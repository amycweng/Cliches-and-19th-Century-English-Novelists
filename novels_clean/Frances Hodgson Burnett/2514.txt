young ardor must not foresee even possibility of new life withdrawing entirely from plane on rapture must materialize on twenty dollar week in flat in harlem chapter ix type a exotic a tembarom be to solicitor naturally suggested problem mr palford found charge baffling because according to ordinary rule young man so rudimentary must have presented problem not perfectly easy to explain be herein that be exotic mr palford who be not given to subtle analysis of difference in character temperament argued privately that english youth who have be brought up in street must have be one of two three thing must have be secretly terrified resentful roughly awkward resentful boastfully delighted given to common youth excitedly common swagger at finding suddenly swell special kind of youth must most assuredly have constantly thought of a swell must have lost head altogether possibly with result in matter of conduct in public must have be either maddening crushing to spirit of well bred mature minded legal gentleman temporarily thrust into position of bear leader tembarom be none of thing if be terrified did not reveal anguish be without doubt not resentful on contrary interested curious though must not be said to bear a one elated indulged in frolic extravagance saw hutchinson off on steamer supplied with fruit flower book with respectful moderation did not conduct a benefactor bestowing unknown luxury a young man on whom unexpected luck have bestowed decent opportunity to express friendship in fact palford taste approved of attitude be evidently much under spell of slight girl with manchester accent sober blue eye be neither flighty meretricious must have sense enough to give trouble even when naturally forgot in revelation of new life father also be plainly respectable working man with blunt lancashire pride must keep from intruding ca butt in get fresh with man like tembarom said money must help be too independent after steamer have sailed away be observable to solicitor that mr temple barholm be apparently occupied hour did not explain why seemed to rush from one part of new york to why seemed to be seeking interview with person be plainly difficult to get at be evidently working hard to accomplish something other before left united state perhaps asked astutely practical business question intention seeming to be to gain definite knowledge of what future resource must be of freedom to use a chose once twice mr palford be rather alarmed by tendency of question have actually prodigious american scheme in view seemed too young inexperienced in handling of large sum for possibility youth inexperience suddenly inherited wealth not infrequently led to rash adventure something palford called very handsome be done for mr bowse boarding house mr bowse be evidently not proud enough to resent being made secure for few year rent extraordinary page be provided for after large amount of effort expenditure of energy must leave galton high dry tembarom explained when came in after rushing about think know man might try have got to find put on to thing good lord nobody rushed about to find offer job hope fellow want a bad a did will be up in air discovered whereabouts of young man in question finding a youngster almost tearfully declared about down out proposition be met with gratitude relief from prospect of something extremely like starvation must mentally produce tembarom took to galton after having talked over in detail be have education know how much have when butted into page said one must have let try did only because saw saw saw answered galton who knew exactly what have seen who found up town social representative new situation a interesting a amusing just touched with pathetic element galton be traveled man knew england several other country well saw that fellow wanted job a much a did must be likely to put up good fight to hold down be scared out of life when started out that morning of blizzard must afford to be scared guess soldier who be scared fight like when see bayonet coming at have to wonder how often man find out that doe pretty big thing when bayonet be coming at answered galton who be actually neglecting work for few minute so that might look at talk to new york descendant of norman lord saxon king joe bennett have be trying to live off free lunch counter for week when found tembarom explained know what be will go at page right be going to take up town introduce to friend there get to boost along made friend said galton knew must of best ever good natured open handed well bet only trouble be wanted to eat drink everything in sight did quite like when must get outside champagne 'd offer broke into big pleased laugh when went in told munsberg pretty near

bennett page all right will see will miss said galton will miss tembarom answered in voice with rather depressed drop in will miss said galton tembarom face reddened little guess 'd seem rather fresh for to tell how will miss said said that first day did know how to tell how well how felt about giving mutt like that big chance never thought did know how little did know did inquired almost anxiously that be that did know that have backbone good spirit to go in win galton replied be tired man good spirit good temper seem to about biggest asset man can bring into thing must have dared do when be age deserved victoria cross added chuckling what be victoria cross asked tembarom will find out when go to england well be not supposing that know about how many billion thing will have to find out when go to england there will be several thousand replied galton moderately will learn about a go on say said tembarom reflectively doe seem queer to think of fellow having to keep up spirit because be fallen into three hundred fifty thousand year must think 'd have to must find have queried galton interestedly tembarom lifted eye be so honest that be touching know where be at said be going to wake up in new place like people die if knew what be like must mind so much know blamed thing be not having seen sample rattle be fond of new york good lord be place know on earth be just about good enough for by gee be kept alive when might have starved to death have have good time here added flushing with emotion good time when have whole meal day 'd have good time anywhere commented galton also with feeling carry over shoulder share with lot of other people certainly shared with joe bennett whom took up town introduced right left to friendly patron who excited by atmosphere of adventure prosperity received with open arm to have be choice of t tembarom a mere representative of earth must have be great thing for bennett to be choice of hero of romance of wildest opulence be tremendous send off be accepted at once when tembarom actually stood for big farewell supper of own in hall nearly have hand shaken off by congratulating acquaintance fact that kept new aspirant by side so that wave of high popularity flowed over until sometimes lost joyful breath established a sort of hero mr palford did not know of festivity a also found be not told of several other thing counted a feature of client exoticism extraordinary lack of concealment of thing vanity forbids many from confessing combined with quite cheerful power to keep own counsel when be for reason of own so inclined can keep mouth shut that chap hutchinson have said once mr palford remembered most of ca have got notion can many time when must there be lot more in than 'd think for be naught lad be na half such fool a look be hesitant timid mr palford observed in entirely unostentatious way soon realized that money gave thing into hand knew must do most thing chose to do that power to do rested in day with without necessity of detailed explanation appeal to others a in case for instance of mysterious friend protege whose name be strangeways of history of acquaintance with palford knew nothing that must choose to burden with half witted invalid in term solicitor described be simply in explainable if have asked for advice by manner left opening for offering of must have be most strongly counseled to take to public asylum leave there advice on subject seemed last thing desired anticipated talk about friend be what seemed least likely to indulge in made secret of intention frankly took charge of a own special business left rest alone say nothing saw wood palford have once be trifle puzzled by hearing remark casually remembered later a remembered comment of joseph hutchinson tembarom have explained to little ann will understand said be like guess feel like do when dog cat in big trouble just look at a if be have know if stick by will be killed just drive crazy be way look at that ca stand believe something must burst in fellow brain if left when found out be going to do 'd just let out awful kind of yell 'd remember till died dried right up almost a soon a spoke of to palford must see anything that be crazy ought to be put in asylum well be not there be time when talk to almost sensible only be always so awful low down in mind be afraid to let go on be little bit better than be seems queer to get to like man be sort of dotty tell ann because will understand have got to sort of like want to see if can work out for somehow england seems to sort of stick in mind if ca spend money in living way want to live buying jewelry clothes for girl 'd like to see dressed like queen be going to do just to please be going to take to england keep quiet see what will happen big doctor ought to know about there be to know can pay old thing want by jings be limit to sit here say that know be true beyond explaining of necessary detail to piloting to england mr palford did not hold many degree responsible theory of correct conduct assumed form of altruism have formulated even before reached middle age one of fixed rule be to avoid error of allowing sympathy sentiment to hamper with unnecessary burden natural tendency of temperament have placed obstacle in way of keeping rule to burden with instruction modification of unfortunately hopeless young new yorker must be unnecessary palford summing up of be that be of type with nothing palliative must be done there be a unavoidable circumstance forced one to take commonness slanginess appalling ignorance one must not leave fortunately respectable legal firm need hold sponsor for next of kin provided by fate wild of america temple barholm estate have never in mr palford generation be specially agreeable to deal

curious high deep window with leaded pane struck that there be end to place that there must be room enough in for hotel tapestry chamber of course burrill heard mr palford say in low tone yes sir mr temple barholm always used few yard farther on door stood open revealing immense room rich gloomy with tapestry covered wall dark oak furniture bed looked to tembarom incredibly big with carved oak canopy massive post have presiding personality of own be mounted by step hanging coverlid be of embossed velvet time softened to perfection of purple blue fire enriched color of everything did best to drive shadow away deep window opened into leafless bough of close growing tree upon outspread space of heavily timbered park where gaunt though magnificent bare branch menaced defied slim neat young man with rather pale face touch of anxiety in expression came forward at once be pearson who will valet exclaimed mr palford thank sir said pearson in low respectful voice manner be correctness there seemed to mr palford to be really nothing else to say wanted in fact to get to own apartment have hot bath rest before dinner where be burrill inquired a turned to go down corridor crimson room sir answered burrill closed door of tapestry chamber shut tembarom in alone with pearson chapter xi for few moment two young men looked at other pearson gaze being one of respectfulness hoped to propitiate if propitiation be necessary though pearson greatly trusted be not tembarom be gaze of hasty investigation inquiry suddenly thought that must have be to merry if somebody have put on to sort of idea of what be done to fellow when be valeted valet have of course gathered waited on one somehow looked after one clothes be there by chance other thing expected to do manicure one nail cut one hair how often did do be day be evidently there to do something must have be waiting behind door to pounce out minute appeared when other two went away burrill must have closed door a solemnly a though shut pair of in together to get through sort of performance here be where t t begin to feel like fool thought here be where there be way out of looking like one know thing personal vanity be not so strong in a healthy normal good temper despite fact that neat correctness of pearson style finished expression of neat face suggested that be of class knew with most finished exactness custom propriety demanded on occasion on valeting in most occult branch might be done be only fellow after must be human so tembarom smiled at hello pearson said how be pearson slightly started be tiniest possible start quite involuntary from recovered instantly to reply in tone of respectful gratefulness thank sir very well thank sir be right answered tembarom sense of relief because 'd got started increasing friendliness of smile see got trunk open said glancing at article of clothing neatly arranged upon bed pearson be slightly alarmed occurred to suddenly that perhaps be not custom in america to open gentleman box lay out clothes for for special reason be desperately anxious to keep place above thing felt must avoid giving offense by doing thing by being too english might seem to cast shade of doubt on entire correctness of custom of america have known ill feeling to arise between gentleman gentleman in servant hall in case of slight difference in custom contested with bitterness of feeling have made almost international question there have naturally be great deal of talk about new mr temple barholm what might be expected of when gentleman be not gentleman be form of expression in hall lord only knew what must happen one who have for one knew be born in workhouse have be boot black kicked about in american street did not know tembarom nearly starved to death found at last in low lodging house what must know about decent living ten to one 'd be american enough to swagger bluster pretend knew everything better than one else lose temper frightfully when made mistake try to make other people seem to blame set beggar on horseback who did know what be there be chance enough to spare that not one of must be able to stand that in month time must be looking for new place so while tembarom be rather afraid of pearson moved about in awful state of uncertainty pearson be horribly afraid of tembarom be in fact in such condition of nervous anxiety that be obliged more than once furtively to apply to damp pale young forehead exceedingly fresh spotless pocket handkerchief in first place there be wardrobe what must do how must approach subject with sufficient delicacy mr temple barholm have brought with only steamer trunk gladstone bag latter evidently bought in london to be stuffed with hastily purchased handkerchief shirt worn a came out of shop a evidently bought without slightest idea of kind of linen gentleman must own what most terrified pearson who be of timid most delicate minded nature be that having workhouse boot blacking a background new mr temple barholm must know a have come upon so suddenly be to be pearson calamitous duty to explain to that have nothing that apparently knew nothing that a have friend who knew mere common servant must educate if did not wish to see derided looked down upon actually cut by gentleman be gentleman to say nothing of pearson own well earned reputation for knowledge of custom intelligence deftness in turning out object of care in such form a to be reference in when new place be wanted of course sometimes there be even real gentleman who be most careless indifferent to appearance who if left to must buy garment made blood run cold when one realized that own character hope for future often depended upon latest employer outward aspect ulster in mr temple barholm have presented be of cut material such a pearson most discouraged moment have never forced to contemplate limited wardrobe in steamer trunk be new equally bad there be evening dress proper linen not what pearson called proper proper toilet appurtenance what be pearson called upon by duty to do if have only have initiative to anticipate might have asked permission to consult in darkest secrecy with mr palford have never dreamed of such situation apparently must be obliged to send new charge down to first dinner in majestically decorous dining room before servant in sort of speckled tweed cutaway with brown necktie tembarom realizing without delay that pearson did not expect to be talked to being cheered by sight of fire sat down before in easy chair like of for luxurious comfort have never known be in fact waiting for development pearson must say do something shortly must give chance to catch on perhaps 'd go out of room leave to must be thing to thank god for then must wash face hand brush hair wait till dinner bell rang 'd be likely to have one 'd have to in place like pearson did not go out of room moved about behind for short time with footfall so almost entirely soundless that tembarom became aware that if went on long must be nervous in fact be nervous already wanted to know what be doing must scarcely resist temptation to turn head look did not want to give away more entirely than be unavoidable besides instinct told that might frighten pearson who looked frightened enough in neat well mannered way already hully gee how wished must go out of room did not there be gently gliding footstep of pearson behind quiet movement must have seemed stealthy if have be burglar soft removal of article from one part of room to delicate brushing almost noiseless folding now pearson be near bed now have opened wardrobe now be looking into steamer trunk now have stopped somewhere behind within few yard of chair why have ceased moving what be looking at what kept quiet tembarom expected to begin stirring mysteriously again did not why did not there reigned in room entire silence soft footfall brushing folding be doing nothing have got hold of something have given fit there have be no sound of fall perhaps even if english valet have fit 'd have so quietly respectfully that one must hear tembarom felt that must be looking at back of head wondered what be matter with be hair cut in way so un english that have paralyzed back of head began to creep under investigation so prolonged sound at movement tembarom stealthily took out watch good old waterbury be going to part with began to watch minute hand if nothing happened in three minute be going to turn round one two three silence made seem fifteen returned waterbury to pocket turned round pearson be not dead be standing quite still resigned waiting be business to wait not to intrude disturb having put everything in order done must do be waiting for further command in suspense must be admitted hello exclaimed tembarom involuntarily will get bath ready sir inquired pearson do like hot cold sir tembarom drew relieved breath have dropped dead have have fit here be one of thing man did when valeted got bath ready hasty recollection of much used paint smeared tin bath on fourth floor of mr bowse boarding house sprang up before everybody have to use in turn waited hour for chance to make dash into one stood still waited fifteen minute until got good ready to tell must go turn on water gee whizz being relieved relieved pearson by telling might fix for that must have hot water very good sir thank sir said pearson silently left room then tembarom got up from chair began to walk about rather restlessly new alarm seized did pearson expect to wash to stand round hand soap towel thing while washed if be supposed that have strength to turn faucet yourself might be supposed did have energy to use flesh brush towel did valeting include kind of shampoo over must stand for said 'd have to tell there 'd be turkish bath in mine be not trained up to when have got on to kind of thing bit more will make understand what be not in for want to scare life out of right off look like good little fellow pearson duty a valet did not apparently include giving bath by sheer physical force be deft calm amenable led tembarom down corridor to bath room revealed to store of sumptuous bath robe towel hot cold water faucet spray tonic essence forgot nothing having prepared mutely vanished returned to bedroom to wait gaze in troubled wonder at speckled tweed cutaway there be appalling possibility be aware that be entirely ignorant of american custom that tweed be fashionable home evening wear in state tembarom returning from bath much refreshed after warm plunge cold shower evidently felt that a costume be must be desired will wear sir evening pearson suggested be suggestive of more than actual inquiry if have dared to hope that manner might suggest number of thing for instance that in england gentleman really did wear tweed in evening even in private that through unforeseen circumstance employer evening dress suit have be delayed must of course arrive to morrow tembarom physically stimulated by hot cold water relief at being left alone be beginning to recover natural buoyancy yes will wear 'em answered snatching at hairbrush beginning to brush damp hair be wooden backed brush pearson have found in gladstone bag shudderingly laid in readiness on dressing table guess be right ai oh quite right sir quite pearson ventured for morning wear morning said tembarom brushing vigorously not night black sir most delicately hinted pearson be more usual in evening in england after added so to speak with vague hope that mollifying phrase might counteract effect of apparently implied aspersion on color preferred in america tembarom ceased brushing hair looked at in good natured desire for information frock coat claw hammer asked despite natural anxiety in midst of pearson must not admit that have uncondemnatory voice sort of young way with gave one courage be not quite sure of claw hammer frock coat for morning dress afternoon wear sir ventured evening cut a know be claw hammer swallow tail guess say here tembarom ended for quite without hint of rancor be rejoiced to see yes sir said pearson ceremony of dressing proved fearsome thing a went on pearson moved about deftly essayed to do thing for new mr temple barholm new mr temple barholm have never heard of man not doing for reached for thing pearson be about to hand to hold for unceremoniously achieved service for be part of pearson manifest duty to perform got into other way there be even danger sometimes of seeming to snatch thing from other to pearson unbounded horror mr temple barholm did not express irritation whatsoever misunderstanding took place held mouth rather close shut pearson not aware that did a precaution against open grinning shout of laughter a found unable to adjust to attendant movement thought possible that be secretly annoyed regarded whole matter with disfavor when dressing be at end stood ready to go down in innocent ignoring of speckled tweed brown necktie looked flurried out of humor asked question in voice be actually friendly be question dealing with incident have aroused much interest in servant hall a suggesting touch of mystery mr strangeways came yesterday right did inquired yes sir pearson answered mr hutchinson daughter came with call little ann hutchinson be sensible little thing sir seemed to know exactly what 'd want done to make comfortable mr butterworth put in west room sir valeted be not very well when came seems better to day sir only be very anxious to see be right said tembarom show room will go see now being led by pearson went without delay chapter xii chief objection to temple barholm in tembarom mind be that be too big for human use at least be how struck entrance be too big stair be too wide room too broad too long too high to allow of eye accustomed to hall bedroom adjusting vision without discomfort dining room in new owner took first meal in company with mr palford attended by large serious man who wore livery three tall footman who did be of size stateliness made feel homesick for mr bowse dining room with two hurried incompetent often changed waitress prevailing friendly custom of pushing thing across table to save time meal be quickly disposed of at mr bowse everybody be due up town down town regarded food a unavoidable because necessary interference with more urgent business at temple barholm one sat night be impression made upon tembarom watching thing being brought in taken out of room carved on huge buffet passed from one man to when be brought solemnly to if turned down seemed that whole ceremony have to be gone through with again sort of silver knife fork spoon be given to one taken away dozen sort of glass stood by plate if made move to do anything for man out of livery stopped a though be too big fool to be trusted food be right when knew what anything be be inclined to welcome a old friend be given to in way that made get rattled with swell dish have butter plate ice seemed scarce dead still way servant moved about gave sort of feeling that be at funeral that be decent to talk so long a remains be in room head man foot men seemed to get on by sign though tembarom never saw making face never changed for moment once twice tried joke addressing to mr palford to see what must happen a mr palford did not seem to see humor of gave glassy eye head man footman seemed to hear thought that perhaps did know be joke if did thought anything at must think be dippy dinner be deadly though sumptuous meal long drawn out when measured by meal at mr bowse did not know a mr palford did that be perfect served with finished dexterity be also perfection mr palford however be relieved when be at end have sat at dinner with late mr temple barholm in day have seen also served by owner of impassive countenance have be aware that whatsoever of secret dislike resentment be concealed by there lay behind immovability acceptance of fact that represented even in most objectionable humor century of accustomedness to respectful service of knowledge of right power to claim solicitor be keenly aware of silent comment being made upon tweed suit brown necktie on manner in wearer boldly chose wrong fork erroneously made use of knife spoon later in evening in servant comment must not be silent there must be doubt of what character must be there must be laughter relating of incident housemaid still room maid must giggle kitchen maid boot boy must grin whisper in servile tribute to witticism of superior servant after dinner rest of evening must at least be spent in talk about business matter there still remained detail to be enlarged upon before palford returned to lincoln inn left mr temple barholm to care of steward of estate be not difficult to talk to when sole subject of conversation be of business nature before parted for night mystery of arrangement made for strangeways have be cleared in fact mr temple barholm made mystery of did not seem ignorant of fact that what have chosen to do be unusual did not appear hampered embarrassed by knowledge remark on subject be entirely civil be far from actually suggesting that singular conduct be purely own business none of solicitor for moment so mr palford be privately just trifle annoyed hutchinson have traveled from london with strangeways in care day before must have be unhappy disturbed if have be obliged to travel with mr palford who be stranger to miss hutchinson have soothing effect on strangeways be for present comfortably installed a guest of house miss hutchinson having talked to housekeeper mr butterworth to pearson what future held for mr temple barholm did not seem to feel necessity of going into left behind a subject went on talking cheerfully of other thing almost a if have forgotten have coffee in library afterward sat at writing table looked over document talked until mr palford felt that must quite decorously retire to bedroom be glad to be relieved of duty tembarom be amiably resigned to parting with tembarom did not go up stair at once sat by fire smoked several pipe of tobacco thought thing over there be lot of thing to think over several decision to make thought must be good idea to pas in review quiet of dead surrounded in house size of servant be probably mile away 'd need trolley to get to one thought if rang for in hurry if armed burglar made quiet entry without knowing must get in pretty rough work before of seventy five footman must come to lend hand be not aware that there be two of standing in waiting in hall powdered head close together so that whisper chuckle must be heard sound of movement in library must have brought up standing to decorous attitude of attention conveying to uninitiated impression that have not moved for hour sometimes a sat in big morocco chair t tembarom looked grave enough sometimes looked a though be confronting problem needed puzzling out with be not making much headway sometimes looked a though be thinking of little ann hutchinson not infrequently grinned here be up to neck in be darned if knew what be going to do did know soul nobody knew did know thing ought to know did know one who must tell even hutchinson have never be inside place like temple barholm be going back to manchester after few week stay at grandmother cottage before have left new york have seen hadman other fellow got thing started so that

startled when realized magnitude of what really must be done saw also that slangy moneyed youth be not merely enthusiastic fool saw into business scheme pretty sharply be of most determined readiness with power ranging on side of hutchinson invention be good business to begin to move if one did not want to run chance of being left out in cold hutchinson have gone to manchester there have be barely time for brief characteristic interview between tembarom when rushed back to london tembarom felt rather excited when remembered recalling what have felt in confronting struggle against emotion in blunt featured red face break in rough voice charging up down room like curiously elated bull in china shop big effort to restrain relief gratitude degree of might seem to under value merit of invention once twice when looked serious tembarom be thinking over also once twice when grinned relief gratitude notwithstanding hutchinson have kept in place have not made unbounded effort to conceal sense of incongruity of position a controller of fortune lord of temple barholm be still vaguely flavored with indignation when have finished last pipe tembarom rose knocked ash out of now for pearson said have made up mind to have talk with pearson there be use wasting time if thing did suit best thing be to see what must do to fix right away if be against law went out into hall seeing two footman

life knowing that realized utterly insignificant helplessness resented giving attention because be not able to show appreciation of service in proper manner miss alicia saw that have not occurred to to endeavor to propitiate in least because somehow seemed joke to did care after first moment of being startled regarded with novel feeling almost kind of admiration tentatively dared to wonder if there be not something even rather rather aristocratic in utter indifference if have be duke must not have regarded servant point of view must have mattered what thought perhaps hastily decided be like because though be not duke boot blacking in new york notwithstanding be temple barholm there be few duke a old of blood a temple barholm must be be relieved whatsoever lay at root of being what be a be somehow changed aspect of thing for without doing anything be cleared atmosphere of dread of surprise mental reservation of footman burrill when came down to dinner in high necked much cleaned much repaired black silk with more distinguishing change in toilet than white lace cap instead of black one with poor dear mamma hair bracelet with gold clasp on wrist weeping willow made of poor dear papa hair in brooch at collar be so curious though still nice did not offer arm when be going into dining room took hold of hers with hand affectionately half led half pushed along with a went drew

like perhaps by chance hear something of interest one two of who saw tembarom went away puzzled amazed did not drop h have of course expected be well dressed not bad looking be frequently impossible to understand what be talking about used such odd phrase seemed good natured enough way with little old miss temple barholm be really quite nice queer a be be queer because be attentive to in manner in young men be not usually attentive to totally insignificant elderly dependent tembarom derived extremely diluted pleasure from visit few person saw reminded in varying degree of mr palford have not before seen anything like specie did not know what to do with also did not know what to do with certain inelasticity frustrated at outset when in obedience to miss alicia instruction have returned visit felt have not gone far serious application enabled to find way through church service accompanied miss alicia to church with great regularity began to take down book from library shelf look over gravely day gradually ceased to appear so long have great deal of time on hand tried to find way of filling wondered if ann must be pleased if learned thing out of book when tentatively approached subject of literature with miss alicia glowed at delightful prospect of reading aloud to in evening reading improving thing like history poet let take hack at night said pleasantly more fellow knew better be for supposed wondered if anything happened went back to new york how much improving thing poetry must help man in doing business first evening began with gray elegy miss alicia felt that did not exhilarate be also obliged to admit that did not read very well felt sure must improve personally be touchingly happy sweetly domestic picture of situation sitting by fire with knitting reading

reached point where suddenly grew quite red stopped say have read inquired after hesitation play of shakspere be part of young lady education answered be afraid be not at shaksperian scholar young lady education repeated gee whizz added softly after pause glanced over page so hastily then laid book down say suggested with evasive air let go over beaud one again be well be easier to read aloud crude awkwardness of manner suddenly made miss alicia flush drop stitch in knitting how dreadful of not to have thought of that elizabethan age be fear rather coarse one in respect even history acknowledges queen elizabeth used profane language faltered coughed little apologetic cough a picked up stitch again bet ann never seen inside shakspere said tembarom before reading aloud in future gave previous personal attention to poem subject decided upon may be at once frankly admitted that when read aloud be more for miss alicia delectation than for own saw how much enjoyed situation effect of frankness constant boyish talk be so inseparable from idea of that found puzzling thing to realize that gradually began to feel aware of certain remote reserve in what might perhaps be better described a habit of silence upon certain subject felt marked in case of strangeways surmised that saw strangeways often spent good deal of time with spoke of rarely never knew exactly what hour be given to sometimes imagined found greater responsibility than have expected several time when believed that have spent part of morning afternoon in room be more silent than usual looked puzzled thoughtful observed a mr palford have that picture gallery with portrait of ancestor have attraction certain rainy day asked to go with look over be inevitable that must soon wander to

be in mile hugo yes tembarom answered fellow who looked way at girl when made love to must get strangle holt must forget soon strike in way too said miss alicia shyly used to wonder if be not quite nice of to think of did seem that if one did look at one like maidenly shyness overcame poor lady joan sighed there be sort of cleft in chin though be good square chin suggested that smile of be jem yes be likeness be quite odd sometimes quite be thing must be likely to change much when grew up tembarom said drawing little closer to picture poor jem be up against hard plenty have hardest chap only died there be mistaking sympathy asked so many question that sat down talked instead of going through gallery be interested in detail of have occurred after ghastly moment when jem have risen from card table stood looking around like baited dying animal at circle of cruel face drawing in about how soon have left london where have gone first how have be killed have be buried with others beneath fall of earth stone having heard much tembarom saw must not ask more question miss alicia became pale hand trembled must not bear to discus detail so harrowing say ought to let talk about broke out patted hand made get up finish walk about gallery held elbow in own odd nice way a guided thing said thing pretended to think not to understand be so amusing that in short time have made laugh knew well enough by time to be aware that be intentionally obliging to forget what only did harm to remember be practical way of looking at getting grouch on being sorry for what ca help cut ice sometimes said when doe for getting up at daybreak keeping at doe bet life on must see that have really wanted to hear about jem knew be bad for to recall thing must not allow to dwell on just a knew must not allow to dwell on little miss hutchinson remotely placed among joy of beloved new york two other incident besides visit to mile hugo afterward marked that day when miss alicia looked back on

queerer be more sure be that there be reason what be reason strangeways be kept here where must detective come in just on general principle be rather going into situation there be reason must be amusing to find out think so spoke casually lady mallowe answer be casual though knew from experience that be not a casual a chose to seem be clever enough always to have certain reason of own formulated into interest large small knew thing about people be useful sometimes quite small thing be useful be always well behaved one have ever accused of bringing pressure to bear be often possible for to sell thing buy thing bring about thing in circumstance must have presented difficulty to other people lady mallowe knew from long experience about exigency of case when need must be not

yard be little odd yes be exactly what thought said palliser have in fact thought good deal followed thing up in quiet amateur way though with annoyingly little result occasionally have felt rather fool for pain because have be led to so few fact of importance have found so often confronted by t tembarom entirely frank grin own mental attitude be not complex one lady mallowe summing up have be correct enough on whole temple barholm ought to be substantial asset regarded in connection with present owner little dealing in stock sometimes rather large one when luck be with have brought desirable return to captain palliser throughout number of year just now be taking interest in somewhat imposing scheme what might prove imposing one if be managed properly presented to right person if t tembarom have be sufficiently lured by spirit of speculation to plunge into old hutchinson affair a evidently have done be plainly of temperament attracted by game of chance there have be no reason that of temperament must have led to invest have found suddenly moneyed man have liked game never having so much a heard of little ann hutchinson captain palliser not unnaturally argued after wise there seemed valid reason why if vague invention have allured le vague scheme managed in more businesslike manner must not mexican silver copper mine be dazzling thing to talk about must go into detail have in fact allowed good deal of detail to trail through conversation at time have not be difficult to accomplish in talk with lady mallowe in host presence lady mallowe be always ready to talk of mine gold silver copper happened at time one must manage to secure few share without actual payment of money there be little hospitality social amiability now then might be regarded a value received so have made easy for captain palliser to talk t tembarom have heard much must have be of interest to kind of young man appeared to be sometimes have listened absorbedly on few occasion have asked few question laid curiously bare in role of speculator if have practical knowledge of way mean of great mining company at least professed none at event if there be little matter preferred to keep to there be harm in making familiar with aspect significance man argument so far a be concerned assume character with own choice of adjective adverb label be if label most astute captain palliser did not dealt merely with reasoning process be applicable to subject in hand whatsoever nature be practical man of world gentleman of course be necessary to adjust matter without romantic hair splitting be by way t tembarom have at outset seemed to present so to speak surface palliser have soon ceased to be at sure that social ambition be to be relied on a lever besides when old duke of stone took delighted possession of dined with drove with sat gossiped with by hour there be not much one must offer strangeways have at first meant only eccentricity little later have occasionally faintly stirred curiosity perhaps fact burrill enjoyed a grievance mystery have stimulated stirring veriest chance have led to find regarding opening up of possible vista from certain window in certain wing of house much praised view be to be seen nothing be more natural than on occasion of curious sunset palliser must in coming from room decide to take look at a passed through corridor pearson came out of room near how be mr strangeways to day palliser asked not quite so well be afraid sir be answer sorry to hear replied palliser passed on on return walked somewhat slowly down corridor a turned into thought heard murmur of voice one be that of t tembarom be evidently using argument sounded a if be persuading one to agree with persuasion be earnest be not arguing with pearson housemaid why be arguing with pensioner voice be a low a be eager other man reply be not to be heard only just after palliser have passed door there broke out appeal be sort of cry god send

of fellow be giving trouble said to that voice be not american not in least set thinking observing when tembarom wore look be not look of depression of something more puzzling thought that must guess at reason by time talked with lady mallowe have gone much further than chose to let know chapter xxviii popularity of captain palliser story of lady have be great at outset with passage of time have oddly waned have resulted from story ceasing to develop a simplest intelligence might have anticipated by mean of only person capable of proper development person in question be of course t tembarom expectation amusing expectation of have be raised have singularly failed in fulfilling of neighborhood have so to speak stood upon tiptoe feminine portion of at least looking over shoulder to get first glimpse of what must inevitably take place a week flew by standing on tiptoe became thing of past whole thing flattened out most disappointingly attack be made upon lady that duke of stone have immensely taken up mr temple barholm have of course resulted in being accepted in such manner a gave many opportunity to encounter one appeared at dinner tea garden party miss alicia whom have in

nasal in midst of low pitched throaty mellow english enunciation talked good deal at time because found talked to by people who either wanted to draw out genuinely wished to hear thing must be likely to say that hero of palliser story must so comport a to provide diversion cause for haughty displeasure must have be only natural outcome of ambition in brief period of time however young woman who might have expected to find object of such ambition realized that method of approach attack be not marked by usual characteristic of aspirant of class evidently desired to see be seen presented a be for inspection consideration while be attentive did not press attention upon one did not make advance in ordinary sense of word never essayed flattering even admiring remark said queer thing at one

invest income for actually treble in year of course told that income be generous gift to that be far more than sufficient for need tembarom put down coffee cup so suddenly to look at that be fearful that have appeared to do captain palliser vague injustice be sure meant to be most obliging dear explained be really quite touched said most sympathetically delicately that when woman be unmarried

wrong of to be so pleased miss alicia thought must make subject of prayer ask to be aided to conquer haughty vain glorious spirit be pathetically serious having be trained to view of great first cause a figuratively embodied in image of gigantic irascible omnipotent old gentleman especially wrought to fury by feminine folly connected with becoming headgear have sometimes even seemed to that heavenly father have special objection to lady have once timorously confessed to tembarom suppose be because be so much weaker than men so much more given to vanity petty vice have caught in arm

of late sometimes when be not talking saying amusing new york thing made people laugh seemed almost to forget where be to be thinking of something baffled tried way in pulled together when realized that one be looking at be to mind most disturbing feature of fit of abstraction suggested that if really have trouble be private one on must not like to intrude naturally adoring eye watched oftener than knew tried to find plausible not too painful reason for mood always made light of unaccustomedness to new life perhaps made feel more unrestful than must admit a walked through park village heart

do in circumstance went on obediently knew a know that mr strangeways must not be disturbed one afternoon saw walk slowly backward forward before west room window have something in hand kept looking up be what first attracted attention queer way of looking up quite suddenly threw something rattled on pane of glass sounded like gravel small pebble must help believing thought mr strangeways must be startled into coming to window tembarom cleared throat did that twice said pearson caught at though palliser did know did 'd have done three time more than perhaps casually mentioned in smoking room one night curious fool of gardener boy have thrown stone frightened strangeways pearson be watching for that if caught be going to knock block off bing did do again darned fool what doe think be after

be coming upon strangely exciting hint of curious possibility have be mere hint at first have seemed almost absurd in unbelievableness one have linked with led on to further wondering exploration when miss alicia palliser have seen that looked absorbed baffled have be because have frequently found to use own figure of speech mixed up to beat band have not known way to turn have gone on turning because must not escape from own excited interest inevitable emotion roused by being caught in whirl of melodrama be what 'd dropped into whacking big play have begun for when palford butted in night told be lost heir with fortune estate in england curtain have be jerking up down ever since there have be thrill in queer a be something doing time by gee sat smoked pipe wished ann be with because

strangeways standing perfectly attired in evening dress pearson setting thing in order at other side of room be taking note of furtively over shoulder quite in casual manner of ordinary man have expressed intention of dressing for evening pearson have thanked star for fact that necessary garment be at hand from first have not infrequently asked for article such a only resource of complete masculine wardrobe must supply on one occasion have suddenly wished to dress for dinner lame excuse have be necessary to make have disturbed horribly instead of pacifying to explain that condition precluded necessity of usual appurtenance must have be out of question have be angry what did pearson mean what be matter have said over over again then have sunk into hopelessly bewildered mood have sat huddled in dressing gown staring at fire pearson have be so harrowed by situation that have be own idea to suggest to master that possible requirement must be provided there be occasion when appeared that cloud over lifted for passing moment gleam of light recalled to familiar usage of past when have finished dressing pearson have be almost startled by amount of effect produced by straight correctly cut line of black white mere change of clothes have suddenly changed man have done something to pearson put after first glance at mirror have straightened a if recognizing fault of

corridor a if have passed down together dozen time before on stairway strangeways looked at tapestry with interest of familiarized intelligence be beautiful old place said a crossed hall that armor be worn by crusader hesitated moment when entered library be only for moment went to hearth took chair host offered lighting cigar sat smoking if t tembarom have chanced to be man of analytical metaphysical order of intellect must have found during past month many thing to lead far in mental argument concerning weird wonder of human mind of power where possessor body be concerned sometime closeness to surface of sentient being sometime remoteness must have known awed marveling at blackness of pit into can descend unknown shade may enfold imprison gropings old duke of stone have sat pondered many hour over story favorite companion have related to what curious subtle process have queer fellow not be watching in closely guarded quiet of room where stranger have spent day strange thing cowering in darkness ray of light piercing cloud one day seeming lost again next struggle imprisoned thing made to come forth to cry out that be immured not wholly conquered that hour must arrive when must fight way through at last tembarom have not entered into psychological research have be entirely uncomplex in attitude sitting down before problem a besieger might have sat down before castle duke have sometimes wondered whether be not good enough thing that have be so simple about merely continuing to believe best with unswerving obstinacy lending hand when must never flagging sympathy have kept singularly alive to chance now then have illumination must have done credit to cleverer man duke have rubbed hand over in half amused half touched elation how have kept head level held to purpose t tembarom talked little a sat in big chair smoked best let alone give time to get used to newness thought nothing must happen must give jolt let thing sort of sink into perhaps 'd set to thinking lead somewhere strangeways evidently did not want talk never wanted unless be excited be not excited now have settled down a if be comfortable having finished one cigar took began to smoke much more slowly than have smoked first slowness began to arrest tembarom attention be smoking of man who be growing sleepy sinking into deep thought becoming oblivious to what be doing sometimes held cigar absently between strong fine finger seeming to forget tembarom watched do until saw go out white ash drop on rug at foot did not notice sat sinking deeper deeper into own being growing more remote what be going on under absorbed stillness tembarom must not have moved spoken for block of fifth avenue said internally dark eye seemed to become darker until there be only pin point of light to be seen in pupil be a if be looking at something at distance at strangely long distance twice turned head appeared to look slowly round room not a normal people look a if also be at strange long distance from be somewhere outside wall be uncanny thing to be spectator to how dead still room be tembarom found thinking be dead still be queer deal sitting not daring to move just watching something be bound to happen sure what be going to be strangeways cigar dropped from finger appeared to rouse looked puzzled for moment then stooped quite naturally to pick up forgot altogether be gone out remarked have suggested tembarom moving box nearer to thank rose crossed room to wall of book shelf tembarom eye be caught again by fineness of movement line evening clothes made manifest what swell looked when moved about like what swell by jings looked along line of shelf presently took book down opened turned over leaf until something arrested attention then fell to reading read several minute while tembarom watched silence be broken by laughing little listen to said began to read something in language totally unknown to hearer man who writes that sort of thing about woman be old bounder whether be poet not there be small biting spitefulness about be cattish who did tembarom inquired softly might be good idea to lead on horace in spite of genius sometimes make feel be rather blackguard horace for moment t tembarom forgot always heard be sort of ymca old guy old horace greeley tribune be yellow journal when have be sorry have spoken next moment strangeways looked puzzled tribune hesitated roman tribune new york started old horace did perhaps be not talking of same man strangeways hesitated again no think be not answered politely have made break thought tembarom ought to have kept mouth shut must try to switch back strangeways be looking down at back of book held in hand one be latin poet quintus horatius flaccus b c know said oh that one exclaimed tembarom a if with air of immense relief what fool be to forget be glad be will go on reading let hear more be winner from winnersville that horace be perhaps be sort of miracle accomplished by great desire to help right thing to happen to stave off shadow of wrong thing whatsoever reason strangeways waited only moment before turning to book again seemed to be link in chain slowly forming to drag back from wandering t tembarom lightly sweating a frightened horse will sat smoking pipe listening intently to satire lampoon read aloud in latin of b c by gee said faithfully at interval when saw on reader face that moment be ripe knew old horace did have steered charge back thing be coming along line to 'd learned latin at one of big english school boy always learned latin duke have told just have to most of hated like thunder used to be caned when did recite right perhaps if went on 'd begin to remember school queer part of be that did not seem to notice that be

recalling something else be going to see picture gallery inquired be getting late must like to see portrait hurry answered t tembarom be just waiting till be ready will go right away if like went without further ceremony a walked through hall down corridor side by side imaginative person might have felt that perhaps eye of ancient darkling portrait so looked down at pair curiously long loosely

far cry between two walked closely in friendly union when entered picture gallery strangeways paused moment again stood peering down length be very dimly lighted how can see said told pearson to leave

that be little mistaken in believing mr temple barholm have proved mr strangeways to be anybody when have proof will no doubt think proper to tell about until then must prefer palliser laughed a finished sentence not to know be not going to betray miss alicia evidently have one of excellent reason for keeping thing to may mention however that be not so much who have proof a how must help

ann if be gone away be gone to get something happens to be will be likely to bring back with father chapter xxxvii old mr hutchinson letter have supplied much detail when son grand daughter arrived in village of temple barholm heard much more greater part of not in least to be relied upon most of be lie a folk enjoys theirsels pretendin ' to believe grand mother commented be servant hall talk

tummas hibblethwaite doe ' broad lancashire only fact fairly authenticated be that mysterious stranger have be taken away very late one night time before interview between mr temple barholm captain palliser of burrill knew so much because have happened to be about when domestic magnate of burrill type happens to be about at crisis be not unlikely to hear great deal burrill be believed knew much more than deigned to make public entire truth be that captain palliser in one of hasty appearance in neighborhood of temple barholm have bestowed few word of cold caution on talk too much have said proof be required before talk be safe american be sharp enough to say that to be sharp enough too to keep man hidden be only person saw who must have recognized saw by chance palford grimby require proof be in search of servant will talk if want to run risk of getting into trouble make absolute statement have be disappointment to burrill who have seen developing in magnitude be timid man therefore felt wise to convey knowledge merely through conviction carried by dignified silence after first indiscreet revelation of having happened to be about have be made must have be solace to to intimate to miss alicia by bearing manner of service that have be discovered so to speak in character of sort of accomplice that position be perilously uncertain one must probably end in utter downfall leaving in old proper place a elderly insignificant unattractive poor relation without feature to recommend being a before remarked timid man recalling interview between employer held outside dining room door having also disturbing memory of sharp cool boyish eye tone of casual remark that have head on shoulder that be up to to make others understand seemed a well to restrain inclination until proof palford grimby required be forthcoming be perhaps moderate precautionary attitude of palford grimby during first somewhat startled though reserved interview with captain palliser have prevented vaguely wild rumor from being regarded a more than villager exaggerated talk among gentry indeed knew much le of cottager than cottager knew of gentry consequently event furnishing much excitement among village people not infrequently remained unheard of by in class above story le incredible might have be more considered highly colored reason given for absence of owner of temple barholm must if heard of have be more than likely to be received passed over with smile manner of mr palford also of mr grimby during deliberately unmelodramatic carefully connected relation of captain palliser singular story be that of professional gentleman who for reason of good breeding be engaged in restraining outward expression of conviction that be listening to utter nonsense palliser be aware of upon whole did not wonder at in entirely unimaginative person of extremely sober life in fact have begun by giving warning a to what might expect in way of unusualness will doubt think what be about to tell absurd incredible have prefaced statement thought same myself when first suspicion be aroused be in fact inclined to laugh at own idea until one link connected with mr grimby mr palford be inclined to laugh on contrary be extremely grave continued to find necessary to restrain united tendency to indicate facially that thing must be nonsense transcended bound a be delicacy with managed to convey did much credit delicacy be equaled by moderation with captain palliser drew attention to fact that be not thing likely to happen on be founded celebrated criminal case of legal history be incredible almost impossible event ordinarily unbelievable duplicity moral obliquity coincidence made what be attracted attention of world mr palford partner be obviously obliged to admit what did not admit be that such thing never having occurred in one own world have be mentally relegated to world of newspaper criminal record a thing must not happen to oneself mr palford cleared throat in seriously cautionary way be of course matter suggesting too serious accusation not to be approached in most conservative manner remarked most serious consequence have resulted in case implying libelous assertion have be made rashly added mr grimby a mr temple barholm intimated to man of almost unlimited mean have command of resource might not be easy to contend with if have reason to feel injured fact that captain palliser have in bitterly frustrated moment allowed to be goaded into losing temper giving away to tembarom discovery on have felt that must rely a lever did not argue that like weakness must lead into more dangerous indiscretion have always regarded a careful man whose defense be well built about at such crisis in career a rendered entrenchment necessary there must of course be pleasure in following matter up getting more than even with man who have be insolent to more practical feature of case be that if through alert observation shrewd aid jem temple barholm be restored to much to be envied place in world far from unnatural result must be that might feel suitable gratitude indebted ness to man who not from actual personal liking from mere sense of justice have rescued a for fear of messrs palford grimby have put on record with burrill by commanding to hold tongue stating clearly proof be necessary lacking man must be regarded a taking risk whose attitude be so wholly conservative non accusing servant will gossip superior who reproves such gossip hold unattackable position in private room of palford grimby however must confidently express opinion without risk recognition of man lost sight of for year seen only for moment through window be not substantial evidence mr grimby have proceeded incident be startling not greatly to be relied upon knew palliser be slightly grim in air of finality be man most men liked hated did like detested trick have of staring at under drooping lid by way do remember portrait of mile hugo be so like mr palford remembered having heard that there be certain portrait in gallery mr james temple barholm have be said to resemble have distinct recollection of ancestor represented be certain youngster who be page in court of charles second who died young mile hugo charles james be name be strongest clue american seemed rather keen first time talked together be equally keen about jem temple barholm wanted to know what looked like whether be true that be like portrait indeed exclaimed palford grimby simultaneously struck that there be something more than mere curiosity in manner palliser enlarged must make out then later began to see that be remarkably anxious to keep one from strangeways be sort of man in iron mask affair strangeways be apparently not only too excitable to be looked at spoken to too excitable to be spoken of must talk about be exceedingly curious remarked mr palford be not in response to palliser few moment before have suddenly looked thoughtful wore now aspect of man trying to recall something a palliser continued one day after have be to look at sunset through particular window in wing where strangeways be kept passed door of sitting room heard american arguing with be evidently telling be to be taken elsewhere poor devil be terrified heard beg for god sake not to send away there be panic in voice in connection with fact that have got away secretly at midnight be ugly thing to recall must seem to have significance grimby said uneasily set thinking looking into thing palliser went on pearson be secretive head man burrill made casual enlightening remark gathered curious detail might might not have meant good deal when strangeways suddenly appeared at window one evening number of thing fitted together theory be that american tembarom a used to call may not have be certain of identity at first must have brought strangeways with if have not have reason to suspect who be dare lose sight of wanted time to make sure to lay plan portrait of mile hugo be clue alarmed doubt have be following if found led to nothing must easily turn strangeways over to public charge let be put into lunatic asylum if found led to revelation must make pauper again must be easy to dispose of come come captain palliser must go too far ejaculated mr grimby alarmedly shocked to think of firm being dragged into case dealing with capital crime possible hangman be not line of profession captain palliser slight laugh contained hint of being shocked by possibility there be extremely private asylum so called sanatorium where discipline be strict question be asked one sometimes read in paper of case in mild mannered keeper in defending against attack of violent patient be obliged to use force with disastrous result be in such place that investigation must begin dear dear mr grimby broke out be that going rather far surely think mr tembarom chief characteristic be that be practical direct person must do what have to do in exactly that businesslike manner inquiry have be making have be a to whereabouts of place in superfluous relative might be placed without attracting attention be really astute what do think palford mr grimby turned to partner still wearing shocked disturbed expression have be recalling to mind circumstance probably bear upon case said mr palford captain palliser mention of portrait reminded of remember now that on mr temple barholm first visit to picture gallery seemed much attracted by portrait of mile hugo stopped examined curiously said felt a if have seen before turned to once twice finally remarked that might have seen one like at great fancy dress ball have taken place in new york have be invited to ball laughed palliser did not gather that replied mr palford gravely have apparently watched arriving guest from railing near by perhaps be lamp post with other news boy recognized likeness to strangeways doubt gave what call 'jolt ' said captain palliser must have experienced number of jolt during last few month palford grimby view of matter continued to be marked by extreme distaste for whole situation disturbing irritating possibility coming of american heir to estate of temple barholm have be trying to verge of extreme painfulness sufficient time having lapsed client having troubled little have outlived shock of first appearance settled once more into calm of accustomed atmosphere routine that must suddenly reappear upon dignified horizon a probable melodramatic criminal be fault of taste lack of consideration beyond expression to be dragged into vulgar detective work to be referred to in news paper in connection must lead to confusing firm with representative of such branch of profession a dealt with person who have committed act for in vulgar parlance might possibly swing if legal defender did not get off to firm whose sole affair have be dealing with noble ancient estate with advising supporting personage of stately name with private weighty family confidence if worst came to worst affair must surely end in most glaring odious notoriety in head line daily report even in london in appalling picture of one concerned in new york newspaper even in baffled struggle to keep abominable woodcut of mr edward james palford mr james matthew grimby from being published in sensational journalistic sheet professional duty demanded that situation must be dealt with investigation must be entered into most serious even if conservative step must be taken at once with regard to accepted report of mr james temple barholm tragic death must not be denied that captain palliser view of naturalness of origin of mistake have be made have logical air in region full of rioting derelict crazed with lawless excitement of dash after gold have said identity name be easily lost temple barholm be derelict in desperate state be in mood to speak of try to make friend doubt came went to such work a did scarcely speaking to one mass of earth debris of sort suddenly give way burying dozen men two three be dug out dead others not reached there be time to spare to dig for dead men one have seen temple barholm near place be seen no more ergo be buried with rest at time who knew in england felt be best thing must have happened to must have be if valet have not confessed trick old temple barholm have not died theory be that may have left place day before accident without being missed mental torment caused mental illness doe not matter what lost memory wandered about lord know how where lived probably never knew american picked up found that have money for reason of own professed to take care of must have come on clue just when heard of new fortune be naturally panic stricken must have be big blow at particular moment be sharp enough to see what might mean held on to poor chap like grim death have be holding on ever since must begin to take step decided palford grimby must of course take step at once must begin with discretion after grave private discussion began to take step in question with caution that seemed necessary to observe until felt solid ground under foot captain palliser be willing to assist have be going into matter went down to neighborhood of temple barholm quietly looked up data might prove illuminating when regarded from one point be on first of occasion that saw warned burrill be from burrill heard of tummas hibblethwaite there be impident little vagabond in village sir said that mr temple barholm used to go see take new york newspaper to cripple lad be be got kind of craze for talking about mr james temple barholm have map of place where be said to be killed if may presume to mention sir added with great dignity be opinion that two have good deal of talk together on subject dare say captain palliser admitted indifferently made further inquiry remark sauntered into hibblethwaite cottage however late next afternoon tummas be in bad temper for reason quite sufficient for regarded sourly what have tha coom for demanded did na ask thee be cheeky said captain palliser will give sovereign if will let see map mr temple barholm used to look at talk so much about laid sovereign down on small table by tummas sofa tummas did not pick up know who tha art tha'rt palliser ' tha wast th ' one a said a a be killed in th ' klondike have coom back alive have be listening to servant story have remarked palliser have better be careful a to what say suppose never heard of libel suit where must find if be called upon to pay mr temple barholm ten thousand pound damage 'd be obliged to sell atlas burrill towd a heard thee say tha 'd swear in court a be th ' one a be killed a tha 'd seen be burrill story not mine burrill have better keep mouth shut said palliser if be true how must like have heard be interested in 'th one a be killed ' tummas eye burned troublously have got reet down taken wi ' th ' other un answered be noan gentry be th ' reet mak dunnot believe a a be killed have coom back do palliser answered with amiable tolerance american gentleman have better come back disprove when used to talk about klondike never said anything to make feel a if doubted that other man be dead not answered tummas eh tummas what art tha talkin ' about exclaimed mr hibblethwaite who be mending at other end of room heerd say mysel suppose th story have be true be alive somewhere now 'd make big change must na ' ' laughed never heerd said tummas in stout denial tha losin ' tha moind commented mother a soon a heerd th talk about runnin ' away ' takin ' th ' mad gentleman wi '

talk about th ' poor gentleman a met with th accident a tha wert thysel tummas mr hibblethwaite proceeded moved by opportunity offered for presenting view on exciting topic 'd ax thee aw sort o ' question about what tha 'd found out wi ' pumpin ' foak 'd ax question now ' agen about what be loike to look at how tall wur onct axed if remembered what soart o chin have how spoke wur to set thee goin ' please volunteered tummas grudgingly did same a 'd look at th ' map to please ' tell tale about th ' news lad new york have not seemed improbable that village cripple tied to sofa must be ready enough to relate knew perhaps so much more that must be necessary to use discretion in selecting statement of value to drop in give sovereign let talk have appeared simple lad of class liked to be listened to enjoyed enlarging upon rendering dramatic such material a have fallen into hand tummas be eccentric instinct led to close like oyster before remote sense of subtly approaching attack be mother not who have provided information be not sufficiently specialized to be worth much what did tha say 'd run away fur tummas said to parent later be not one o ' th ' runnin ' away soart have probably be called away by business remarked captain palliser a rose to go after few minute casual talk with mr hibblethwaite be mistake not to leave address behind mother be mistaken in saying that took mad gentleman with have removed late at night time before went tak tha sov'rin ' said tummas a palliser moved away did na show thee th atlas tha did na want to see will leave sovereign for mother said palliser be sorry be not in better humor interest in atlas have indeed be limited to idea that must lead to subject of talk might cast illuminating side light possibly open up avenue vista tummas however having instinctively found displeasing have gained little avenue vista be necessary avenue through step of palford grimby might wander vista might explore with hesitating investigating glance so far scene remained unpromisingly blank american temple barholm have simply disappeared a have mysterious charge step likely to lead to definite result can scarcely be taken hopefully in case of person who have seemed temporarily to cease to exist can not interrogate can not demand information whatsoever foundation upon rest accusation if such accusation can be launched only into thin air fact that there be nobody to reply to to acknowledge indignantly refute be in serious barrier to accomplishment be also true that only few week have elapsed since accused have so to speak dematerialized be also impossible to calculate upon what american of class peculiarity must be likely to do in circumstance in private conference palford grimby frankly admitted to other that must almost have preferred that captain palliser must have kept remarkable suspicion to for time being at least yet when have admitted be confronted by disturbing possibility suggested by palliser actual crime have be might be committed have heard unpleasant story of private lunatic asylum like thing to shudder at might be going on at very moment spoke to other under possibility supineness must be excusable effort to trace missing man must at least be made effort be made with result painful a be to reflect on subject of asylum careful private inquiry be made information be quietly collected there be even visit to gruesomely quiet place on various polite pretext if longer period of time have elapsed mr palford remarked several time with stiffness of manner must feel that have more solid foundation for premise perfectly right captain palliser agreed with be lapse of time may mean life death to jem temple barholm so be perhaps a well to be on safe side go on quietly following small clue dare say must feel more comfortable yourselves mr palford mr grimby having made appointment with miss alicia arrived one afternoon at temple barholm to talk to privately thereby casting into state of agonized anxiety reduced to pallor visit be merely one of inquiry miss temple barholm mr palford began there be perhaps nothing alarming in client absence in note left asked to feel anxiety miss alicia said left note of explanation wish have known earlier mr palford tone have note of relieved exclamation perhaps there be entirely simple solution of painful difficulty hope have be too sanguine be not note of explanation exactly went away too suddenly to have time to explain two men looked at other disturbedly have not mentioned to intention of going asked mr grimby feel sure did not know be going when said good night remained with captain palliser talking for time miss alicia eye held wavering anxious question a looked from one to other wondered how much more than visitor knew found telegram when went to room contained most disquieting news about mr strangeways have got away from place where got away mr palford be again exclamatory be in institution where be kept under restraint miss alicia be wholly unable to explain to herself why quality in manner filled with sudden distress oh think not surely not surely nothing of sort be necessary be very quiet always be getting better day be important that must be watched over be doubt under care of physician in quiet sanatorium quiet sanatorium mr palford disturbance of mind be manifest did not know where indeed mr temple barholm talked very little of mr strangeways believe knew that distressed to feel must be of real assistance a a case be so peculiar perturbed solicitor looked again with rapid question at other miss alicia saw exchange of glance so to speak broke down under pressure of unconcealed anxiety last few week with suggestion of accusation too vague to be met have be too much for be afraid feel sure know something began be most anxious unhappy have not liked to ask question because must have seemed to imply doubt of mr temple barholm have even remained at home because did not wish to hear thing must not understand know have be said pearson in whom have greatest confidence felt that mr temple barholm must prefer must wait until returned do think will return said mr grimby amazedly oh gentle creature ejaculated can possibly think will not why why mr palford have shared partner amazement be obvious that be a ignorant a babe of detail of palliser extraordinary story in affectionate consideration for temple barholm have actually shut up lest must hear anything said against must not refute stood innocently obedient to wish like boy upon burning deck awaiting return version of whatsoever have be accused of there be something delicately heroic in little slender old thing with troubled eye cap quivering sideringlets appealed be legal adviser will be able to tell if there be anything must wish to know must not allow to listen to villager servant may ask be far from knowing a much a desire to know mr palford replied came here in fact added grimby to ask question of miss temple barholm fact that miss temple barholm have not allowed to be prejudiced by village gossip be invariably largely unreliable will make excellent witness mr palford said to partner with deliberation held suggestive significance man in fact have suddenly realized that ignorance must leave absolutely unbiased in answer to question might put that be much better in cross examining emotional elderly lady that such must be case witness miss alicia found word alarming mr palford bow be apologetically palliative mere figure of speech madam said really know so little one else doe know miss alicia protest have touch of bewilderment in must wish to ask a understand relation with mr temple barholm be most affectionate confidential be very fond of other answered for reason doubt talked to more freely than to other people mr grimby put perhaps palford must be a well to explain to miss temple barholm that curious feature of matter be that in way involves certain point concerning late mr temple barholm miss alicia uttered pathetic exclamation poor jem who died so cruelly mr palford bent head in acquiescence perhaps can tell what present mr temple barholm knew of how much knew told whole story first time took tea together miss alicia replied between recollection of strangely happy afternoon wonder at connection with present moment began to feel timid uncertain how did seem to impress remembered so well queer dear new york way of expressing warm hearted indignation at cruelty of what have happened oh be very much excited be so sorry for wanted to know everything about asked what looked like oh said palford wanted to know that be so full of sympathy replied explanation gaining warmth when told that picture of mile hugo in gallery be said to look like jem a boy wanted very much to see afterward went saw together will always remember how stood looked at most young men must not have cared always have such touching interest in poor jem mean that asked question about about death so forth be mr palford inquiry about concerned be interested especially in look manner of speaking personality so to speak in awful accident ended life though must not let talk about after have asked first question what kind of question suggested grimby only about what be known of time place how sad story reached england used to touch to think that only person who seemed to care be one who might have be expected to be almost glad tragic thing have happened be not mr palford watched mr grimby mr grimby gave more than one dubious distressed glance at palford interest be evident remarked palford thoughtfully unusual under circumstance for moment hesitated then put question did ever seem must say do remember occasion when appeared to think that there might be reason to doubt that mr james temple barholm be one of men who died in klondike felt that through wild questioning have at least reached certain testimony supporting captain palliser view interest reluctantly increased be reluctant because there must be shadow of question that innocent spinster lady told absolute truth being case one seemed to be dragged to verge of depth must inevitably be explored miss alicia expression be that of one who conscientiously searched memory remember that really expressed doubt answered carefully not exactly that what prompted palford a hesitated please try to recall exactly what said be most important fact that manner be almost eager eagerness be not habit made catch breath look more questioning puzzled than before one day came to sitting room when seemed rather excited explained have be with mr strangeways who have be worse than usual perhaps wanted to distract forget about asked question talked about poor jem for about hour at last said do suppose there be sort of chance that might be true that story came from klondike said so thoughtfully be startled said do think there must be such chance do ' drew long breath answered want to be sure about thing like have got to be sure ' be little excited so changed subject very soon afterward never felt quite certain of what be really thinking see what said be not so much expression of doubt a sort of question touch of lofty condemnatory made mr palford impressive be compelled to admit that fear that be question of have already guessed answer said at point miss alicia clasped hand quite tightly together upon knee if please exclaimed must ask to make thing little clear to what dreadful thing have happened will regard communication a most sacred confidence think may a well palford mr grimby suggested to partner yes palford acquiesced felt difficulty of blank explanation be involved in most trying position said feel that great discretion must be used until have reached more definite certainty extraordinary in fact startling thing have occurred be beginning a result of cumulative evidence to feel that there be reason to believe that klondike story be to be doubted that poor jem cried miss alicia one begin to be gravely uncertain a to whether have not be in house for month whether be not mysterious mr strangeways jem jem gasped poor little miss temple barholm quite white with shock if be mysterious strangeways mr grimby assisted to shorten matter american temple barholm apparently knew fact brought here for reason for same reason kept secreted under restraint cried miss alicia never never beg not to say such thing excuse can not listen must be wrong ungrateful excuse got up from seat trembling with actual anger in sense of outrage be remarkable thing to see small elderly creature angry remarkable thing have happened be a though be mother defending young loved poor jem love temple though be only woman who never have be least clever know know of must lie do wicked cunning thing temple be soul of honor be quite inspirational outburst have never before in life said so much at one time of course tear began to stream down face while mr palford mr grimby gazed at in great embarrassment if mr strangeways be poor jem come back alive temple did not know never knew did for be done for kindness ' sake be inevitable that must stammer before going to length of violence that word must burst from must swear be really shock to palford grimby that lady of miss temple barholm age training must volunteer to swear to thing be almost alarming be also in rather unpleasing taste captain palliser obliged mr temple temple barholm to confess that have known for time mr palford said with cold regret also informed that must communicate with without delay captain palliser be bad man miss alicia choked back gasp to make protest be after interview that mr temple barholm almost immediately left house without explanation added grimby left few line for defended miss alicia have not seen mr palford be still a well a cold poor little miss alicia took out of pocket with unsteady hand be always with must not on challenge seem afraid to allow to be read mr palford took from with slight bow of thanks adjusted glass read aloud with pause between phrase seemed somewhat to puzzle dear little miss alicia have got to light out of here a quick a can make ca even stop to tell why there be just one thing get rattled miss alicia one say doe get rattled yours affectionately t tembarom there be silence mr palford passed paper to partner who gave careful study afterward refolded handed back to miss alicia in court of law be mr palford sole remark must not be regarded a evidence for defendant miss alicia tear be still streaming held ringleted head well up can not stay beg pardon do indeed said must leave see added with fine little touch of dignity a yet house be still mr temple barholm home be grateful recipient of bounty burrill will attend make quite comfortable with obeisance be like slight curtsey turned fled in le than hour walked up neat bricked path old mr hutchinson looking out saw through tier of flower pot in window hutchinson be in london ann be reading at other side of room here be poor little owd miss temple barholm aw in flutter remarked grandmother tha got work cut out for thee if tha going to quiet oppen th door lass ann opened door

greeting however expressed more than lightly agreeable detachment from view whatsoever captain palliser felt curiously though must not have said what must have expected from if have known must be whim to appear how do do how d do grace shook hand with amiable ease scarcely commits man even to casual interest after took seat again how d ' do miss hutchinson said palliser how d ' do mr hutchinson mr

somebody whole company must be cross examined because curtain can not be brought down until right man be unmasked do let come into mr palford what know seems so inadequate mr palford mr grimby felt that there lurked in manner possibility that be being regarded lightly objection to situation loomed annoyingly large be of course extraordinary story mr palford said if be not mistaken in deduction may find involved in cause celebre will set england talking be not mistaken palliser presented comment with short dry laugh tha seems pretty cock sure hutchinson thrust in be one knew jem temple barbolm better than did in past be intimate enemy laughed again tha say tha will swear th ' chap tha saw through th ' window be said hutchinson 'd swear with composure duke be reflecting be again tapping with cane gaiter covering slender shining boot if mr temple temple barholm have remained here action must have seemed le suspicious suggested be palliser who replied if have whisked other man away lost head played fool did lose head that chap be screwed on th ' right way head be grunted curious fellow have number of friend duke remarked to palford grimby in impartial tone be hoping be not thinking of cross examining have always be convinced that under cross examination must be induced to innocently give evidence condemnatory to side of case must mind telling what exact evidence be so far mr palford have be opening budget of paper be evidence be cumulative grace said mr temple temple barholm position must have be far le suspicious one a suggested if have remained if have secretly removed mr mr strangeways last be captain palliser suggestion believe smiled duke did remove secretly how secretly for instance at night answered palliser miss temple barholm did not know when happened did turning to miss alicia who at once flushed paled knew be rather nervous where mr strangeways be concerned be sorry to say found that out almost at once even told several time must not think of need hear nothing about turned to duke air of appeal plainly representing feeling that must understand confession scarcely like to say wrong a be must help feeling that be like having lunatic in house be afraid might be more ill than temple realized that might time become violent never admitted so much of course be see be not told palliser summed up succinctly evidently duke admitted see point seemed to disengage from sense of admitting implication with entire calmness a turned again to mr palford paper be saying that exact evidence be mr palford referred to sheet of note that whether before shortly after arrival here be not at certain mr temple temple barholm began strongly to suspect identity of person then known a strangeways palliser again emitted short dry laugh duke mr palford looked at inquiringly have got on to ' before brought answered glance be sure of then why did bring duke suggested lightly oh well taking cue from duke assuming casual lightness also be obliged to come be jolly well convinced that have better keep hand on man also eye be good enough idea must leave thing like wandering about state must play benefactor safely in house of size of until be ready for action duke gave moment to considering matter still detachedly be on whole not unlikely that something of sort might suggest to criminal mind said glance at mr palford intimated that might resume statement have secured proof that applied to secret investigation be known to have employed scotland yard to make certain inquiry concerning man said to have be killed in klondike having evidently reached more than suspicion began to endeavor to persuade mr strangeways to let take to london apparently took time mere suggestion of removal threw invalid into state of painful excitement did pearson tell that duke inquired captain palliser in passing door of room one day heard certain expression of terrified pleading be mr palford explanation heard enough palliser took up carelessly to make worth while to question pearson who must have heard great deal more pearson be ordered to hold tongue from first will have to tell truth when be asked duke did not appear to resent view pearson must be likely to know what went on remarked be intelligent little fellow fact remains that in spite of distress reluctance mr strangeways be removed privately there knowledge end have not be seen since few hour after captain palliser expressed conviction that person have seen through west room window be mr james temple barholm mr temple temple barholm left house taking midnight train leaving clue a to where abouts intention disappeared said duke where have be looked for countenance of mr palford party expressed certain degree of hesitance principally in asylum so called sanatorium mr grimby admitted with hint of reluctance place where curiosity of outsider be not encouraged said palliser languidly where if patient dy in fit of mania there be always respectable witness to explain that case be hopeless from first mr hutchinson have be breathing hard occasionally a sat listened now sprang up uttering sound dangerously near violent snort art tha accusin ' lad o ' bein black villain enough to be ready to do bloody murder cried out be in very tight place hutchinson palliser shrugged shoulder a said one make suggestion at stage not accusation that hutchinson have lost head be apparent to daughter at least tha 'd be in tight place fine chap if have way flung forth irately 'd like to get thy head under arm roll of approaching wheel reached miss alicia there be carriage be agitated exclamation oh dear must be lady joan little ann left seat to make father return to father 'd better sit down said gently pushing in right direction when ca prove thing lie be just a well to keep quiet until can kept quiet though turned stood before palliser spoke with clear deliberateness what pretend to believe be not true captain palliser be just not true gave to be facing looking at other when burrill announced lady joan fayre entered rather quickly looked round room with sweeping glance taking in went to duke first shook hand be glad be here said must not have be out of dear young lady answered for farm be quotation know replied giving hand to miss alicia taking in palliser solicitor with bow be little more than nod then saw little ann walked over to to

little ann put hand on arm lady joan looked over hungry eye be more hungry than ever looked like creature in fever worn by think be glad be here too answered palliser sauntered over to have approved duke air of being at once detached inquiring did not intend to wear aspect of personage who play unpleasant part of pursuer avenger what said be be good of to come lady joan did think must stay away

call t tembarom too oh understand keep near while talk to people made sit down by know detail of letter addressed palliser a well a palford grimby sweeping detail aside what be want to ask be position ladyship mr palford fumbled little with paper in speaking mr temple temple barholm person known a mr strangeways have be searched for so far without result in meantime realize that more evidence obtain that mr temple temple barholm identified strangeways acted from motive more solid foundation upon captain palliser conviction rest up to point have only statement be prepared to make on oath fortunately however on one occasion overheard something said to belief will be corroborative evidence what did overhear inquired of palliser tone be not pacific considering that logically must be on side of investigator be habit a captain palliser remembered to seem to put most people on defensive meant to look a uninvolved a duke be not quite within power manner be sufficiently deliberate one evening before left for london be returning from billiard room heard engaged in animated conversation with host attention be arrested first because sketch of smile ill concealed usually scarcely deigned to speak to secondly because heard jem temple barholm name neither eye manner omitted word listened slight lift of shoulder be indifferent enough listened deliberately be convinced that fellow be criminal impostor wanted evidence ah come now remarked duke amiably now be getting on did gain thought so merely of cumulative order of course palliser answered with moderation be early day asked turning to lady joan again if knew one one who have sort of photograph of jem have one showed to be quite silent for moment hour came back to extraordinary hour when have stood in lounging fashion before through odd uncivilized absolutely human force of own have made listen to have gone on talking in nasal voice until with one common crude grotesque phrase have turned hideous world upside down changed whole face of sent stone wall rising before crumbling into dust seemed somehow to set free for moment have lifted load from nature of did not think must understand load of hatred silence have clutched hand have passionately wept on must have kissed have told must come back not be afraid a strange episode rose before detail by detail literally stared at palliser did did inquired yes answered mind be in riot because in midst of thing must be true something be false with memory of myriad subtle duplicity in brain have never seen anything must have approached thing like that have made feel more human than one in world have ever made feel jem have be able to do because be human human be friendly have said with boy laugh just friendly saw start though did not palliser continued stood studied locket intently remembered perfectly have examined so closely that have unconsciously knit brow said something in rather low voice palliser took up must not quite catch be something about knowing face again can see remember lady joan can repeat exact word did not understand struggle saw in face must have be impossible for to understand what felt be that if lost hold on strange belief in honesty of one decent thing have seen felt so close to that cleared air breathed must be a if have fallen into bottomless abyss without knowing why did got up from chair a if be witness in court yes can said yes can wish to make statement for whether jem temple barholm be alive dead captain palliser t tembarom have done harm duke sat up delicately alert have evidently found worth looking at listening to from outset hear hear said pleasantly what be exact word suggested palliser miss alicia who have be weeping on little ann shoulder almost on lap lifted head to listen hutchinson set jaw grunted mr palford cleared throat mechanically said one better than realized how ominously cumulative word sounded that man must know face like again wherever saw wherever saw ejaculated mr grimby there ensued moment of entire pause be inevitable having reached point taking of breath be necessary even duke ceased to appear entirely detached a mr palford turned to paper again there be perhaps slight feeling of awkwardness in air miss alicia have dropped terror smitten into new tear slight awkwardness be on whole rather added to by t tembarom a if serenely introduced by hand of drama opening door walking into room came in with matter of fact rather obstinate air stopped in midst looking round at a if collectedly taking in hutchinson sprang to foot with kind of

time coming by gee be alive heard for man of palliser make to stand silent in midst of mysterious slowly accumulating conviction that one perilously of own rarely inept type be on verge of feeling appallingly like fool be momentarily unendurable nothing have be explained after be what call bluff ' in new york demanded have got lot to explain admit that jem temple barholm be alive realized asinine error before word be fully spoken realization be result of square shouldered swing with t tembarom turned round expression of eye a ran over admit said admit hell be up stair with slight jerk
