majestic deliberation got upon foot stood gazing at with calmness of pose so splendid liquid darkness lustre of eye so stilly fearlessly beautiful that caught breath simply gazed a a great king might gaze at intruder scarcely deigning wonder a have passed on way betty have seen that enclosing park paling be decaying covered with lichen falling at interval have even passed through mind that here be one of demand for expenditure on large estate limited resource must not confront with composure deer fence thing of wire ten foot high to form obstacle to leap have marked to be in such condition a to threaten to become shortly useless thing until moment have seen no deer looking beyond stag across sward now saw group near other stag cropping looking towards with lifted head doe at respectful affectionate distance from caring for fawn stag who have risen near have merely walked through gap in boundary now stood free to go where must will get away said betty knitting black brow ah what

might be about be affair of mine said must be too bad to let get away though what happens to stray stag one doe exactly know a said caught sight of someone man in legging shabby clothes with gun over shoulder evidently under keeper be big rather rough looking fellow a lurched out into open from wood betty saw that must reach if passed through narrow gate few yard away walked quickly be slouching along head drooping broad shoulder expressing definite antipode of good spirit betty studied back a strode after conclusion being that be perhaps not good humoured man to approach at time that be by ill luck one of le fortunate hour wait moment if please clear mellow voice flung out after when be within hearing distance want to speak to keeper turned with air of far from pleased surprise afternoon sun be in eye made scowl for moment did not see distinctly who be approaching have at once recognised certain cool tone of command in voice whose suddenness have roused from black mood few step brought to close quarter when found looking into eye of pursuer made movement a if to lift cap then checking touched keeper fashion oh said shortly miss vanderpoel beg pardon bettina stood still second have surprise also here be unexpected again under keeper be red haired second class passenger of meridiana did not look pleased to see suddenness of appearance excluded possibility of realising that upon whole be at least not displeased to see how do do said feeling remark fantastically conventional not being inspired by alternative came to tell that one of stag have got through gap in fence damn heard say under breath aloud said thank be splendid creature said did not know what to do be glad to see keeper coming thank said again strode towards place where stag still stood gazing up road a if reflecting a to whether allured not betty walked back more slowly watching with interest wondered what must find necessary to do heard begin low flute like whistling then saw antlered head turn towards woodland creature moved be in direction have without doubt answered call before knew meaning to be friendly went towards stretching out tender sniffing nose put hand in pocket of rough coat

reception of reserved view of situation entirely be not of mature rather alarming american type have imagined possible felt relief in marking at once be also not pretty fashionable young lady who might have come to scold ask silly irrational question ordinarily rather unillumined countenance changed somewhat in expression when sat down began to speak mr townlinson be impressed by fact that be at once unmistakably evident that whatsoever reason for coming have not presented to ask irrelevant unreasonable question lady anstruthers explained without superfluous phrase have definite knowledge of husband whereabouts have seemed possible that messrs townlinson sheppard might have received information more recent that own impersonal framing of inquiry struck mr townlinson a being in remarkably good taste since conveyed condemnation of sir nigel desire to involve mr townlinson in expressing refrained even from implying that situation be unusual one might be open to criticism excellent reserve great cleverness mr townlinson commented inwardly there be certainly few young lady who must have clearly realised that solicitor can not be called upon to commit until have have time to weigh matter decide upon long varied experience have included interview in charming emotional woman have expected at once to take side miss vanderpoel exhibited sign of expecting anything of kind even when went on with what have come to say stornham court surroundings be depreciating seriously in value through need of radical repair etc sister comfort be naturally involved a mr townlinson must fully understand nephew future sooner process of dilapidation be arrested better with le difficulty present time be without doubt better than indefinite future miss vanderpoel having fortunately be able to come to stornham be greatly interested naturally desirous of seeing work begun father also must be interested since be not possible to consult sir nigel have seemed proper to consult solicitor in whose hand estate have be for so long time be aware seemed that not only mr townlinson mr townlinson father also grandfather have legally represented anstruthers a well a many other family a there seemed necessity for structural change work done be such a must only rescue increase value of estate must there be objection to being begun without delay certainly unusual young lady must be interesting to discover how well knew sir nigel since seemed that only knowledge of temper bitter irritable vanity must have revealed to necessity of precaution be taking without even intimating that be precaution extraordinarily clever girl mr townlinson wore air of quiet business like reflection be aware miss vanderpoel that present income from estate be not such a must justify anything approaching required expenditure yes be aware of that expense must be provided for by father most generous on mr vanderpoel part mr townlinson commented estate must of course increase greatly in value circumstance have prevented father from visiting stornham miss vanderpoel explained have led to being ignorant of condition of thing might have remedied did not explain what particular circumstance have separated family have be mr townlinson thought understood condition existing must be remedied now if messrs townlinson sheppard saw obstacle other than scarcity of money mr townlinson summing up of matter expressed in effect that saw none estate have be fine one in day during last sixty year have become much impoverished with conservative decorum of manner admitted that there have not be since sir nigel marriage sufficient reason for neglect of dilapidation firm have strongly represented to sir nigel certain resource must not be diverted from proper object of restoring property be entailed upon son son future must beyond have be considered in dispensing of mother fortune by time comprehended fully that need restrain dignified expression of opinion in speech with young lady have come to consult with with a clear view of propriety discretion demanded by position a have yet before close of interview understood point of view of other what recognised be that though have not seen sir nigel since childhood have in astonishing way obtained extraordinary insight into character be have led to take present step might not realise might have to contend with conservative formal action have surrounded sister with certain barrier of conventional protection at once controlled dignified astutely intelligent since a say structural change be proposed such a owner might resent a lady anstruthers be mother of heir a lady anstruthers father undertakes to defray expenditure sane man must object to restoration of property to do so must be to cause public opinion to express strongly against such action must place grossly in wrong then added with deliberation realising that be committing feeling firmly willing to do so for reason of own sir nigel be man who object strongly to putting publicly in wrong thank said miss vanderpoel have said of intention for enlightenment be aware that have done so will not be first time that american fortune have restored english estate mr townlinson continued amiably there have be many notable case of late year will be happy to place at disposal at time miss vanderpoel be obliged to for consideration in matter thank said miss vanderpoel again wished to be sure must not be infringing english rule have knowledge of will be infringing none have be most correct courteous before went away mr townlinson felt that have be greatly enlightened a to what young lady might know be gave singularly clear detail a to what be proposed there be so much to be done that found opening eye slightly once twice of course if mr vanderpoel be prepared to spend money in lavish manner be to good so far a estate be concerned be stupendous people after heir be grandson how striking be that with power readiness to use be evidently combined even in beautiful young person clearest business sense of situation what be done must be for comfort of lady anstruthers future of son sir nigel being unable to sell either house land must not undo when mr townlinson accompanied visitor to carriage with dignified politeness felt somewhat like elderly solicitor who have found drawn into atmosphere of sort of intensely modern

early victorian sentimentalist did not despair of result from process of irritation to gently steadily convey to beautiful spirited young creature that man must approach without ulterior motive be rather good idea if one must make clear with casual air of sensibly taking for granted that natural power of youth wit beauty be rendered impotent by greatness of fortune whose proportion obliterated

woman who take to heel be deucedly unpopular in england have not be long in england have be struck by prevalence of sort of constitutional british sense of fair play among people who really count

colonist like piece of fine solid old furniture one even now see here there in house in virginia fact remains said nigel with unpleasant laugh fact remains dear girl fact that doe remain said betty not unpleasantly at still with gentle air of mere unprejudiced speculation be that if man woman be properly ill treated properly not in amateurish way reach point of not caring in least nothing matter that must get away from horror of unbearable thing never to see hear of again be heaven enough to make anything else thing to smile at one must settle other point by experimenting suppose run away from rosy then can see if be cut by county laugh be unpleasant again so long a be with will not be cut there be number of penniless young men of family in a well a adjoining county do think mount dunstan must cut looked down at carpet thoughtfully moment then lifted eye think so answered will ask be startled by sudden feeling that might be capable of oh come now said that go beyond joke will not do such absurd thing one doe not want one domestic difficulty discussed by one neighbour betty opened coolly surprised eye did not understand be personal matter remarked where do domestic

cut unadorned fact be like bullet said betty reach home if one aim be good shiftiest people can not evade certain thing became evident to betty during time elapsed between arrival of invitation great ball despite obvious intention to assume amiable pose for time being sir nigel must not conceal not quite unexplainable antipathy to one individual individual be mount dunstan whom did not seem easy for to leave alone seemed to recur to a subject without special reason somewhat puzzled betty until heard from rosalie of intimacy with lord tenham in measure explained whole truth be that lout a have be called have indulged in frank speech in rare intercourse with brother friend have once interfered with hot young fury in matter in pair have specially wished to avoid interference open scorn of method of entertaining have felt to be disgusting impudence must have be deservedly punished with horsewhip if youngster have not be big muscled clumsy oaf with dangerous eye upon footing acquaintance have stood in past year to decide a sir nigel have decided that oaf in question have begun to make bid for splendid fortune under roof of stornham court be thing not to be regarded calmly be more than must stand folly of temper be forever undoing betrayed into mistake more than once girl with beauty wealth chose to regard a sort of property rightfully own be sister in law at least be living under

sick a be driven home to that be no longer young that have never be good looking that have cut ground from under foot twelve year ago when have married rosalie if must have waited if must have done several other thing perhaps clever acting of part power of domination might have given chance even blackguard of mount dunstan have better one now be young at least free big strong beast be forced with bitter reluctance to admit that be not even particularly strong of late have felt hideously so detested mount dunstan more for increasing reason a thought matter over must seem perhaps subtle pleasure to normal mind to there be pleasure support aggrandisement in referring to ill case of mount dunstan estate in relating illustrative anecdote in dwelling upon hopelessness of outlook notable unpopularity of man confiding young lady from state be required said on one occasion must be necessary that must be young person of much simplicity who must not be alarmed chilled by obvious one must realise more clearly than mount dunstan said coldly casually a if be simplest matter of fact if fellow have be making agreeable to betty be a well that certain point must be a be inadvertently brought before miss vanderpoel be really rather fine people said to other afterwards when entered ballroom at dunholm castle with brother in law bore a composedly a if have be escorted by most admirable

realise situation clearly said to other have arrived in england to find sister neglected wreck fortune squandered existence stripped bare of even such thing a one felt to be mere decency there be one thing to be deduced from fact have stared in face of deduction have said nothing whatever be of course remarkable in young person may be mentioned that perhaps there have be who must not have be reluctant to hear what must have have to say who have even possibly given delicate lead lead have never be taken one lady have even remarked that on part felt that too great reserve verged upon secretiveness be not desirable girlish quality of course situation have be so much discussed that people be naturally on lookout for arrival of stornham party a be known that sir nigel have returned home must be likely to present with wife sister in law there be not dowager present who did not know how where have reprehensibly spent last month served quite right that spanish dancing person have coolly left in lurch for younger more attractive a well a richer man if be not for miss vanderpoel one need not pretend that one knew nothing about affair in fact if have not be for miss vanderpoel must not have received invitation poor lady anstruthers must be sitting at home still forlorn little frump invalid have so wonderfully ceased to be since sister have taken in hand be absolutely growing even pretty young clothes be really beautiful whole thing be amazing betty a well a rosalie nigel knew that many people turned undisguisedly to look at even to watch a came into splendid ballroom be splendid ballroom stately one lord dunholm lord westholt shared certain thought when met be that hers be distinctly proud young brilliance of presence figured most perfectly against background much a people wanted to look at sir nigel eye be drawn from to miss vanderpoel after be who made object of interest one wanted to know what must do with how must carry off how much did know of distaste people felt for since must not talk encourage talk dunholms must not have invited sister have ignored did not guess that must have ignored if must be there not natural embarrassment in feeling forced to appear in pomp a be under escort embarrassment be perceptible manner committed to recognition of shadow of flaw in character of companion even carried certain conviction with looker on felt impossibility of suggesting such flaw by own manner for evening at least man must actually be treated a if be entirely unobjectionable person appeared a if be what girl wanted intended must happen be what nigel have begun to perceive did not put pleasantly deucedly clever girl a be said to saw that must be more agreeable to have nonsense talked ruffling of temper have always be able to

one house be superb room of entertainment be in proportion perfect be quite renowned for beauty of space offered people be through century of dignified living so placed that intercourse with kind be easy delightful thing need never doubt own effect effect of hospitality sir nigel saw about people who held enviable place in county of have never known of have long ceased to recall existence there be among who lifted lorgnette stuck monocle into eye a passed asking other in politely subdued tone who man be who seemed to be in attendance on miss vanderpoel nigel knew girded at internally while made most of suave smile distinguished personage who be chief guest be to be seen at upper end of room talking to tall man with broad shoulder who be plainly interesting for moment a stornham party passed on person making bow retired a turned towards sir nigel recognising agreeable smile be for moment lost how in name of heaven did mount dunstan come here broke from with involuntary heat must be rash to conclude said betty a returned bow of very grand old lady in black velvet imposing tiara that came in response to invitation very grand old lady seemed pleased to see with royal little sign called to side a betty vanderpoel be great success with mr weldens old dobys of village life be also success among grand old lady when stood before there be delicate submission in air be suggestive of obedience to dignity of year state strongly conservative rather feudal old person be much pleased by in present irreverent iconoclasm of modern time be most agreeable to talk to handsome creature who be a beautifully attentive a if have be specially perfect young lady in waiting one even patted betty hand little when took be great county potentate who be known a lady alanby of dole house being one of most ancient interesting in england be glad to see here to night said be looking very nice can not help that betty asked permission to present sister brother in law lady alanby be polite to of gave rather sharp glance through gold pince nez a greeted janey mary said to two girl nearest daresay will kindly change chair let lady anstruthers miss vanderpoel sit next to lady jane mary lithcom who have be ordered about by from infancy obeyed with polite smile be not particularly pretty girl be of indigent noble jane who have almost overlarge blue eye sighed a reseated few chair lower down doe

satisfactorily convinced that lord mount dunstan have be suffering for sin of father must be annoying be lord dunholm quite sure of put in sir nigel with suggestively civil air old lady alanby gave unencouraging look quite said must be likely to be before took step ah remarked nigel knew lord tenham see lady alanby look be more unencouraging still quietly openly put up glass stared there be time when have not remotest objection to being rude to certain people be sorry to hear that observed there never be room for mistake about tenham be not usually mentioned think man must be usually mentioned if everything be known said nigel then appalling thing happened lady alanby gazed at few second made reply dropped glass turned again to talk to betty be a if have turned back on sir nigel still wearing amiable exterior used internally bad language be fool to speak of tenham thought great fool little later miss vanderpoel made curtsy to exalted guest be commented upon again by who looked on be not at unnatural that one must find one eye following girl who representing sort of royal power must have good fortune of possessing such look bearing remembering child bete noir of long leg square audacious little face nigel anstruthers found restraining slight grin a looked on at dancing partner flocked about like bee lady alanby of dole other very grand old middle aged lady found

obviousness dunholms have given lead a lady alanby have said rest be following ignoring interval with reposeful readiness be wonderfully well done apparently there have be no past at began with large young man who despite viking type really looked particularly well in evening dress lady alanby held by chair for time openly enjoying talk with calling up tommy that might make friend after while

have seen day by day where thought be leading in what direction be developing at distance of three thousand mile found asking question endeavouring to reach conclusion affection for betty be central emotion of existence have never told that have outgrown kind pretty creature have married in early youth certainly tender care for pleasure in simple goodness have never wavered betty have given companionship have counted greatly in sum of happiness because imagination be not suspected in one knew what stood for in life have son stood at head of great house so to speak american parallel of what great house be in non republican country power of counted for great thing not in america alone throughout world a international intimacy increased influence of such house might end in aiding in making of history enormous constantly increasing wealth huge financial scheme must not confine influence must reach far man whose hand held lever controlling be doing well when thought of gravely such

sometimes suggested to son who might have be be not a closeness of companionship increased with year admiration for grew with love power left in hand must work for advancement of thing must not be idly disseminated if antagonistic influence wrought against have found reflecting that after be said marriage of such girl have sort of parallel in of young royal creature whose union might make mar

fortune such a grow rapidly be richer man by million than have be when rosalie have married nigel anstruthers memory of marriage have be painful thing to even before have known whole truth of result man have be common adventurer scoundrel despite fact of good birth air of decent breeding if man who be a much scoundrel cleverer must be necessary that must be much cleverer made best of to betty be folly to think one must guess what woman man for matter must love knew betty man know thing come a be in dark claim own whether for good evil have lived long enough to see beautiful strong spirited

for dunholms have pleased be people whose dignity admirableness be part of general knowledge lord westholt be plainly young man of many attraction if two be drawn to other what more natural must be well wondered if must be westholt love quickened sagacity needed stimulus said to in time that though liked admired westholt went farther that others paid court to must guess without being told have seen effect have produced when have be at home also unexpected letter to wife from milly bowen have revealed many thing milly having noted mr vanderpoel eager anxiety to hear direct news of lady anstruthers be not person to let fall from hand useful thread of connection have written quite at length managing adroitly to convey that have seen that have heard have be making visit within driving distance of stornham have have pleasure of meeting lady anstruthers miss vanderpoel at various party be so sure that mr vanderpoel must like to hear how well lady anstruthers be looking that ventured to write betty effect upon county be made quite clear a also be interested expectation of appearance in town next season mr vanderpoel perhaps gathered more from letter than wife did in mind relieved happiness consternation be mingled do think reuben betty will marry that lord westholt rather faltered seems very nice must rather married american must feel a if have girl at if lived in england lady bowen give good character husband said smiling if anything untoward happens annie will have house of own half way between dunholm castle stornham court when have begun to decide that lord westholt did not seem to be man fate be veering towards not unnaturally cast mental eye over such other person a letter mentioned at exactly what period thought first dwelt shade anxiously on mount dunstan must not have told at length became conscious that so dwelt have begun by feeling interest in story have asked question about because situation such a suggested query to man of affair thus have be natural that letter must speak of what have written have recalled to certain rumour of disgraceful old scandal yes have be bad lot arranged to put casual sounding question so to certain person who knew english society well what gathered be not encouraging present lord mount dunstan be considered rather surly brute lived mysterious sort of life might cover many thing be bad blood people be naturally shy of of course man be pauper place barrack falling to ruin there have be something rather shady in going to america australia few year ago good looking well so few people have seen lady who be speaking have heard that be one of big rather lumpy men have ill tempered expression always gave wide berth to man who looked nasty tempered one two other person who have spoken of have conveyed to mr vanderpoel about same amount of vaguely unpromising information episode of g selden have be interesting enough with suggestion of picturesque contrast combination betty touch have made junior salesman attracting be good type of young fellow who battling with discouragement of hard life still did not lose amazing good cheer patience found healthy sleep honest waking even in hall bedroom have consented to betty request that must see partly because be inclined to like what have heard partly for reason betty did not suspect by extraordinary chance g selden have seen mount dunstan surroundings at close range mr vanderpoel have liked what have gathered of mount dunstan attitude towards personality so singularly exotic to crude uneducated slangy junior salesman be not in degree fool to american father with daughter like summing up of normal nice natured common young denizen of united state fresh from contact with effete might be subtly instructive well worth hearing if be unconsciously expressed mr vanderpoel thought knew how after have overcome visitor first awkwardness if chanced to be self conscious must lead to talk what hoped to do be to make forget begin to talk to a have talked to betty to ingenuously reveal impression point of view young men of clean rudimentary type be very definite about thing liked disliked must be trusted to reveal admiration lack of without absolute intention actual statement being elemental undismayed saw thing cleared of mist of social prejudice modification yes felt must be glad to hear of lord mount dunstan mount dunstan estate from g selden in happy moment of unawareness why be that happened to be mount dunstan be desirous to hear of well absolute reason for must not have explained have asked question on subject more than once there be well founded reason perhaps if betty letter have spoken of mount dunstan home have also described lord westholt dunholm castle of two men have certainly spoken more fully than of others of mount dunstan have have more to relate through incident of g selden smiled a realised importance of figure of g selden be selden broken leg two men have ridden over from mount dunstan to visit for selden betty might not have met mount dunstan again be reason enough for have said yet perhaps between betty there existed thing impress communicates without word perhaps because affection be unusual realised other emotion half defined anxiety felt now be not new thing confessed to that have be spurred little by letter last steamer have brought be not lord westholt definitely appeared have asked to be wife have declined proposal must not have liked man more without being in love with wrote like more than can say so much indeed that feel little depressed by certainty that love if have loved whole matter must have be simplified if other man have drawn thing must not be simple father foresaw complication did not want complication for betty yet emotion be perverse irresistible

evidence that horse have be ridden too long hard that be worn out with fatigue did not know that have ridden round round over marsh have passed several time through same lane childe sure of foot actually stumbled out of sheer weariness of limb perhaps be brought back to earth led to look around with eye saw material object with comprehension have reached lonely place indeed evening be drawing on be at edge of marsh land about be strange to desolate at side of steep lane overgrown with grass seeming mere cart path stood deserted looking black white timbered cottage be ruin close to be dripping spinney tree forming darkling background to tumble down house whose thatch be rotting into hole wall sagging forward perilously bit of garden about be neglected untidy here there window be broken stuffed with piece of ragged garment altogether sinister repellent place enough looked at with heavy eye where be now where be now repeating in far chamber of brain sight seemed dimmed not only by mist by sinking faintness possessed did not remember how little food have eaten during more than twenty four hour habit be heavy with moisture clung to body be conscious of hot tremor passing over saw that hand shook a held bridle on have lost grip have never fainted in life be not going to faint now woman did not faint in day must reach cottage dismount to rest under shelter for short time

wet not alone with rain with sweat snorted out hot smoking breath spoke to moved forward at command be trembling too not more than two hundred yard turned into lane be wet slippery strewn with stone trembling uncertain hold on bridle combined to produce disaster set foot upon stone slid beneath stumbled must not help to recover so fell only by heaven mercy not upon with crushing big boned weight be able to drag free of before began to kick in humiliated effort to rise must not rise because be hurt when herself got up staggered caught at broken gate because in wrenching leap for safety have twisted ankle for moment be in cruel pain when recovered from shock sufficiently to be able to look at cottage saw that be more of ruin than have seemed even at short distance door hung open on broken hinge smoke rose from chimney because there be one within wall to light fire be quite empty everything about place lay in dead utter silence in normal mood must have liked mystery of situation must have set about planning way out of difficulty now mind made effort because normal interest in thing have fallen away from might be twenty mile from stornham possible fact did not at moment seem to

passed through dead blackened ember lay on hearth bundle of dried grass have be slept on be piled in corner empty nail keg wooden box have be drawn before big chimney place for wanderer to sit on when black ember have be hot red betty gave one glance around sat down upon box standing on bare hearth head sinking forward hand falling clasped between knee eye on brick floor where be now broke from in loud whisper whose sound be mechanical hollow where be now sat there without moving while grey mist from marsh crept close about door through stole about foot so sat long long in heavy far off dream along road man be riding with lowering fretted face have come across country on horseback because to travel by train meant wearisome stop change endlessly slow journeying annoying beyond endurance to who have not patience to spare ride must have be pleasant enough for slow mist like rain also have taken wrong turning because did not know road travelled last signpost have passed however have given cue again began to feel something of security confound rain best road be slippery with haze of made man mind feel befogged lowered spirit horribly discouraged must worry into ill humour even if have
