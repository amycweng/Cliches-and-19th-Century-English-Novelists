ran very fast rat boyish invention of rising be only part of game how natural must be that sometime perhaps before long there must be real rising surely there must be one if secret party have grown so strong if many weapon secret friend in other country be ready waiting during year hidden work preparation must have be going on continually even though be preparation for unknown day party have lasted so long passed oath on from generation to generation must be of deadly determination what might not have made ready in cavern secret meeting place longed to reach home tell father at once have heard recalled to mind word for word that rat have be told even have added in game because well because seemed so real too so real that actually might be useful when reached philibert place found loristan lazarus very much absorbed in work door of back sitting room be locked when first knocked on locked again a soon a have entered there be many paper on table be evidently studying several of be map be road map map of town city of fortification be map of place in samavia be usually kept in strong box when be taken out to be studied door be always kept locked before have evening meal be returned to strong box be pushed into corner have newspaper piled upon when arrives marco heard loristan say to lazarus can show clearly what have be planned can see for father spoke scarcely at during meal though be not habit of lazarus to speak at such time unless spoken to evening seemed to marco that looked more silent than have ever seen look before be plainly thinking anxiously of deeply serious thing story of stranger who have be to samavia must not be told yet be one must keep loristan did not say anything until lazarus have removed thing from table made room a neat a possible while be being done sat with forehead resting on hand a if absorbed in thought then made gesture to marco come here comrade said marco went to to night one may come to talk with about grave thing said think will come can not be quite sure be important that must know that when come will find quite alone will come at late hour lazarus will open door quietly that one may hear be important that one must see one must go walk on opposite side of street until appears then one who go to give warning must cross pavement before say in low voice lamp be lighted ' at once turn quietly away what boy heart must not have leaped with joy at mystery of even common dull boy who knew nothing of samavia must have felt jerky marco voice almost shook with thrill of feeling how will know said at once without asking at knew be one who be to go have seen before loristan answered be man who drove in carriage with king will know said marco when will go not until be half past one o'clock go to bed sleep until lazarus call then added look well at face before speak will probably not be dressed a well a be when saw first marco went up stair to room went to bed a be told be hard to go to sleep rattle roaring of road did not usually keep awake because have lived in poorer quarter of too many big capital city not to be accustomed to noise to night seemed to that a lay looked out at lamplight heard bus cab went past must not help thinking of people who be in on top of of people who be hurrying along on pavement outside broken iron railing be wondering what must think if knew that thing connected with battle read of in daily paper be going on in one of shabby house scarcely gave glance to a went by must be something connected with war if man who be great diplomat companion of king came in secret to talk alone with patriot who be samavian father be doing be for good of samavia perhaps secret party knew be doing heart almost beat aloud under shirt a lay on lumpy mattress thinking over must indeed look well at stranger before even moved toward must be sure be right man game have amused with so long game of trying to remember picture people place clearly in detail have be wonderful training if must draw knew must have made sketch of keen eyed clever aquiline face with well cut delicately close mouth looked a if have be shut upon secret always always if must draw found saying again must draw though perhaps only roughly have often amused by making sketch of thing wanted to ask question about have even drawn people face in untrained way father have said that have crude gift for catching likeness perhaps must make sketch of face must show father that knew must recognize jumped out of bed went to table near window there be paper pencil lying on street lamp exactly opposite threw into room quite light enough for to see by knelt by table began to draw worked for about twenty minute steadily tore up two three unsatisfactory sketch poor drawing must not matter if must catch subtle look be not slyness something more dignified important be not difficult to get marked aristocratic outline of feature common looking man with le pronounced profile must have be le easy to draw in one sense gave mind wholly to recalling of detail have photographed on memory through trained habit gradually saw that likeness be becoming clearer be not long before be clear enough to be striking one one who knew man must recognize got up drawing long joyful breath did not put on shoe crossed room a noiselessly a possible a noiselessly opened door made ghost of sound when went down stair woman who kept lodging house have gone to bed so have other lodger maid of work light be out except one saw glimmer of under door of father room when have be mere baby have be taught to make special sign on door when wished to speak to loristan stood still outside back sitting room made now be low scratching sound two scratch soft tap lazarus opened door looked troubled be not yet time sir said very low know marco answered must show something to father lazarus let in loristan turned round from writing table questioningly marco went forward laid sketch down before look at said remember well enough to draw thought of at once must make sort of picture do think be like loristan examined closely be very like answered have made feel entirely safe thanks comrade be good idea there be relief in grip gave boy hand marco turned away with exultant feeling just a reached door loristan said to make most of gift be gift be true mind have have good training more draw better draw everything can neither street lamp noise thought kept marco awake when went back to bed before settled upon pillow gave certain order have read heard loristan say that mind can control body when people once find out that can do so have tried experiment have found out curious thing one be that if told to remember certain thing at certain time usually found that did remember something in brain seemed to remind have often tried experiment of telling to awaken at particular hour have awakened almost exactly at moment by clock will sleep until one o'clock said a shut eye then will awaken feel quite fresh will not be sleepy at slept a soundly a boy can sleep at one o'clock exactly awakened found street lamp still throwing light through window knew be one o'clock because there be cheap little round clock on table must see time be quite fresh not at sleepy experiment have succeeded again got up dressed then went down stair a noiselessly a before carried shoe in hand a meant to put on only when reached street made sign at father door be loristan who opened will go now marco asked yes walk slowly to other side of street look in direction know where will come from after have given sign then come in go to bed again marco saluted a soldier must have done on receiving order then without second delay passed noiselessly out of house loristan turned back into room stood silently in center of long line of handsome body looked particularly erect stately eye be glowing a if something deeply moved there grows man for samavia said to lazarus who watched god be thanked lazarus voice be low hoarse saluted quite reverently sir said god save prince yes loristan answered after moment hesitation when be found went back to table smiling beautiful smile wonder of silence in deserted street of great city after midnight have hushed roar tumult to rest be almost unbelievable thing stillness in depth of forest on mountain top be not so strange few hour ago tumult be rushing past in few hour more will be rushing past again now street be naked thing distant policeman tramp on bare pavement have hollow almost fearsome sound seemed especially so to marco a crossed road have ever be so empty deadly silent before be so night perhaps be when be fast asleep on lumpy mattress with light from street lamp streaming into room listened for step of policeman on night watch because did not wish to be seen there be jutting wall where must stand in shadow while man passed policeman must stop to look questioningly at boy who walked up down pavement at past one in morning marco must wait until have gone by then come out into light look up down road cross street heard approaching footstep in few minute be safely in shadow before must be seen when policeman passed came out walked slowly down road looking on side now then looking back at first one be in sight then late hansom cab came tinkling along people in be returning from festivity be laughing talking noticed nothing own joking then there be silence again for long time a seemed to marco one be to be seen be not really so long a appeared because be anxious then very early vegetable wagon on way from country to covent garden market came slowly lumbering by with driver almost asleep on pile of potato cabbage after have passed there be stillness emptiness once more until policeman showed again on beat marco slipped into shadow of wall a have done before when came out into light have begun to hope that time must not seem long to father have not really be long told have only seemed so father anxiousness must be greater than own must be loristan knew depended on coming of great man who sat side by side with king in carriage talked to a if knew well might be something samavia be waiting to know at least secret party marco thought secret party be samavia started at sound of footstep one be coming said be man be man who be walking up road on same side of pavement a own marco began to walk toward quietly rather rapidly thought might be best to appear a if be boy sent on midnight errand perhaps to call doctor then if be stranger passed suspicion must be aroused be man a tall a one who have driven with king yes be about same height be too far away to be recognizable otherwise drew nearer marco noticed that also seemed slightly to hasten footstep marco went on little nearer must be able to make sure yes now be near enough yes man be same height not unlike in figure be much younger be not one who have be in carriage with majesty be not more than thirty year old began swinging cane whistling music hall song softly a marco passed without changing pace be after policeman have walked round beat disappeared for third time that marco heard footstep echoing at distance down cross street after listening to make sure that be approaching instead of receding in direction placed at point where must watch length of thoroughfare yes one be coming be man figure again be able to place rather in shadow so that person approaching must not see that be being watched solitary walker reached recognizable distance in about two minute time be dressed in ordinary shop made suit of clothes be rather shabby quite unnoticeable in appearance common hat be worn so that rather shaded face even before have crossed to marco side of road boy have clearly recognized be man who have driven with king chance be with man crossed at exactly place made easy for boy to step lightly from behind walk few pace by side then pas directly before across pavement glancing quietly up into face a said in low voice distinctly word lamp be lighted without pausing second walk on way down road did not slacken pace look back until be distance away then glanced over shoulder saw that figure have crossed street be inside railing be all right father must not be disappointed great man have come walked for about ten minute then went home to bed be obliged to tell to go to sleep several time before eye closed for rest of night viii exciting game loristan referred only once during next day to what have happened did errand well be not hurried nervous said prince be pleased with calmness more be said marco knew that quiet mention of stranger title have be made merely a designation if be necessary to mention again in future must be referred to a prince in various continental country there be many prince who be not royal even serene highness who be merely prince a other noble be duke baron nothing special be revealed when man be spoken of a prince though nothing be said on subject of incident be plain that much work be being done by loristan lazarus sitting room door be locked map document usually kept in iron box be being used marco went to tower of london spent part of day in living again story century past have

might all be real word of might be game at said marco might rat answered if knew where secret party be 'd like to go tell about what be that said suddenly turning head toward street what be calling out newsboy with particularly shrill voice be shouting out something at topmost of lung tense excited member of circle stirred spoke for few second rat listened marco listened whole squad listened pricking up ear startling news from samavia newsboy be shrilling out amazing story descendant of lost prince found descendant of lost prince found chap got penny snapped rat beginning to shuffle toward arched passage have answered marco following come on rat yelled let go get paper whizzed down passage with swiftest rat like dart while squad followed shouting tumbling over other ix be not game loristan walked slowly up down back sitting room listened to marco who sat by small fire talked go on said whenever boy stopped want to hear be strange lad be splendid game marco be telling story of second third visit to inclosure behind deserted church yard have begun at beginning father have listened with deep interest year later marco recalled evening a thrilling memory a one must never pas away from throughout life must always be able to call back small dingy back room dimness of one poor gas burner be must afford to light iron box pushed into corner with map plan locked safely in erect bearing actual beauty of tall form shabbiness of worn mended clothes must not hide dim not even rag tatter must have made loristan seem insignificant undistinguished be always same eye seemed darker more wonderful than ever in remote thoughtfulness interest a spoke go on said be splendid game be curious have thought out well lad be born soldier be not game to marco said be not game to squad be only playing with be quite different know will never really get what want feel a if be something near said might show map made father look at gave clean copy of rat map of samavia city of melzarr be marked with certain sign be to show at point rat if have be samavian general must have attacked capital a marco pointed out explained rat reason for planning loristan held paper for minute fixed eye on curiously black brow drew together be very wonderful said at last be quite right might have got in there for very reason hit on how did learn think of nothing else now answered marco have always thought of war made plan for battle be not like rest of squad father be nearly always drunk be very well educated when be only half drunk like to talk rat asks question then lead on until find out great deal then begs old newspaper hide in corner listens to what people be saying say lie awake at night thinking out think about day be why got up squad loristan have continued examining paper tell said when refolded handed back that studied map may be proud of may also tell smiled quietly a spoke that in opinion be right iarovitch must have held melzarr to day if have led marco be full of exultation thought must say be right felt sure must be what make want to tell rest hurried on if think be right about rest too stopped awkwardly because of sudden wild thought rushed upon know what will think stammered perhaps will seem to a if game a if part of must must only be game be so fervent in spite of hesitation that loristan began to watch with sympathetic respect a always did when boy be trying to express something be not sure of one of great bond between be that loristan be always interested in boyish mental process in way in thought led to conclusion go on said again be like rat be like have not seemed quite like game to so far sat down at writing table marco in eagerness drew nearer leaned against resting on arm lowering voice though be always habit to speak at pitch that one outside room be in must distinguish what said be rat plan for giving signal for rising said loristan made slight movement doe think there will be rising asked say that must be what secret party have be preparing for year must come soon other nation see that fighting must be put end to even if have to stop if real king be found when rat bought newspaper there be nothing in about where be be only sort of rumor nobody seemed to know anything stopped few second did not utter word be in mind did not say know rat have plan for giving signal loristan said marco forgot first feeling of hesitation began to see plan again a have seen when rat talked began to speak a rat have spoken forgetting that be game made even clearer picture than rat have made of two vagabond boy one of cripple making way from one place to quite free to carry message warning where chose because be so insignificant poor looking that one must think of a anything waif stray belonging to nobody blown about by wind of poverty chance felt a if wanted to convince father that plan be possible one did not quite know why felt so anxious to win approval of scheme a if be real a if must actually be done feeling be what inspired to enter into new detail suggest possibility boy who be cripple one who be only street singer sort of beggar must get almost anywhere said soldier must listen to singer if sang good song might not be afraid to talk before strolling singer cripple must perhaps hear great many thing might be useful for secret party to know might even hear important thing think so before have gone far with story faraway look have fallen upon loristan face look marco have known so well life sat turned little sidewise from boy elbow resting on table forehead on hand looked down at worn carpet at foot so looked a listened to end be a if new thought be slowly growing in mind a marco went on talking enlarging on rat plan did not even look up change position a answered yes think so because of deep growing thought in face marco courage increased first fear that part of planning might seem so bold reckless that must only appear to belong to boyish game gradually faded away for strange reason father have said that first part of rat imaginings have not seemed quite like game to now even now be not listening a if be listening to detail of mere exaggerated fancy be a if thing be hearing be not wildly impossible marco knowledge of continental country of method of journeying helped to enter into much detail give realism to plan sometimes must pretend knew nothing english said then though rat must not understand must must always understand in country know city place must want to go to know how boy like live so must not do anything must make police angry make people notice if one asked question must let believe that have met rat by chance have made up mind to travel together because people gave more money to boy who sang if be with cripple there be boy who used to play guitar in street of rome always have lame girl with one knew be for reason when played people looked at girl be sorry for gave soldi remember yes remember what say be true loristan answered marco leaned forward across table so that came closer to tone in word be said made courage leap like flame to be allowed to go on with boldness be to feel that be being treated almost a if be man if father have wished to stop must have done with one quiet glance without uttering word for wonderful reason did not wish to cease talking be willing to hear what have to say be even interested be growing older have said night have revealed marvelous secret silence be still order be man enough to be told more be man enough to be thought worthy to help samavia in small way even with boyish fancy might contain germ of thought older wiser mind might make useful be being listened to because plan made a part of game be not impossible one if two boy who must be trusted must be found caught deep breath a went on drawing still nearer speaking so low that tone be almost whisper if men of secret party have be working thinking for so many year have prepared everything know by time exactly what must be done by messenger who be to give signal can tell where to go how to know secret friend who must be warned if order must be written given to to one who have who have learned to remember thing have begun to breathe so quickly that stopped for moment loristan looked up looked directly into eye one who have be trained to remember thing said one who have be trained marco went on catching breath again one who doe not forget who must never forget never that one even if be only twelve even if be only ten must go do a be told loristan put hand on shoulder comrade said be speaking a if be ready to go be eye looked bravely straight into said not one word do know what must mean comrade father went on be right be not game be not thinking of a one have thought how must be if something betrayed be set up against wall to be shot marco stood up quite straight tried to believe felt wall against back if be shot must be shot for samavia said for father even a be speaking front door bell rang lazarus evidently opened spoke to one then heard footstep approaching back sitting room open door said loristan marco opened there be boy who be cripple here sir old soldier said asked to see master marco if be rat said loristan bring in here wish to see marco went down passage to front door rat be there be not upon platform be leaning upon old pair of crutch marco thought looked wild strange be white somehow line of face seemed twisted in new way marco wondered if something have frightened if felt ill rat began father have come to tell about father rat broke in without waiting to hear rest voice be a strange a pale face know why have come just wanted to be dead father marco stammered be be dead rat answered shakily told 'd kill have fit died in knew must one of day told so knew must stayed with till be dead then got bursting headache felt sick thought about marco made jump at because saw be suddenly shaking a if be going to fall be just in time lazarus who have be looking on from back of passage came forward together held up be not going to faint said weakly felt a if be be bad fit have to try hold be by people in other attic thought be only drunk must come in be lying on floor there dead come see father marco said will tell do do lazarus help can get on by myself said rat do see crutch did something for pawnbroker last night gave to for pay though tried to speak carelessly have plainly be horribly shaken overwrought queer face be yellowish white still be trembling little marco led way into back sitting room in midst of shabby gloom under dim light loristan be standing in one of still attentive attitude be waiting for be rat boy began rat stopped short rested on crutch staring at tall reposeful figure with widened eye be that father said to marco then added with jerky half laugh be not much like mine be x rat samavia what rat thought when loristan began to speak to marco wondered suddenly stood in unknown world be loristan who made so because poverty shabbiness have power to touch looked at boy with calm clear eye asked practical question gently be plain that understood many thing without asking question at marco thought that perhaps have at time seen drunken men die in life in strange place seemed to know terribleness of night through rat have passed made sit down ordered lazarus to bring hot coffee simple food have have bite since yesterday rat said still staring at how did know have have not have time loristan answered afterward made lie down on sofa look at clothes said rat lie down sleep loristan replied putting hand on shoulder gently forcing toward sofa will sleep long time must tell how to find place where father died will see that proper authority be notified what be doing for rat asked then added sir because be man be boy be terrible thing loristan answered went away without saying more rat lay on sofa staring at wall thinking about until fell asleep before happened marco have quietly left alone so a loristan have told must slept

past day when have shaved morning put on clean shirt to stand even in most battered of tin bath full of clean hot water to splash scrub with big piece of flannel plenty of soap be marvelous thing rat tired body responded to novelty with curious feeling of freshness comfort dare say swell do day muttered 'd do if be swell soldier have to keep so clean shine when after making most of soap water came out of closet under stair be a fresh a marco though clothes have be built for more stalwart body recognition of cleanliness filled with pleasure wondered if by effort must keep clean when went out into world again have to sleep in hole police did not order out of wanted to see marco again wanted more to see tall man with soft dark eye queer look of being swell in spite of shabby clothes dingy

in order coarse linen cloth on table be fresh spotless so be cheap crockery spoon shone with brightness loristan be standing on hearth marco be near be waiting for vagabond guest a if have be gentleman rat hesitated shuffled at door for moment then suddenly occurred to to stand a straight a must salute when found in presence of loristan felt a if ought to do something did not know what

talk with father in middle of night when be in vienna know nothing said marco wo tell said lovely person be sorry for boy may tell after have sat in good little black wine cellar for few hour said man with pointed beard come with put powerful hand on marco shoulder pushed before marco made struggle remembered what father have said about game not being game be game now somehow have strong haughty feeling of not being afraid be taken through hallway toward rear down commonplace flagged step led to basement then be marched through narrow ill lighted flagged passage to door in wall door be not locked stood trifle ajar companion pushed farther open showed part of wine cellar be so dark that be only shelf nearest door that marco must faintly see captor pushed in shut door be a black hole a have described marco stood still in midst of darkness like black velvet guard turned key peasant who came to father in moscow spoke samavian be big men do remember asked from outside know nothing answered marco be young fool voice replied believe know even more than thought father will be greatly troubled when come home will come back to see in few hour if be possible will tell however have have disturbing news might make necessary for to leave house in hurry might not have time to come down here again before leaving marco stood with back against bit of wall remained silent there be stillness for few minute then there be to be heard sound of footstep marching away when last distant echo died be quite silent marco drew long breath unbelievable a may appear be in one sense almost breath of relief in rush of strange feeling have swept over when found facing astounding situation up stair have not be easy to realize what thought really be there be so many of came so fast how must quite believe evidence of eye ear few minute only few minute have changed prettily grateful kindly acquaintance into subtle cunning creature whose love for samavia have be part of plot to harm to harm father what did companion want to do what must do if knew thing be trying to force to tell marco braced back against wall stoutly what will be best to think about first said because one of most absorbingly fascinating thing father talked about together be power of thought human being allow to pas through mind strange strength of when talked of marco felt a if be listening to marvelous eastern story of magic be true in loristan travel have visited far oriental country have seen learned many thing seemed marvel have taught deep thinking have known reasoned through day with men who believed that when desired thing clear exalted thought must bring to have discovered why believed have learned to understand profound argument what believed have taught marco quite simply from childhood be marco with strong boy body thick mat of black hair patched clothes be magician held waved wand wand be own thought when special privation anxiety beset be rule to say what will be best to think about first be marco reason for saying to now a stood in darkness be like black velvet waited few minute for right thing to come to will think of very old hermit who lived on ledge of mountain in india who let father talk to through one night said at last have be wonderful story one of favorite loristan have traveled far to see ancient buddhist what have seen heard during one night have made change in life part of story came back to marco now be word let pas through thy mind son only image thou wouldst desire to see truth meditate only upon wish of thy heart seeing first that can injure man be not ignoble then will take earthly form draw near to thee be law of creates be not afraid marco said aloud will not be afraid in way will get out be image wanted most to keep steadily in mind that nothing must make afraid in way must get out of wine cellar thought of for minute said word over several time felt more like when have done when eye be accustomed to darkness will see if there be little glimmer of light anywhere said next waited with patience seemed for time that saw glimmer at put out hand on side of found that on side of wall against stood there seemed to be shelf perhaps cellar have be used for other purpose than storing of wine if be true there might be somewhere opening for ventilation air be not bad then door have not be shut tightly when man opened be not afraid repeated will not be afraid in way will get out must not allow to stop think about father waiting for return knew must only rouse emotion weaken courage began to feel way carefully along wall reached farther than have thought must cellar be not so very small crept round gradually when have crept round made way across keeping hand extended before setting down foot cautiously then sat down on stone floor thought again what thought be of thing old buddhist have told father that there be way out of place for must somehow find before too long time have passed be walking in street again be while be thinking in way that felt startling thing seemed almost a if something touched made jump though touch be so light soft that be scarcely touch at in fact must not be sure that have not imagined stood up leaned against wall again perhaps suddenness of movement placed at angle have not reached before perhaps eye have become more completely accustomed to darkness for a turned head to listen made discovery above door there be place where velvet blackness be not so dense there be something like slit in wall though a did not open upon daylight upon dark passage be not light admitted so much a lesser shade of darkness even be better than nothing marco drew long breath be only beginning will find way out said will remembered reading story of man who being shut by accident in safety vault passed through such terror before release that believed have spent two day night in place when have be there only few hour thought did that must remember will sit down again begin thinking of picture in cabinet room of art history museum in vienna will take time then there be others said be good plan while must keep mind upon game have helped to pas so many dull hour must think of nothing else a required close attention perhaps a day went on captor must begin to feel that be not safe to run risk of doing thing a desperate a must be might think better of before left house at least in case have learned enough from loristan to realize that only harm must come from letting one mind run wild mind be engine with broken flying gear giant power under control be thing knew have walked in imagination through three of cabinet room be turning mentally into fourth when found starting again quite violently time be not at touch at sound surely be sound be in cellar with be tiniest possible noise ghost of squeak suggestion of movement came from opposite side of cellar side where shelf be looked across in darkness in darkness saw light there must be mistake about be light two light indeed two round phosphorescent greenish ball be two eye staring at then heard sound not squeak time something so homely comfortable that actually burst out laughing be cat purring nice warm cat be curled up on one of lower shelf purring to new born kitten knew there be kitten because be plain now what tiny squeak have be be made plainer by fact that heard much more distinct one then have be asleep when have come into cellar if mother have be awake have probably be very much afraid afterward have perhaps come down from shelf to investigate have passed close to feeling of relief came upon at queer simple discovery be wonderful be so natural comfortable day thing that seemed to make spy criminal unreal only natural thing possible with mother cat purring away among kitten even dark wine cellar be not so black got up kneeled by shelf greenish eye did not shine in unfriendly way must feel that owner of be nice big cat counted four round little ball of kitten be curious delight to stroke soft fur talk to mother cat answered with purring a if liked sense of friendly human nearness marco laughed to be queer what difference make said be almost like finding window mere presence of harmless living thing be companionship sat down close to low shelf listened to motherly purring now then speaking putting out hand to touch warm fur phosphorescent light in green eye be comfort in will get out of of said will not be here very long pus cat be not troubled by fear of being really hungry for time be so used to eating scantily from necessity to passing long hour without food during journey that have proved to that fasting be not after such desperate ordeal a most people imagine if begin by expecting to feel famished by counting hour between meal will begin to be ravenous knew better time passed slowly have known must pas slowly have made up mind not to watch ask question about be not restless boy like father must stand sit lie still now then must hear distant rumbling of cart van passing in street there be certain degree of companionship in also kept place near cat hand where must occasionally touch must lift eye now then to place where dim glimmer of something like light showed perhaps stillness perhaps darkness perhaps purring of mother cat probably three caused thought to begin to travel through mind slowly more slowly at last ceased fell asleep mother cat purred for time then fell asleep xv sound in dream marco slept peacefully for several hour there be nothing to awaken during time at end of sleep be penetrated by definite sound have dreamed of hearing voice at distance a tried in dream to hear what said brief metallic ringing sound awakened outright be over by time be fully conscious at once realized that voice of dream have be real one be speaking still be lovely

sounded also to recall voice have seemed to be part of dream have be real thing then began to try favorite experiment a often tried experiment of commanding mind to go to sleep so frequently experimented on commanding to work for to help to remember to understand to argue about thing clearly reason out for said to now quite naturally calmly show what mean what did come for be certain that be in too great hurry to be able without reason to spare time to come what be reason have said liked then came because liked if liked came to do something be not unfriendly only good thing must do for

be one left that have grudge against there be one now then fell again into silence did not speak until journey be at end a arrived early in day have plenty of time to wander about marvelous little old city through wide street through narrow one under archway into market garden across bridge into square where glockenspiel played old tinkling tune everywhere citadel looked down always rat walked on in dream found hair dresser shop in one of narrow street there be grand shop there particular shop be modest one walked past once then went back be shop so humble that there be nothing remarkable in two common boy going into to have hair cut old man came forward to receive be evidently glad of modest patronage undertook to attend to rat having arranged in chair turned about called to one in back room heinrich said in slit in marco sleeve be sketch of man with smooth curled hair who looked like hair dresser have found corner in to take final look at before turned back to come in heinrich who came forth from small back room have curled hair looked extremely like hair dresser have feature like in sketch nose mouth chin figure be like what marco have drawn committed to memory gave chair tied professional white covering around neck marco leaned back closed eye moment be not man be saying to be not man how knew be not must not have explained felt sure be strong conviction for sudden feeling nothing must have be easier than to give sign if must not give now where be one to whom must be spoken what must be result if one must not be found if there be two who be so much alike how must be sure owner of of pictured face be link in powerful secret chain if link be missed chain must be broken time heinrich came within line of vision recorded feature afresh compared with remembered sketch time resemblance became more close time persistent inner conviction repeated sign be not for be disturbing also to find that rat be at once a restless a have previously be silent preoccupied moved in chair to great discomfort of old hair dresser kept turning head to talk asked marco to translate diver question wished to ask two men be question about citadel about monchsberg residenz glockenspiel mountain added one query to must not sit still young gentleman will get ear snipped said old man to marco will not be fault what will do marco be thinking be not man did not give sign must go away think out though where thought must lead did not know be more difficult problem than have ever dreamed of facing there be one to ask advice of only rat who be nervously wriggling twisting in chair must sit still said to hair dresser be afraid will make cut by accident want to know who life at residenz said rat men can tell thing if ask be done now said old hair dresser with relieved air perhaps cutting of hair make young gentleman nervous be sometimes so rat stood close to marco chair asked question until heinrich also have done work marco must not understand companion change of mood realized that if have wished to give sign have be allowed opportunity must not have given restless questioning have so directed older man attention to son marco that nothing must have be said to heinrich without observing must not have spoken if have be man marco said to very exit from shop seemed little hurried when be fairly in street rat made clutch at marco arm did give whispered breathlessly kept talking talking to prevent marco tried not to feel breathless tried to speak in low level voice with hint of exclamation in why did say that asked rat drew closer to be not man whispered doe matter how much look like be right one be pale swinging along swiftly a if be in hurry let get into quiet place said queer thing have be telling have got hold of how did know how must

from street people reached quiet place where must see mountain there sat down by wayside rat took off cap wiped forehead be not only quick walking have made damp queerness of gave kind of fright said when came out be near enough for to see sudden strong feeling came over seemed a if knew be man then said to myself 'but look like began to get nervous then be sure again then wanted to try to stop from giving sign then seemed foolishness next second thing have told rushed back to at once remembered what have be thinking ever since said 'perhaps be law beginning to work ' palm of hand got moist

partake of supernatural believed quite simply that be working of law not breaking of one gave answer led in quest rat who have known nothing of law other than administered by police court be at once awed fascinated by suggestion of crossing borderland of unknown law of one have baffled overthrown with sweeping away of enmity of passion created war called for army law of earthly living seemed to offer practical benefit if must hold on to enough to work must get everything for nothing a far a can make out have said to marco 'd have to sweep rubbish out of mind sweep a if did with broom then keep on thinking straight believing be going to get thing working for 'd come then have laughed short ugly laugh because recalled something there be something in bible that father used to jeer about

splendor a passed by with marching foot prancing horse glitter of scabbard chain seemed somehow part of music in triumphant burst rat be enormously thrilled by magnificence of imperial place immense space square garden reigned over by statue of emperor warrior queen made feel that thing on earth be possible palace stately pile of architecture whose surmounting equestrian bronze ramped high in air

yes there be good in talking when be tired rat answered trifle gloomily reason straight must 'let go meal be simple ate well without word even when have finished undressed for night said very little where do thought go when be asleep rat inquired casually after be stretched out in darkness must go somewhere let send to find out what to do next be not a still a be on gaisberg can hear city roaring

for hour sometimes wander about looking at place thing gallery museum palace giving up with boyish pleasure eagerness to saw marco be too intimate with thing worth seeing rat too curious feverishly wide awake to allow of missing much rat image of world have grown until seemed to know boundary must hold wealth of wonder wanted to go on on see when marco opened eye in morning found rat lying

marco did wake up feel sure of first thing yes answered rat a sure a if 'd heard say so did said marco be what thought brought back to said rat when 'let go sent off last night sat up hugging knee looking straight before for time after marco did not interrupt meditation day be brilliant one though attic have only one window sun shone in through a ate breakfast after leaned on window ledge talked about prince garden talked about because be place open to public have walked round more than once palace be not large one stood in midst of prince be good natured enough to allow quiet well behaved people to saunter through be not fashionable promenade pleasant retreat for people who sometimes took work book sat on seat placed here there among shrub flower when be there first time noticed two thing marco said there be stone balcony jut out from side of palace look on fountain garden day there be chair on a if prince visitor sometimes sat there near there be very large evergreen shrub saw that there be hollow place inside if one wanted to stay in garden night to watch window when be lighted see if one came out alone upon balcony must hide in hollow place stay there until morning be there room for two inside shrub rat asked must go alone said marco xxv voice in night late afternoon there wandered about garden two quiet inconspicuous rather poorly dressed boy looked at palace shrub flower bed a stranger usually did sat on seat talked a people be accustomed to seeing boy talk together be sunny day exceptionally warm there be more saunterer sitter than usual be perhaps reason why portier at entrance gate gave such slight notice to pair that did not observe that though two boy came in only one went out did not in fact remember when saw rat swing by on crutch at closing time that have entered in company with dark haired lad who walked without aid happened that when rat passed out portier at entrance be much interested in aspect of sky be curiously threatening there have be heavy cloud hanging about day now then blotting out sunshine entirely sun have refused to retire altogether just now however cloud have piled in thunderous purplish mountain sun have be forced to set behind be be sort of battle since morning portier said there will be crash cataract to night be what rat have thought when have sat in fountain garden on seat gave good view of balcony big evergreen shrub knew have hollow in middle though circumference be so imposing if there must be big storm evergreen will not save much though may keep off worst rat said wish there be room for two must have wished there be room for two if have seen marco marching to stake a garden emptied boy rose walked round once more a if on way out by time have sauntered toward big evergreen nobody be in fountain garden last loiterer be moving toward arched stone entrance to street when drew near one side of evergreen two be together when rat swung out on other side of be alone one noticed that anything have happened no one looked back so rat swung down walk round flower bed passed into street portier looked at sky made remark about crash cataract a darkness came on hollow in shrub seemed very safe place be not in least likely that one must enter closed garden if by rare chance servant passed through must not be in search of people who wished to watch night in middle of evergreen instead of going to bed to sleep hollow be well inclosed with greenery there be room to sit down when one be tired of standing marco stood for long time because by doing so must see plainly window opening on balcony if gently pushed aside flexible young bough have managed to discover in first visit to garden that window overlooking fountain garden be belonged to prince own suite of room opened on to balcony lighted favorite apartment contained best loved book picture in spent most of secluded leisure hour marco watched window anxiously if prince have not gone to budapest if be really only in retreat hiding from gay world among treasure must be living in favorite room light must show if there be light might pas before window because since be inclosed in garden need not fear being seen twilight deepened into darkness because of heavy cloud be very dense faint gleam showed in lower part of palace none be lighted in window marco watched waited so long that became evident that none be to be lighted at at last loosed hold on young bough after standing few moment in thought sat down upon earth in midst of embowered tent prince be not in retreat be probably not in vienna rumor of journey to budapest have doubt be true so much time lost through making mistake be best to have made venture not to have made must have be to lose chance entrance be closed for night there be getting out of garden until be opened for next day must stay in hiding place until time when people began to come bring book knitting sit on seat then must stroll out without attracting attention have night before to spend a best must must not matter at must tuck cap under head go to sleep on ground must command to waken once half hour look for light must not go to sleep until be long past midnight so long past that there must not be one chance in hundred that anything must happen cloud made night so dark be giving forth low rumbling growl at interval threatening gleam of light shot across sudden swish of wind rushed through tree in garden happened several time then marco began to hear patter of raindrop be heavy big drop few at first then there be new more powerful rush of wind jagged dart of light in sky tremendous crash after that cloud tore open poured forth content in flood after protracted struggle of day seemed to happen at once a if horde of huge lion have at one moment be let loose flame after flame of lightning roar crash sharp report of thunder shriek of hurricane wind torrent of rain a if tidal wave of sky have gathered rushed burst upon earth be such storm a people remember for lifetime in few lifetime be seen at marco stood still in midst of rage flooding blinding roar of after first few minute knew must hing to shield down garden path heard cataract rushing held cap pressed against eye because seemed to stand in midst of darting flame crash cannon report thunderings jagged stream of light came so close to one that seemed deafened a well a blinded wondered if must ever be able to hear human voice again when be over that be drenched to skin that water poured from clothes a if be cataract be so small detail that be scarcely aware of stood still bracing body waited if have be samavian soldier in trench storm have broken upon comrade must only have braced waited be what found thinking when tumult downpour be at worst there be men who have waited in midst of rain of bullet be not long after thought have come to that there occurred first temporary lull in storm fury perhaps reached height broke at moment yellow flame have torn jagged way across heaven earth rending crash have thundered into rumbling actually died away before breaking forth again marco took cap from eye drew long breath drew two long breath be a began drawing third realizing strange feeling of almost stillness about that heard new kind of sound at side of garden nearest hiding place sounded like creak of door opening somewhere in wall behind laurel hedge one be coming into garden by private entrance pushed aside young bough again tried to see darkness be too dense yet must hear if thunder must not break again there be sound of foot on wet gravel footstep of more than one person coming toward where stood not a if afraid of being heard merely a if be at liberty to come in by what entrance chose marco remained very still sudden hope gave shock of joy if man with tired face chose to hide from acquaintance might choose to go in out by private entrance footstep drew near crushing wet gravel passed by seemed to pause somewhere near balcony flame lit up sky again thunder burst forth once more be last great peal storm be at end only fainter fainter rumbling muttering paler paler dart followed even be soon over cataract in path have rushed silent darkness be still deep be deep to blackness in hollow of evergreen marco stood in streaming with rain feeling nothing because be full of thought pushed aside greenery kept eye on place in blackness where window must be though must not see seemed that waited long time knew only seemed so really began to breathe quickly because be waiting for something suddenly saw exactly where window be because be lighted feeling of relief be great did not last very long be true that something have be gained in certainty that man have not left vienna what next must not be so easy to follow if chose only to go out secretly at night what next to spend rest of night watching lighted window be not enough to morrow night might not be lighted kept gaze fixed upon tried to fix will thought power on person inside room perhaps must reach make listen even though must not know that one be speaking to knew that thought be strong thing if angry thought in one man mind will create anger in mind of why must not sane message cross line must speak to must speak to found saying in low intense voice be outside here waiting must speak to said many time kept eye fixed upon window opened on to balcony once saw man figure cross room must not be sure who be last distant rumbling of thunder have died away cloud be breaking be not long before dark mountainous billow broke apart brilliant full moon showed sailing in rift suddenly flooding everything with light part of garden be silver white tree shadow be like black velvet silvery lance pierced even into hollow of marco evergreen struck across face perhaps be sudden change attracted attention of inside balconied room man figure appeared at long window marco saw now that be prince opened window stepped out on to balcony be over said quietly stood with face lifted looking at great white sailing moon stood very still seemed for moment to forget world be wonderful triumphant queen of moon something brought back to earth low strong clear boy voice came up to from garden path below lamp be lighted lamp be lighted said word sounded almost a if one be uttering prayer seemed to call to to arrest to draw stood still few second in dead silence then bent over balustrade moonlight have not broken darkness below be boy voice said in low tone can not see who be speaking yes be boy voice answered in way somehow moved because be so ardent be son of stefan loristan lamp be lighted wait be coming down to prince said in few minute marco door open gently not far from where stood then man have be following so many day appeared at side how long have be here asked before gate closed hid in hollow of big shrub there highness marco answered then be out in storm yes highness prince put hand on boy shoulder can not see be best to stand in shadow be drenched to skin have be able to give highness sign marco whispered storm be nothing there be silence marco knew that companion be pausing to turn something over in mind so o said slowly at length lamp be lighted be sent to bear sign something in voice made marco feel that be smiling what race be what race samavian loristans paused a if to think thing over again want to see face said next here be tree with shaft of moonlight striking through branch let step aside stand under marco did a be told shaft of moonlight fell upon uplifted face showed young strength darkness quite splendid for moment in triumphant glow of joy in obstacle overcome raindrop hung on hair did not look draggled only very wet picturesque have reached man have given sign prince looked over with interested curiosity yes said in cool rather dragging voice be son of stefan loristan also must be taken care of must come with have trained household to remain in own quarter until require service have attached to own apartment

companion crossed room stood beside speaking in lowered voice marco must not at first hear what said stood quite still waiting white haired man lifted head listened seemed a though almost at once be singularly interested lowered voice be slightly raised at last marco heard last two sentence only son of stefan loristan look at old man in chair turned slowly looked steadily with questioning curiosity touched with grave surprise have keen clear blue eye then marco still erect silent waited again prince have merely said to old man whom might interest to see have plainly intended that whatsoever happened must make outward sign of seeing more than have be told must see old man be for to show astonishment recognition have be brought here not to see to be seen power of remaining still under scrutiny rat have often envied stood now in good stead because have seen white head tall form not many day before surmounted by brilliant emerald plume hung with jeweled decoration in royal
