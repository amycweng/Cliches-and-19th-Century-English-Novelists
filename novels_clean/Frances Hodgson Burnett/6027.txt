scrubbing brush did not dislike excitement of work before judith certainty that must not be missed made clear before if absence be observed mother must realize that whole house lay open to that be undisturbing element wheresoever be led either by fancy by circumstance if went into parlour must probably sit talk to play quietly with shabby doll in case must be finding pleasure of own must touch nothing must be harmed when child found in entrance hall stopped few moment to look about stillness seemed to hold paused to hear feel in leaving basement behind have left movement of living behind

of window drew blind up so that look of place might be clear to there be two window opened upon flat roof of extension suggested somehow that have be used a place to walk about in at least be what judith thought of at once that one who have used room have be in habit of going out upon roof staying there a if have be sort of garden there be row of flower pot with dead flower in there be green tub containing large shrub be dead also against low parapet certain of held climbing plant have be trained upon two have be climbing rose two be clematis judith did not know by name ledge of window be so low that mere step took outside so taking stood among dried withered thing looked in tender regret at wish be not dead said softly to silence must be like garden if be not dead sun be hot cool little breeze seemed straying up from among tree of park even made dried leaf of flower tremble rustle little involuntarily lifted face to blue sky floating white cloud seemed so near that felt almost a if must touch with hand street seemed so far so far below whole world seemed far below if one stepped off parapet must surely take one long time to reach earth knew now why have come up here be so that might feel like a if be upheld far away from thing a if have left everything behind almost a if have fallen awake again there be perfume in air be still sweet clear suddenly turned went into room

beautifully dressed in white lace eye closed little wreath of dead flower in hair look almost a if have died too said judith did not ask why said a if have died too perhaps be because place be so

little garden be bright full of leaf flower be life said to judith judith nodded smiled back at understanding quite well just a have understood eye of bird who have swung on twig so near cheek day have hidden among bush in park now must go little girl said at last judith went out of room at once without waiting looking back though knew white figure did not stir till be out of sight be not until have reached second floor that change came upon be great change curious one closed room became a far away a other place thing have seemed when have stood upon roof feeling nearness of blueness white cloud a when have looked round found face to face with child in closed room suddenly realized thing have not known before knew that have heard voice when little girl spoke to knew that have happened that be only who have lifted doll who have taken out toy who have arranged low table for feast putting small service upon though have played with such rapturous enjoyment have laughed feasted what
