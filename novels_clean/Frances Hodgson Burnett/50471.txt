thrill of being fairy story be realso real that one must read about in newspaper everybody be talking about even aunt matilda neighbor work hand on farm to two lonely child in high nest in straw stack seemed curious thing to hear people in world below talk about in ordinary everyday way without excitement awe a if be new kind of big ploughing winnowing machine to be thing so beautiful that must scarcely find word to express thought dream about yet be never alone together without trying to do so on wet cheerless day in huddled close together in nest to keep from being chilled be comfort to try to imagine paint picture of various wonder until in interest forgot dampness of air felt unending patter of rain drop on barn roof merely pleasant sort of accompaniment to story of fancy since day when have listened to jones jerry joking down below in barn rob have formed habit of collecting scrap of newspaper relating to wonder cut paragraph out of aunt matildas cast aside newspaper begged from farm hand from country store keeper anything in form of illustration held a treasure beyond price hoarded to bring to meg with exultant joy how pored over thing reading paragraph again again until knew almost by heart how studied picture trying to gather proportion color of column dome arch what enthusiast living in chicago knew marvel a did so dwelt on revelled in beauty one knew of pleasure like straw parlor be secret strangeness of life lay in fact that absolutely one knew anything about at asked anything thinking quite sufficient that friendlessness be supplied with enough animal heat nourishment to keep body alive of other part of themtheir restless growing young brain naturally craving heart in own poor enough still human little home have at least be recognized cared foraunt matilda knew nothing indeed have never given thought to have not undertaken care of intelligence affection own be not of order to require supervision be too much occupied with thousand acre farm amazing thing be doing with that child must read write understood arithmetic knew have learned no more have found enough to build fortune upon have never known what be to feel lonely neglected because be person quite free from affection quite enough for never suspected that others must suffer from weakness of knew nothing because have never touched if one have told that two child who ate plentiful rough meal at table among field hand servant be neglected lonely that dim knowledge of burned in childish mind must have thought announcement piece of idle sentimental folly that solid detail of farming be fact more real than one be grievous truth when be at home be meg summing up of situation at least belonged to somebody be poor wore clothes long time have shabby shoe couldnt go on excursion have little bench by fire father mother used to talk to let read book paper try to teach thing dont know what be going to be when grew up be going to do sort of work know a much a father mother did dont know whether be great deal not be something be enough to teach school said robin if be not so far out in country now believe aunt matilda must let go to school if asked wouldnt cost

said to myself robin be just like live just like eat food go to bed get up again eat more food dont learn anything more than do be not worth a much to anybody be not even worth killing at christmas if have never known other life if nature have not given big questioning eye square little jaw strong nervous little fist might have be content to sink into careless idleness apathy one be actively unkind to have straw parlor be free to amuse a chose have be made of material of world worker be built young heart be full of restlessness longing whose full significance did not comprehend wonder working in world beyond themthis huge beautiful marvel planned by human brain carried out by mere human hand great thing with world seemed to to be throbbing seemed to set limit to prove that there be limit to power of human will mindsthis filled with passion of restlessness yearning greater than have ever known before be enchanted thing know robinits enchanted thing meg said one day looking up from study of newspaper clipping magazine with picture in seems like said robin im sure enchanted meg went on seems so tremendous that people must think must do such huge thing a if felt a if must do anything bring anything from anywhere in world almost frightens sometimes because reminds of tower of babel dont remember how people got so proud that thought must do anything began to build tower be to reach to heaven then woke up one morning found be speaking different language must not understand other suppose everybody be suddenly struck like morning nowi mean fair people widening eye with little shiver wont be said rob thing have stopped happening yes have said meg sometimes wish hadnt if hadnt perhapsperhaps if made burnt offering might be taken by miracle to see world fair havent anything to burn said rob rather gloomily weve got chicken meg answered a gloomily do good miracle be over world be different said robin have to do miracle will be miracle meg said if ever get away from aunt matildas world live like people instead of like pig who be comfortableand will have to perform there be one else said robin see there be one else in world threw out hand clutched meg be lying in straw near did not know why clutched ithe did not in least know why did know why queer sound in voice suddenly made feel unfriendedness in way overwhelmed found looking at with hard lump rising in throat be one of rainy day hollow drumming patter of big drop on roof seemed somehow to shut in with loneliness away from world strange thing said almost under breath to be two child only just twelve year old to be quite by ourselves in big world where there be such million million of people busy doing thing making great plan none of knowing about caring what be going to do if work miracle ourselves said rob holding hand quite tight will be better than having worked for megas if be beginning new subjectmeg what answered still feeling hard lump in throat do think be going to stay here always ioh robin
