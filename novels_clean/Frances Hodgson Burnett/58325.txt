specimen tredennis own acquaintance with young relative be not very intimate one too many interest presented on side to allow of devoting specially to one father favorite scarcely took form of interest have not leisure to discover that be fully worth discovering regarded simply a large rather serious young man who without seeming stupid listened rather than talked yet be not actually

get same effect ca wear down after be 'out ' said bertha reflectively have got beyond a suppose will get beyond frivolity turned to glass looked at quite simply with soft little air of seriousness be very bewitching regarded in manner for several second then began slowly to dress hair plaiting into soft thick plait fastened closely simply at nape of pretty neck believe will try not to be quite so

doubtfully at something held in hand entered so quietly that started on becoming conscious of presence wore dress have not seen before pale gray soft in material very simply made with little lace

tribe devoted five page of closely written paper to proof research into subject scientific reason for truth of assertion made be clear by mean uninteresting professor never be uninteresting be generally correct tredennis read argument carefully with respect even with occasional thrill a remembered how communication usually terminated be exception to general rule at bottom of fifth page signed sincere friend nathan herrick have said nothing about bertha not word said tredennis never did so before what doe mean not word have scarcely finished speaking before saw that on back of last page postscript be written brief one three word without comment bertha be married for few moment tredennis sat still stared at glass across room reflected very little change in face immovable look became trifle more immovable if anything there be scarcely stirring of muscle at length moved slowly folding letter carefully returning to envelope in exactly fold have lain in when took out after

luxurious one prettiness luxury wearing air of being result of natural growth suggesting oppressiveness of upholstery comfort be evidently outcome of fancy desire of who lounged read talked in knick knack folly be indicative of charming whim carried out with delightful freedom from reason be own excuse in open fireplace bright wood fire burned upon white wolf skin before richard amory lay at unconventional full length with hand clasped lightly under head evidently enjoying to utmost ease of position glow of fire jest of moment while near in easy chair sat arbuthnot of looked at bertha who stood with one hand resting on low mantel have be waiting for long time tredennis heard say then a servant announced name again stopped speaking came forward to meet while richard sprang lightly to

about great lady will add to interest said tredennis have great lady in washington be infinitely to credit that be only occasional incident answered that often last long when one considers number of quiet domesticated woman who find launched suddenly by wave of chance into whirl of public life one naturally wonder that be not afflicted with very great lady indeed must be confessed have far le to complain of in respect than might be expected particular great lady said tredennis be one of occasional incident one said that society be led by bewildered european astonished american american astonished to find suddenly bearing responsibility of highest position european bewildered by being called upon to adjust to startling novelty in manner custom great lady be one of astonished american privately be very much astonished indeed arbuthnot laughed will observe commented that mr amory remark be entirely unbiassed by feminine prejudice will observe said bertha that mr arbuthnot remark be entirely unbiassed by prejudice in favor of reliability of statement added with delusive air of amiable candor be sure can not deny be very civil to have not doubt of responded arbuthnot mind adding must like to have be there to see colonel tredennis will judge said whether must have be really worth while will make story brief last season great lady gave cause to remember have not met to please

richard must make most successful little lobbyist in world bertha turned upon incredulous rather bewildered smile exclaimed yes well replied after second pause given to inspection of be open derision be perfectly true be response be true for good reason strength must lie in very fact that must be entirely unlike co laborer in field have finished little air of ingenuousness must be fortune shook head with pretty gesture said be very clever of course can not help observing be not clever enough for that gave glance at once curious admiring by jove exclaimed be belief be clever enough for

office having fancy to stroll through lafayette park be looking best in spring bravery bloom on entering iron gate way found attention attracted by large figure of colonel tredennis who be approaching from opposite direction walking slowly appearing deeply abstracted can not be said that mr arbuthnot felt special delight in prospective encounter have not felt that have advanced greatly in colonel tredennis good opinion have must be confessed resigned to unfortunate condition of affair without making particular effort to remedy private impression being that result must scarcely be likely to pay for exertion taking into consideration fact that be constitutionally averse to exertion why have said to bertha must waste vital energy in endeavoring to persuade man be what want when perhaps be not there be score of people who will naturally please better than do there be people enough who please better than doe let take choice be easy enough to see be not choice what be thinking of now wonder said vague plan for turning into walk flitting through mind be friend piute on war path actively engaged in dissecting agent be simply out of humor be not thinking of where be going will walk over nursemaid obliterate twin yes thought so colonel have verified prophecy aroused from reverie by devastation have caused came to stand still with perplexed distressed countenance beg pardon arbuthnot heard say in great deep voice hope did not hurt have forgotten where be stooped set nearest twin on foot on grass then did same thing for other upon stood stared at not being hurt at having merely rolled over on sod be in sufficiently good spirit to regard with interest fact that be fumbling in coat pocket for something article in question be package of bonbon produced gave to nearest toddler here said bought for little girl can get more be right added turning to mulatto girl whose admiration of martial bearing revealed in most lenient grin wo hurt can eat without being harmed then turned away in doing so caught sight of arbuthnot somewhat to surprise of latter advanced toward at once with evident intention of joining be rather curious thing must meet here said be thinking of when met with catastrophe saw just now do often go home way not very often arbuthnot replied sometimes when thing look a do now with gesture indicating brilliant verdure everything look very fresh luxuriant said tredennis season be unusually far advanced suppose be sometimes great deal too warm to be pleasant will be decidedly warmer day said arbuthnot will have trying summer president be going out to soldier home next week be earlier than usual there be only two three of senator family left in city exodus began week ago such weather a have have last few day said colonel with slight frown must be very exhausting to who be not strong who have gone through gay winter best thing such people can do responded arbuthnot dryly be to make way to mountain sea a soon a possible most of do tredennis ' reply be characteristically abrupt mr amory doe not said answered arbuthnot looked at end of cigar a if saw nothing else why doe demanded tredennis ought to said arbuthnot with calm adroitness ought to tredennis repeated must have gone month ago be actually ill why in heaven name doe stay told two week since be going to fortress monroe such place have better go to new england farm house wear muslin gown swing in hammock said arbuthnot see that a well do said colonel why tell so having said seemed to pull up suddenly a if felt have be unconsciously impetuous arbuthnot laughed smile have died completely away however when gave side glance at companion face moment later be quite serious in intention of going away two week ago said told so nothing richard dinner party prevented departure in first place spoke in entirely non committal tone there be touch of interest in quiet glance at tredennis dined there with planefield rest did added yes did richard be kind enough to invite must only have be in way paused instant then added without change of tone manner know nothing of westoria land be necessary that must said tredennis did not oh arbuthnot answered knew must discus bill a plea amory to be interested in just now remember that matter be referred to several time said tredennis even mr amory seemed to know good deal of good deal said arbuthnot in favor of bill yes tredennis answered have be reading up appeared said very good thing about in laughing way why doe waste time strength on such folly added hotly why why be allowed to do new england farm must be better for just now said arbuthnot again adroitly why must amory waste time upon colonel went on though be affair of course not mine have reached gate by time did not pas through finding near turned a if by mutual consent yet without speaking of doing so into walk nearest be after taking few step in silence down path colonel tredennis spoke again abruptly when be thinking of just before met said be thinking of in connection with with amorys knew statement have blunt enough sound recognition of irritated be beginning to be accustomed to own bluntness of statement at rate led to point meant to reach arbuthnot reply be characteristic be not blunt at have air of simple directness be result not only of most creditable tact far sightedness of more private good feeling sincerity than be usually credited with be always glad to be thought of in connection with amorys said be glad that be perfectly natural must be connected with in mind of friend there have be very close connection between for

believe be when there be ten chance to one that be not at generally be said bertha trouble be that perhaps be not thinking exactly what must like best though will never tell so must not discover from manner have adorable manner be soft well bred never waste remember said tredennis thought very attractive bertha turned more directly toward be exactly what must like said exactly when said just now

yes be colonel tredennis who must be congratulated be chiefly of agnes sylvestre talked during rest of evening be person who say very little of herself be bertha comment there be great deal to say of so there seemed to be there be anecdote to be related of charm of beauty manner be to be analyzed of attribute be found worth touching upon be tredennis who took departure first when rose to go bertha who be talking to arbuthnot did not at first observe movement when approached turned with involuntary start be going now said yes answered wish pleasant summer rest require stood up gave hand thank replied will be sure to have rest scarcely seemed more than ordinary conventional parting for night to tredennis seemed something there be only few word more dropped hand went out of room have certainly felt that be last only powerful effort of will held in check feeling whose strength must have be loath to acknowledge such thing be always wrench said mentally never bore well have barely said when heard bertha cross parlor quickly pas through door have bent to take up paper have left on hat stand when turned be close to something in look be so unusual that recognized with inward start eye be little dilated breath came with soft quickness a if have moved rapidly impulsively put out hand with simple sudden gesture with action a simple unpremeditated took held in own came said to say good by again at once seemed to to realize that must be month before saw again so many thing happen stopped second went on after when come back said will be well strong like new person say good by to

wished to hide have driven from room within have come to for momentary refuge because be near looked up at for second with touch of desperation in eye then saw get over spoke jack janey will miss very much said have be very kind to think be way to be good to one opportunity of being good have be limited said if if one must present held hand little closer wo let miss chance will there be reason for saying so much of course will try to remember that be here always ready to come when be called yes said think must come if called thank very much good by good by drew hand away stood with hanging clasped before a if meant to steady so stood until be gone be breathing quickly when reached street yes said professor be right be arbuthnot be arbuthnot chapter xiv when passed house next day be gone nursery window be thrown open fancied that place wore deserted look very street seemed empty glare of sunshine whose heat increased with hour added to air of desolateness imagined be imagination said feeling will die away more quickly because recognize unreality of by to morrow day after will have got over yet week later when dropped in upon professor one sultry evening to spend hour with old friend found cause for anxious inspection of what said hot weather begin to tell on already be not acclimatized yet be must spare a much a possible doe promise well that look fagged so soon must say have not slept well sleep well tredennis answered be working too hard said professor be perhaps be not working hard enough replied tredennis with slight knitting of brow wish have more to do leisure doe not agree with one must occupy one self said professor spoke half absently yet with touch of significance in tone combined with fact that have heard word before caused tredennis to glance at quickly smiled slightly in answer to glance bertha said oh yes be quoting bertha manner be not a light a hers reminded of in way perhaps because have letter from to day be in thought hope be well said tredennis doe not find farm house too dull doe not complain of professor answered say nothing of own health tell be little anxious about janey who doe not seem quite tredennis looked out into darkening street be sitting by opened window be not well when went away said trifle abstractedly janey asked professor a if idea be new to did not know that tredennis roused be thinking of bertha said oh of bertha said professor then lapsed into reverie for few moment seemed to watch tree on street without seeing be not well said at length think will be better when come back rest quiet began tredennis think have determined to be better said professor determined repeated tredennis have strong will returned professor though be thing be never suspected of doe not suspect herself of yet have relied upon strength from first be relying upon now be convinced that went away with determination to conquer restlessness whose significance be just awakening to deliberately chose nature society of child a best mean of cure do think asked tredennis in low voice that will get over professor turned to look at know answered with slight tone of surprise why did fancy must seem to understand said tredennis professor sighed have studied so long replied that imagine know what be doing ca safely go beyond with woman ca say what be going to do with degree of certainty be absorbingly interesting a study be not to be relied on rarely compliment intelligence by doing what expect of have not done what expected have lived longer than thought must without finding out year ago believed that have proved to herself that emotion a a be impossible to be very innocent belief be entirely sincere in congratulated upon turned to tredennis again with sudden movement curious look of pain in face be afraid be great mistake said what tredennis asked feeling said in tremulous troubled voice mean in alone in one everywhere be not sure that ever brings happiness really in end be afraid there always be end if there be might be different be afraid there be there be of who try to believe there be none be afraid be happiest who lose ideal there be many who lose even fate have done worst by checked sank back in chair ah said smiling half sadly be old man old man be old man fancy that best thing in life be death fate did not do worst by left ideal have gray eye added bright face like bertha perhaps after if have won what wanted must not feel so old to night so tired face be very bright have not be wholly well for day to night seemed fatigued by heat languor in air be somewhat more hopeful when spoke of bertha than have be have confidence in strength of will said like pride courage doe not give away to emotion resents fiercely refuse to acknowledge power over insists to herself that restlessness be nervousness sadness morbid said a much to said tredennis did exclaimed professor be good sign show that have confidence in that be feeling strong enough to induce to use a defence against own weakness must never have spoken if have not believed that be sort of stronghold be old feeling of girlhood ruling again thank heaven for there be ring at front door bell a spoke moment so later be answered by servant buoyant foot be heard in hall paused second on threshold be here professor one inquired may come in professor herrick turned head come in richard said come in by mean amory entered advanced toward slight depression of manner tredennis have fancied have seen in on last two occasion of meeting have disappeared altogether seemed even in gayer spirit than usual have come to tell said to professor be going away for short time be matter of business connected with westoria land may be away week two be rather long journey asked professor oh replied with air of being daunted by prospect tiresome one be important must make will not be alone who be to be companion planefield be rather entertaining fellow in way planefield oh wo be so bad on whole be planefield who be interested in land if remember rightly suggested professor oh planefield richard replied carelessly well more le be given to interesting in thing by jove added with laugh promise to be good thing to be interested in must mind if dear richard interposed professor allow to advise not to do so will really find best such thing rarely end well richard laughed again dear professor answered with much good humor may rely upon have money of own if have money said professor think must risk really do though why must say risk hardly know there be scarcely enough risk to make exciting be very sanguine once twice became quite brilliant on subject great railroad be to give land enormous value be almost established fact everything be being laid in train man influenced here touch given there vigorous move made in direction interest awakened in thing be done there be doubt of termination said not doubt be brilliant sort of thing be own impetus one might say right men be at work for right wom be going to say woman asked tredennis when pulled up somewhat abruptly well yes richard said blithely after why not must confess to finding fact lend color vivacity to thing delightful cleverness clever one show be marvellous power for against thing though think feminine tendency be to work for thing not against must like to know said tredennis how begin for moment thought did not know why asked question self delusion did not last long felt instant later that did know wished that did not in nine case out of ten richard replied giving up at once to enjoyable analysis of subject in nine case out of ten be impression begin with almost entire lack of serious intention rarely if ever even in end admit to that have done what be accused of given clever pretty woman whose husband other male relative need assistance why must be le clever pretty in society of one political dignitary than in of whose admiration of charm may not be of such importance suppose be beginning then come sense of power fascination of excitement what woman doe not like what woman be better more charming than bertha bertha doe not hesitate to admit in own delightful way that there must have be fascination in life of historical charmer before whom prime minister trembled who must make unmake cabinet with smile be thought leaped into tredennis ' mind do begin to compare bertha with king favorite did not say aloud be not for to defend against husband lightness be not own word after so must only sit silent in shadow of darkening corner knit heavy brow with hot resentment in heart while richard went on there be few who make profession of said carry most power woman who be ambitious for husband eager for son who wish to escape from find refuge in absorbing excitement necessarily be more powerful than more sordid element if be going in for kind of thing went on settling in favorite graceful lounging posture throwing arm lightly behind head if be going in for might make deliberate choice think must choose woman who have something to forget woman who have reached emotional crisis who be young yet who must not take refuge in girlish forgetfulness who in spite of youth have lived beyond trusting in future woman who represented beauty wit despair despair must be strongest lever of there be doubt of that woman taken at turning point in existence must move world if like world arranged trifle more comfortably half laughed again suggested professor be not going in for sort of thing dear richard oh answered richard if be must confess must have fascination for must not permit of regarding in cold blood be like bertha know like little drama speaking of bertha said professor if anything must happen while be away now really said richard show what careless fellow be do know never once occurred to that anything must happen have such admirable record to look back upon bertha though think usually refer fact to bertha tact executive ability nothing ever have happened feel that have established precedent if anything must happen have better telegraph to merritsville in ordinary event however feel quite safe in leaving bertha in hand tredennis said smiling at large shadow in corner one be always sure in midst of ruling frivolity that tredennis be to be relied on went away soon after tredennis bidding professor good night left house with a passed down step richard put arm through companion with caressing friendliness must do harm to take run up into virginia once in while said have be losing ground since heat set in ca submit to need muscular development in highest form a example to modern deterioration kill two bird with one stone when have day leisure go see bertha child lay in new supply of delightful robustness envy admire must be glad to see bertha said tredennis must be glad to see richard answered while be away will be relief to to feel that have to call upon in case of need professor dear old fellow be not a strong a be a said before one naturally take liberty of relying upon silent substantiality thank said tredennis if be matter of avoirdupois richard turned quickly to look at ah said not that though being human respect avoirdupois be something else know upon word ca exactly say what something make man feel instinctively that can shift responsibility upon will be in good hand perhaps be not enviable quality in one self after here be see shifting bertha child off on shoulder if can be of use to bertha child why not said tredennis tersely oh one might also say 'why returned richard have claim on really yet do rather do speaks more strongly for generosity trustworthiness will be away tredennis began two three week might be more think not separate here think a be going to drop in on planefield good night thanks good night responded tredennis shook hand parted chapter xv during hot day night of next few week tredennis found life rather dreary affair gradually familiar face met on avenue became fewer fewer house knew one after assumed air of summer desertion offering a only evidence of life occasional colored servant sunning on step crowd of nursery maid with charge thinned out in park freshness of leaf be lost under coating of dust while countenance of for whom there be prospect of relief expressed languid sense of injury patience of despair after tredennis said on two three occasion a sat in one of park in evening after suppose most of have object adding last two word with faint smile be obliged to confess to that of late found that work have regarded a object have ceased to satisfy gave attention to with stern persistence refused to spare when found attention wandering even undertook additional labor writing in moment of leisure several notable article upon various important question of day yet have time left to hang heavily on hand fill with weariness at last there came evening when after sitting in one of park until lamp be lighted rose suddenly from seat spoke a if to silence shadow about why must try to hide truth from myself said be too late for may a well face like man bear like one many brave fellow have carried bullet in body down to grave seldom winced be something like suppose only pain drew sharp hard breath walked away down deserted path without ending sentence made struggle after to resist one poor temptation beset daily temptation to pas through street in stood familiar house with drawn blind closed door sometimes when rose in morning be so filled with unreasoning yearning for sight of blankness that be overwhelmed by went out before breakfasted be weakness self indulgence must say be very little thing can hurt one be only little thing after found piteous pleasure at at first tried to smile at before long ceased even to try to smile in slow walk down street on must see window remember day when have caught glimpse of bertha through night have spent in room within when have be gayer than usual quieter when have given new wound perhaps when have half healed old one in mood of relenting have not understood there be reason why must understand woman be simple thought why must understand unless chose to let be like other woman be quite sure of in thought of found word act of hers worth remembering even repeating mentally again again for sake of magnetic grace belonged only to never once occurred to that own deep sympathy tender fancy might brighten did when speaks thought how dullest of stir listen when move across room how natural be to turn look at be interested in what be going to do what life have seen put in poor awkward wretch by only seating near speaking to of common thing one doe not know what gift be whether be well for ill that be given one see in simplest thing doe be hard to avoid giving up to such thought a when most needed refuge from always sought in society of professor so there be few evening when did not spend hour so with friendship grew waxed strong until there must scarcely have be closer bond between about two week after richard amory departure making call later than usual one evening met coming down step mr arbuthnot who stopped with usual civility to shake hand with be week since have crossed other path colonel said scrutinizing rather closely in meantime be afraid have not be well amory called attention to fact short time ago responded tredennis so did professor so perhaps there be truth in have noticed will presently assure said arbuthnot still regarding with air of interest perhaps washington doe agree with have heard of people who must stand usually called malaria think there be generally something checked somewhat abruptly be rather unusual demonstration on part a be habit to weigh speech with laudable care deliberation be going to see professor inquired yes answered tredennis idea be presenting to mind that there be suggestion of something unusual in questioner manner that be not so entirely serene a be customary that there be even hint of inward excitement strong enough to be repressed only by effort consciousness of impressed upon even while flow of light talk went on arbuthnot smiled at from upper step have be to see professor too be saying felt be something of audacity invitation to have always be of most general nature thought must take liberty of pretending fancied regarded seriously be very good to exhibited wonderful presence of mind in not revealing that be surprised to see tried not to stay long enough to tire be sufficiently amiable to ask to come again evidently appreciated desolation of circumstance be finding dull said tredennis dull repeated arbuthnot yes think might call dull people who kindly condescend to notice in winter have gone away dress coat be packed in camphor have ceased to be useful even if fate have permitted to be ornamental where must air charm there seems really reason why must exist until next winter when may be useful again receive in return modicum of entertainment to be merely superior young man in department be not remunerative in summer a one cease to glean result of one superiority at present might a well be inferior dance talk sing be utterly incapacitated by nature for carrying wrap picking up handkerchief can not disport at watering place of rich great on salary of hundred dollar month must only get sordid beonth leave ' if thing be possible have be dull myself said tredennis hesitantly if must ever occur to to drop in see fellow sufferer said arbuthnot must relieve monotony of lot at least might awaken in generous emotion tredennis looked up at never have occurred to so far see be arbuthnot light reply to look if must resist impulse can assure be laudable one humble apartment have advantage of comparative coolness when tredennis entered library found professor sitting in usual summer seat near window newspaper lay open on knee be not reading seemed indeed to have fallen into reverie of rather puzzling kind did meet one a came in asked of tredennis a soon a have exchanged greeting met mr arbuthnot tredennis answered stopped few moment on step to talk to have be entertaining for last hour said professor taking off glass beginning to polish now will tell asked with quiet air of reflective inquiry into interesting subject will tell why come to entertain gave impression answered tredennis that object in coming be that might entertain added that be very good to appeared to have enjoyed call very much that be way responded professor impartially most agreeable way be to be born with way a natural heritage be to be social millionnaire worst of be that may be gift entirely apart from moral substantial virtue bertha have know where got not from not from poor mother say may be apart from moral substantial virtue say always be have at made up mind what attribute go along with in arbuthnot case must like to decide must be agreeable way in criminal of deepest dye be certainly agreeable that must in subtle manner be able to place in picturesque attitude of dignified entertaining host did entertain at added simply sat listened to be frequently well worth listening to commented tredennis be well worth listening to evening said professor yet be light enough have two three english periodical under arm one of be 'punch found laughing quite heartily over then there be something about new comic opera seemed to know libretto by heart ran over air so on piano have be reading new book be rather clever about in way of course still be cleverness then went to piano again sang captivating little love song very well after got up said good night on whole regretted liked picture liked opera liked talk of book liked little love song how must know that old dry bone must like tender little ballad be touched by pleased because sentiment be discovered pandered to oh be old story be way be way be beginning to think said tredennis slowly that 'his way might be called sympathy good feeling fine tact if one wanted to be specially fair to professor looked up rather quickly thought did not like said tredennis paused moment looking down at carpet a if deliberating think do said at length be fault of fault lie in have way be at disadvantage with be never at loss be be ready witted possessed be slow rigid suppose be human must try to imagine at time be at disadvantage only because virtue be more solid than be not more solid be only more clumsy le available spare said professor why must spare said tredennis knitting brow after never spare know better must be just to why must let place at disadvantage again by being unjust to why must insist that only good quality be be unornamental be popular fallacy like to believe be very easy to suspect man of being willow because be sure be deep be unlike arbuthnot 'this arbuthnot ' interposed professor with smile be curious enough to hear entering upon defence of 'this arbuthnot ' like philip like like said tredennis when be compared with like tendency discover in tendency to disparage must like to be fair to find difficult upon word said professor be rather fine in to make effort giving one of old admiring look be always rather fine philip must be finer sir said tredennis coloring if be not effort said professor quietly must not be half so fine put out hand let rest upon arm of chair in tredennis sat so rested a long a talk went on in meantime arbuthnot walked rather slowly down street quite conscious of finding necessary to make something of effort to compose be recognition of necessity have caused to change first intention of returning to bachelor apartment after having made call upon professor herrick felt necessity more strongly after brief encounter with colonel tredennis will go into park think over said to will give time turned into lafayette park found quiet seat took out very excellent cigar be not entirely surprised to see that a held match to hand be not a steady a usual tredennis have thought little pale subject of reflection a smoked cigar be comparatively trivial incident taken by have not taken by because in flash have connected with score of others at time of occurring have borne significance to visit to professor have not be made without reason have be such reason a simply stated to majority of ordinary acquaintance must have be received with open amazement polite discredit principally because be such very simple reason indeed if such person have be told that finding without vestige of entertainment have wandered in upon professor a last resource that have wished to ask of trivial favor that have made call without reason must have felt state of affair probable enough being informed that while sitting in easiest of chair in coolest possible neglige reading agreeable piece of light literature smoking cigar before open window have caught sight of professor at window sitting with head resting on hand being struck vaguely by air of desolateness lassitude in solitary old figure have calmly laid aside book cigar have put into conventional attire have walked across street with other intention than of making best of gift of entertainment be certainly not habit to overvalue to whom explanation have be made must have taken liberty of feeling somewhat insufficient must in nine case out of ten privately have provided with more complicated one cautiously insuring against imposture by rejecting at outset simple unvarnished truth upon whole visit have be success on entering be true found called upon to admire rapidity with professor recovered from surprise at seeing a have not be deluded by hope that first appearance must awaken unmistakable delight managed to make best of situation opening remark upon subject of weather be not altogether infelicitous then produced late number of punch professor laughed ice being broken conversation flourished there be further difficulty discovered somewhat to surprise that be in better conversational trim than usual be delusive condition to be in explained to professor experience have taught not to be taken in by expect future development wo continue a doubt suspect be result of entire social stagnation for several week be merely letting off firework at once inspired to improvidence by presence be poor creature a know even poor creature be likely to suffer from idea day mental accumulation of summer carefully economized will support in penury during entire ensuing season only conjure not to betray when hear repeat same thing by instalment at mr amory evening saying saw professor face change in subtle way a looked at what there be in look change to make conscious of inward start must not have told be merest lifting of lid combined with almost imperceptible movement of muscle about mouth yet found difficult to avoid pausing for moment accomplished feat felt have reason to be rather proud of though what there be to startle in mention of mr amory evening reflected must require intellect to explain being somewhat given to finding entertainment in quiet speculation upon passing event must doubtless have given attention to incident even if have remained solitary unexplained mystifying trifle be not left to stand alone in mind be not fifteen minute before in drawing handkerchief from breast pocket accidentally drew forth with letter fell upon newspaper lying upon professor lap for moment rested there with address upward instant glanced from pretty feminine envelope to professor face arbuthnot recognized fact that something altogether unexpected have occurred again a have looked from envelope to professor so professor looked from envelope to then picked letter up returned be letter arbuthnot began letter paused ignominiously yes said professor a if have lost something of own gentle self possession see be letter be not happy remark did arbuthnot feel own next effort particularly successful one be letter from mr amory said be kind enough to write to occasionally yes responded professor saw that be from bertha hand be easily recognized be unusual hand said arbuthnot letter be very like when occurs to to remember doe happen a frequently a must wish consider fortunate writes a talk very few people do that ended with greater degree of composure than have begun with to surprise felt that pulse have quickened that there have risen to face touch of warmth suggestive of increase of color did not enjoy sensation began to open letter will said then suddenly stopped knew why have stopped professor did not to make pause return letter to envelope place in pocket without explanation required something like hardihood be well seems to be taking advantage of opportunity to rest said picked up punch again returning to half finished comment upon cartoon a if interruption have taken place a sat on seat in park apparently given up to undivided enjoyment of cigar mind be filled with tumult of thought have not be under influence of such mental excitement for year suddenly found confronting revelation perfectly astounding to so be man said at last be man took cigar out of mouth looked at end of with air of deliberate reflection a be masculine habit doe say much for added that never once suspected not once then replaced cigar with something like sigh be blind lot said did not feel situation pleasant one there be circumstance under must have resented with vigor happy ingenuity of resource must have stood in good stead there be resentment in present mood from moment truth have dawned upon have treated without even most indirect reference to own very natural feeling there have be more sacrifice of own peculiarity in action when have returned letter to pocket than even realized be not letter to show be thought doe not know how much tell must have understood a do went over good deal of ground mentally a sat in deepening dusk thought clearly dispassionately a be habit when allowed to think at by time have arrived at conclusion be quite dark then threw end of last cigar away arose there be denying that be pale still wore curiously intense expression if there be one thing man devil can put stop to said be experience such a that will go on to one of two end will kill will kill wider of mark shoot easier for a for added with rather faint dreary smile perhaps suit well enough to be merely alleviating circumstance be be good for let think a please brushed atom of cigar ash from sleeve with rather too finely feminine hand walked away chapter xvi paid professor visit few day later afterwards said professor at end of second visit be ten o'clock assure be usually much later than when strike ten thank said arbuthnot never heard that civility accomplished so dexterously before be perfectly easy to explain preternatural adroitness of speech on mr amory pride be too kind to professor weaken resolution not to present unless have just appropriated idea from somewhere if must appear day au naturel not having taken precaution to attire in mature reflection of acquaintance must pay for wear tear of seeing will confess beforehand once told said professor to tredennis after fourth visit be not fond of there have be time when have be threatened with be one of time ah with sigh of fatigue understand attraction understand following week tredennis arrived at house one evening to find in confusion coup of prominent medical man stood before pavement servant who opened door looked agitated professor sir said have have fall hope aint much hurt mr arbuthnot doctor be with ask if may go upstairs said tredennis a asked arbuthnot appeared on landing above seeing who be below came down at once there be real cause for alarm said though have have shock have be out heat must have be too much for a be coming up step felt giddy lost footing fell doctor malcolm be with say need nothing entire quiet be glad have come did receive message answered tredennis have not be to room come into library said arbuthnot have something to say to led way into room tredennis followed wondering when got inside arbuthnot turned closed door suppose said know more certainly than do where mr amory be to be found a spoke took telegram from pocket what be matter demanded tredennis what have came almost immediately after professor accident said arbuthnot be from mr amory asking to come to janey be very ill what exclaimed tredennis alone probably without physician relies on one must go to said arbuthnot professor must know nothing of if knew of woman friend of hers might appeal to everybody be out of town paused second eye fixed on tredennis changing face if will remain with professor said will go take doctor wentworth with said tredennis will be better than nothing replied arbuthnot quietly can do what be told to do must be left alone if mother have be alive must have gone if father have be well must have gone if husband have be here be not here said tredennis with bitterness not strictly just heaven only know where be must be rather hazardous to trust to telegram reaching at merrittsville said arbuthnot be not going to leave alone even until have tried merrittsville what must be done must be done now will go see doctor wentworth at once can leave in hour if find can tell professor be called away made step toward door a did so tredennis turned suddenly wait moment said arbuthnot came back what be asked there be curious pause though lasted scarcely longer than second be still pause if go said tredennis will be easier to explain absence to professor then there be pause again man looked at other be trifle pale be arbuthnot who spoke first think said without moving muscle that have better let go why said tredennis unnatural quality of voice startled because said arbuthnot a calmly a before will be conferring favor on if do want excuse for getting out of town want opportunity to be of slight service to mr amory before dignity of stalwart figure towering above slighter proportion knew appeared to advantage a said word to have made best of must have relinquished point at outset have intention of doing though be not enjoying certain cold blooded pertinacity have acquired after many battle with be very useful to at moment worst thing must happen to just now have said to ten minute before must be that must go to in trouble upon conviction took stand in placing in breach knew that have mean of defence that reason for course might offer must appear by flimsiness to betray in entire inadequacy to situation in seemed to stand that must present in character of victim to own bold willow device simply brazen matter out when one reflects upon human weakness be certainly not to discredit that have calmly resigned to before entering room there be triviality in tredennis mood made pretence of half darkness of room have be shaded from sun during day added to significance of line in face a stood with folded arm shadow seemed to make look larger to mark pallor deepen intensity of expression give better reason said arbuthnot paused what saw in man moved strongly in light of past of be mystery to friend often saw with terrible clearness much be not suspected of seeing at here recognized what awakened in pity respect have better one answered tell miss exhilaration of mr amory society want to see hope will not be sorry to see having said paused again before making coup d'tat then spoke deliberately looking tredennis in eye that must think anything detrimental to mr amory even in most shadowy way be out of question said think of what please will think nothing be detrimental to man who be friend said tredennis there be passion in word though have tried to repress friendship must be good defence for man against wrong be in said arbuthnot time sudden stir of feeling in be not altogether concealed let have way ended will do harm will do good said tredennis answered arbuthnot recovering impervious air will do good one have to be sanguine to expect good perhaps need pity added suppose be generous show must not help seeing dramatic side of situation with half conscious irony abandoning to at once seemed to have deserted well regulated decently arranged commonplace of ordinary life to be taking part in theatrical performance of rather fine subtle quality waited with intense interest to see what tredennis must do what did be characteristic of have unconsciously taken two three hurried step across room turned stood still be who must go said be sure of said arbuthnot have never found easy to understand other tredennis answered though perhaps have understood better than have understood be quicker more subtle than be only seem able to see one thing at time do one thing only see one thing now be better must go mean said arbuthnot better for tredennis looked down at floor yes answered second so of silence followed in arbuthnot simply stood looked at utter uselessness of effort have made be borne in upon in manner overpowered then remarked at length if be considering there seems nothing more to be said will go tell professor that be called away will will go replied tredennis turned to leave room arbuthnot walked slowly toward window next moment tredennis turned from door followed if have ever done injustice said time be past for ask pardon perhaps be not justice need said arbuthnot mercy think have ever be unjust to must have be easy in place said tredennis with visible effort must find easier than do to say what wished mean that pity arbuthnot interposed a said before perhaps need pity sometimes think do slight touch of dreariness in tone echoed in tredennis ear long after have left gone on way chapter xvii be ten o'clock bright moonlight when tredennis reached destination train having brought to way side station two mile distant where have hired horse struck out into county road in good old day when dwelling of virginia gentleman be mansion substantial pile of red brick before whose gate way dismounted have be mansion too have not be disposed to trifle with title have insisted upon with dignified squareness scorned architectural device to attract attention first owner have chosen site with view to young shade tree upon while have lived upon property have be almost a proud of tree a of mansion when long afterward change have taken place object of pride fell into degenerate hand a glory of mansion faded old friend tree grew flourished seemed to close kindly in about a if to soften shadow decay on side of drive led down to gateway grew irregular line of tree here there shading way from side to side again leaving space for moonlight to stream upon a tied horse tredennis glanced up drive way toward house there be light burning in one of room said must be there that broke off in midst of sentence attention suddenly attracted by figure flitted across one of patch of moonlight knew at once though have have thought of seeing before entering house be bertha in white dress with two large dog following leaping panting when spoke in hushed voice a if to quiet came down toward gate with light hurried tread when be within few foot of spoke doctor said oh how glad be how glad a said came out into broad moonlight again found face to face with tredennis fell back from a if blow have be struck fell back trembling a white a moonlight what cried be looked at bewildered by shock presence seemed to did not think must frighten said came to night because professor be not well enough to make journey doctor wentworth will be here in morning must have come with have important case to attend did not think must come said breathlessly put out hand groping for support of swinging gate caught held there be one else answered felt a if be part of strange dream stillness moonlight heavy shadow of great tree added to unreality of moment most unreal of be bertha clinging with one trembling hand to gate looking up at with dilated eye did not think must come said again startled paused with poor little effort at smile next instant died away look at said turning away from laid face on hand clinging to gate looked down at slight white figure bent head great tremor passed over next instant felt standing close at side must not do that said put out hand touched shoulder voice be almost whisper be scarcely conscious of what word be have scarcely consciousness of touch feeling swept over needed sense of touch sound one thing overpowered be sudden sense of nearness to be not physical nearness at perhaps be wrong to come went on must not leave alone must not leave alone knew that be suffering must not bear that did not speak lift head have be desolate asked yes answered in hushed voice be afraid so said have be alone so long thought of almost hour of day be not used to being alone perhaps be mistake why do tremble so know answered poor child said poor child then there be pause seemed to hold lifetime of utter silence be bertha who ended stirred little then lifted face looked a remembered looking when have first known only that be paler there be wearied softness in eye made attempt at hiding trace of tear in spoke a simply a child thought be doctor when horse foot said be afraid dog must bark waken janey have just fallen asleep have slept so little

side with bertha have fancied lost forever have bewildered be gone brilliant little figure with tinkling ornament unemotional little smile light laugh be only part of feverish dream be bertha whose hand rested on arm whose fair young face be pale with watching over child whose soft voice be tremulous tender with innocent natural tear spoke very little when have walked to fro before house for short time said let go sit down on step of porch went sat there together upon lower step few step above hand clasped on knee face turned half away from rarely looked at noticed even when spoke to spoke to eye rested oftener than not upon far away point under tree be better than be when went away said looking at cheek where moonlight whitened answered did not think to find looking like said perhaps said still with eye fixed on far away shadow perhaps have not have time enough must give time have have two month returned two month said be not so long a seems between word there came curious little catch of breath have seemed long to asked yes turned face slowly looked at have seemed long to said yes replied long dreary swayed little toward with sort of unconscious movement eye be fixed upon face with wistful questioning have seen look at child so be very hot said be tired why did not go away did not want to go away answered ought to have gone away said be not used to heat let light fall on face so can see came little nearer to a looked at wistfulness in eye changed to something else oh cried have done harm face be quite changed why did see before what have be doing nothing

question giving strange sweetness to ear yes answered often with surety of wakening with scalp on oh exclaimed made involuntary movement toward barely restrained impulse to put out hand hers fell at side next instant be great coward said fill with terror to hear of thing like be at likely that will be ordered back know replied uplifted eye devouring sweetness of face must that very madness of question forming on lip be own check want to think of said then added a stand here look up at never looked up at before down at returned be always so high above seems strange to look down at be so simple inconsequent word seemed full of mystery emotion of hour when tried afterward to recall what have said be bewildered by slightness of what have be uttered even though thrill of have not yet passed away went up step stood beside yes said speaking a gently a might have spoken to child make feel what heavy limbed clumsy fellow be woman make feel more than rest look almost like child be not

troubled breath well said will go without word turned away stood watched a moved slowly across wide porch at door stopped turned toward said faint line showing on forehead will be remembering that be not asleep must not remember at answered then stood still watched again until have entered house noiselessly ascended staircase be few yard from open door then when must see white figure in darkness no more went out to place beneath window strode silently to fro keeping watch listening until after moon have gone down bird be beginning to stir in tree chapter xviii at six o'clock in morning bertha came down stair again simple white gown be fresh one there be tinge of color in cheek slept nearly night said to tredennis when joined so did be sure be better then put out hand for to take be because

preternatural intelligence answered be rather simple thing on whole seemed very simple thing a did very pretty thing a leaned against leathern back of chair beginning vaguely to realize by dawning sense of weariness that have be up night felt that have not awakened from dream yet that vision of past month be too far away too unreal to move early morning sunlight made way through vine embowering window cast lace like shadow of swaying leaf upon floor upon bertha dress when passed near softness of light mellowed everything intensified touch of color in fan ornament on wall mantel in bit of drapery thrown here there a if by accident in midst of color mellowed light bertha moved before slender quiet figure making picture complete be quietness impressed upon more than else after first moment when have uttered cry on seeing have given way in momentary agitation have noticed that curious change fell upon when lifted face from gate emotion seemed to have died out of voice be quiet one of thing remembered of talk be that have spoken in voice so low a to be scarcely above whisper when breakfast be brought in took seat at table to pour out coffee attend to want ate very little rarely looked up without finding eye resting upon with wistful interest at least said once must see that have good breakfast kindest thing can do morning be to be hungry please be hungry if can consciousness

of pretty service at hand unsophisticated reverence for everything feminine have worked against with reserve be one of result have be habit to feel that there be reason why must be singled out for bestowal of favor have perhaps ignored many through sheer ignorance of simple somewhat exaggerated humility to find sitting at table alone with bertha in new mood bertha quiet beautiful be moving experience to be a if two must have sat there day for year have prospect of sitting so together indefinitely be very simplicity naturalness of stirred most old vivid gayety be missing did not laugh once smile be very sweet talked principally of child of common thing about there be never word did not seem thing to be cherished remembered after while child be brought down took meg upon knee jack leaned against while told tredennis what have be doing sun creeping through vine touched hair child made picture of when went upstairs took meg with holding little hand talking to in pretty maternal fashion after two have vanished tredennis found necessary to pull together with strong effort that might prove equal to conversational demand made upon by master jack who have remained behind will go

quick uneasy movement effort to recover beg pardon said with half laugh must help be paused second for reflection be primeval savage in turned clasped hand about knee again resuming attitude of attention even while fold of lace on bosom be still stirred by quick breathing though might resume attitude be not so easy to resume calmness of mood having be stirred once be le difficult to be stirred again when began at last to tell story of life on frontier if vanity have be concerned must have felt that made good listener vanity have nothing to do with obedience to wish made a plain story a material must allow also made persistent though scarcely successful effort to avoid figuring a hero be indeed rather abashed to find on recurring to fact that have done so much to bring to front even found at last taking refuge in subterfuge of speaking of in third person a one of party when recounting specially thrilling adventure in discovered that have unblushingly distinguished be exciting story of capture of white woman by indian at critical juncture when few men must be spared from fort fact that deadly determination of one of party that harm must befall be not once referred to in word only expressed in daring endurance for one be supposed to be responsible did not detract from force one of party who seemed to have sworn silent oath that must neither eat sleep rest until have accomplished end of rescuing captive who have be upon track almost a soon a news have reached fort who have followed night day with hastily gathered altogether insufficient little band at last have overtaken captor through sheer courage desperate valor have overpowered brought back prisoner unharmed one of party silent must be insignificant be in spite of figure to stir blood be who did

bertha downcast face gave cause to realize what intensity feeling have reached wakened to sudden starting of pulse heart be almost pain when reached house bertha went in search of janey remained with

be desired be ability to distract one self tredennis said paused second then said will not speak so now to day will hing like then added a be last day wish to retrieve have to retrieve asked answered a said spread letter upon lap gave attention to be rather like richard said that when begin to write invariably writes letter like theoretically detests correspondence when once begin letter always interest even awakens to kind of enthusiasm so instead of being brief tell one everything have written twelve page here be delightful be wonderful thing to do remarked tredennis doe not surprise in richard replied richard can always interest rather doe not interest be that be interested without making effort be strong point replaced letter in envelope laid in basket from took strip of lace work beginning to employ with in manner more suggestive of graceful leisure than of industrious intention seemed to accentuate fact that have nothing to do let day drift by in luxurious idleness tredennis must not help seeing that for while tone of mood so to speak be lowered yet curiously enough nothing of own dreamy exaltation died away subtle shadow seemed to have touched for moment only intensified feeling of tenderness in fact there be few thing must not have so intensified mental condition be one must advance by steady silent step of development to climax be not by nature reckless man be by mean unconscious that there be something very like recklessness in humor last day a for day also advanced by steady step to climax unfolding beauty like perfect flower fresh rain washed morning drifted into warm languorous noon followed by afternoon so long golden that seemed to hold within flower sun shade perfume of whole summer tredennis have never known so long afternoon thought yet be only lengthened by strange delight hour brought with be too short when be over seemed full of minute detail presented to mind at time a discovery bertha worked upon lace watched waiting for moment when must look up at then look down again with quick slow droop of lid impressed upon a charm in there be little ring wore made memory to simple turquoise set upon whiteness of hand like blue flower saw with new sense of recognition fold line of thin white drapery slight girlish roundness of figure dash of brightness in color of hair smallness of gold thimble on finger grace when rose sat down

answered wo repent repent felt vehemence of speech too late to check when ended be silent be a if suddenly light veil have fallen upon face felt that too tried to be calmer repeated must not repent be who must repent have given even little pain be hard on to know have done that afternoon stretched golden length to sunset cast deep velvet shadow upon grass filled air with enchanted mellow radiance everything took tinge of gold green of pine broad leaved chestnut tree gray brown of trunk red of old house honeysuckle virginia creeper clambering about bird flying homeward to nest when rich clearness depth of color reached greatest beauty bertha folded strip of lace laid in little basket ought simply to sit watch said think ought even to speak will be over in few minute will never see again said tredennis with sad prescience anything at like ah be bertha rejoinder to have always seemed that be not best of such hour one doe see others like have seen sun set like before have not said a stood silent in stillness glow faint rather bitter smile touched lip faded out found fancied face to face with laurence arbuthnot again be sharing sunset with there be ten chance against one that have shared day with also bertha sat in deepening enchanted light with soft dreamy look thought meant that remembered something felt that memory be one to yielded without reluctance that be happy in at last lifted eye to expression be very sweet in entire gentleness submission to spell of moment see said sun have slipped behind pine already have only few second left then even a looked at great fire made brighter by dark branch through saw sank little lower little lower with expiring flame be gone bertha drew quick breath there be second so of silence then stirred be over said have be like watching one die only sadder took up little work basket rose from seat seems pity to speak of mundane thing said think must go in to tea when child be taken upstairs for night bertha went with have be

laugh at last caused tredennis to leave seat go to place under tree where hammock be swung be far more place of general rendezvous than parlor window from point must see corner of brightly lighted room near window where be bertha custom to sit in low chair rock janey to sleep when be restless be doing to night must see child head lying on bosom own bent so that cheek rested against bright hair in few moment be quiet began to sing a sang swaying to fro tredennis looked listened without stirring though be gay no longer liked to hear song to mind moment in stood in odorous dark looking upward at picture framed by vine hung be among tenderest of day be fate to be full of homely sentiment found pleasure in unsophisticated primary virtue affection deep passion might be moved by must necessarily have foundation in such element be slow at subtle analysis whose final result be frequently to rob such simplicity of value tendency be to reverence for age tenderness to womanhood childhood faithfulness to thing there be something boyish quixotic in readiness to kindle in defence of womanly weakness pain nothing have ever said done have so keenly touched delighted professor herrick a fiery denunciation one night of man who be hero of scandalous story there have be qualification of sweeping assertion that in such case must be man who have earned right to bear blame be always man who be in wrong have cried flushing fiercely coward devil be in nature of thing that must be let stand at front take what follows if have ever be man for hour professor have flushed also fainter flush of age have given silent moment to reflection afterwards a sat gazing at fire be primitive belief sentiment stirred within now must not have lost one low note of little song for world have left seat only that might see what saw now arm about child cheek pressed against hair be not long before little burden fell asleep saw did not rise a soon a happened sat longer song went on finally dying away into brooding silence reigned for time before moved at length lifted face gently looked down at child few second slowly changed position in lay with indescribably tender cautious movement then rose after standing instant holding in folding arm crossed room passed out of sight tredennis turned began mechanically to arrange cushion in hammock felt sure must come to night talk to for little while at least be not very long before recognized white figure in door way went toward be asleep said in voice whose hushed tone seemed to belong half to slumber have left half to stillness of hour will come out to hammock said will sit here came forward descended step will sit in hammock replied like tree above went down path together reaching hammock took usual seat among cushion upon

portion of room seemed to have arranged about own graceful figure faint pink blue flowered drapery puffed padded furniture hundred one entirely feminine device of ornamentation be faintly aware that expression le thoughtful than one wore must have be more in keeping with surroundings look too serious to harmonize said if bertha be here must detect incongruity deplore be in thoughtful mood be not uncommon experience with faint smile word gave rise to died away a turned to fire again what thought of a sat looked into must have be difficult to tell there be evidence that be mentally well occupied in fact that sat entirely still gazed at flickering flame for nearly hour must not have moved then perhaps if have not be roused from reverie by sound at door low knock voice speaking to agnes said agnes knew at once a bertha rose to reply to summons almost a if have expected even waited for when unlocked door opened bertha be standing on threshold have partly undressed too have laid

too late mr sylvestre paused again think said that ever come to one at right time bertha have be sitting with hand folded about knee unclasped clasped with sharply vehement movement be false thing from beginning to end said believe in ah said mr sylvestre softly believe wish did not what be there to be gained by said bertha feeling be not to be reasoned about controlled miserable feverish emotion can not understand can only resent struggle against blindly when let conquer how can respect object of do woman love men for who know be like madness can say be love be life death to ' be so unreasoning so unreasoning stopped suddenly a if at once became conscious that companion be looking at instead of at fire love man generally said mr sylvestre in tenderly modulated voice at least have thought so because be one human creature who be capable of causing greatest amount of suffering know of other reason have thought of great deal be good reason said bertha good reason then laughed be just little tragic be said what delightfully emotional condition must be in to have reached tragedy in le than five minute entirely without intention did not come to be tragic came to be analytical want to tell carefully how strike said mr sylvestre bertha touched on breast said richard laurence arbuthnot colonel tredennis senator planefield two hundred men caller washington in short how doe washington strike now that have come to again wo give two week to reflect upon said agnes want impression not reflection be very much changed be very much changed be reply said bertha suppose suppose

tone of voice will in instant secretly atone for crime of lifetime wo wince will probably reply in most brilliant impersonal manner figuratively speaking will have reduced to powder cast to breeze will not be sufficiently intimate to render thing possible said mr sylvestre one must be intimate with man to be angry enough with to wish to avenge one bertha smiled like said poor larry on contrary be friend reply must not occur to to 'begin with a suggested just now with whom then said bertha must begin guest gave moment to reflection during bertha regarded intently if be going to begin at said rather slowly think must be with colonel tredennis there be moment of silence then bertha spoke in somewhat cold rigid voice what do like about asked think like everything if be one else said bertha must say that simply like size think be generally woman invariably fall victim to men who be big little lumbering like to persuade that be overawed subjected never understood big men never pleased very much be so apt to tread on like eye said agnes apparently reflecting aloud be very kind like voice be rather too deep remarked bertha sometimes be little afraid will degenerate into growl though have never heard do so yet mr sylvestre went on when bend head little look down at a talk said be very nice be really thinking of regarding seriously think be given to trifling returned bertha think be given to anything special being massive be what be thinking that be massive there be denying said friend that be one of thing like ah said bertha find rest of very flippant trivial be how strike fatigued little sigh escaped lip after said be true have obliged ourselves to be trivial for so long that be incapable of seriousness sometimes generally toward lent after have be out great deal wonder if other must not be interesting for change at same time know must not be serious if tried seriousness will be deeper said mr sylvestre when accomplish without trying be serious a spoke seriousness be extremely gentle looked at bertha even tenderly clear eye be very expressive be changed since met here last said with simple directness be only natural that what have lived through must have affected differently be of very different temperament be always more vivid intense than suffering if have suffered soft voice faltered little paused bertha turned looked unflinchingly in face have not suffered said agnes spoke a simply a before have said bertha turned sharply away be afraid so be response if be to be a near to other a hope agnes continued must be useless for to try to

much suffering in life everything seemed so pitiful must not bear thought of ended with sob of child be very womanish to cry whispered did not mean to do look at so laid cheek against cushioned back of chair for little while be more pathetic in silence than must have be in word might have uttered be true that bertha have looked at there be tear in own eye feeling be one of obstinate resistance to emotion in herself did not resent friend on contrary felt strange enjoyment of stop cry because be here said like to see do mr sylvestre recovered at once sat up smiling little there be disfiguring trace of emotion on fair face thank answered like so much have not done before for long time be perhaps because mr arbuthnot presented a entirely safe topic with tendency to develop sensibility that chose a subject of next remark see much change in friend observed if mean laurence bertha replied dare say not doe not allow thing to happen to know better have done nothing during last seven year have be to great many party said bertha have read book so sung several song hope have sung well be friend comment always depends upon mood bertha returned there have be time when have sung very well indeed can scarcely have be great tax to have done occasionally said mr sylvestre must always be rather inclined to think be result of chance not effort still with sudden conscientious scruple brought about by recollection of fact that mark of disapproval have not expressed in manner earlier in day still be very agreeable one can not deny that be always safe not to attempt to deny even if feel inclined be bertha comment because if do will inevitably prove to that be in wrong before have done with did one thing rather liked companion proceeded be very nice in peculiar impartial way of to boy boy who came with bartlett bertha interposed saw be positively unhappy about because must not attend to did take in hand asked brightening visibly knew must if noticed particularly be just like to do saw first mr sylvestre explained be afraid must not have be equal to occasion if mr arbuthnot have not assisted certainly surprised that must do knew bartlett have met boy sister in most wonderful yet most uneffusive natural way utilized material until boy felt quite at home not out of place at one of nicest thing be way in talked about whippleville boy came from whippleville seemed to give kind of interest importance even picturesqueness did not pretend to have be there knew something of country be pretty be very clever in saying too much too little of course be nice colonel tredennis must not have done said bertha agnes paused felt there be something of truth in statement be reluctant to admit why not inquired by reason of very thing be attraction for because be too massive to be adroit agnes be silent be not colonel tredennis who went to virginia when little girl be ill asked in few moment yes be bertha response came because richard be away papa be ill be janey who told of said agnes quietly made very pretty story of in childish way said that carried up down room when be tired that when head ached helped not to cry must be very gentle like to think of be very picturesque idea of great soldierly fellow nursing frail little creature making pain easier to bear do know find imagining that know how looked bertha sat perfectly still too knew how have looked there be reason told for sudden horrible revulsion of feeling rushed upon with remembrance little while before when agnes have told story there have be reason why must be threatened by emotion now be different now that there be so to speak pathos in air now that be merely talking of commonplace unemotional thing remembered so well if must have forced to forget for one instant might have overcome passion of unreasoning anguish seized be use a made effort agnes sat watched strange questioning dawning slowly in eye looked very large stopped short hand clutched other hard close wild thought of getting up leaving room came to then knew be too late light flickered up from wood fire fell upon face a slowly turned to agnes for instant agnes simply looked at then uttered terror stricken exclamation bertha cried well said bertha well at next breath began to tremble left place on hearth stood up trembling still be tired out said must go away ought not to have come here agnes rose went to laying hand on

will go out of life in time be lost forever then know compared to that rest be nothing nothing must bear for eternity anguish shame bitterness if only might not be taken away oh cried agnes can believe can believe can believe said bertha fiercely yes can not for minute after agnes did not speak sat still looked down at bertha cowering figure there came back to with terrible distinctness time when must have looked so only have always be alone there mingled with deep feeling of moment far away pity for own helpless youth despair will tell said at last how began be struck when bertha lifted face from cushion by change have come upon trace of intense passionate feeling be gone be a if weeping have swept away left only weariness made look pathetically young helpless a watched agnes

only to bertha amory can not mean anything to very long only just while last before one get used to to torture of turned away crossed room to window drawing aside curtain there be little streak of light in east said be day have not slept at agnes went to stood looked at together faint thin line of gray tinged with palest yellow to morrow have come said bertha must begin new year properly must make up visiting book arrange list call one agnes be only faintness with little protesting smile on lip sank to floor agnes knelt down at side began to loosen wrapper at throat chafe hand yes be only faintness said in low voice if be something more must be saved great deal chapter xxiii on dit that charming mr sylvestre so well known so greatly admired in society circle a miss agnes wentworth have after several year of absence much deplored by numberless friend returned to make home in washington having taken house on lafayette square three year of mr sylvestre widowhood have be spent abroad chiefly in italy land of love beauty where tasso sang raphael dreamed of immortal thus society column of daily paper week later mr merriam arrived house on lafayette square be taken possession of be one of older house large substantial one whose rather rigorous exterior still held forth promise of possibility in way of interior development arbuthnot heard bertha mention one day that one of mr sylvestre chief reason for selecting be that looked quiet reflected upon afterward a being rather unusual a reason of young beautiful woman though after 'looks quiet ' be mental comment if felt called upon to remark upon at must certainly say that be perfectly composed person perhaps be groove chooses to live in may be simply nature must mind knowing be rather desirous of seeing what must make of place inside desire be by mean strong enough to lead to make first call upon hour earlier than might have be expected according to strictest canon of good taste on part mr sylvestre found great pleasure in day spent in establishing for year life have be unsettled one prospect of arranging home according to own taste especially home in washington be very agreeable to fortune be large time be own a in course of rambling have collected innumerable charming interesting odds end there be reason why house must not be delightful one for several day be quite busy greatly interested found picture plaque hanging even more absorbing than have imagined must be spent morning in arranging rearranging cabinet wall mantel moved about room wearing faint smile of pleasure on lip faint tinge of color on cheek really said to bertha who dropped in to see one morning found standing in middle of room reflecting upon pretty old blue cup saucer be quite happy in quiet way seem to be shut in from world life busy thing to find interest enough in color of bit of china fold of portire seems almost exciting to put thing on shelf then take down put somewhere else when arbuthnot passed house saw that rich eastern looking stuff curtained window great indian jar stood on step balcony a if ready for plant in exhausting resource of universe mr sylvestre have given attention to india being man of caprice have not returned from explorings empty handed carriage stood before house door being open revealed glimpse of picture hanging in hall be pleasantly suggestive will make attractive arbuthnot said to that go without saying will be rather perilously so first call upon be always very distinct memory to be made on rather chill unpleasant evening being admitted by servant into hall have before caught glimpse of picturesque comfort warmth impressed upon in strongest possible contrast to raw dampness darkness of night through half drawn portires have flitting glance at two three room passing impression of bright deep point of color on drapery bric brac picture then be ushered into room in mr sylvestre sat have be sitting before fire with book upon lap rose to meet still holding volume in hand be dressed in violet wore large cluster of violet loosely at waist looked very slender tall fair rich darkly glowing color of furniture hanging formed into background for a if accomplishment of end have be sole design of existence arbuthnot even wondered if be possible that must ever again look so well a did just at instant rose moved forward though recognized folly of thought before ten minute have passed looked quite a well when reseated even better when became interested in conversation followed be conversation dealt principally with change have taken place in washington during absence from found great many strike a little singular that resent more said arbuthnot most of be change for better answered ah returned must not make difference to ordinary mind unless awakened additional resentment there be sense of personal injury in recognizing that improvement have be made entirely without assistance feel be reply be lost in pleasure in being at home again have always thought of a 'home then be arbuthnot mental comment be inadvertent speech tell story impression of late mr sylvestre be not agreeable one have heard discussed frequently by men who have known story told of be not pleasant after fifteen minute in crucible of impartial public opinion manifold brilliant gift undeniable grace attainment have habit of disappearing in vapor leaving behind residuum of cold blooded selfishness fine disregard of human feeling in others not easily disposed of arbuthnot have also noticed that there be one opinion expressed on subject of marriage married lovely girl twelve fifteen year younger than have heard man say once must like to see what have made of must ejaculated older man must heaven forbid added greatly to arbuthnot interest in that bore outward sign of conflict might have passed through whatever have be have borne with courage kept secret own quiet of manner be not suggestive either of sadness self repression made apparent effort to evade mention of married life though a spoke of seldom seemed entirely natural that must refer rarely to year have passed away from washington when little later mr merriam came in proved to be a satisfactory a other appurtenance to household be picturesque elderly woman with small elegant figure acute little countenance large dark eye sparkled in most amazing manner at time be old washingtonian herself have lived through several administration have made most of experience seemed to have personally known notability of century reminiscence gave arbuthnot feeling of being surpassingly youthful modern have be living abroad for last seven year finding at home once more seemed to settle down with sense of relief be bad habit to get into of living abroad said be habit grows on one went away intending to remain year must probably have ended existence in europe if mr sylvestre have not brought home be always little homesick too continually felt need of new administration lacked resolution required to leave behind thing have become accustomed to when went away arbuthnot discovered that be with have talked more than with mr sylvestre yet while have be in room have not occurred to that mr sylvestre be silent silence be not unresponsiveness when looked back upon found that there be even something delicately inspiring in be that expression of gentle attentiveness in eye said make most trivial remark of consequence convinces that if spoke must be sure to say what must please most to hear be great charm for few moment before returning to room dropped in upon amory household there be one in parlor when entered colonel tredennis who stood with back to fire apparently plunged deep in thought glance fixed upon rug at foot be in evening dress held pair of white glove in hand did not wear festive countenance arbuthnot thought that looked jaded worn certainly there be deep line left on forehead even when glanced up straightened be waiting for mr amory said amory be out of town a be going to reception at secretary of state be to accompany think will be down directly yes there be saw through portires descending staircase a spoke be gleaming in creamy satin lace carried wrap over arm came into room with soft rustle of trailing drapery tredennis stirred slightly then stood still did keep waiting very long said hope not then turned to arbuthnot a buttoned long glove deliberately richard have gone to baltimore with theatre party explained miss varien went dozen others did not care to go richard persuaded colonel tredennis to assume responsibility for evening take to secretary of state president be to be there a have not yet told that approve of cabinet object to message feel ought not to keep in suspense longer approval will naturally remove load of anxiety from mind said arbuthnot can be of assistance to in buttoning that glove hesitated second then extended wrist to arbuthnot who have occasionally performed service for before there be something novel in hesitation delicate suggestion of coquettish surrender in gesture have be chief of charm for that coquetry be of finer more reserved sort that have never expended upon be something so new that momentary bewilderment did not add to dexterity glove buttoning be of longer duration than must otherwise have be while be being accomplished colonel tredennis looked on in silence have never buttoned woman glove in life seemed to that be scarcely thing for man who be husband brother lover to do if there be deep feeling in heart how must careless conventional fellow stand there hold little wrist meet lifted eye without betraying reasoning be not very logical in nature be reasoning of pain hot anger other uneasy masterful emotion so got better of that turned suddenly away that might not see scarcely knowing what did be abrupt movement attracted arbuthnot attention a also did something else movement of bertha unsteadiness of gloved hand however be speedily controlled ended glanced at only to find smiling though breath came little quickly eye looked exceedingly bright be afraid find rather troublesome said extremely replied look upon in light of moral training sustained by sense of duty will endeavor to persevere felt absurdity triviality of word more perhaps because a uttered caught glimpse of tredennis ' half averted face there be that in jaded look formed too sharp contrast to inconsequent jesting be not getting easier for be thought wo until have driven harder even than doe now perhaps there be something in own humor made trifle more susceptible to outward influence than usual a have be already intimated have mood have felt one of creeping upon like shadow during brief walk through dark street hear carriage at door said when have buttoned glove let detain be on way home have be questioned bertha suddenly awakening to new interest on own part called upon mr sylvestre answered then assisted to put on wrap went out to carriage together when be seated door closed bertha leaned forward spoke through open window think house very pretty inquired very be brief reply though seemed to expect to add more did not do so carriage drove away left standing upon sidewalk ah said bertha leaning back with faint smile will go again again yet again will said colonel let hope will enjoy truth be that subject did not awaken in absorbing interest oh will enjoy responded mr sylvestre suggested tredennis will never be sure what think of what wish to think of though will have caprice will always treat beautifully uncertainty will make enjoy more than ever such state of

honest right in whose very affection be emotion against honor must struggle be humiliation that others must look on see that must so amuse so stood on outer edge of little circle be so standing when first caught sight of professor at opposite end of room left place then went over to sight of refined gentle old face brought to something bordering on sense of relief removed little of totally

brought best of gift to surface though nothing must have be more unstrained quiet than tone of conversation be at disadvantage when talked together must keep pace with understand gentle thought did not bewilder place on defensive once a looked at sweet reposeful face remembered what bertha have said of ideal woman thought rose in mind that be fair feminine full of tender sympathy kindly thought not ignorant of world bitter against only bearing stain of upon woman must be so thought sadly agnes saw shadow fall upon face wondered what be thinking of began to speak to of bertha soon afterward perhaps if whole truth be told be while so spoke that felt grace sweetness most movingly figure word brought before be innocent one loved one only saw in memory dream whose eye followed with appeal be sad truth at first agnes spoke of time when have be girl together making entre into society with others a young untried a bertha happiest brightest of be always success said have that quality one know how to analyze people remembered be attracted never made angry envious men who have be in love with remained friend be because be so true to be always true friend remembered so many incident of early

heartfelt gratitude to woman who have defended against when sat among book that night mind be calmer than have be for many day felt loneliness what wonder that went to house again again oftener to spend quiet hour than when others be there when burden weighed most heavily upon sky looked darkest agnes sylvestre rarely failed to give help when noted thoughtfulness for others did not know what method there be in thoughtfulness for with what skilful tact delicate care chose word in spoke to of bertha only felt that after have talked to shadow be companion be le shadow more fair truth to be believed in to draw faith courage from professor who met once twice during informal call spoke of fact to arbuthnot with evident pleasure be at best said have noticed that be always so when be there truth be must be impossible to resist influence of beautiful young woman acquaintance with mr arbuthnot have taken upon something of character of intimacy saw other almost daily professor have indeed made many discovery concerning younger man none caused to like le have got over first inclination towards surprise at finding have many thing in common having early composed to meet with calmness

discussing problem of day though method be entirely different arbuthnot be at outset much given to light treatment of argument always understood other in end be drawn trifle nearer by debate be actually discovered that laurence have gone so far a to initiate unwary professor into evil practice of smoking having gradually seduced by insidious temptings of most delicate cigar discussion be observed be always more enjoyable when professor having easy chair placed in exactly right position with regard to light fire found with cigar in hand carefully smoking making most of aroma tranquil enjoyment of respect for rite be agreeable thing to see soothes must say to arbuthnot even inspires elevates feel a if have discovered new sense be really quite grateful be arbuthnot who generally arranged easy chair showing remarkable instinct in matter of knowing exactly what be necessary to comfort among discovery concerning professor counted one have in such thing silent quickness of perception deft handedness of woman perhaps have at first surprised more than else may have be for private reason of own that professor occasionally gave to conversation lighter tone even giving friendly discursive attention to social topic showing interest in doings of pleasure lover butterfly of fashion at such time arbuthnot noticed that beginning with reception at british embassy not unfrequently ended with bertha opening with last dinner at white house closed with richard weekly evening adorned by presence of senator planefield colleague so be perfectly natural that must not neglect mr sylvestre to whom professor have taken great fancy whose progress watched with much interest frequently spoke of to arbuthnot dwelling upon charm made what be analyzing influence upon others appeared to have specially impressed upon on occasion of seeing tredennis having said that must be impossible to resist beautiful young woman a have fallen into unconscious habit of calling went on to discourse further be too tranquil to make apparent effort said yet coldest most reserved person must be warmed moved by have seen that though be neither most reserved coldest arbuthnot be smoking most perfectly flavored of cigar giving good deal of delicate attention to at took from mouth looked at end removed ash with touch of finger in doing naturally kept eye upon cigar not upon professor yes said have recognized of course see rather often think said professor be happy to be permitted privilege be answer though be aware be indebted for far more to mr amory than to own fascination numberless powerful though may be be privilege said professor be more of one to philip than to even more of one than know need what woman might give doe said arbuthnot might ask what be be angry with because did not say with more ease le of sense of unreasonable irritation professor seemed to forget cigar held in hand rested on chair arm neglected while gave up to thought have changed very much during past year said in few last month have noticed specially miss something from manner look fagged worn have struck that rather need interest feel loneliness without being conscious that doe so after be only natural man who lead isolated life inevitably reach period when isolation wearies brood over little think said arbuthnot that mr sylvestre might supply interest think so suggested professor mildly oh said laurence think man must be hard to please who did not find must supply with anything everything laughed made few ring of smoke watching float upward toward ceiling must have great deal to bring said professor speaking for moment rather a if to than to audience must have great deal in return for what must bestow have always be what be to day only such man be worthy of man who have trifled with past must offer what be due to be true said laurence made more ring of smoke blew away a for tredennis said with deliberateness felt necessary to outward composure advantage be that doe not exactly belong to nineteenth century have place in parlor when enters one without least pretension consciousness of tower over rest of with gigantic modesty be useless to endeavor to bear

permitted to retain position in treasury until need be modest ambition be yet be afraid will be thwarted then in next administration perhaps will be seedy out at elbow mr amory wo like to invite to thursday evening because will know will make uncomfortable then then will disappear something have disturbed commented professor rather seriously be talking nonsense a said thought occurred to that have heard more of kind of nonsense than usual of late that fact be likely to be of significance be old story thought be beginning to wear upon until doe not control quite so completely a did at first be natural too perhaps bertha have be little cruel to in woman way have not be bearing so well dear professor said laurence everything be relative what call nonsense regard a most successful conversational effort must not wield excalibur expect of beg if have made effort to evade further discussion of mr sylvestre possibility of future have not failed in talked of more in fact talked very little at shade have fallen upon professor face did not pas away lighted cigar again scarcely seemed to enjoy finishing if arbuthnot have be in a alert mental condition a usual attention must have be attracted by anxious thoughtfulness of old friend manner be preoccupied rather glad of opportunity to be silent when cigar be finished be on point of taking departure professor seemed to rouse a if from reverie modest ambition of yours began slowly thank for thinking of said arbuthnot a paused interest replied professor be continually finding something to interest there be reason why must be

go abroad season reached height wane though miss jessup began to refer occasionally to much to be regretted delicacy of charming mr amory health there seemed little alteration in mode of life will confide to said to colonel tredennis have set up effective little air of extreme delicacy a might set up carriage if needed one be one of luxury do remember lord farintosh tooth always ached when be invited out to dinner did not want to go tooth ethel newcome said nothing must induce to part with indisposition be like refuse to become convalescent prescribe for beg of be true a have said that

at time managed to see rather often took pain to renew bloom of first acquaintance have perhaps shown little on wane a richard friendship usually did in course of time perhaps waning having set in richard be not at first invariably so enthusiastically glad to see large military figure present in office have reason of own for not always feeling entirely at ease before whilom favorite a have remarked to planefield philip tredennis be not malleable fellow have unflinching habit of truth remorseless idea of what man integrity must be must not be likely to look with lenient half seeing eye upon paltering with falsehood dishonor however colored disguised did not always appear at most convenient moment there be occasion indeed when unexpected entrance have put end to business conference of very interesting slightly exciting nature conference have be true connection with matter of westoria land colonel have lately developed interest in project in question have not shown at outset have even begun to ask question about shown desire to inform a to method most likely to be employed in manipulating great scheme amassed in one way large capital of information concerning subsidy land grant exhibited remarkable intelligence in mental investment of indeed there be time when awakened in richard rather uneasy sense of admiration by clearness of insight practical readiness of view have always be given to digging into thing amory said to planefield after one of interview be habit of mind have steady business capacity expect to find what be digging into thing for planefield asked will be digging up something one of day that be not particularly anxious to have dug up be not overfond of fellow never be richard laughed trifle uneasily oh be well enough said though will admit have be little in way once twice be quite possible that colonel have not be entirely unaware of latter fact though have exhibited sign of knowledge either in countenance bearing indeed must be difficult for one so easily swayed by passing interest a richard amory be to have long resisted manly courtesy good nature men always found agreeable companion made most of power on occasion threw in threw in amory way even planefield admitted reluctantly once twice that fellow have plenty in be not long before richard succumbed to personal influence with pleasurable indolence must have cost too much effort to combat against besides be rather agreeable to count among one friend supporter man strong enough to depend on desirable enough to be proud of there have be time during last few month when there must have be sense of relief in feeling that there be within reach stronger nature than own one on whose strength knew must rely a intimacy appeared to establish if did not openly confide in tredennis more than once approached border of confidence in moment of depression that have such moment have become plain did not even look so bright a have looked something of care free joyous air have deserted now then there be to be seen faint line on forehead there be great deal of responsibility to be borne in matter like said to tredennis wear on man to added few second later with delightfully unconscious mixture of petulance protest confound why ca thing a well turn out right a wrong have thing be turning out wrong colonel ventured richard put elbow on table before rested forehead on hand second well yes admitted several thing just at wrong time too there seems kind of fate in a if when one thing began rest must follow colonel began to bite one end of long mustache reflectively a looked at young man knitted brow there be one thing must understand at outset said at length when can be made useful supposing thing be possible be here richard glanced up at quickly looked little haggard for moment what steady reliable fellow be said yes must be sure of if if worst came to worst colonel bit end of mustache way home more than one passer by on avenue be aroused to wonder what subject of reflection might be strode along with so absorbed air frowned so fiercely must like to know what worst be be saying to must like to know what mean be perhaps desire to know what meant led to cultivate richard more faithfully still to join on street to make agreeable bachelor dinner for to carry off to theatre in quiet way to learn something of what be doing day be in fact delicate diplomatic position colonel occupied in day can not be said that greatly enjoyed liked in be too honest by nature to find pleasure in diplomacy what did for must never have done for for sake of woman who rewarded generosity care with frivolous coldness slight have undertaken task whose weight lay heavily upon since first suspicion of danger have be aroused have be upon alert continually have seen many thing to more indifferent le practical be blind a richard have casually remarked be possessed of strong business sense faculty of be not usually suspected have seen sign in air felt boded good for richard amory who relied on discretion in business affair that professor have innocently relied upon when gave daughter into hand have finally learned that bertha never gave other than transient thought more than jest to money matter knew good fortune have be to be trammelled neither by weight of money want of truly enviable condition have not unnaturally engendered in confidence at once unquestioning somewhat perilous tredennis have recalled more than once of late little scene have taken part in on one occasion of signing legal document richard have brought to will sign here have said with exaggerated seriousness will sign there what must happen to if wrote on wrong line must not laurence sign for in government hand give air of distinction suppose hand trembled made blot be not obliged

fashion whose word be law if such thing must be spoken of person of habit so grave might have be said that danced attendance upon lady though such phrase must seem unfitting may certainly be remarked that walked attendance on sought favor did bidding with silent faithfulness wonderful to behold accepted invitation attended reception escorted to carriage found wrap carried light burden with imperturbable demeanor what said bertha one night when have seen in attendance on wife of secretary of state whose liking for be at once strong warm what be colonel tredennis who curry favor of rich

past present entitled to respect admiration there be story mentioned in discussion of seemed to have lived life singularly uneventful so far a emotional experience be concerned nevertheless used to say when gave few moment to sympathetic musing upon nevertheless observed good behavior notwithstanding did not enjoy greatly in society be attentive to duty without being absorbed in when temporarily unoccupied wore rather weary abstracted look be something like look once remarked inwardly something like look have seen in eye of bright baffling little mr amory who seems at time to be obliged to recall from somewhere have not be leader of world of hers without seeing many thing learning many lesson a have stood giving greeting to passing multitude week after week have gained wonderful amount of experience knowledge of kind have seen so many weary face so many eager one so many stamped with care disappointment bright eye have passed before one season have saddened have heard gay voice

be a if suddenly fatigue have overtaken have energy desire to rally from before end of season have altered again have touch of too brilliant color be gayer than ever rather persistently gay said older woman be think lately there have be greater change still more baffling one there have appeared upon scene element so new strange a to set ordinary conjecture at first breath of rumor have wafted story of planefield infatuation westoria scheme have be met with generous displeasure disbelief a time went on have begun to be more difficult to make effort against discussion grew with day gathered material a passed from one to most trivial circumstance assumed proportion of proof when viewed in light of general too vivacious interest when senator planefield entered room people instantly cast about in search of mr amory reposed entire confidence in immediately popular theory for presence of one absence of other must have be foregone conclusion if met other with degree of vivacity fact be commented upon in significant aside if bertha manner be cold quiet be supposed to form portion of deep laid plan for entire subjugation of victim have indeed come to at last tredennis ' friend looked on listened bewildered to find shaken in first disbelief by aspect of affair too serious to be regarded with indifference by time season drew toward close rumor have at first be accepted only by rumor lover epicure in scandal have found way into place where opinion have weight decision be more serious matter in one two quiet establishment there be private debating of various rather troublesome question in debate mr amory name be frequently mentioned affair a unfortunate a one under discussion have be known to occur before be not impossible that might occur again be impossible to be blind to be impossible to ignore treat lightly certainly something be due to society from who held rein in hand for time being be too great leniency make such thing possible one remarked to woman with hitherto unspotted reputation in entirely respectable position must be impossible be on very evening that remark be made that bertha expressed rather curious opinion to laurence arbuthnot be dawning upon said that be not quite so popular a used to be be wondering why what suggested idea laurence inquired scarcely know replied little languidly care so much a ought people talk to in so animated manner a used to fancy be not very animated perhaps there be great deal in know be deteriorating conversationally what say have right ring exactly suppose people detect false note like wonder at oh there be denying that be not so much overpraised noticed a used to be then sat silent for time appeared to be reflecting laurence watched with dawning sense of anxiety must have be reluctant to admit existence of even to chapter xxvii few day after told richard that wished to begin to make arrangement for going away for summer what so early exclaimed with air of slight discontent have be quite cool so far remained too late last year answered want to make up for lost time be at dinner turned wineglass about restlessly on table cloth be getting tired of washington asked seem to be be little tired of everything just now said even with ghost of laugh of westoria land senator planefield turned wineglass about again oh said voice going beyond border of petulance be plain enough to see that have taken unreasonable dislike to planefield be too large florid absorbs too much of one attention replied coldly doe not always seem to absorb great deal of yours richard responded knitting delicate dark brow treated cavalierly enough last night when brought rose be tired of rose exclaimed with sudden passion be too big red heavy cost too much money fill air about weight down never seem to be rid of wo have more let give to one else threw bunch of grape on plate dropped forehead on hand with childish gesture of fatigue despair richard knit brow again regarded with feeling very nearly approaching nervous dread must not do be plain what be matter with said what have happened be like to be unreasonable bertha made effort to recover partly succeeded lifted face spoke quite gently deprecatingly said think be so will be readier to overlook allow to a luxury fact be richard be not growing stronger do know interrupted understand that used to be strong enough one have to be very strong to be strong enough replied seem to have fallen little short of mark have be going on rather long time have inquired did begin last winter yes answered in low voice began then well see be rather long for thing of sort to go on without special reason have seemed so to responded without change of tone have pretty good appetite inquired raised eye suddenly then dropped again have not observed what dozen other people have seen answered sleep well be thinner well yes giving glance of inspection be thinner oh come now wo do at be willing to offer form of apology like said must get well answered be rose from seat went to mantel for cigarette returned to side patting shoulder encouragingly must not be tired of planefield if be well must like well enough change settled on face be one have crossed many time without taking note of possibly edge of susceptibility so fine keen a be more easily dulled than of sensitiveness exquisite arose that offer inducement to recover said will begin immediately to day moment let light cigarette for after be done sauntered into library together stood for moment looking out of window do know said at length laying hand on sleeve think even be not quite be invalid too said why do think so for very good reason answered for best of reason two three time lately have be trifle out of humor be aware of such see be disadvantage of being habitually amiable slightest variation of usually angelic demeanor lay open to suspicion of bodily ailment just now for instance at table when spoke to about going away be little not to put too fine point upon cross be touch upon sleeve be very soft kind face have gentle playful appeal on really be returned just little so be be more matter of voice manner of course did appear to greatest advantage be afraid have never done thing like know must be rather bad to begin now must certainly must replied be very nice in to care about must not be nice in not to care said just for moment know actually sounded quite quite married seemed a if be on verge of agreeing to differ about senator planefield wo do again said will agree to make best of hesitated second will try not to make worst returned there be always best suppose so long a be here to take care of need not need not be uncomfortable about what asked hesitated again shade of new color touched cheek think be over fastidious said have way like be too fulsome admires too much pay too many compliment wish must not do oh come now said gayly be prejudice be worse than rest never heard complain of admirer before of compliment hesitated moment again be not first time have encountered light graceful obstinacy found more difficult to cope with than word apparently more serious have never have admirer of exactly quality before said oh said airily argue from ground that be bad quality have never struck suggested that there be something of same quality whether be good bad indifferent in person who be connected with westoria land have felt once twice lately when have looked around parlor a if must have suddenly emigrated atmosphere be so different have actually rather crowded out rest men be turn to pause now did so looking out of window evidently ill at ease hesitant for moment dear child said at length there may be truth in what say may a well be frank with thing be necessary richard said quickly prompted to question by sudden vague thought what have to do with westoria land why do care so much about have everything to do with nothing answered legal business connected with likely to result from success of scheme will be making of be have be immense success so far know will make immense success man of property upon word nice little lobbyist be to look frightened at mere shadow of plot be not lobbyist exclaimed never wanted to be one be only part of nonsense have talked life have talked too much nonsense wish wish have be different allow repentance to be too deep remarked dryly wo be able to get over be too late for repentance will not be guilty of particular kind of folly again be folly be bad taste a have not observed might have be content to let rest interrupted checked in reply be about to make clasping hand helplessly o richard said be beginning again so be responded coolly seem to have tendency in direction always happens said when speak of senator planefield of going away have fallen into habit of wanting to go away lately answered wanted to go to europe want to go still interposed very much wish to remain here returned petulantly what be use of man having wife at other side of globe withdrew pace leaned against side of window letting eye rest upon with little bitter smile for moment have le care of herself of than have ever have before ah said then keep here because love bertha exclaimed even equable triviality found disturbing element in situation richard said go finish cigarette out of door will be better for of have gone far enough have gone too far answered nervously be deucedly uncomfortable be way to be uncomfortable ca make smooth again of course can must not be like to be implacable be afraid be trifle irritable fact be have have great deal of business anxiety lately one two investment have turned out poorly have weighed on mind if money be mine know be yours have never wished to feel difference said replied nothing must have be nicer than way about might have made very uncomfortable if

will follow a soon a can wo say more about europe just at present will perhaps next year kissed again perhaps next year year after repeated with queer little smile will take senator planefield with answered will leave at home to invest million derived from westoria land went out with laugh on lip week later colonel tredennis heard from richard that bertha child be going away when asked colonel

engagement chapter xxviii next few week be not agreeable one to richard amory there be too much feverish anxiety uncertainty in have not yet acquired coolness hardihood of experience felt lack in have great deal at stake more than at outset have seemed possible must have under circumstance began to realize with little discomfort that have run heavier risk than have intended to allow to be led into running when rose before in full magnitude a did occasionally when affair assumed unencouraging aspect wished enthusiasm have be le great must not be said that have reached remorse for actual repentance of indiscretion have simply reached point when discouragement led to feel that might be called upon to repent by misfortune up to time have be habit to drive up to capitol in coup to appear in gallery to saunter through lobby to flit in out of committee room with something of air of amateur rather enjoying have made popular gayety magnetic manner readiness to be thing to men have smoothed pathway for while unprofessional air have given appearance of harmlessness be first rate kind of fellow to have on ground when thing of sort be going on one of smaller satellite once remarked

making honest living out of native land one know what be up to now one be different wife of have be doing flung in planefield who be present what have got to do with said with savage uneasiness be full of restive jealousy distrust in day be only going to say that be known in society remarked be kind most particular of fellow object to calling on a matter took form more critical point be neared a newspaper began to express on subject of westoria land scheme prophesy failure success a became subject of editorial applauding public spiritedness of most prominent in of paragraph denouncing corrupt self seeking tendency of time a mental temperature of certain individual became matter of vital importance degree of cordiality of greeting affair of elation despair richard felt that air of being amateur be becoming thing of past be too anxious to keep up well did not sleep at night began to look fagged required effort to appear at ease confound said to planefield how can one be at ease with man when yes may be success destruction to make of too much consequence fellow find trying to please spoil manner never knew what be to feel human being of particular consequence before have be lucky commented planefield not too tolerantly have be lucky richard answered be not lucky now will be deucedly unlucky if bill doe pas fact be there be time when half wish have meddled with mistake made said planefield with stolid ill humor be in letting mr amory go away now be time need most there be denying that there be thing woman can do better than men when man have wife a clever a yours a much of social success be blundering when doe call on for assistance one two of little dinner must be very thing just now for final smoothing down of one two rough one who have opinion unless provide

eye be that kind of thing want now well said richard nervously be at disposal mind telling that be rather out of humor with aspect of affair before went away have one interview with showed must be safest plan to let go out of humor said planefield have be good deal out of humor lately seems to not that be business of mine be rather pity considering circumstance richard colored walked few step put hand in pocket took out again among chief source of anxious trouble to have be that of late have found companion rather difficult to get along with have be irritable even trifle overbearing have at time exhibited indifference to result truly embarrassing to contemplate in view of crisis at hand when intrenched behind certain heavy stubbornness in be specially strong richard felt big body florid face doggedly unresponsive eye be too much to combat against when be ill humored richard knew that endeavored to conciliate when mood held possession must only feel alarm ask if must be possible that after man might be brutal false enough to fail there be time when sat looked at unwillingly fascinated by likeness found in to man who have sent poor westor to doom naturally old story have be revived of late heard new version of more minute description of chief actor be not difficult for overwrought imagination to discover in two men similarity of personal characteristic just at moment there rose within memory of point of resemblance between pair must have be extremely embarrassing to if have permitted to assume disagreeable form of actual fact be resemblance between influence have moved in case have be woman in case be own wife if have not be too greatly harassed must have appreciated indelicacy of situation be not unrefined person in theory sensitiveness must have caused to revolt at grossness of position if have not have so much at stake be so overborne by associate mistake vice be always result of circumstance enthusiasm hurried past with averted eye refused to concede to substantiality there be nothing more certain than that have never allowed to believe that have found bertha of practical use in rendering planefield docile attracting le important luminary bertha have be very charming amiable be be always so be habit to please people nature in fact have only done what always did a mental statement of case nothing must be more simple than be moved to private disgust by companion aggressive clumsiness seemed to complicate matter confront with more crude suggestion be afraid must not enjoy way of putting said planefield shut teeth on cigar looked out of window be sole response be form of bullying enjoyed must remember that doe not realize everything continued richard uneasily have not regarded matter from serious stand point be impression added with sudden sense of growing irritation that must have anything to do with if thought be matter of gain loss planefield made movement be convinced that be lie look out of window be reply to richard put hand into pocket again turned about irritated helpless must have seen how unpractical be exclaimed be mere child in business matter one must deceive stopped flushed without apparent reason found looking out of window too with feeling of most unpleasant confusion be obliged to shake off before spoke again when did so be with air of beginning with fresh subject after said everything doe not depend upon influence of sort there be other thing to be considered have seen blundel ca expect man like blundel said planefield to be easy to manage blundel be possessor of moral character when man have capital like blundel sharpness into bargain be not going to trifle with be going to hang on to until reach highest market value then decide way will invest richard dropped into seat by table felt forehead growing damp if be not sure of blundel exclaimed well be not sure of blundel be answer what have to hope be that be sure of one thing ca be sure of be moral character impeccability be rare be never easy for outsider to hit on exact value varies have to run risk with blundel be expensive there have be great deal of money used hesitated richard great deal planefield resorted to window again have not be money have be used have sufficient intellect to reap advantage where be to be reaped to avoid indiscreet adventure have better go see blundel said after pause have have talk with made a alluring statement of case a must with proper degree of caution have have time to put matter in scale with impeccability see weighs heavier if ca be made to balance will try to balance if ca must settle what be to be done between have done best by jove exclaimed richard virtuously what corruption be ingenuous ejaculation be not collected enough to appreciate native candor of at moment felt that be being hardly treated that most sacred trust of great nation be in hand likely to betray at far too high figure remark amounted to outburst of patriotism have price cried planefield turned head slowly glanced at over shoulder said if have 'd find easier there be difficulty if be to be bought none of be to be sold 'd see way did not seem to richard that way be very clear at present moment at step of late have found new obstacle in path new burden on shoulder people have so many interest so many limitation limitation be always related to interest began to resolve that be very sordid business like world in human lot be cast to realize that tendency of humanity be to coarse prejudice in favor of then have better see blundel at once said with feverish impatience have time to lose be planefield cool response will need wit can carry with be not going to offer inducement know be only going to prove to that chance to do something for country lie before in direction of westoria land after after repeated richard anxiously do what think safest most practicable a well appointed equipage drew up under archway before lower entrance to north wing of capitol group of men who stood near door way regarded with interest did so because three of be stranger sight seer fourth who be well seasoned washingtonian have called attention to there said with experienced air there be one of moment be beginning to be regarded a fact that be mixed up with one of biggest job country have ever known be up to ear in westoria business be believed though

average american with ingenuous eagerness for dramatic exposure of crime in fellow man have existed joyously for year in belief that washington be seat of corruption bribery fraud that be populated chiefly with brilliant female lobbyist depraved official who carried privilege to market bartered sold with guileless candor whose temerity be only to be equalled by brazen cheerfulness of spirit be probably not in least aware of mental attitude toward nation government revelled in none le must have felt keen pang of disappointment if have be suddenly confronted with fact that there be actually element of most unpicturesque honesty in house flavor of shameless impeccability in senate have heard delightful story of job scheme have hoped to hear more when have be taken to visitor gallery have exhibited earnest anxiety to be shown member connected with last investigation have received with private rapture anecdote connected with ruling political scandal decided that country be in bad way felt glow of honest pride in standing up at in present condition of rottenness ardor have be little dampened by incautious statement made by friend guide to effect that subject of investigation seemed

have combined to render sentiment of such importance in present crisis looking at thick set figure ordinary face felt that planefield have be right that bertha might have done much with principally because presented a one of obstacle whose opinion must be formed for more on account of obstinacy when once biassed in wrong direction there be suggestion of conviction in manner when spoke be very

valuable information have seen many thing have not seen in vain may be even suspected that richard in character of amateur be aware of there be suggestion of watchfulness in glance at thing ought to be better worse to simplify system said be in effect what heard said morning answered richard be sorry be not entirely new returned be suggested also that since can not have incorruptibility might alter moral standard remove corruption by making transaction mere matter of business if there be longer penalty attached to sale barter of public privilege such sale barter must cease to be dishonor crime must be better if be infinitely worse theory may appear bold at first blush no not at first blush for blush be to be done away with at first sight will say in preference may appear bold after much reflection have decided that be only practicable one be undoubtedly brilliant replied richard a say must simplify matter wonderfully must not be at such loss to know what senator blundel will do

more established fact one must always number among one acquaintance clever dowager remarked agreeable well bred reliable man friend man one can ask to do thing if unforeseen occasion arise must be agreeable since one must be intimate with for same reason must be well bred notwithstanding large circle be rather lonely pair dear gradually mr sylvestre have found slight change taking place in manner toward arbuthnot became conscious of liking better of giving more mental attention a saw more familiarly idea dawned by slow degree upon that triviality of accused be of unusual order that be accompanied by quality peculiarity did not seem to belong to have discovered that must deny pleasure desired that be secretly thoughtful for others that be also secretly determined that have serious moment however persistently endeavored to conceal perhaps professor have given more information concerning than must have gained by observation in comparatively short space of time frivolous fellow said to one night laying affectionate hand on arbuthnot arm a be on point of leaving house together after having spent evening there frivolous fellow be friend of old age wonder why so do said arbuthnot assure that must not find reason professor there be kind of reason returned professor though be scarcely worthy of name frivolous fellow be not such trifler a seems interest to see seriousness continually getting better of when fancy have got under trodden under foot arbuthnot laughed again full careless laugh be so excellent answer to everything maligns dissector of emotion said desire artfully to give impression be not serious by nature be in fact seriousness be wicked world get better of statement mr sylvestre might have chosen to place reliance in a being plausible one if have not seen professor at other time when spoke of friendship of be certainly warm one then feeling that there must be reason for began to see reason for herself appreciate something of significance value change finally revealed in manner be so subtle in character that arbuthnot must not be sure when have first felt sometimes fancied have be at one time again at even now be not easy for to explain to why knew that be better friend there be incident in acquaintance always remembered a landmark incident occurred at close of season one bright moonlight night having fancy for making call upon bertha who be not well enough to go out for several day mr sylvestre made visit on foot accompanied by maid night be so pleasant that be walking rather slowly under tree near lafayette park when attention be attracted by sound of suppressed sobbing came from one of two figure standing in shadow near railing few yard ahead of figure be of man young woman instant saw man who be well dressed agnes sylvestre felt heart leap in side for recognized laurence arbuthnot stood quite near woman seemed trying to console control while le woman than girl revealing in childish face figure be most pathetic in youth helplessness wept wrung hand must be quiet have more confidence in agnes heard arbuthnot say then prompted by desperate desire to hear more to avoid being seen spoke to maid marie said will cross street when have crossed street chill in night air seemed to have struck began to shiver so that marie looked at in affright madame be cold said be possible that madame have chill be afraid so mistress replied turning about hurriedly will not make visit will return home few minute later mr merriam who have settled small figure comfortably in large arm chair by fire prepared to spend rest of evening with new book looked up from first chapter in amazement a niece entered room agnes exclaimed what have happened be ill why child be a white a lily be true that mr

with equal appreciation knew what to talk about too what subject to joke on however apparently communicative mood might be opinion be always kept thriftily in hand seems to talk good deal richard said testily after find out much of what really think bertha have discovered early in acquaintance if object in making house attractive to be that might be led to commit in way during visit that object be scarcely attained when at last appeared feasible to discus westoria land project in presence showed unwillingness to listen to ask question discussion being at end if note have be compared one must have said that have taken either side of question be balancing thing planefield said told must do may trust not to speak until have made up mind side of scale weight be on when discussion be being

occasionally found fault with habit what regarded a unnecessary conventionality of of surroundings good natured egotism never offended widower without family immersed in political business knew little of comfort of home life lived in two three room full of paper book pigeon hole took meal at hotel found convenient if not luxurious more than convenience have never yet occurred to to expect demand be not too dull to appreciate good fell in way after spending hour with amorys on two three occasion when have left scene of political labor fagged out of humor began to find pleasure relief in unceremonious visit looked forward to there came evening when bertha in looking over music came upon primitive ballad proved to be among recollection of youth aroused to enthusiasm by singing musical taste be not remarkable for cultivation be strongly in favor of pronounced melody be disposed to regard song a incomplete without chorus enjoyed when prejudice be pandered to bertha rather respected courageous if benighted frankness obstinate faith in obsolete favorite so sang ben bolt to harp once through tara hall others far le classical more florid while sang sat ungracefully comfortably by fire eye twinkling le watchfully rugged line of blunt featured face almost settling into repose sometimes when ended roused with something like sigh do like must say doe make forget 'the gentleman from indiana beenator from connecticut ' want to forget must reply with dogged good humor be not kind of fellow be safe to forget make recollection of more agreeable after while there be time when be not in best of humor when bertha have fancy that be not entirely at ease pleased with at such time visit be brief unsatisfactory frequently discovered that regarded with restless perturbed expression a if be not quite certain of own opinion of look at said to richard a if have moment of suspecting of something nonsense said richard what must suspect of of nothing answered think be what agreed to call never failed to shrink when twinkling eye rested upon with disturbed questioning in glance consciousness of shrinking be very bitter to in secret when guest approached on evening before referred to detected at once that be not in condition of mind altogether unruffled glance cast on about be not encouraging few nod of recognition bestowed be far from cordial hair stood on end trifle more aggressively than usual short stout body expressed degree of general dissatisfaction be next to impossible to ignore bertha did not attempt to ignore will tell something before speak to said something have put out of humor gave sharp glance then looked away over head of crowd there be always enough to put man out of humor said what lot of people have here to night what do come for have just be telling mr arbuthnot of reason answered be very few of good one came hoping to recover spirit came to look at said be frequently blunt there be bluntness about speech surprised answered with laugh however be always worth looking at said now have seen be looking at by time even more sharply than before seemed a if be bent upon reading in face answer to question have asked of before evidently did not find there be something wrong with said know what be know what to make of if must make anything of bertha amory replied might do service to society be out of question a to there being something wrong with there be something wrong with of there be something wrong with mr arbuthnot be not enjoying there be something wrong with senator planefield who have be gloomy evening planefield said ah yes there be here pretty often be be great friend of richard replied with discretion so have heard returned then gave attention to planefield for few minute a if found also object of deep interest after inspection turned to bertha again well said suppose enjoy must do be not enjoying replied doe not exhilarate a hoped must be out of humor be answer told so have just heard something like dropped in here to stay five minute take look at see if checked rubbed upright hair impatiently almost angrily be not sure that might be enjoying better said must like to know something more of than do if information can give began come said with sudden effort at better humor be way talk to planefield be too good friend for shrewd eye fixed on a if asking unanswered question again come said be blunt old fashioned fogy be good honest friend always have be glanced across room at richard who be talking to stubborn opposer of great measure making delightful beyond description wished for moment that be not quite so picturesque animated then gathered together think have be said hope will believe so well answered must like to believe anything else thought that perhaps have said more than originally intended changed subject abruptly made few comment upon people near asked few question finally went away having scarcely spoken to one why did not remain longer richard asked afterward when guest be gone be talking evening over be not in mood to meet people bertha replied said have heard something did not like have put out of humor think be something about about richard exclaimed why in heaven name about manner made think so answered coldly must not be at unnatural think may begin to expect such thing upon word said richard starting up think that be going rather far see with righteous indignation what imputation be casting on do suppose must allow to do anything that raised eye met with unwavering glance certainly not said quickly sentence remained unfinished not because felt that point have be admitted because for mysterious reason suddenly became impossible for to say more more than of late when have launched into one of spasmodic defence of have found checked by intangible power in uplifted eye certainly did not feel grievance le for experience until during last few month have always counted a one of wife chief charm that there be nothing complicated about that method be a simple direct a child have never seemed necessary to explain have not found so of late have even begun to feel that though there be outward breach in tenor of life almost impalpable barrier have risen between expressed wish did not endeavor to gratify manner toward with exception of fleeting moment when have felt check be entirely unchanged spirit of gayety ruled house a have always done yet be not always sure of exact significance of jest laughter jest be clever laugh have light ring there be difference puzzled because recognized in vague connection with tried in moment of leisure to explain have even spoken of to colonel tredennis on occasion when mood be confidential used to be a frank a child said have lightest way in world liked be rather feather headed fellow perhaps suited be gone now when laugh feel sure of when be silent begin to wonder what be thinking of thing thought word said to herself oftenest be will not last very long said over to herself at moment must not have sustained under for consolation found in beyond time when what faced from day to day must be over have not yet looked be curious thing said to arbuthnot seem to have ceased even to think of future wonder sometimes if very old people feel so a if there be nothing more to happen there be person who found event of present sufficient to exclude for time being almost thought of future person be colonel tredennis who have found responsibility increase upon also not least of responsibility being must be confessed that intimacy with mr richard amory of bertha have spoken be very intimate with richard have said have reason for making comment at first have be colonel who have made advance for reason of own later have not be necessary for to make advance having found relief in making first reluctant half confidence richard have gradually fallen into making others when have be overpowered by secret anxiety nervous distrust of everything finding alone with colonel admiring respecting above thing self control saw in self control meant safety silence under temptation to betray faintest shadow of trust reposed in have be impossible for to resist impulse to speak of trial beset having once spoken of be again impossible not to go little farther say more than have at first intended so have gone on from one step to until there have come day when colonel have checked for instant feeling only part of honor in man who be cooler of two who have nothing to risk repent wait moment said remember that though have not asked question so far be ready to hear anything choose to say tell what might wish have kept back to morrow devil take cried richard dashing fist on table must tell one will go mad misery impelled notwithstanding always told story in own way gave complexion more delicate than le graceful historian might have be generous enough to bestow have be too sanguine enthusiastic have made mistake have be led by duplicity of wily world into folly have be unfortunate more experienced than have betrayed confidence have be only natural must repose in throughout labyrinth of relation wound way graceful agile supple figure lightly avoiding obstacle here dexterously overstepping barrier there untouched by shadow that of misfortune at first spoke chiefly of complication bore heavily upon complication arising entirely from action of others committed to so little that colonel listened with apprehension more grave than open confession of greater blunder must have awakened in must tell more thought if there be le to tell grim fancy came to sometimes a listened that be a if watched man circling about edge of volcano drawing nearer nearer until at last in spite of impelled by dread necessity must plunge headlong in so richard circled about crater sometimes drawn nearer by emotion excitement of moment sometimes withdrawing trifle through caution a momentary in of circlings revealing little more of truth revelation be principally connected with westoria land scheme be such in many instance a colonel be not wholly unprepared to hear have not looked on during last year for nothing often when richard have be in gay good spirit have imagined telling nothing silent companion have heard pleasantry with foreboding must not control be not deceived by appearance of entire frankness knew that have not be told until one dark stormy night a sat in room richard be announced came in pallid haggard beaten by rain at lowest ebb of depression have have hard bitter day of have followed several others quite a hard bitter have be fagging about capitol going old round using old argument trying new one overcoming one obstacle only to find confronted with feeling that be losing ground where be matter of life death that must gain spirit courage deserting just when needed most being over dropped into office to find awaiting there letter containing news gave final blow sat down by table began outpouring graceful attractive injured colonel thought so a watched listened recognizing meanwhile incompleteness of recital making up mind that time have come when be safer that whole truth must be told in hour in have pondered upon subject gradually decided that occasion must arrive here be so at certain fitting juncture just a richard be lightly skirting delicate point tredennis leaned forward laid open hand on table with curious simplicity of gesture think said have better tell whole story have never done yet what do say boarder on floor below who have heard walking to fro on first new year night have spent in washington on many night since heard firm regular tread again during half hour in richard told in fitful outburst what have not found equal to telling before be not easy to tell in very clear connected manner be necessary to interlard with many explanation extenuation even when be supplied there be baldness about fact a gradually grouped together be not agreeable to contemplate richard felt gallingly know how appears to said know how sound be maddening side of look so much worse than really be there be not man living who must accuse of intentional wrong confound seem to have be forced into doing very thing be least natural to to do bertha must say must understand be always just generous yes said colonel must say have be generous mean have betrayed generosity cried richard that of course expected will find said colonel that others will say same thing have heard even more than worst misgiving have suggested to shock of have destroyed something of self control for time being be in lenient mood know what people will say richard exclaimed do suppose have not thought of thousand time know what must say if did not know circumstance be circumstance make difference fact that be circumstance not man began tredennis there checked beg pardon said coldly have right to meet confidence with blame will do good if can give help might better be silent there be circumstance appeared extenuating to suppose be angered by own anger a have often be before told that be making matter personal cause a usual how must hear that very generosity simplicity have be used against by man who must have guarded interest a first duty without burning with sharp fierce indignation if understand said only hope of recovering what have lost lie in success of westoria scheme yes answered amory with forehead on hand be diabolical truth have lost once be driven into saying to that if thing must fail must mean ruin to be truth too colonel stood still ruin to said ruin to wife ruin to child serious loss to old man who who trusted richard finished gnawing white lip see in exactly same light doe not make easier to bear be way thing look when fails suppose have succeeded may succeed yet trusted tell trusted be easy to see just what despair must seize if worst came to worst how powerless must be in clutch be like reed beaten by wind even now sudden paroxysm of fear fell upon great god cried ca fail what must say to how must explain thousand wild thought surged through tredennis ' brain a heard old sense of helplessness be strong upon to upright strength there seemed way of judging fairly of dealing practically with such dishonor weakness what standard must be applied to man who lied agreeably in very thought of action have scarcely made statement during last hour have not contained airy falsehood of whom be thought in momentary anguish not of bertha not of child not of gentle old scholar who have always be lenient with fault be of be thinking of richard amory robbed of refined picturesqueness by mere circumstance placed by bad luck at baleful disadvantage for few minute there be silence richard sat with brow upon hand elbow on table before tredennis paced to fro looking downward at length richard raised head did so because tredennis have stopped walk what be asked tredennis walked over to sat down be pale wore set rigid look chief characteristic of be that expressed absolutely nothing voice be just a hard expressed a little when spoke have proposition to make to said will preface by statement that a business man be perfectly well aware that be almost madness to make say 'almost ' let rest there will assume risk have run in westoria scheme invest money have charge of in something safer say there be chance of success will take chance what cried richard what sat upright staring did not believe evidence of sens tredennis went on without quiver of muscle speaking steadily almost monotonously have money said more than know perhaps have have recently legacy must of make comparatively rich man be not dependent upon pay knew before have family will not marry be fond of child of janey particularly must have provided for future in case have made bad investment in land transfer to invest in something safer if bill fails to pas exclaimed richard if fails to pas will have land on hand if pass will have made something by venture janey will be richer a stand venture have better be mine than yours have lost enough richard gave hair excited toss backward stared at a have done before slight cold moisture broke out on forehead mean began breathlessly do remember said tredennis what told of comment people be beginning to make have assumed form told must be best for for child that must be put end to if assume risk there will be farther need for to use to exert began to look white about mouth through iron stolidity there be something revealed before richard felt quail night blundel came in to wife reception remained so short time have heard remark upon influence be exerting over have have bad effect remark be made publicly at one of hotel turned little whiter something strength in have held down at outset leaped to surface have wife to to use said if have by heaven must have spared have held in hand be silent long time must not do now be mother of child cried clenching great hand woman be beginning to avoid men to bandy name to fro have deceived have thrown away fortune have used a instrument in scheme who be only outsider with right to defend defend for father sake for child for own be on verge of ruin disgrace offer chance to retrieve to retrieve take if be man richard have fallen back in chair breathless ashen in imaginings of what future might hold have never thought of such possibility a that must be man who must turn upon place interpretation so fiercely unsparing upon what have done under admiration respect for colonel there have be hidden must be admitted almost unconscious touch of contempt for a rather heavy unsophisticated personage scarcely versatile agile enough formed in mould somewhat obsolete quixotic safe person to confide in one to invite confidence passively by belief in what be presented to man to make good listener to encourage one to believe in one own statement certainly not man to embarrass discourage historian by asking difficult question translating too literally what be said have not asked question until to night face have said very little for on occasion among other thing richard have secretly though leniently felt to be trifle stolid have amiably forgiven for be very thing made sudden change appear so keen injustice injury amounted to breach of confidence that must have formed deliberate obstinate opinion of own entirely unbiassed by presentation of case offered to have spoken more than once be true in manner have suggested prejudice have be prejudice of primeval mind unable to adjust to modern condition easily disregarded by more experienced now be stolid no longer first word have startled richard beyond expression face said more for than word burned white with fire have hidden so long great frame quivered with passion of moment when have clenched hand have be in vain effort to hold still yet man who saw recognized in only wrath scorn have reference to perhaps be best that must have be so best that triviality be so complete that must see nothing be not in way connected with own personality tredennis gasped out be terribly harsh did not think even if must lie palter to said tredennis clenched hand still on table be not time for have tried before to make face truth have refused to do perhaps have made believe what told that harm be meant done know what harm have be done have heard talk of hotel corridor club hand clenched harder drew in sharp breath be time that must give thing up continued with deadly determination be willing to shoulder who else must do same thing one else said richard bitterly be not for sake do either be for sake of of ideal fancy be too fine for worldling to understand swear felt specially hard that be so yes replied colonel suppose might call that be not for sake a say have be one of fancy that man might even deny for sake of idea be not denying be only giving to child in one way meant to give to in must be willing to share with mother think then somehow richard began to feel that offer be demand that even if sanguine mood must come upon again must not find exactly easy to avoid seemed actually a if there be something in man principle of strength of feeling of conviction almost constituted right by might contend for what asked before in temporary abasement anguish of mind richard amory faltered said great deal be true argued case a have argued before being betrayed in course of argument by exigency of case to add fact a well a fancy endeavored to adorn position a much a possible naturally failure be not entire there be hope of passage of bill sometimes strong hope seemed if money have invested have be own if have not be for failure of speculation in other quarter if so much have not depended upon failure success must have run risk willingly there be indeed moment when almost appeared that companion be on point of making capital investment being much favored thereby be really not so bad a seems said gaining cheerfulness a talked after such day a have have man loses courage can not look at thing collectedly have be up down in scale score of time in last eight hour be where wear tear come in great deal depends on blundel have talk with carried farther than have ever be before farther said tredennis in what direction richard flushed slightly think sounded pretty well said there be use mincing matter have to be done have never be able to get at view of thing exactly wo say went very far afternoon be in desperate mood well think reached bottom half promised to call at house evening dare say be with bertha now something in flush have slightly excited triumphant air something in look tone caused tredennis to start in chair what be there for said what do mean richard thrust hand in pocket for moment seemed to have lost grace refinement of charm for moment be distinctly coarse undraped human being have gone to make evening call said if manages a well a have managed before a well a can manage man chooses to take in hand yet not give more than smile so investment if make may

impossible be not only not impossible returned mr merriam be extremely probable heard remark assured of must not go said agnes must manage to keep at home colonel tredennis remedy must go deeper than that answered fact that did not appear must only postpone end slight avoided one night must be stored up for future may be sure endeavored to speak calmly be not easy knew too well that change have come upon face a two woman must not see though have feared climax so long though have even seen day by day sign of approach fell upon a blow at last seemed even worse than in most anxious hour have thought might be have friend said friend have friend think there be besides ourselves who will defend must be strong remarked mr merriam there be of answered who be strong think know lady whose opinion will not go for nothing who be generous enough to use influence in right direction direction said mr merriam if opposing party find met by party more powerful than said tone will change a for

clever idea if must be induced to go be honest man said tredennis flushing be friend believe that sincerely believe must prove by going anywhere to serve if be true said mr merriam great deal will be accomplished though be little difficult to figure to one how must enjoy ball think will have pleasure of seeing replied colonel paused moment then added chance to have rather intimate acquaintance with have interested in work of mine lately have shown very friendly to must perhaps be easier for to speak to than for other friend of mr amory think must do better than other friend mr merriam said with kindly look at truth be that since first introduction to colonel tredennis blundel have taken care that acquaintance must not drop have found modest warrior at once useful entertaining have be able to gather from information be interest to count among store having obtained be not ungrateful indeed be led by appreciation of certain good quality recognized in into something bordering on attachment for new friend like fellow used to say energetically realizing something of friendliness more of honor worth of acquaintance colonel felt that might hope to reach heart by telling story simply with dignity leaving rest to a for lady of whom have spoken have little doubt that kind generous heart might be reached have seen evidence of truth charity too often to distrust be of course wife of secretary of state be thinking of good graceful gentlewoman whose just clear judgment knew must rely upon whose friendship must grant favor be very generous sympathetic said have heard speak most kindly of mr amory action in matter must have weight have confidence that will show feeling in manner will make deep impression have always be fond of professor herrick be a clever idea a other said mr merriam have drawn line so delicately heretofore that have influence even greater than be wielded by most of who have occupied position be decided dignified person capable of social subtlety oh exclaimed mr sylvestre seems very hard that must be bertha who must need such defence be miserable said mr merriam impatiently be disgraceful when one considers who be person to blame be very delicate of not to use name suppose there have be enough delicacy indelicacy must like to use a freely a other people do think remember have not be very fond of mr richard amory when colonel tredennis left turned step at once toward house of woman who be friend upon whose assistance so much depended to gain sympathy seemed first thing to be done one thought repeated again again in mind how will say

be great deal of prejudice shown of course need expect nothing else be sure professor herrick can know nothing of will tell what know be came to do said colonel still paler perhaps there be great deal to tell more than world will ever know be only to such a that must be told there be more emotion in voice face than have meant to reveal perhaps something in kind anxiousness of companion eye moved

that be only woman who can aid be woman who say thing a rule who can unsay action of men in such matter be of le weight than must be though be true there be one man who might do service be thinking of

land scheme be discussed with freedom vigor light being cast upon from side upon subject have promised most there be marked silence only in one paper there appeared paragraph scarcely more written with much clearness with combined reserve directness must not fail to carry weight be very well done said so much in little with such unmistakable faith in own statement such suggestion of foundation for faith that be something of shock to who have delighted in most elaborate ornamentation of original story in effect be denial not only of ornamentation of story left liberal commentator not fact to stand upon so that became temporarily prey of discouragement spiritual gloom be not little added to by event of day there be however sense of discouragement in mind of senator blundel a attired for
