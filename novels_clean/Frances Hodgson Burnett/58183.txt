of most voluble diffuse mood displayed knowledge of trade mechanic with gentlemanly ostentation talked of trade union master difficulty introduced manufacturer politics expatiated on continental weakness weighed question of demand supply touched on protective tariff blast said haworth growing bitter mentally think be up to naught else be right a father talked miss ffrench joined in seldom listened looked on in manner of haworth be conscious from first to last thought made way into mind finally that looked on a if matter did not touch her at be only faintly curious about eye rested on

miss ffrench listened with slight demonstration of interest did not understand conversation be being carried on between father murdoch made pretense of doing so be very clear to said to haworth a stood near other be clear enough to said haworth signifying murdoch with gesture upon miss ffrench smiled little be not sensitive upon subject of father hobby coarse frankness of remark amused notwithstanding lack of interest drew nearer to engine finally stood looking at feeling at once fascinated unpleasantly overpowered by heavy invariable motion be a stood in way little later that murdoch glance fell upon next instant with simultaneous cry of terror broke from others have thrown forward dragged back by main force among thunderous wheel rod shaft there be slowly twisted torn ground into shred fragment of delicate fabric of dress be scarcely work of second father staggered toward white trembling good god cried good god what word died upon bloodless lip freed from murdoch grasp stood upright did not look at at looked at father lightly brushed with hand sleeve at wrist despite pallor be difficult to realize that only held erect by terrible effort of self control why said why did touch in manner haworth uttered smothered oath murdoch turned about strode out of room did not care to remain to hear explanation a went out into open air fellow workman passing by

be in place at twice risk same day mr ffrench have made visit to work for purpose of setting mind at rest expressing gratitude in graceful manner in fact be rather glad of opportunity to present upon ground so soon again on confronting hero of hour found that somehow affair dwindled assumed altogether incidental unheroic aspect rather high flown phrase modified took different tone be very reserved very shy said afterward to daughter be not easy to reach at outset there seems lack of enthusiasm about so to speak will come to house asked miss ffrench oh yes suppose will come be very plain that must rather have stayed away have too much good taste to refuse point blank to let speak to good taste repeated miss ffrench father turned upon with manifest irritation good taste repeated petulantly can not see that poor fellow be gentleman wish must show le of nonsensical caste prejudice rachel suppose one necessarily dispenses with good deal of in place like answered in making friend with mr haworth for instance mr ffrench drew nearer to rested elbow upon mantel with rather embarrassed expression wish to to behave well to haworth said faltering great deal may may depend upon looked up at

going to work said may be there night wait for feel anxious when great building loomed up before in dark mind recalled instantly night have entered before attracted by light in window there be light about now that shut in lantern carried immensity dead stillness must have be trying thing for many man to encounter a relocked door made way to den thought of only from one point of view be silence of grave said man can concentrate upon work a if there be not human breath stirring within mile of somehow even room wore look seemed to belong to silence of night look felt have not seen before marked with vague sense of mystery when set lantern down upon table turning light upon spot on work must stand then took down case opened removed model will not be forgotten again thought aloud if be to be finished will be finished here night passed before returned home when did so went to room slept heavily until daylight have never slept a slept in night heavy dreamless sleep from at first used to

dark door be shut locked a have left went back to work little disturbed have not really expected to find trace of presence in place have felt best to make matter safe perhaps fact that once twice on other night same light indefinite sound fell upon ear again made feel rather more secure than otherwise having examined place again with same result troubled no more set down to ordinary material cause after first visit haworth came into room often why came murdoch did not understand very clearly did not come to talk sometimes scarcely spoke at be moody abstracted went about place wearing hard

storm haworth have held own weathered worst be what county potentate be fond of saying upon occasion particularly when wanted haworth to dine with at house used to accept invitation then go sit at dinner table with sardonic face humor be remarked with regret be often of sardonic kind occasionally laughed at wrong time joke be not always easy to smile under be also remarked that mr ffrench scarcely seemed comfortable upon festive occasion of late have not be in enjoyment of good health explained that suffered from nervous headache depression refined well molded face have become rather thin fatigued looking have lost effusive eloquence often sat silent started nervously when spoken to did not eschew society at always going out upon state occasion when partner be to be feature of feast once upon occasion have said privately with plaintiveness to haworth think can go to night dear fellow really feel quite equal to blast said haworth dispensing with social code will go whether be up to not will keep up to end will be over soon enough evinced interest in model in visit to work room seemed little singular to murdoch asked question about more than once repeated caution concerning being kept close have got into head that will finish of day said once if naught happens to chapter xlviii finished one night murdoch on leaving house said to christian expect until morning may not be back until then think will work night did not ask why for several day have seen that singular mood be upon that be restless sometimes when met eye unexpectedly started colored turned away a if be little afraid stood upon step watched until disappeared in darkness then shut door went in to mother quarter of hour afterward entered work room shut in brought out model sat looking at moment then stretched forth hand to touch suddenly drew back let fall heavily upon table good heaven cried did ever feel so near a then fail shock be almost unbearable be there to be two of said be not one

blue neck cloth knotted under ear a approached mr briarley looked up keeping eye fixed upon in despairing gaze did not remove glance at in fact until murdoch be within ten foot of when for entirely inexplicable reason rose hurriedly passed to other side of road at distance of yard ahead sat down stared wildly at again singular course pursued until have reached end of lane where sat watched out of sight thowt said breathing with extreme shortness a have ' done fur wur wonder a did na if 'd coom nigh 'd coom nigh 'd have ' swore wur a did be gone accordin if luck went ag'in then sudden panic
