familiar with other to throw aside restraint there be nothing to distract one ferrol said nothing to rouse one nothing to inspire one nothing be delicious why did know of before have plenty of time to study sister friend rode walked with olivia when made excursion listened while read aloud to a lay on grass in quiet corner of ground thought natural reserve held from expressing opinion on what read very freely certainly did not occur to that be beginning literary education under guidance must see that thing pleased most be not lost upon face told that one moonlight night a sat on upper gallery began to speak of novelty of aspect of country a presented to outsider who saw for first time be new life new people said by way olivia where be new specie of young woman be to see daughter of people

broken be who broke know what mean said in low voice know have done in little while got up began to roam aimlessly about gallery strolled from one end to other with hand thrust in coat pocket olivia who have remained seated knew that be waiting in hope that louisiana must return have be walking to fro looking a miserable a possible for about hour when at last saw pause turn half round before open door of upper corridor leading out upon verandah black figure stood revealed against inside light be louisiana after hesitating moment moved slowly forward have not recovered color manner be perfectly quiet be glad did not go away said ferrol have only stood still at first waiting pleasure instant spoke made quick step toward must have felt very hard thing not to have seen again before slept said made reply walked together in silence until reached opposite end of gallery miss ferrol have gone in said then turned to look saw such be case suddenly for reason best known to herself olivia have disappeared from scene louisiana leaned against one of slender supporting pillar of gallery did not look at ferrol at blackness of mountain rising before ferrol must not look away from if have not come out again said after pause think must have remained here baying at moon night then a made reply began to pour forth quite recklessly can not quite understand how hurt said seemed to that must have hurt even while understand there be word abject enough to express what feel now have felt during last half hour if only dared ask to tell stopped ca tell said be not fault be nothing must have understood be fault fault deserve be terribly discouraged be bewildered said be very unhappy turned pretty pale face round to swiftly be not who need be unhappy exclaimed be next instant have checked again just a have done before let talk of something else said coldly will not be easy for to do so answered will try before olivia went to bed have visit from received with embarrassment must be confessed day by day felt le at ease with more deeply convicted of blundering to young woman of temperament be sharp penalty louisiana must not sit down revealed purpose in coming at once want to ask to make promise said want to ask pardon do said olivia want to promise that will not tell brother truth until have left here be at home will go away very soon be tired of what have be doing be different from what meant to be must promise that if stay after have gone a of course will will not tell home be only few mile away might be tempted after thinking over to come see must not like want to stop here mean part of want to know rest olivia have never felt so helpless in life have self poise tact other daring quality left wish faltered gazing at girl quite pathetically wish have never begun so do said louisiana do promise y yes must promise anything have hurt feeling confessed in outbreak be destined to receive fresh shock at once girl be metamorphosed again be old ignorant sweet simple self who stood there with trembling lip dilated eye yes have cried yes have burst into tear turned about ran out of room chapter vi road to right morning after ferrol heard announcement came upon like clap of thunder after breakfast a walked about ground olivia who have seemed to be in abstracted mood said without preface miss rogers return home to morrow laurence stopped short in middle of path to morrow exclaimed oh glanced across at louisiana with anxious face yes said be going home to new york live in new york spoke quite simply word be shock to embarrassed there be coldness in manner displeasure in tone of course understood that must be worse than tactless to inquire further be possible that did not care that must know where lived there seemed other construction to be placed upon word flushed little for few minute looked rather gloomy though quickly recovered afterward changed subject with creditable readiness did not tell lived in new york asked olivia first time be alone together olivia answered trifle sharply why new york more than place for reason really returned more bewildered than ever there be reason why must choose new york only when spoke to of certain place there paused thought matter over carefully before finishing sentence ended at last in singular manner said nothing said be actually true now think of said nothing whatever because said nothing began olivia drew hand across forehead with puzzled gesture fancied looked a if knew said slowly be sure looked a if knew what be talking about a if knew place mean be very queer there seems reason in why must wish to know where life must confess cried olivia that be getting little tired of be treacherous vicious knew be guilty conscience increasing sense of having bungled drove to desperation if have not promised to keep truth to herself must have be only too glad to unburden be so stupid after have only to blame laurence drew long breath can not be tired of said that be impossible take firmer hold upon one hour be certainly true a far a be concerned be often even surprised at own enthusiasm have seen so many pretty woman that be almost inconsistent that must be so much moved by prettiness of one charming creature particularly one who spoke so little who after be there always found at full stop must not say what be did not know yet really seemed nearer solution of mystery than have be at first there lay fascination felt so sure there be immense deal for to discover if must only discover have ideal in mind ideal felt confident be real creature if must only see during episode on upper gallery fancied have caught glimpse of what be to be revealed sudden passion on pale young face fire in eye be what have dreamed of if have not be possessed of courage honest faith in born of goodly amount of success must have be far more depressed than be be going away have not encouraged to look forward to meeting again own be rather bad to look at said to if one quite believed that fate must serve one ill turn never played trick however wo believe will will see again sometime will turn out fairly enough surely so with consolation supported there be one day left meant to make best of be to be spent in driving to certain mountain about ten mile distant tourist who be possessed of sufficient energy made excursion a matter of duty if from more enthusiastic motive strong light carriage pair of horse be kept in hotel stable for express purpose of conveying guest to special point vehicle ferrol have engaged day before a matter have developed have cause to
