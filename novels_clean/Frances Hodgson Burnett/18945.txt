spoken now be young man speaking almost a if be little boy involuntarily revealing exaltation a have felt half frightened year before so felt wholly frightened now be not little boy longer must not sweep away in arm to save from danger also knew more of easy fashionably accepted view of moral of pretty mr gareth lawless still lightly known with cynicism a feather knew what donal did not relationship to head of house of coombe made unlikely that gossip must choose a exact young man to whom must be related story of distinguished relative mr gareth lawless girl through year helen muir have unavoidably heard thing thought particularly hideous here child be again just same have only grown up laugh be like lightly indrawn breath cheek be just a much like rose petal wonderful little look eyelash just same do girl usually grow up like that be look most be sort of asking giving at once there be have nothing to say must only sit look at at beautiful youth alight with sudden flame of

flower of music young nymph like tossed blossom never allowed for moment to lose sight of mr gareth lawless ' girl be light floating over vision of happy youth of assembly be centre beginning ending of chapter ii if uncomplex minded even moderately articulate man woman living in small ordinary respectable london house going about work in customary way have be prompted by chance upon june th to begin to keep on date day by day diary of ordinary life effect of huge historic event a revealed by day incident to be noted in street to be heard in neighbour house a well a among fellow worker to be read in penny half penny newspaper must have resulted if record have be kept faithfully without self conscious sense of audience between in gradual compiling of human document of immense historical value compared with diary of defoe pepys must pale be flavourless must have be begun in june have be written with casualness of commonplace realism be most convincing realism of be true that expression of uncomplex mind be infrequently articulate record must bring home clearest truth must be one unpremeditatedly depicting effect produced upon wholly unprepared undramatic personality by monstrous drama a second deluge rose for apparent overwhelming carrying upon flood old civilisation broken from anchor half submerged a tossed on rising raging wave such priceless treasure a might have be quite unliterary unromantic diary of say mr james simpson of house number in respectable side street in regent park st john wood hampstead one can easily imagine sitting in small comfortable parlour bending over blotting pad in unilluminated cheerful absorption after day work can also without special intellectual effort be imagined that record might have begun with such seemingly unprophetic entry a follows june th made up mind when be at office to day must begin to keep diary have thought several time must harriet think must be good thing because must have to refer to when there be little dispute about date thing have happened to night seemed good time because there be something to begin first entry with harriet spent part of evening in reading newspaper account of assassination of austrian archduke wife there seems to be good deal of excitement about because be next heir to austrian throne assassination occurred in bosnia at place called sarajevo crawshaw whose desk be next to mine in office belief will make nice mess for bosnians servians because have be rather troublesome about wanting to be united into one country instead of two called greater serbia seems silly sort of reason for throwing bomb killing people foreigner have way of thinking bomb settle everything harriet brought out old school geography looked up sarajevo on map of austria hungary be hard to find because print be small be spelt saraievo without j in be just on line between bosnia servia geography said be chief city in bosnia harriet said be queer thing how place on map never seemed like real place when looked up just read name yet probably people in be a real to a be there be street in a real a lupton street where be sitting finding on map on sitting room table said that bomb be pretty real thing sound of one when exploded seemed to have reached long way to judge from newspaper talk in london harriet said putting like gave queer feeling almost a if have heard have made jump somehow seemed something like to at rate sat still minute two thinking over then harriet got up went into kitchen made nice toasted cheese for supper before went to bed men of james simpson type be among many who daily passed coombe house on way to from office work of doubt caught sight of lord coombe a walked drove through entrance gate knowledge of be founded upon rumoured story repeated rather privately among be great swell there be many shady thing have done did know in out of remoteness from own life rendered accepted legend scarcely prejudicial perfection of clothes unusual preservation of physical condition good look also habit of so called week end continental journey be point chiefly recalled by incidental mention of name if james simpson on way home to lupton street with friend crawshaw chanced to see lordship car standing before door few day after bomb throwing in sarajevo might incidentally have referred to somewhat in wise a passed by coombe house marquis of coombe came out got into car there be smart leather valise travelling thing in rug so a if be going on journey be fine looking man for one be lived life have reached age see how be done when said to crawshaw that looked a if be going away for week end crawshaw said that perhaps be taking saturday to monday off to run over to talk to kaiser old franz josef about sarajevo business might telephone to czar about because be intimate with whole lot seem to be getting mixed up in thing writing letter sending secret telegram seems to be turning out a crawshaw said must into nice mess for servia austria be making out that assassination really be committed to stir up trouble say be done just by crazy anarchist by secret society working for own end crawshaw came in to supper talked over harriet gave cold beef pickled onion beer looked at map in old geography again got quite interested in finding place bosnia servia be often spelled serbia be close up against austria hungary germany russia be close against other side can get into other country without much travelling heard to day that russia will have to help servia if have row with austria crawshaw say will give germany chance be be waiting for that will try to get through belgium to england say hate england harriet began to look pale a studied map saw how little belgium be that channel be so narrow said felt a if england have be silly to let get so slack almost wished have looked at geography said must help thinking how awful must be to see german army marching up regent street camping in hyde park who in goodness name knew what might do to people if hated england so actually looked a if must have cried if crawshaw have chaffed made laugh by telling must join army crawshaw began to shoulder arm with poker got new umbrella in domesticated almost comfortable fashion did greatest tragedy human race have known since beginning of world gradually prepare first scene reveal glimpse of a curtain of time be during june slowly raised by hand of fate be not what be known a war story be not even story of war relation of incident occurring amidst resulting from strenuousness of period to war be background so colossal that dwarfed event except in mind of for whom such event personally shook darkened brightened world nothing can dwarf personal anguish at moment of highest power to last agony despairing terror of heart wrung cataclysm of earthquake tornado shipwreck be awesome back drop of scene also incidentally story be one of transition in convulsive change of point of view produced by convulsion flung into new perspective whole surface of earth race existing upon head of house of coombe have a said be born at once too early too late to admit of fixed establishment of taste ideal existence have be passed in transition from one era to early victorian under whose disappearing influence have spent youth late victorian edwardian in whose more rapidly changing atmosphere have ripened to maturity have during transition seen from afar slow rising of tidal wave of second deluge in summer day of heard first low roaring of torrential swell visualised that overwhelming power of bursting flood might sweep before bury forever beneath weight made seemingly casual crossing of channel journey be made up of surmounting of obstacle when returned brought with knowledge of thing must have be unwise to reveal carelessly to general public mind of general public have parallel at moment in temperature of patient in early stage of a yet undiagnosed typhoid other fever restless excitement spasmodic heat discomfort prompted ruled tendency be to nervous discontent suspicious fearfulness of approaching vaguely formulated evil rising of temperature be to be seen in very street shop people be talking talking talking ordinary people common people kind of class majority of did not know what be talking about most of talked either uneducated frightened blustering nonsense everybody talked more le enormous number of newspaper be bought flourished about pored over anxiously number of young german be silently disappearing from place in shop factory warehouse be how germany showed readiness for military happening army be already trained must be called from country walk in life mysterious unheard command called be obliged to obey entire male population of england have not be trained from birth to regard a immense military machine ready at moment for action james simpson type of englishman indulged in much discussion of pro con of enforced military training of youth germany well known contempt of size power of british army took on aspect filled james simpson with rage have not previously thought of a martial because middle class england be satisfied with belief in strength entire safety of course be safe always have be britannia rule wave james simpson be sure that incidentally ruled everything else a there stole up behind mature simpson haunting realization that if england be drawn in to war must be young simpson who must gird loin go forth to meet goliath in armour with only sling stone of untrained youth valour a weapon there be many who began to feel that even inconvenient drilling discipline might have be good thing there be something quite thrilling in going about now said feather to coombe after coming in from shopping round made in new electric brougham one doe know what be be in air see in people face actually shop girl give one impression of just having stopped whispering together when go into place ask for something girl who be trying on glove for be thin girl with prominent watery eye have such frightened look said to just to see what must say ' wonder what must happen to shop if england got into war turned quite white answered 'oh madam ca bear to think of favourite brother soldier be such nice big fellow be so fond of be always talking about say germany not going to let england keep out be so frightened mother ' almost dropped big tear on glove must be quite exciting if england did go in must coombe answered london must be crowded with officer sort of thing must have to be given for ball thing cannon ball among other thing said coombe must have nothing to do with cannon ball thank goodness exhilaration sweeping past unpleasant aspect one must be sorry for tommies of course if worst came to worst must say army navy men be more interesting than most civilian be constant change in life having to meet so many kind of people in actual war men who be not merely 'tommies actually take part coombe suggested be looking at ball room full of night after news came from sarajevo fine well set up youngster dancing with pretty girl must not help asking must have happened to before german army crossed channel if be not able to prevent crossing what must happen to girl after crossing when poured over london rest of england in unbridled rage of drunken victory so spoke because beneath outward coldness felt secret rage against lightness a saw thing have parallel in order of trivial unawareness in more important place larger brain feather started drew somewhat nearer to how hideous what do mean where be party asked be small dance given by duchess very kindly for robin answered for robin with open eye whose incredulity held irritation old duchess giving party to 'useful companion girl what nonsense who be there sharply young fellow who must be first called on if there be war girl who be relative halwyn be there young dormer layton be in army cannon ball must be for a well a for

again be man whose intense interest in profession did not confine wholly to scientific aspect extraordinarily beautiful child swooning into death be not mere pathological incident to knew many strange thing brought about by abnormal condition of war be conscious of being overstrung with rest of tormented world knew of mr gareth lawless have heard more story of household loveliness lord coombe than have time to remember have of course heard unsavoury rumour of child who be being brought up for nefarious object a knew lord coombe rather well did not believe story about went beyond certain limit not until have talked to duchess for time did discover that hard smitten child lying half lifeless in bed be very young heroine of quite favourite scandal knowledge gave furiously to think be coombe who have interested duchess in duchess have doubt taken under protection for generously benign reason pursued questioning delicately have have young friend seems to have taken walk alone even to have gone into country by life of young people in ordinary sense of companionship amusement have be stopped by war there may be who go on in old way have not be one of duchess said visit to old woman in remote country place be not stimulating enough have have companion tried said duchess wearily be rather pale news of sarajevo tragedy arrived on day gave small dance for to bring young people together waxen pallor became even more manifest how danced said woefully what living thing be oh exclamation broke forth at suddenly overwhelming memory beautiful boy splendid lad who be blown to atom news came only yesterday be there dancing with rest dr redcliff leaned forward slightly to hear that boy have be blown to atom be hideous thing said who brought news be miss lawless in room when be brought think so though be not sure come in go out very quietly be afraid forgot everything else shock be great one old friend lord coombe brought news boy must have succeeded hear again again of great family becoming extinct house of coombe have not be prolific war have taken toll donal muir be last of one have felt a though be of great importance that thing like must be carried on began to speak in half numbed introspective way what doe matter really only one boy of thousand perhaps hundred of thousand before be over be youngness power potential meaning wasted torn scattered in fragment stopped sat quite still gazing before a though into space be very young have be absorbed in war work living in highly charged atmosphere for time dr redcliff said presently if knew poor lad did not really know well though have met a child danced together that night sat talked in conservatory never saw again duchess explained might have be too much even if did not know well must keep quiet said dr redcliff very shortly afterwards rose went away hour later be sitting in room at coombe house alone with lord coombe be room in mademoiselle valle have found lordship on night of robin disappearance one knew now where mademoiselle be if be still alive have be living with old parent in serene belgian village have be destroyed by german black tale have be told of robin have be allowed to hear nothing have be protected in many way though have not be intimate two men knew other well to individually type of other be one must understand be plain to lord coombe that redcliff found case of rather special interest felt be scarcely to be wondered at a have seen too slender prostrate figure bloodless small face with curtain of lash lying too heavily close to cold cheek have realised that helpless beauty alone be enough to arrest more than ordinary attention have a woman have cried out looked a if be dead dead loveliness be reaching power dr redcliff spoke of thoughtfully with certain gentleness at first included with many other girl change in whose method of life have be observing closed gate in path be suddenly thrown open for because one have to lock unlock said produce curious effect light minded one take advantage of fact find dangerous amusement in sometimes serious one go about work have taken in hand miss lawless be gather one of thinking feeling one have gone about great deal yes duchess have tried to save from own ardour perhaps have worked too steadily have duchess always known where have gone what people have seen must have be impossible wished to feel free if have not wished one can see that must not have be possible to stand guard over neither be necessary began to listen with special attention there awakened in mind consciousness that be being asked question suggested object next one added to awakening sense of thing exercise holiday be always taken alone redcliff said duchess believed so have evidently be living under poignant strain ghastly shock have struck down think must have be in room when brought news of young muir terrible death be said coombe saw then forgot thought so redcliff went on cried out several time 'blown to atom atom donal ' be not conscious of cry be sure said 'donal ' coombe asked quite sure be that set thinking have thought great deal have touched horribly mere sight of be enough there be desolation in childlikeness lord coombe sat extremely still room be very silent till redcliff went on in dropped voice there be thing said whispered brokenly word by word did not know that whispered one will ever know ever lord coombe still sat silent what be thinking must not be read in face being man of astute perception used to study of face dr redcliff knew that suddenly startling thought have leaped within be right to come to said what be suspect that dr redcliff be almost unbearably moved be manifest be not man of surface emotion face actually twitched hastily gulped something down be heartbreakingly beautiful thing said have be left through sheer kindness in own young hand be too young be hour of cataclysm know nothing doe not know that will probably have child chapter xv swiftness of process by glowing little miss lawless at whom people have found involuntarily looking so often changed from rose of girl into something strangely like small waxen image walked called forth frequent startled comment be glanced at even oftener than ever be going into galloping consumption little chin have grown quite pointed eye be actually frightening be early observation girl who be going into galloping consumption cough look hectic be weaker day by day have cough be hectic though be known that dr redcliff saw frequently insisted that be not ill begged duchess to let go on with work done for woe in face be inexplicable in girl who have have love affair have not even known one who must have flirted with ridden away little thing done for cry out aloud ca bear to look at one woman protested will send away if doe not improve duchess said will go to remote place in highland will not be allowed to remember that there be war in world if can manage to send old nurse dowie with will stand guard over like old shepherd also have be struck by look have be spoken of a done for girl did not look like for common reason asked question with great care sat on foot gradual delicate cross examination of robin discovered reason common uncommon for thing recognised time looked at be inevitable that must talk to lord coombe met in sort of barrier must not avoid seeing that be preoccupied remotely felt that be turning over in mind something precluded possibility of giving attention to other question almost feel a if interest in have lapsed said at last have taken entirely new form be answer be when glance encountered hers after said regarded other with slow growing anxiousness something came to life in pair of eye be something disturbed reluctant duchess spoke first have have companion said painfully war put end to what thought might do for there have be nobody at present be curious fact that in one sense know very little of other life answered old leisurely habit of observing detail no longer exists a redcliff said in speaking of girl generally gate be thrown wide open duchess be very silent for space before made reply yes know mother two week ago gave something to reflect on feeling for daughter be that of pretty cat like woman for something enragingly younger than always resented be infuriated by interest in said to one afternoon ' hope duchess be still pleased with companion saw to day in bond street looked like housemaid once have to dismiss rather suddenly be glad be in grace house not in mine ' after few second be glad be in house not in hers duchess said after have spoken to at length have quite lost temper added evidently know that have be meeting donal muir told so at erwyn asked if have seen since dance owned that have then be cross at for making slip did not ask how often have met must not have told if met once met a often a chose ' be not lying when said know have be thinking constantly ever since there be brief silence between then proceeded robin worshipped when be mere baby be very beautiful together on night of dance fainted on stairway after hearing of death have be crawling up to hide in room poor child be one of tragedy perhaps together duchess be seeing again two who have come forth shining from conservatory continued to see a lord coombe went on speaking telling what dr redcliff have told on part robin scarcely understood anything be happening because nothing seemed to matter on morning when duchess told that dr redcliff wished to see alone fact mattered a little a rest be indifferently conscious that duchess regarded in anxious kind way if have be unkind instead of kind must have meant nothing there be only room for one thing in world wondered sometimes if be really dead a donal be did not know be so perhaps after people died walked about a did did not understand that others must not see be not alive if be dead must surely see donal before went to dr redcliff duchess took hand held closely in own looked at with curious sort of pitifulness a if be sorry poor child said whatsoever tell be frightened think be without friend will take care of thank said think anything must frighten nothing seems frightening now after went into room where dr redcliff be waiting for duchess sat alone thought deeply what thought of chiefly be head of house of coombe have always known that more than probably attitude towards circumstance of sort must not even remotely approach in likeness that of other people point of view must detach from ordinary theory of morality immorality must see with singular clearness side of incident must not be indignant annoyed embarrassed have have interest in robin a creature representing peculiar loveliness undefended potentiality sometimes have felt that have even verged on tenderness of be remotely if at conscious concerning boy donal have realised that felt something stronger deeper than word of own have at time expressed have believed fine thing of have watched silently have wished have be own flesh blood perhaps have always felt longing for son who might have be companion a well a successor who knew whether thwarted paternal instinct might not now be giving such thinking to do a might have done if donal muir have be son of body dead on battlefield leaving behind something to be gravely considered what must man think must man do under such circumstance one might imagine what men must do must depend entirely upon type thought what will do will be different might seem cold might be merely judicial might be surprising be quite haunted by haggard look of face a have exclaimed wish to god have known better wish to god have talked to more what have done morning be to go to mersham wood to see mr bennett there be thing might be possible to learn by amiable carefully considered expression of interest in loss loneliness concerning such thing a did not already know must learn nothing from conversation concerning such thing a have become aware of must learn everything without alarming if unhappy child met at cottage wandered about in mersham wood together tragedy be understandable duchess thinking ended pityingly because just at time be that robin opened door stood looking at seemed a though dr redcliff must have talked to for long time have on small hat coat what duchess seemed chiefly to see be wide darkness of eye set in face suddenly pinched small snow white looked like starved baby please said with hand clasped against chest please may go to mersham wood to mersham wood duchess felt aghast then suddenly flood of thought rushed upon be not very far little gasping voice uttered must go please oh must just to mersham wood something almost uncontrollable rose in duchess throat child said come here robin went to oh poor little soul in utter obedience a drew close to went down upon knee holding up hand like little nun at prayer please let go said again only to mersham wood stay here poor child talk to duchess said time have come when must talk to one when come back will try want to ask wood said robin caught at fold of duchess dress went on rapidly be not far dr redcliff said might go mr bennett be there love be going to talk to mr bennett no not to one in world hapless young creature in plight must always be touching touchingness be indescribable almost unendurable to ripe aged woman of world who watched heard be a if knew nothing of meaning of thing a if little spirit have be torn from heaven flung down upon dark earth one felt that one must weep aloud over exquisite incomprehensible remoteness of be so awfully plain that there be tragic connection with wood that whole soul cried out to must not speak to one in world such thing have be known be child brain wavering why not world be mad be older woman thought after year have for moment sense of balance felt a if old reason for thing have be swept away if will come back said will let go after poor child have gone there formulated in mind thought that if lord coombe mr bennett met together clarity might be reached then again said to herself oh why after must be asked question what can matter to rest of woeful world if hide forever in heart sat with drooped head knowing that be tired of living because thing be so helpless chapter xvi wood be gradually growing darker have be almost brilliant during part of afternoon because bareness of branch let in wintry sun there be leaf to keep out there have be rare chill blue sky seemed cold blue sky where be not brown sodden yellow fern moss trunk of tree looked stark tall slender white stem of birch stood out here there among darker growth like ghost who be sentinel be always silent place now stillness seemed even added to by one sound broke sound of sobbing sobbing sobbing have be going on for time there have stolen through narrow trodden pathway dark slight figure have dropped upon ground under large tree be one of group whose branch have made few month ago canopy of green where bird have built nest where one nightingale have sung night after night to moon later robin have said to herself must go to cottage must sit upon hearth lay head on mr bennett knee must cling together sob talk of battlefield boy lying dead there have thought of saying other thing to because there be nothing left to say have said nothing to dr redcliff have only sat listening to feeling eye widening a tried to follow understand what be saying in grave low toned cautious way a if be almost afraid a went on what said must once have be strange wonderful now be not because wonder have gone out of world only seemed to sit stunned before feeling now dream be not sacred secret longer there grew within a heard wild longing to fly to wood a if be living human thing who must hear understand a if must be like arm enclosing something must be there listening must talk to ask what to do have spoken to a staggered down path have cried out to with wild broken word then when heard nothing have fallen down upon earth sobbing sobbing have begun donal said donal again donal over over nothing answered for even have be donal with heavenly laugh blue in gay eye fine long smooth hand have be blown to fragment in field somewhere there be nothing anywhere have heard footstep be sobbing still when voice spoke at side voice of one standing near be donal want poor child one else said that must be voice lord coombe amazing a be to hear be not amazed did not care sobbing ceased so far a sobbing can cease on full flow lay still for low shuddering breath have come because be donal said told once that have always

cry together together oh little lovely love ' who must have borne torment rather than betray secret of dream now that must no longer be secret lay reft of memory wild longing to hold to breast shred be own let wail when wailing ceased helplessly bent over listen to said if donal be here must tell to listen be child be too young to know what have come upon did not speak be too young be driven by fate if have be more than boy if have not be in frenzy must have remembered must have thought yes yes knew how young oh what mattered youth thought remembering small hand beat in soft impatience on ground be strangely on one knee beside head bent close in voice there be new strong insistence a if must not let alone oh donal donal must have remembered that might leave child voice be almost hard did not know that in mind be memory now in secret broke memory of belief be thing have held a gift certain faith in clear young highness strength of body soul in one scion of house even in youth madness must have remembered if lad have be own son might have felt something of same pang word brought back what have heard redcliff say to earlier in day thing have only struck again to earth will have father shuddered there be not even grave put hand on shoulder even tried to force to lift head must have father said harshly look at must stupefied lost to thing a be heard something in harshness

lived through tragedy have be long ago since then have only known thing of world have seen struggle trick paltry craftiness have known of woman caught in trap of folly passion weakness have learned how terror taught to lie shift even show abnormal cleverness above knew exactly what world must say if poor wretch of girl told story like of youngster like donal when be no longer on earth to refute yet if wild thing be true here in wintry wood sat desolate undefended thing with one thought in be most remote in being be conscious that be for moment relieved because even worldly wisdom be not strong enough to overcome desire to believe in certain thing be that boy must have played fair even when brain whirled fierce youth beset a regarded saw that must be difficult to reach mind be so torn stunned by method must reach must answer question ask said be for donal sake did not lift face made protest began to ask such question a sane man must know must be answered clearly a heard reply to

creature utterly unawake to man who be of world who have lived long life in contemplation of be strange baffling thing ask whether believe spoke quite low silence of darkening wood be unearthly dropped word scarcely stirred have never even thought of be inwardly shaken by own feeling will believe if will believe be what said singular sharp new desire impelling merely lifted face little so that eye rested upon because of tragic thing must believe will be necessary that must what have thought of with regard to mother be not true believed because world did denial on part must merely have

did matter must not feel even sorry will try answered be no use a yet saw what be trying to deal with be in new dimension held out hand helped to foot wood be growing very dark said must go will take to mr bennett can spend night with wood be growing dark indeed be obliged to guide through closeness of undergrowth threaded way along narrow path shadow seemed to close in behind before reached end must have led out into open put hand on shoulder held back in wood even now there be something must be saved from suffering be helpless be blameless be not be not donal god help spoke steadily strangely voice be so low that be almost whisper though be not one for first time felt something stir in stunned mind a if thought be wakening fear vague quaking wan small face began to wonder in dark roundness of eye question be to be seen like drowned thing slowly rising from deep of pool asked question only waited few moment let look at until said at last in voice a near whisper a own will believe chapter xvii be alone with duchess door be closed world shut out by own order leaned against high back of chair watching intently a listened walked slowly up down room with long pace have be doing for time have told from beginning to end singular story of what have happened when found robin lying face downward on moss in mersham wood be what be saying in low steady voice have not once thought of what most woman must have thought of before anything else if be speaking to person than must say that be too ignorant of world to will say that be not merely girl be unearthly luckless embodiment of pure spirit of love knew only worship rapt giving of gift unearthliness made forget earth folly madness of course incredible madness must seem to most people decently intelligent lad losing head wholly not regaining sens until be too late to act sanely perhaps not quite incredible to there must have be day seemed to lad like like last hour of condemned man in midst of love terror agony of farewell what time be there for sanity believe duchess said yes impersonally in spite of world flesh devil also know that one else will to most people story will seem thing trumped up out of fourth rate novel law will not listen to will when see unawakened face have seen be duchess interpolation saw when went upon knee prayed must let go to mersham wood there be something inexplicable in remoteness from fear shame be only woe self did not comprehend be merely baffled old woman of world now begin to see believe a do world law will laugh at because have none of accepted reason for belief believe a do absurd a will seem to others yes will seem absurd coombe said slowly pacing here be here be what do see before asked of deep thought see helpless girl in dark plight a far a knowledge of how to defend herself go be a powerless a child fresh from nursery life among people with observing eye already noting change in piteous face place in house make centre of attention observation of beauty happiness have be good natured so far observation will continue in time character will change see before anything else be first thing to be considered answered next paused thought seriously be mother perhaps mr gareth lawless have sharp eye said to something rather vulgarly hideous about being glad daughter be in house not in hers last word to robin be to warn not to come to for refuge 'if got into mess be in what mr gareth lawless must call ' mess be what good many people must call duchess said doe not even know that tragedy must express in mere vulgar colloquialism with modern snigger in presently poor child when awakens little more will begin to go about looking like little saint do see that a do thought did that be moved by though did not say so be thinking first of mother mr gareth lawless must see hear nothing be not criminal malignant creature light malice be capable of playing flimsily with atrocity have not brain enough to know that can be atrocious robin can be protected only if be shut out of whole affair be simply speaking truth when warned girl not to come to in case of need for little longer can keep here duchess said a look ill will not be unnatural that doctor must advise to send away from london be not possible to remember anything long in life live now will be forgotten in week that part of will be simple yes answered yes paced length of room twice three time said nothing watched a walked knew be going to say more also wondered what curious thing might be have said to herself that what said did must be entirely detached from ordinary archaic view also have guessed that might be extraordinary perhaps a extraordinary a long intimacy with mr gareth lawless be there possibility that be going to express now be not said at last ended pondering walk by coming nearer to sat down touched newspaper lying on table have be poring over said have be doing same thing have also be talking to people who know thing to who ought to know just now news be worse day in midst of roar thunder of cataclysm to talk about mere girl trouble ' appears disproportionate because world seems crumbling to piece about assumes

gripped old have not let go there be thing can not bear to see lost forever without struggle such a said very low conceal thing from answered rise confront there be day when at least believed quite obstinately in number of thing sometimes quite heroically admitted save queen ' in long day have actual glow passion have thrilled glowed at shouting song of yes drew little nearer to cold face gained slight colour in day when son grandson be born to head of house be serious impressive affair yes knew at once recalled own son george in flanders meant new generation generation counted for decent dignity a well a power farmer must say with huge pride mine have worked place for four generation a must say of owner of land have held for six century century generation be in danger of longer inspiring special reverence be future thing to be count thing to be yes duchess said knew that be drawing near thing have to say suppose be born dogged sort of devil went on almost in monotone fact did not manifest to until came to time when rest of dropped into bottomless gulf that perhaps describes found suddenly standing on edge of youth future belief in use of hoping real enjoyment of thing dropped into blackness be gone while looked on if have not be born dogged devil must have blown brain out if have be born gentler kinder more patient must perhaps have lived down found there be something left man way of facing thing depends upon kind of thing be born went on living without rest of closed mouth not only mouth life a far a other men woman be concerned when found interest stirring in shut door be went on did behind shut door there be thing went on duchess gently suggested in hidden way yes be what be coming to when first saw mr gareth lawless sitting under tree suddenly stopped harshly need not put into word to then pause a if for breath have way of lifting eye a very young angel might have quivering spirit of smile soft deep curled corner to mouth saw same thing in old photograph bought likeness be oh be hellish that resemblance must be in le than hour after spoke to have shut door be obliged to go look at again again resemblance drew by time husband died knew well enough to be sure what must happen man must pick up throw aside then one else must have held nothing long must have passed from one hand to until be tossed into gutter swept away quivering spirit of smile of must not have shut door on prevented kept clean by shutting door right left have watched over at time have bored frightfully after year so behind door have shut child robin have sometimes thought so said duchess did not know why exactly be not affection attraction be sort of resentment of beastly unfairness of thing bottomless gulf seemed to yawn in path when be nothing baby everything be being tossed into before have taken step began to keep eye on prevent thing assist be more fury than benevolence have gone on for year behind shut door be quite sure have be entirely free from affection for duchess asked question impersonally though with degree of interest think so be le sure have power to feel what be called 'affection ' for one think have felt something nearer for donal for than for one else when child talked to in wood felt for first time wished to know that relation to mother be not reason for hating have believed will be made to understand said duchess must said because of rest last four word be a be italicised now felt be probably about to hear chief thing have be approaching so waited attentively behind door have be shut thing said

devil own job when first speak to about will almost be driven mad chapter xix robin have spent night at cottage mr bennett have be very good to have sat by fire together for long time have talked of dead boy on battlefield while robin head have rested against old fairy woman knee shrivelled hand have stroked patted tremulously have be nearing dawn when girl went to bed at last mr bennett have held on to dress asked pleading question be there anything 'd like to do for anything on earth miss dear sometimes there be thing old woman can do young one ca if there be anything 'd like to tell

railroad journey back to london seemed unnaturally long because brain began to work when found half blindly gazing at country swiftly flying past carriage window perhaps anxiousness in mr bennett face have wakened thought in connecting with lord coombe word look in wood when door of house in eaton square opened for be conscious of shrinking from sympathetic eye of war substituted woman servant who be one who have found lying on landing knew that face be white that eyelid be stained heavy that woman saw be sorry for mountain climb of stair seemed long steep reached room at last took off hat coat put on house dress did automatically a if be going downstairs to work a though there have be no break in order of living a be fastening little hook button stunned brain went on with thought to have begun to awaken in train since hour when have fallen unconscious on landing have not seemed to think at have only felt thing have nothing to do with real world there be fire in grate when last button be fastened sat down on seat before looked into redness of coal hand loosely clasped on knee sat there for several minute then turned head looked slowly round room did because be impelled by sense of emptiness by fact that be quite alone in there be only only robin in be first feeling aloneness then thought of something else seemed to feel again hand of lord coombe on shoulder when held back in darkened wood must hear almost whispered word in wood even now there be something must be saved from suffering be helpless be blameless be not be not donal god help then be not alone even a sat in emptiness of room put up hand covered face with will happen murmured did not cry deadliness of blow have stupefied still left barely conscious of earthly significance something of dark mistiness be beginning to lift slowly reveal to vague shadow shape a be if one must believe that be married to donal then people must think that have be kind of girl who be sent away from decent house if be servant cut off in awful disgrace from family never spoken to again if belongs to upper class book benevolent society speak of a fallen lost vision of such thing be at once vague primitive took form of pathetic fictional figure memory of hushed rumour heard by mere chance rather than of anything more realistic dropped hand upon lap looked at fire again now will be like said listlessly doe not matter donal knew care care duchess will send away whispered next perhaps will send away to day where will go hand on lap began to tremble suddenly felt cold in spite of fire sound of knock on door made start to foot woman who have looked sorry for when came in have brought message grace wish to see miss said thank robin answered after servant have gone away stood still moment so perhaps be going to tell now said to empty room two aspect of face rose before duchess a girl entered room where waited for with lord coombe one be that have met glance when mademoiselle valle have brought charge on first visit recalled impression of childlikeness seemed dark dew of appealing eye be like young doe bird rather than girl other be star like radiance of joy have swept down ballroom in donal arm with dancing whirl swayings pretty swoop about have laughed swirled boy now lying dead under heavy earth of flemish field donal face looked small almost thin younger than ever eye be like of doe who be lost frightened a if heard quite near baying of hound knew must not get away hesitated moment at door come here dear duchess said lord coombe stood by chair have evidently placed for did not sit down when reached hesitated again looked from one to other did send for to tell must go away said what do mean child said duchess sit down lord coombe said spoke in undertone rapidly think mean to turn out of house a if be kitchen maid robin sat down with listless small hand clasped in lap nothing matter at said know what to do there be great deal to do duchess said to did not speak a if be angry expression be not angry one looked a if be wondering at something wondering be almost tender know what to do must be done without delay said lord coombe voice reminded of mersham wood come nearer to come quite close want duchess did not explain what wanted pointed to small square ottoman must place robin almost at knee own early training have be of statelier victorian type be not easy for to deal freely with outward expression of emotion here emotion sprang at throat so to speak a watched childish thing with frightened doe eye girl have be inmate of house for month have be kind to have become fond of have never reached even border of intimacy yet emotion have seized upon be in midst of strange powerful drama robin did a be told struck duchess that always did a be told spoke to hoping that voice be not ungentle look at a if be afraid be going to take care of said doe eye be still great with hopeless fearfulness lord coombe said that one must believe robin faltered thought be not married to donal be be wanted to be married to wanted to do everything wanted to do loved other so much be afraid one must be angry so many be killed day before be killed oh with sharp little cry be glad be glad happens to be glad be married to before be killed poor child broke from duchess poor poor mad young thing put arm about robin because barrier built by lack of intimacy be wholly overthrown robin trembled over looked up in face may begin to cry quavered want to trouble by beginning to cry must not cry if want to cry duchess answered will be better said lord coombe if can keep calm be necessary that must be calm enough to think understand will try be for donal sake will try answered amazed eye still yearningly wondered at duchess arm have felt almost like dowie of will begin to explain to duchess questioned will may be better be going to take care of be not to be turned into street though perhaps if be turned into street without money must die somewhere must not matter because must be thankful duchess took one of hand held on knee looked kind still be grave be frightened when tell that most people will not believe what say about marriage said be because be too much like story other girl have told when be in trouble be easy story to tell when man be dead in donal case so much be involved that law must demand proof must not be denied donal not only owned estate of braemarnie must have be next marquis of coombe have not remembered more slowly with certain watchful care have be too unhappy ill have not have time to realise that if donal have son heard robin caught breath what father must have inherited must inherit also braemarnie must be in turn must be marquis of coombe be because of important thing that must be said that must be immensely to interest to insist that be married to donal muir law must not allow of shade of doubt people must think wanted money castle for robin said blankly must think that if be dishonest woman wanted must get even if be not actually dishonest must see must want for son might think ought to be whether father have married not most woman love child robin sat very still stunned brain be slowly working for

much except that be donal can never feel a if be dead again never no answered never lay so still for few minute that if eye have not be open must have thought be falling asleep be so dreamy that perhaps be falling asleep softly rose to leave think be trying to come nearer murmured good night dear chapter xl ominous hour have come gone wave of gloom have surged in receded never receded far enough be a though rising falling of primaeval storm be background of thought life pandemonium of sound foretold far off heaving of vast tidal wave gathering unearthly power a swelled coombe talking to close friend in few quiet hour at eaton square found support in very atmosphere surrounding world at war creates prehistoric uproar said earth called out of chaos to take form may have produced such tempestuous crash there be far off glow believe something believe too prehistoric darkness uproar be so appalling one loses hold duchess leaned forward voice dropping what do know that light

exact psychological moment if have come in at beginning must have faced first full force of monstrous tidal wave of colossal german belief in own omnipotence must have faced unawakened unenraged by

world others have borne first fierce heat burden of day will rush in young untouched by calamity bounding shouting singing will come armed with long borne horror maddening human fatigue most need repeat will occur at exact psychological moment will bring red hot blood furious unbounded courage will be end in fact coombe waited with tense sensation of being too tightly strung have hour when felt that something might snap nothing must snap yet be too inextricably entangled in arduous work even to go to darreuch for rest did not go for week be well there however marvellously well seemed even when held in mind letter from robin have ended have not come back be not afraid promised must never be afraid again in dark tired hour steadied with singular half realised belief that must not that somehow strange thing must be left to whatsoever be taken away be because felt a if be nearing end of tether have become hypersensitive to noise to sound in street to strain grief in face saw a walked drove after lying awake one night without moment of blank peace came down pale saw that hand shook a held coffee cup be livid sort of morning when went out for sake of exercise found be looking at of strained face a if held answer to unformed question realised that tenseness of mind body have increased for reason whatever be restrung by sense of waiting for something a if something be going to happen went back to coombe house when crossed threshold confronted elderly unliveried man who have stood at place for year usually unperturbed face be agitated so nearly to panic that stopped addressed have anything happened lord red cross nurse have brought be actually quite unsteady too unsteady to finish for next moment red cross nurse be at side looking very whitely fresh clean with nice serious youngish face need not prepare for good news even if be sort of shock said watching closely have brought captain muir back to have brought exclaimed have be in one of worst german prison be left for dead on field taken prisoner must not ask question know why be alive escaped god know how at time doe not know saw on boat asked to take charge of spoke very quickly be skeleton poor boy come led way to own private room went on talking short hurried sentence scarcely heard then be what have be waiting for why have not known tremendous thing be really not so tremendous after because have happened in other case before yet have never once thought of must not let wife mother see until looked more like heard red cross nurse say a entered room donal be lying stretched at full length on sofa looked abnormally long because be so thin that be a nurse have said skeleton face be almost death head blue eye looked out of great hollow socket clear a tarn water with smile coombe must not have forgotten howsoever long life have dragged out be very careful whispered nurse knew must be careful only eye be alive body be collapsed thing seemed scarcely breathing voice be thread robin coombe caught a bent close to robin be well dear boy how voice shook have taken care of light leaped up into blue for second next lid dropped nurse sprang forward because have slipped into faint so much like death that might well have rent hope from looker on for next hour indeed for many following there be unflagging work to be done red cross nurse be capable swiftly moving woman with resource at finger end quick wit about almost immediately two doctor from staff in charge of room be on spot at work with by what lightning flashed sentence conveyed to without pausing for second fact be necessary for to know be incomprehensible to coombe who must only stand afar off wait watching dead face sunken temple cheek eye sharply carven bone outline be heart gripping seemed hour before one of doctor a bent over couch whispered breathing be little better be not possible that must be moved couch be broad deeply upholstered must be used temporarily a bed resource of medical science be within reach nurse jones who have be on way home to take rest be so far ensnared by unusual interest that wished to be allowed to remain on duty there be other nurse who must be called on at moment of night day there be doctor of indisputable skill who be also fired by mere histrionic feature of case handsome fortunate young fellow who have be supposed torn to fragment have by incomprehensible luck be aided to drag home perhaps to die of pure exhaustion be really hour before coombe saw closed eye weakly open smile be gone seemed to be looking at something not in room will come in word dragged out scarcely to be heard jackson said said must eye dropped again breathing be mere flutter nurse jones be in fact filled with much curiosity concerning interest in marquis of coombe be clever well trained person socially simple creature who in inoffensive way loved lord if work have not absorbed must not have kept eye from finely conventional rather unbending looking man who keeping out of way of who be in charge of seemingly almost dead boy still must not leave room watched with restrained passion of such feeling a be not natural to see in eye of men marquis not have gone through frightful thing in life boy meant something tremendous to if must be brought back despite work swift eye darted sideways at marquis when at length nurse took place be going out of room moved quickly towards spoke may ask if may speak to alone for few minute have right to keep from rest assure wo will come answered what saw in man face be that because have brought boy actually clung to have be clung to many time before never by man who looked quite like there be more than must see led to smaller room near by made sit down did not sit be plain that did not mean to keep from bed though be in hard case

if 'd be must have got help earlier 'd be ill treated have seen thing made lose balance must tell clear story be too weak to talk clearly asked question now then listened to word said when rambled because of fever jackson be fellow prisoner who died of hemorrhage brought on by brutality often must understand kept bringing in name of jackson one thing puzzled very much said several time taught to dream of robin must never have seen robin if have known jackson ' now ' be boy name said ' two three time a if be girl robin be wife said coombe really found support of door still held open useful for moment odd new interest sharpened in eye then be be dreaming of almost jerked out a if in sudden illumination almost relief be be dreaming of may have kept alive paused a if be asking question of own mind wonder dropped from in slow speculation if have be dreaming of be not dead be not angel be donal robin have persisted from first have not be dead in incredibly hideous german prison in midst of inhuman horror blackness of what must have be despair have be alive have dreamed a have nurse jones looked at waiting even if nurse have not be presumably under such bond of honourable secrecy a constrained medical profession knew be to be trusted very look told did dream of said be slipping fast down slope to death caught back saved life child be going to have child be quite silent for few moment room be still then woman drew hand with quick odd gesture across forehead queer thing happened in last century queerer one be going to happen in if people will let doctor nurse see think lot ca

deep in blue eye be made of can only flicker up for second now ca go out be safe even minute though may believe do believe coombe said stood there believing when went through open door left chapter xli be long before dropped eyelid must lift hold open for more than few second long before eye wore old clear look depth of collapse after prolonged torture of strain fear be such a demanded fierce unceasing fight of skill unswerving determination on part of doctor nurse there be hour when what seemed to be strange deathly drop into abyss of space struck terror into most of who stood by looking on nurse jones always believed so did coombe need send for mother yet said without flinching know something others know lord coombe child baby be holding back though know anything about revealed to that interest in thing occult apparently unexplained by material process have during last few year intensely absorbed in private feeling though intense be intelligent process of argument be often convincing became willing to answer question because felt sure of lent book have be reading in hard earned hour of leisure plunged deep into perhaps read sometimes when ought to be sleeping rest tell rest be finding out that there be strength outside of can draw on be there waiting said everybody will know about being there in course of time time seems long said coombe concerning dream have many interesting theory be at first disturbed puzzled because have stopped be anxious to find out whether have come back again like lord coombe realised that robin apparent calm must on account be disturbed if health giving serenity must be sustained for certain length of time gate of heaven must open to at first nurse jones asked lord coombe troubled question came about at length that appeared one night in room where first private talk have taken place have presented herself on way to bed because have something special to say came to when awakened morning a if have be told to in night thing often seem to come way do remember lord coombe that said only talked about happy thing yes said several time coombe answered do remember that never told where came from knew that must not ask question how must have told of hell how must be right quite feel sure be when can talk will tell if remembers wonder how much remember except relief blessed happiness of lord coombe believe a believe be in room that when knew be going to face awful risk of trying to escape knew must tell knew that in crawling through danger hiding in ditch must never be sure of being able to lie down to sleep concentrate on sending soul to so told that might not come for time oh lord if 'd be caught killed must never obstinately even then must have got back in form in way have got to point of believing a much a that be hers yes yes yes be slow answer there be deep thought in detached word when went away walked up down room with leisurely step looking down at carpet a many hour of day night a in authority must allow lord coombe sat watched by donal bed watched from well hidden anxiousness to see subtle change recording on being watched from throbbing affection longing to see at once tinge of growing natural colour unconscious movement perhaps shade stronger than last be son who lay there told be son have remotely yearned for in loneliness if have be father watching sunk lid with bated breath must have felt just unmerciful pang also watched because in boy hour of fevered unconsciousness must at time catch word sometimes broken sentence threw ghastly light upon thing past sometimes significance be such a made shudder condition doctor most dreaded be one in monstrous scene seem lived again scene in cruelty maddening suffering despairing death rose vividly from depth of subconsciousness cried aloud for vengeance sometimes donal shuddered tearing at chest with hand more than once lay sobbing until only skilled effort prevented sob from becoming choking danger may be year after regains strength chief physician said year before will be safe to ask for detail on own part must never bring such horror back to man may have noticed how men who have borne most absolutely refuse to talk be accursed fool who try to make broke in one of younger men there be fellow who have be pinned up against barn door left to hang there coarse loud mouthed lunatic asked to describe how felt chap must stand do know what did sprang at knocked down apologized afterwards said be nerve there be not man who be there who will ever speak to other brute again man whose name be jackson seemed to be clinging memory to skeleton when mind wandered in past hades have be in way very close to boy have died somehow cruelly there have be blood blood one must help devil have even laughed when scene came back doctor nurse held breath silently worked hard nothing seemed quite a heart rending a what have happened to jackson there be endless other thing to shudder at so time passed nurse jones found many time that must stop at door on way to rest to say look like lord coombe need not send for mother yet then at last have be like travelling for month waterless in desert came in one day with new elate countenance mr muir be quiet self controlled woman be asked entirely self controlled very quiet answered then if will speak to dr beresford about know will allow to see captain muir for few minute thank god be not because if doe see now will never see alive again have life before please sit down coombe spoke hastily placed chair a spoke did so because have perceiving eye sat down covered face with apron for moment made sound movement caught deep quick breath two three time relaxed strain have temporarily overpowered uncovered face got up almost immediately be not likely to give way openly to emotion thank lord coombe said have never have case gripped hold of a have have often felt a though poor half killed boy be more to than be might speak to dr beresford now be just gone in therefore lord coombe went that afternoon to house before grew plane tree whose leaf have rustled in dawn first wind on morning donal have sat talked with mother after night of dowager duchess of darte dance on way thought be almost uncontrollable thing knew first demand of good sense be that must control be like unbelievable messenger from world dark world unknown because shadow hid must not let be pierced by streaming human eye donal be dead be what must fill woman mind when entered house donal be dead be thought have excluded all else from life for though knew have gone on working a other broken woman have done what did people say to woman whose son have be dead have come back to life have happened before what must one say to prepare for transcendent shock of joy what preparation must there be god help said to with actual devoutness a stood at door have seen helen muir once twice since news of loss have reached have looked like most beautiful ghost shadow of herself when came into drawing room to meet be more of ghost shadow than when have last met saw lip quiver at mere sight of though came forward very quietly whatsoever helped in response to unconscious appeal brought to suddenly wave of comprehension of of a creature unexpectedly near other a have never be before feeling be remotely akin to what have be awakened in by pure gravity tenderness of robin baptismal good bye kiss be human be human have be forced to bear suffering be bringing joy to met almost a entered door made several quick step took hand in held be thing so unheard of stopped stood quite still looking up at come sit down here said drawing towards sofa did not let hand go sat down at side while stared at breath began to come go quickly what began be changed quite different yes be changed everything be changed for for touched breast weakly for a well a yes answered still held hand protectingly kept altered eye eye of strangely new man upon be living human longing to help who have so long condemned hand be even warm held hers a if to give support be calm well balanced woman said joy doe not kill people even hurt there must be only one joy only one knew knew there must be other

over in breast if have known panted low if have known other did not later bit by bit told of jackson only of jackson never spoke of other thing when put together bit by bit amounted to be queer simple sort of american be full of ideal kind of unbounded belief in country have enlisted in canada at beginning always believed america must come in be sure german knew must be why hated american more saw stirred up more hated fellow caught worse treated be hellish to jackson have stopped at point coombe have noted dreaded look dawning in eye go on boy be bad for broke in donal shook head little a if
