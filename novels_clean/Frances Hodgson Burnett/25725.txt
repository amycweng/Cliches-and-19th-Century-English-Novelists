watched until be out of sight chapter ii liz th ' owd lad be at trick again be rough comment made on joan lowrie appearance when came down to work next morning joan looked neither right left went to place without word not one among have ever heard speak of misery wrong have known to do otherwise than ignore fact that existence be well known among fellow worker when derrick passed on way to duty looked up from task with faint quick color replied to courteous gesture with curt yet not ungracious nod be evident that not even gratitude must lead to encourage advance notwithstanding did not feel repelled disappointed have learned enough of joan in brief interview to prepare to expect other manner from be none le interested in girl because found forced to regard curiously critically at distance watched a went about work silent self contained solitary that lass o ' lowrie said superannuated old collier once in answer to remark of derrick eh hoo rare un hoo be th ' felly be haaf feart on tha ' see hoo getten bit o skoolin ' hoo con read bit if tha will believe mester with touch of pride not a th ' owd chap ivver did owt fur that road speaker went on nothing loath to gossip with

set mind to do owt ' will do here said derrick to paul night a engineer leaned back in easy chair glowering at grate knitting brow here said be creature with majesty of juno though really nothing girl in year who rule set of savage by mere power of superior will mind yet woman who work at mouth of coal pit who can not write own name who be beaten by fiend of father a if be dog good heaven what be doing here what doe mean reverend paul put up delicate hand deprecatingly dear fergus said if dare if own life life of others must let think must be tempted to give up a one give up other puzzle when one be beaten by derrick looked at forgetting in sudden sympathetic comprehension have be more than ordinarily discouraged to day said what be grace do know sammy craddock be reply sammy craddock ' said derrick with laugh be 'owd sammy ' who be talking to to day about joan lowrie dare say be sighing if know sammy craddock know one of principal cause of discouragement went to see afternoon have not quite quite got over in fact derrick interest in friend trial be stirred a usual at first signal of distress be part of stronger more evenly balanced nature to be constantly ready with generous sympathy comfort have struck said that craddock be one of institution of riggan must like to hear something definite concerning why be principal cause of discouragement in first place because be man of others whom be hard for to deal with because be shrewdest most irreverent most disputatious old fellow in riggan yet in face of because be so often right be forced into sort of respect for right repeated derrick raising eyebrow be bad grace rose from chair flushing up to root of hair right reiterated yes right say how ask can man battle against faintest element of right truth even when will must arraign on side of wrong if must shut eye to right see only wrong might leave at least blind content can not can not if must look upon thing a barholm doe here stopped suddenly checking thank god can not put in derrick quietly for few minute reverend paul paced room in silence among men who be once fellow worker craddock be oracle went on influence be not unlike joan lowrie be influence of strong mind over weaker one sharp sarcastic speech be proverb among rigganites amuses can make listen to when hold up 'th owd parson ' to ridicule sweep before can undo in hour what have struggled year to accomplish be collier until became superannuated know nature see what have to say about barholm asked derrick without looking at friend however oh protested be worst side of be miserable be wretched may a well speak openly barholm be strong card be what baffle scan barholm with eye of eagle doe not spare single weakness study know favorite phrase gesture by heart have used until there be not riggan collier who doe not recognize when be presented to applaud a audience might applaud staple joke of popular actor explained even thus far case looked difficult enough derrick felt wonder at friend discouragement when have heard story to end understood fully living at riggan have never be happily managed have be presented to men who did not understand people under charge to men whom people failed to understand possibly have never before fallen into hand of man who be so little qualified to govern rigganites a be present rector reverend harold barholm man who have mistaken vocation who have become ever so faintly conscious of blunder may be stumbling block in path restrained a will be by secret pang of conscience can scarcely be active obstructionist man who having mistaken field of life labor yet remains amiably self satisfied unconscious of unfitness may do more harm in serene ignorance than might have done good if have chosen proper sphere man a last be reverend harold good natured broad shouldered tactless self sufficient person have taken up work with complacent feeling that field of labor must fail to be benefited by patronage be content now a always have be content with intellectual progress at oxford have be content with first parish at ashley wold have be content then with gentle natured soft spoken kentish men woman have never feared finding unequal to guidance of soul be not at troubled by prospect riggan presented to be different sort of thing said to curate in best of spirit new to new of course will get over will get over easily enough grace so with not shadow of doubt a to speedy success with comfortable confidence in ecclesiastical power in whomsoever vested called upon parishioner one after other appeared at cottage at hour gave same greeting to of be new rector having come to riggan with intention of doing good improving moral condition intended to do good improve in spite of must come to church be business to come to church a be business to preach gospel implied in hour half friendly half ecclesiastical conversation garnished with few favorite text religious platitude man felt that have done duty done well only one man nonplussed even man effect upon be temporary only lasting a long a call have be met with dogged resentment in majority of visit when encountered 'owd sammy craddock ' encountered different sort of opposition aye said owd sammy ' so tha'rt th new rector art ta thowt a mich a ud spring up a soon a th ' owd un wur cut down tha parsens be nettle a dunnot soon dee oot well will leave thee to th ' owd lass here hoo be rare un fur gab when hoo ' taks th notion be noan so mich ' th ' humor t ' argufy mysen today took pipe from mantelpiece strolled out with imperturbable air be not last of matter rector went again again cheerfully persisting in bringing old sinner to proper sense of iniquity there must be triumph in converting such veteran a sammy craddock be confident of winning laurel for result be scarcely what expected 'owd sammy ' stood ground like old soldier fear of man be not before eye 'parsens be favorite game be a contumacious profane a such men be apt to be delighted in scattering clerical antagonist a task worthy of mettle encountered reverend harold with positive glee jeered at in public sneered at in private held up to mockery of collier men lad with dramatic mimicry made so popular character a derrick have said sammy craddock be riggan institution in youth fellow have feared strength in old age feared wit let sammy tackle said when new comer be disputatious hard to manage owd sammy th ' one to gi ' one fur nob owd sammy will fettle graidely fact be that craddock cantankerous sharpness of brain tongue be usually efficacious so tackled barholm so tackled curate for reason be never actually bitter against grace spoke of lightly rather sneered at physical insignificance did not hold up to public ridicule hav ' not quite settled moind about th little chap must say sententiously to admirer be noan siccan foo a th ' owd un for be graidely foo ' be mistake at rate little foo ' be better big un there matter stood against tremendous odds grace fought against coarse perverted nature worse than against power must have be ranged upon side added to discouragement be obstacle of physical delicacy almost morbid conscientiousness man of coarser fibre might have borne burden better at least with le pain to drop so of barholm blood in grace vein said derrick communing with on knoll road after interview few drop of barholm rich comfortable stupid blood in grace vein must not harm yet must have to be few drop indeed hastily on whole think must be better if have more blood of own following day miss barholm came business have taken derrick to station in morning being delayed be standing upon platform when one of london train came in there be generally so few passenger on such train who be likely to stop at riggan that few who did so be of interest to bystander accordingly stood gazing in rather preoccupied fashion at carriage when door of first class compartment opened girl stepped out upon platform near before seeing face one might have imagined to be child of scarcely more than fourteen fifteen be derrick first impression when turned toward saw at once that be not child yet be small face with delicate oval feature smooth clear

glance derrick have unconsciously fallen into place of centre figure be talking others be listening mr barholm in usual restless fashion mr barholm with evident interest anice leaning forward on ottoman listening eagerly ah exclaimed mr barholm when servant announced visitor be fortunate here be grace glad to see grace take seat be talking about uncommonly interesting case dare say know young woman anice looked up be talking about joan lowrie said mr derrick be telling about most interesting affair from beginning to end continued rector briskly something must be done for young woman must go see will go see have caught fire at once in usual inconsequent self secure style ecclesiastical patronage must certainly set young woman right at once there be doubt of who be so well qualified to bestow a yes yes will go said that kind of people be easily managed when once one understands there really be good in after see grace be a have told only understand make understand rest be easy derrick glanced from father to daughter clear eye of girl rested on man with curious expression do think said quickly that like to go see in sort of way papa do think be wise to remind that know more than do that if want to learn must learn from just because have be more fortunate really seems to that rebellious one must ask what right have to be more fortunate dear returned rector somewhat testily be not partial to interposition of obstacle even in suggestion dear if have be brought into contact with people a closely a have even a grace have must learn that be not prone to regard thing from metaphysical stand point metaphysics be not in line be more apt to look upon life a matter of bread bacon than a problem shadow fell upon anice face before visit ended derrick have observed presence more than once be always father who summoned noticed yet be evident enough that be fond of man in ordinary degree that affection be mutual a be contented with so barholm be contented with domestic relation be fond of wife fond of daughter a much perhaps through appreciation of own good taste in wedding wife becoming father of such daughter a through appreciation of peculiar charm be proud of indulgent to reflected credit on of felt wholly deserving be very fond of remarked grace afterward to friend show that there must be great deal of virtue in man indeed there be great deal of virtue in derrick must have observed certain kindliness open generosity with wistful sound in voice there be always wistful appeal in young man tone when spoke of clerical master certain anxiety to make best of refrain from suspicion of condemnation derrick be always reminded by of shadow on anice face want to tell something miss barholm said evening to grace at parting think be afraid of riggan at think will like better because be so new everything be so earnest energetic that be little bracing like atmosphere perhaps when time come must do something to help with girl will try at rate held out hand to with smile reverend paul went home feeling not little comforted encouraged rector stood with back to fire portly person expressing intense satisfaction will remind about young woman in morning anice said must like to attend to matter singular that grace must not have mentioned before really seems to know now then grace be little deficient in interest energy surely not interest dear suggested mr barholm gently well well conceded rector perhaps not interest energy appreciation must have seen fine creature superiority mentioned at once must be fine creature young woman of kind must be encouraged will go see in morning if be not so late must go now really ought to be told that have exhibited very excellent spirit that people approve of wonder what sort of household servant must make if be properly trained must not do at put in anice decisively from pit mouth to kitchen must not be natural transition well well a usual perhaps be right there be plenty of time to think of however can judge better when have seen did not need reminding in morning be a full of vague plan for joan lowrie when arose a have be when went to bed came down to charming breakfast room in most sanguine of mood then mood usually be sanguine be scarcely to be wondered at fortune have treated with great suavity from earliest year wellborn comfortably trained healthy easy natured world have always turned pleasant side to a young man have be strong handsome fellow whose convenient patrimony have placed beyond possibility of entire dependence upon profession when curate have be well enough paid without private responsibility when married be lucky enough to win woman who added to comfort in fact life have gone smoothly with for so long that have reason to suspect fate of intention to treat ill naturedly be far more likely that must reserve scurvy trick for one else even riggan have not perplexed at difficulty be not such a must be likely to disturb greatly one found ignorance vice discomfort among lower class always there be same thing to contend against in agricultural a in mining district rectory be substantial comfortable even picturesque house be roomy garden large capable of improvement there be tree in abundance ivy on wall anice must do rest breakfast room looked specially encouraging morning anice in pretty pale blue gown with few crocus at throat awaited coming behind handsomest of silver porcelain reading favorite newspaper while little pot of emigrant violet exhaled faint spring like odor from sunny place at window there be vase of crocus snow drop ivy leaf in centre of table there be sunshine outside comfort in rector have good appetite unimpaired digestion anice rose when entered touched bell mamma headache will keep upstairs for while said told be not to wait for then brought newspaper kissed dutifully very glad to see home again be sure dear remarked rector have really missed very much what excellent coffee be cup if please after pause

be well to make best of thing get along reasonably well with people encounter difficulty grace complains of doe complain asked anice did not think exactly complained grace be too easily discouraged answered rector in off handed explanation be apt to make blunder speaks of to people a if be of same fibre a doe not take hold of thing be deficient in courage mean well be not good at reading character that other young fellow now derrick engineer must do twice a well in place what do think of young fellow by way dear like said anice will help mr grace often grace need support of kind returned mr barholm frowning slightly doe not seem to rely very much upon not so much a must wish quite understand at time fact be have struck once twice that preferred to take own path instead of following mine papa commented anice scarcely think be to blame for be sure be always best that conscientious thinking people mr grace be thinking man must have path of own mr barholm pushed hair from forehead own obstinacy confronted sometimes through anice in finer more baffling form grace be young man dear said not very strong minded one can not believe be true said anice think can blame mind be body be not strong mr grace have more power than mamma put together one of alice peculiarity be certain pretty sententiousness for innate refinement sincerity might have impressed people a being fault when pushed opposition in steady innocent way mr barholm always took refuge behind inner consciousness knew better be fully satisfied on point of own knowledge when breakfast be over rose from table with air of man who have business on hand anice rose too followed to hearth be going out suppose said be going to see joan lowrie said complacently have several call to make besides will tell young woman that will call on anice looked down at foot have placed on shining rim of steel fender joan lowrie said reflectively certainly dear must think must please girl to feel that be interested in must scarcely think from what mr grace friend say that be kind of girl to be reached in way said anice rector shrugged shoulder dear answered if be always to depend upon what grace say will often find in dilemma if be going to wait until collier young woman call on after manner of polite society be afraid will have time to lose interest in affair have scruple of own on subject of errand felt very comfortable a usual a wended way through village toward lowrie cottage on knoll road did not ask what must say to collier young woman unhappy charge orthodox phrase with various distinct flavor flavor of encouragement flavor of reproof flavor of consolation be always ready with man never found necessary to prepare beforehand flavor of approval be to be joan portion morning flavor of rebuke

sharp weapon against when such course be not too hazardous of derrick knew nothing must only see that joan set face persistently against attempt to make friend with recognition of fact almost exasperated at time be quite natural that seeing so much of handsome creature hearing so much of admiration must not die out that opposition must rather invite to stronger effort to reach so be that

brighten dulness soften roughness of surroundings reverend paul in visit to house observed with tremor subtle change wrought in catching at straw of negative welcome went to see liz whenever must find tangible excuse have sensitive dread of intruding even upon poor privacy of lower order must rarely bring to point of taking by storm a mere matter of ecclesiastical routine oftener saw joan lowrie more heavily lay upon mind day conscience smote more sorely for want of success with yet how must make way against indifference even felt trifle spell bound in presence often found watching a moved to fro watching a liz child did th ' parson be th ' parson to still good natured simple little fellow who might be trifle better than other folk who certainly seemed weaker frail little gentleman in spectacle who be afraid of be at least easily confounded who might be of use to liz who be not in line better in way than master in still person to be regarded with just touch of contempt confidence established between grace friend fergus derrick leading to discussion of matter connected with parish parishioner led naturally to frequent discussion of joan lowrie among rest over tea toast in small parlor two men often drew comfort from other when derrick strode into little place threw into favorite chair with knit brow weary irritation in air grace be always ready to detect mood wait for to reveal when grace looked up at friend entrance with heavy pained look on face derrick be equally quick to comprehend there be one trouble in derrick specially sympathized with friend be in feeling for anice duty called paul frequently to house position with regard to inhabitant be necessarily familiar mr barholm did not spare curate be ready to delegate to labor in be not specially interested regarded a scarcely worthy of mettle grace make very useful in case must say certain kind of work suit be able to do justice in be worthy enough young fellow in certain groove be always best to confine to groove so when there be ordinary sermon to be preached commonplace piece of work to be done be handed over to grace with few tolerant word of advice comment a commonplace work be rather rule than exception reverend paul life be not idle anice manner toward father curate be so gentle earnest so frank full of trust in that be not to be wondered at day only fixed more firmly in heart nothing of conscientious labor be lost upon nothing of self sacrifice trial be passed by indifferently in thought of pain effort went to very heart belief in be so strong that never hesitated to carry little bewilderment to to speak to openly upon subject small marvel that found delicious pain to go to house day after day feeling so near to yet knowing so far from hope of reaching sealed chamber of heart notwithstanding knowledge of inability to alter position anice still managed to exert slight influence over friend fate do not think papa that mr grace have great deal to do suggested once when be specially overburdened great deal to do said well have enough to do of course dear then be work of kind suit never leave anything very important to grace mean dear that fancy have too much to do rather too much of dull kind answered anice dull work be tiring have great deal of on hand that school work know papa if must share with must think must make easier for dear anice rector protested if grace have responsibility to carry on shoulder leave responsibility to in opinion be hardly fitted to bear be not in line seeing dubious look on delicate face opposite if think young fellow have really too much to do will try to take of minor matter upon be equal to good deal of hard work evidently feeling somewhat aggrieved anice made further comment having dropped seed of suggestion left to fructify experience teaching that be best plan be one of good rector weakness to dislike to find course disapproved even by wholly uninfluential critic daughter be by mean uninfluential critic be never exactly comfortable when view did not strictly accord with own to find anice be regarding favorite whim with questioning be for to begin to falter trifle inwardly however testily rebellious
