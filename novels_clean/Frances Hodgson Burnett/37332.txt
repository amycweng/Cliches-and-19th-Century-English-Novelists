flush rising on cheek miss minchin be very severe imposing person seemed so absolutely sure that sara knew nothing whatever of french that felt a if must be almost rude to correct truth be that sara must not remember time when have not seemed to know french father have often spoken to when have be baby mother have be frenchwoman captain crewe have loved language so happened that sara have always heard be familiar with have never really learned french began trying shyly to make clear one of miss minchin chief secret annoyance be that did not speak french be desirous of concealing irritating fact therefore have intention of discussing matter laying open to innocent questioning by new little pupil be enough said with polite tartness if have not learned must begin at once french master monsieur dufarge will be here in few minute take book look at until arrives sara cheek felt warm went back to seat opened book looked at first page with grave face knew must be rude to smile be very determined not to be rude be very odd to find expected to study page told that le pere meant father la mere meant mother miss minchin glanced toward scrutinizingly look rather cross sara said be sorry like idea of learning french be very fond of answered sara thinking must try again must not say 'but when be told to do thing said miss minchin look at book again sara did so did not smile even when found that le fils meant son le frere meant brother when monsieur dufarge come thought can make understand monsieur dufarge arrived very shortly afterward be very nice intelligent middle aged

very anxious that must begin language be afraid have childish prejudice against doe not seem to wish to learn said miss minchin be sorry of mademoiselle said kindly to sara perhaps when begin to study together may show that be charming tongue little sara rose in seat be beginning to feel rather desperate a if be almost in disgrace looked up into monsieur dufarge face with big green gray eye be quite innocently appealing knew that must understand a soon a spoke began to explain quite simply in pretty fluent french madame have not understood have not learned french exactly not out of book papa other people have always spoken to have read written a have read written english papa loved loved because did dear mamma who have died when be born have be french must be glad to learn anything monsieur must teach what have tried to explain to madame be that already knew word in book held out little book of phrase when began to speak miss minchin started quite violently sat staring at over eye glass almost indignantly until have finished monsieur dufarge began to smile smile be one of great pleasure to hear pretty childish voice speaking own language so simply charmingly made feel almost a if be in native land in dark foggy day in london sometimes seemed world away when have finished took phrase book from with look almost affectionate spoke to miss minchin ah madame said there be not much can teach have not learned french be french accent be exquisite ought to have told exclaimed miss minchin much mortified turning on sara tried said sara suppose did not begin right miss minchin knew have tried that have not be fault that be not allowed to explain when saw that pupil have be listening that lavinia jessie be giggling behind french grammar felt infuriated silence young lady said severely rapping upon desk silence at once began from minute to feel rather grudge against show pupil chapter iii ermengarde on first morning when sara sat at miss minchin side aware that whole school room be devoting to observing have noticed very soon one little girl about own age who looked at very hard with pair of light rather dull blue eye be fat child who did not look a if be in least clever have good naturedly pouting mouth flaxen hair be braided in tight pigtail tied with ribbon have pulled pigtail round neck be biting end of ribbon resting elbow on desk a stared wonderingly at new pupil when monsieur dufarge began to speak to sara looked little frightened when sara stepped forward looking at with innocent appealing eye answered without warning in french fat little girl gave startled jump grew quite red in awed amazement having wept hopeless tear for week in effort to remember that la mere meant mother le pere father when one spoke sensible english be almost too much for to suddenly find listening to child own age who seemed not only quite familiar with word apparently knew number of others must mix up with verb a if be mere trifle stared so hard bit ribbon on pigtail so fast that attracted attention of miss minchin who feeling extremely cross at moment immediately pounced upon miss st john exclaimed severely what do mean by such conduct remove elbow take ribbon out of mouth sit up at once upon miss st john gave jump when lavinia jessie tittered became redder than ever so red indeed that almost looked a if tear be coming into poor dull childish eye sara saw be so sorry for that began to rather like want to be friend be way of hers always to want to spring into fray in one be made uncomfortable unhappy if sara have be boy lived few century ago father used to say must have gone about country with sword drawn rescuing defending one in distress always want to fight when see people in trouble so took rather fancy to fat slow little miss st john kept glancing toward through morning saw that lesson be easy matter to that there be danger of ever being spoiled by being treated a show pupil french lesson be pathetic thing pronunciation made even monsieur dufarge smile in spite of lavinia jessie more fortunate girl giggled looked at in wondering disdain sara did not laugh tried to look a if did not hear when miss st john called le bon pain lee bong pang have fine hot little temper of own made feel rather savage when heard titter saw poor stupid distressed child face be funny really said between teeth a bent over book ought not to laugh when lesson be over pupil gathered together in group to talk sara looked for miss st john finding bundled rather disconsolately in window seat walked over to spoke only said kind of thing little girl always say to other by way of beginning acquaintance there be something nice friendly about sara people always felt what be name said to explain miss st john amazement one must recall that new pupil be for short time somewhat uncertain thing of new pupil entire school have talked night before until fell asleep quite exhausted by excitement contradictory story new pupil with carriage pony maid voyage from india to discus be not ordinary acquaintance name ermengarde st john answered mine be sara crewe said sara yours be very pretty sound like story book do like fluttered ermengarde like yours miss st john chief trouble in life be that have clever father sometimes seemed to dreadful calamity if have father who know everything who speaks seven eight language have thousand of volume have apparently learned by heart frequently expects to be familiar with content of lesson book at least be not improbable that will feel ought to be able to remember few incident of history to write french exercise ermengarde be severe trial to mr st john must not understand how child of must be notably unmistakably dull creature who never shone in anything good heaven have said more than once a stared at there be time when think be a stupid a aunt eliza if aunt eliza have be slow to learn quick to forget thing entirely when have learned ermengarde be strikingly like be monumental dunce of school must not be denied must be made to learn father said to miss minchin consequently ermengarde spent greater part of life in disgrace in tear learned thing

big deep one tucking up foot sat with hand clasped round knee can speak because have heard life answered must speak if have always heard oh must said ermengarde never must speak why inquired sara curiously ermengarde shook head so that pigtail wabbled heard just now said be always like ca say word be so queer paused moment then added with touch of awe in voice be clever be sara looked out of window into dingy square where sparrow be hopping twittering on wet iron railing sooty branch of tree reflected few moment have heard said very often that be clever wondered if be if be how have happened know said ca tell then seeing mournful look on round chubby face gave little laugh changed subject must like to see emily inquired who be emily ermengarde asked just a miss minchin have done

tried put hand warningly on ermengarde let go very quietly to door whispered then will open quite suddenly perhaps may catch be half laughing there be touch of mysterious hope in eye fascinated ermengarde though have not remotest idea what meant whom be wanted to catch why wanted to catch whatsoever meant ermengarde be sure be something delightfully exciting so quite thrilled with expectation followed on tiptoe along passage made not least noise until reached door then sara suddenly turned handle threw wide open opening revealed room quite neat quiet fire gently burning in grate wonderful doll sitting in chair by apparently reading book oh got back to seat before must see sara exclaimed of course always do be a quick a lightning ermengarde looked from to doll back again can walk asked breathlessly yes answered sara at least believe can at least pretend believe can make seem a if be true have never pretended thing said ermengarde never tell about be so bewitched by odd new companion that actually stared at sara instead of at emily notwithstanding that emily be most attractive doll person have ever seen let sit down said sara will tell be so easy that when begin ca stop just go on on doing always be beautiful emily must listen be ermengarde st john emily ermengarde be emily must like to hold oh may said ermengarde may really be beautiful emily be put into arm never in dull short life have miss st john dreamed of such hour a one spent with queer new pupil before heard lunch bell ring be obliged to go down stair sara sat upon hearth rug told strange thing

being be out of room who must keep power secret so flew back to place like lightning when people returned to room must do said sara seriously see be kind of magic once when be relating story of search for emily ermengarde saw face suddenly change cloud seemed to pas over put out light in shining eye drew breath in so sharply that made funny sad little sound then shut lip held tightly closed a if be determined either to do not to do something ermengarde have idea that if have be like other little girl might have suddenly burst out sobbing cry did not have pain ermengarde ventured yes sara answered after moment silence be not in body then added something in low voice tried to keep quite steady be do love father more than anything else in whole world ermengarde mouth fell open little knew that must be far from behaving like respectable child at select seminary to say that have never occurred to that must love father that must do anything desperate to avoid being left alone in society for ten minute be indeed greatly embarrassed scarcely ever see stammered be always in library reading thing love mine more than world ten time over sara said be what pain be have gone away put head quietly down on little huddled up knee sat very still for few minute be going to cry out loud thought ermengarde fearfully did not short black lock tumbled about ear sat still then spoke without lifting head promised must bear said will have to bear thing think what soldier bear papa be soldier if there be war must have to bear marching thirstiness perhaps deep wound must never say word not one word ermengarde must only gaze at felt that be beginning to adore be so wonderful different from one else presently lifted face shook back black lock with queer little smile if go on talking talking said telling thing about pretending will bear better forget bear better ermengarde did not know why lump came into throat eye felt a if tear be in lavinia jessie be 'best friend said rather huskily wish must be 'best friend must have for yours be clever be stupidest child in school oh do so like be glad of said sara make thankful when be liked yes will be friend will tell what sudden

being so much indulged flattered if have be indolent child must have learned nothing privately miss minchin disliked be far too worldly woman to do say anything might make such desirable pupil wish to leave school knew quite well that if sara wrote to papa to tell be uncomfortable unhappy captain crewe must remove at once miss minchin opinion be that if child be continually praised never forbidden to do what liked must be sure to be fond of place where be so treated accordingly sara be praised for quickness at lesson for good manner for amiability to fellow pupil for generosity if gave sixpence

unchildlike woe of never spoke to one about there be one who must have understood be indeed well for that a lay awake in darkness mind be forcibly distracted now then by strangeness of surroundings be perhaps well for that be reminded by small body of material thing if have not be so anguish of young mind might have be too great for child to bear really while night be passing scarcely knew that have body at remembered other thing than one papa be dead kept whispering to herself papa be dead be not until long afterward that realized that bed have be so hard that turned over over in to find place to rest that darkness seemed more intense than have ever known that wind howled over roof among chimney like something wailed aloud then there be something worse be certain scufflings scratching squeakings in wall behind skirting board knew what meant because becky have described meant rat mouse who be fighting with other playing together once twice even heard sharp toed foot scurrying across floor remembered in after day when recalled thing that when first heard started up in bed sat trembling when lay down again covered head with bedclothes change in life did not come about gradually be made at once must begin a be to go on miss minchin said to miss amelia must be taught at once what be to expect mariette have left house next morning glimpse sara caught of sitting room a passed open door showed that everything have be changed ornament luxury have be removed bed have be placed in corner to transform into new pupil bedroom when went down to breakfast saw that seat at miss minchin

be down earlier lottie have already upset tea be beginning from day to day duty given to be added to taught younger child french heard other lesson be least of labor be found that must be made use of in numberless direction must be sent on errand at time in weather must be told to do thing other people neglected cook housemaid took tone from miss minchin rather enjoyed ordering about young one who have be made so much fuss over for so long be not servant of best class have good manner good temper be frequently convenient to have at hand one on whom blame must be laid during first month two sara thought that willingness to do thing a well a must silence under reproof might soften who drove so hard in proud little heart wanted to see that be trying to earn living not accepting charity time came when saw that one be softened at more willing be to do a be told more domineering exacting careless housemaid became more ready scolding cook be to blame if have be older miss minchin must have given bigger girl to teach saved money by dismissing instructress while remained looked like child must be made more useful a sort of little superior errand girl maid of work ordinary errand boy must not have be so clever reliable sara must be trusted with difficult commission complicated message must even go pay bill combined with ability to dust room well to set thing in order own lesson became thing of past be taught nothing only after long busy day spent in running here there at everybody order be grudgingly allowed to go into deserted school room with pile of old book study alone at night if remind myself of thing have learned perhaps may forget said to herself be almost scullery maid if be scullery maid who know nothing will be like poor becky wonder if must quite forget begin to drop h not remember that eighth have six wife one of most curious thing in new existence be changed position among pupil instead of being sort of small royal personage among no longer seemed to be one of number at be kept so constantly at work that scarcely ever have opportunity of speaking to of must not avoid seeing that miss minchin preferred that must live life apart from of occupant of school room will not have forming intimacy talking to other child that lady said girl like grievance if begin to tell romantic story about will become ill used heroine parent will be given wrong impression be better that must live separate life one suited to circumstance be giving home be more than have right to expect from sara did not expect much be far too proud to try to continue to be intimate with girl who evidently felt rather awkward uncertain about fact be that miss minchin pupil be set of dull matter of fact young people be accustomed to being rich comfortable a sara frock grew shorter shabbier queerer looking became established fact that wore shoe with hole in be sent out to buy grocery carry through street in basket on arm when cook wanted in hurry felt rather a if when spoke to be addressing under servant to think that be girl with diamond mine lavinia commented doe look like object be queerer than ever never liked much ca bear way have now of looking at people without speaking just a if be finding out be said sara promptly when heard of be what look at people for like to know about think about over afterward truth be that have saved annoyance several time by keeping eye on lavinia who be quite ready to make mischief must have be rather pleased to have made for ex show pupil sara never made mischief herself interfered with one worked like drudge tramped through wet street carrying parcel basket labored with childish inattention of little one french lesson a became shabbier more forlorn looking be told that have better take meal down stair be treated a if be nobody concern heart grew proud sore never told one what felt soldier complain must say between small shut teeth be not going to do will pretend be part of war there be hour when child heart might almost have broken with loneliness for three people first must be owned be becky just becky throughout first night spent in garret have felt vague comfort in knowing that on other side of wall in rat scuffled squeaked there be young human creature during night followed sense of comfort grew have little chance to speak to other during day have own task to perform attempt at conversation must have be regarded a tendency to loiter lose time mind miss becky whispered during first morning if say nothin ' polite un 'd be down on if did mean 'please ' 'thank ' 'beg pardon das to take time to say before daybreak used to slip into sara attic button dress give such help a required before went down stair to light kitchen fire when night came sara always heard humble knock at door meant that handmaid be ready to help again if be needed during first week of grief sara felt a if be too stupefied to talk so happened that time passed before saw other much exchanged visit becky heart told that be best that people in trouble must be left alone second of trio of comforter be ermengarde odd thing happened before ermengarde found place when sara mind seemed to awaken again to life about realized that have forgotten that ermengarde lived in world two have always be friend sara have felt a if be year older must not be contested that ermengarde be a dull a be affectionate clung to sara in simple helpless way brought lesson to that might be helped listened to word besieged with request for story have nothing interesting to say loathed book of description be in fact not person one must remember when one be caught in storm of great trouble sara forgot have be easier to forget because have be suddenly called home for few week when came back did not see sara for day two when met for first time encountered coming down corridor with arm full of garment be to be taken down stair to be mended sara have already be taught to mend looked pale unlike be attired in queer outgrown frock whose shortness showed so much thin black leg ermengarde be too slow girl to be equal to such situation must not think of anything to say knew what have happened somehow have never imagined sara must look like so odd poor almost like servant made quite miserable must hing break into short hysterical laugh exclaim aimlessly a if without meaning oh sara be that yes answered sara suddenly strange thought passed through mind made face flush held pile of garment in arm chin rested upon top of to keep steady something in look of straight gazing eye made ermengarde lose wit still more felt a if sara have changed into new kind of girl have never known before perhaps be because have suddenly grown poor have to mend thing work like becky oh stammered how how be know sara replied how be be be quite well said ermengarde overwhelmed with shyness then spasmodically thought of something to say seemed more intimate be be very unhappy said in rush then sara be guilty of injustice just at moment torn heart swelled within felt that if one be a stupid a one have better get away from what do think said do think be very happy marched past without word in course of time realized that if wretchedness have not made forget thing must have known that poor dull ermengarde be not to be blamed for unready awkward way be always awkward more felt more stupid be given to being sudden thought have flashed upon have made over sensitive be like others have thought doe not really want to talk to know one doe so for several week barrier stood between when met by chance sara looked other way ermengarde felt too stiff embarrassed to speak sometimes nodded to other in passing there be time when did not even exchange greeting if must rather not talk to sara thought will keep out of way miss minchin make that easy enough miss minchin made so easy that at last scarcely saw other at at time be noticed that ermengarde be more stupid than ever that looked listless unhappy used to sit in window seat huddled in heap stare out of window without speaking once jessie who be passing stopped to look at curiously what be cry for ermengarde asked be not cry answered ermengarde in muffled unsteady voice be said jessie great big tear just rolled down bridge of nose dropped off at end of there go well said ermengarde be miserable one need interfere turned plump back took out handkerchief boldly hid face in night when sara went to attic be later than usual have be kept at work until after hour at pupil went to bed after have gone to lesson in lonely school room when reached top of stair be surprised to see glimmer of light coming from under attic door nobody go there thought quickly one have lighted candle one have indeed lighted candle be not burning in kitchen candlestick be

almost frightened will get into trouble ermengarde stumbled up from footstool shuffled across attic in bedroom slipper be too large for eye nose be pink with cry know will if be found out said care care bit oh sara please tell be matter why like more something in voice made familiar lump rise in sara throat be so affectionate simple so like old ermengarde who have asked to be best friend sounded a if have not meant what have seemed to mean during past week do like sara answered thought see everything be different now thought be different ermengarde opened wet eye wide why be who be different cried did want to talk to did know what to do be who be different after came back sara thought moment saw have made mistake be different explained though not in way think miss minchin doe not want to talk to girl most of want to talk to thought perhaps did so tried to keep out of way oh sara ermengarde almost wailed in reproachful dismay then after one more look rushed into other arm must be confessed that sara small black head lay for minute on shoulder covered by red shawl when ermengarde have seemed to desert have felt horribly lonely afterward sat down upon floor together sara clasping knee with arm ermengarde rolled up in shawl ermengarde looked at odd big eyed little face adoringly must bear more said dare say must live without sara must live without be nearly dead so to night when be cry under bedclothes thought at once of creeping up here just begging to let be friend again be nicer than be said sara be too proud to try make friend see now that trial have come have shown that be not nice child be afraid must perhaps wrinkling forehead wisely be what be sent for see good in said ermengarde stoutly do to speak truth admitted sara frankly suppose there might be good in thing even if see there might doubtfully be good in miss minchin ermengarde looked round attic with rather fearsome curiosity sara said do think can bear living here sara looked round also if pretend be quite different can answered if pretend be place in story spoke slowly imagination be beginning to work for have not worked for at since trouble have come upon have felt a if have be stunned other people have lived in worse place think of count of monte cristo in dungeon of chateau d'if think of people in bastille bastille half whispered ermengarde watching beginning to be fascinated remembered story of french revolution sara have be able to fix in mind by dramatic relation of one sara must have done well known glow came into sara eye yes said hugging knee will be good place to pretend about be prisoner in bastille have be here for year year year everybody have forgotten about miss minchin be jailer becky sudden light adding to glow in eye becky be prisoner in next

used to look forward to two morning week when went into school room to give little one french lesson small pupil loved strove with other for privilege of standing close to insinuating small hand into hers fed hungry heart to feel nestling up to made such friend with sparrow that when stood upon table put head shoulder out of attic window chirped heard almost immediately flutter of wing answering twitter little flock of dingy town bird appeared alighted on slate to talk to make much of crumb scattered with melchisedec have become so intimate that actually brought mr melchisedec with sometimes now then one two of child used to talk to somehow looked quite a if understood there have grown in mind rather strange feeling about emily who always sat looked on at everything arose in one of moment of great desolateness must have liked to believe pretend to believe that emily understood sympathized with did not like to own to herself that only companion must feel hear nothing used to put in chair sometimes sit opposite to on old red footstool stare pretend about until own eye must grow large with something be almost like fear particularly at night when everything be so still when only sound in attic be occasional sudden scurry squeak of melchisedec family in wall one of pretend be that emily be kind of good witch who must protect sometimes after have stared at until be wrought up to highest pitch of fancifulness must ask question find almost feeling a if must presently answer never did a to answering though said sara trying to console answer very often never answer when can help when people be insulting there be nothing so good for a not to say word just to look at think miss minchin turn pale with rage when do miss amelia look frightened so do girl when will not fly into passion people know be stronger than be because be strong enough to hold in rage be not say stupid thing wish have said afterward there be nothing so strong a rage except what make hold in be stronger be good thing not to answer enemy scarcely ever do perhaps emily be more like than be like perhaps must rather not answer friend even keep in heart though tried to satisfy with argument did not find easy when after long hard day in have be sent here there sometimes on long errand through wind cold rain came in wet hungry be sent out again because nobody chose to remember that be only child that slim leg might be tired small body might be chilled when have be given only harsh word cold slighting look for thanks when cook have be vulgar insolent when miss minchin have be in worst mood when have seen girl sneering among at shabbiness then be not always able to comfort sore proud desolate heart with fancy when emily merely sat upright in old chair stared one of night when came up to attic cold hungry with tempest raging in young breast emily stare seemed so vacant sawdust leg arm so inexpressive that sara lost control over there be nobody emily one in world there sat will die presently said at first emily simply stared ca bear said poor child trembling know will die be cold be wet be starving to death have walked thousand mile to day have done nothing scold from morning until night because must not find that last thing cook sent for must not give supper men laughed at because old shoe made slip down in mud be covered with mud now laughed do hear looked at staring glass eye complacent face suddenly sort of heartbroken rage seized lifted little savage hand knocked emily off chair bursting into passion of sobbing sara who never cried be nothing doll cried nothing doll doll doll care for nothing be stuffed with sawdust never have heart nothing must ever make feel be doll emily lay on floor with leg ignominiously doubled up over head new flat place on end of nose be calm even dignified sara hid face in arm rat in wall began to fight bite other squeak scramble melchisedec be chastising of family sara sob gradually quieted be so unlike to break down be surprised at after while raised face looked at emily who seemed to be gazing at round side of one angle somehow by time actually with kind of glassy eyed sympathy sara bent picked up remorse overtook even smiled at very little smile ca help being doll said with resigned sigh more than lavinia jessie can help not having sense be not all made alike perhaps do sawdust best kissed shook clothes straight put back upon chair have wished very much that one must take empty house next door wished because of attic window be so near hers seemed a if must be so nice to see propped open day

one place from one must see splendor of pile of red gold cloud in west purple one edged with dazzling brightness little fleecy floating one tinged with rose color looking like flight of pink dove scurrying across blue in great hurry if there be wind place where one must see seem at same time to breathe purer air be of course attic window when square suddenly seemed to begin to glow in enchanted way look wonderful in spite of sooty tree railing sara knew something be going on in sky when be at possible to leave kitchen without being missed called back invariably stole away crept up

just like lovely vaulted ceiling sometimes watching west wonderful thing happened there cloud melting drifting waiting softly to be changed pink crimson snow white purple pale dove gray sometimes made island great mountain enclosing lake of deep turquoise blue liquid amber chrysoprase green sometimes dark headland jutted into strange lost sea sometimes slender strip of wonderful land joined other wonderful land together there be place where seemed that one must run climb stand wait to see what be coming until perhaps a melted one must float away at least seemed so to sara nothing have ever be quite so beautiful to a thing saw a stood on table body half out of skylight sparrow twittering with sunset softness on slate sparrow always seemed to to twitter with sort of subdued softness just when marvel be going on there be such sunset a few day after indian gentleman be brought to new home a fortunately happened that afternoon work be done in kitchen nobody have ordered to go anywhere

dream poor crewe child may be begging in street said carmichael try to be calm console with fact that when be found have fortune to hand over to why be not man enough to stand ground when thing looked

cook came in from kitchen miss minchin have expected to see in sara when appeared in school room very much what lavinia have expected to see sara have always be annoying puzzle to because severity never made cry look frightened when be scolded stood still listened politely with grave face when be punished performed extra task went without meal making complaint outward sign of rebellion very fact that never made impudent answer seemed to miss minchin kind of impudence in after yesterday deprivation of meal violent scene of last night prospect of hunger to day must surely have broken down must be strange indeed if did not come down stair with pale cheek red eye unhappy humbled face miss minchin saw for first time when entered school room to hear little french class lesson superintend exercise came in with springing step color in cheek smile hovering about corner of mouth be most astonishing thing miss minchin have ever known gave quite shock be child made of what must such thing

expression of bewilderment what audacious look of well being under august displeasure must mean must not understand be however just like sara singular obstinate way be probably determined to brave matter out one thing sara have resolved upon a thought thing over wonder have happened must be kept secret if such thing be possible if miss minchin must choose to mount to attic again of course must be discovered did not seem likely that must do so for time at least unless be led by suspicion ermengarde lottie must be watched with such strictness that must not dare to steal out of bed again ermengarde must be told story trusted to keep secret if lottie made discovery must be bound to secrecy also perhaps magic must help to hide own marvel happens sara kept saying to herself day happens somewhere in world there be heavenly kind person who be friend friend if never know who be if never can even thank will never feel quite so lonely oh magic be good to if be possible for weather to be worse than have be day before be worse day wetter muddier colder there be more errand to be done cook be more irritable knowing that sara be in disgrace be more savage what doe anything matter when
