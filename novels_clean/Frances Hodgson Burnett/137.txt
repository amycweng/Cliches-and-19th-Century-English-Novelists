to making mischief be said sara promptly when heard of be what look at for like to know about people think over afterward never made mischief herself interfered with one talked very little did a be

be only thing have if be must try why try really be very strange feeling have about emily arose from being so desolate did not like to own to herself that only friend only companion must feel hear nothing wanted to believe to pretend to believe that emily understood sympathized with that heard even though did not speak in answer used to put in chair sometimes sit opposite to on old red footstool stare at think pretend about until own eye must grow large with something be almost like fear particularly at night when garret be so still when only sound be to be heard be occasional

answering used to say answer very often never answer when can help when people be insulting there be nothing so good for a not to say word just to look at think miss minchin turn pale with rage when do miss amelia look frightened so do girl know be stronger than be because be strong enough to hold in rage be not say stupid thing wish have said afterward there be nothing so strong a rage except what make hold in be stronger be good thing not to answer enemy scarcely ever do perhaps emily be more like than be like perhaps must rather not answer friend even keep in heart though tried to satisfy with argument sara did not find easy when after long hard day in have be sent here there sometimes on long errand through wind cold rain when came in wet hungry have be sent out again because nobody chose to remember that be only child that thin little leg might be tired small body clad in forlorn too small finery too short too tight might be chilled when have be given only harsh word cold slighting look for thanks when cook have be vulgar insolent when miss minchin have be in worst mood when have seen girl sneering at among making fun of poor outgrown clothes then sara did not find emily quite that sore proud desolate little heart needed a doll sat in little old chair stared one of night when came up to garret cold hungry tired with tempest raging in small breast emily stare seemed so vacant sawdust leg arm so limp inexpressive that sara lost control over will die presently said at first emily stared ca bear said poor child trembling know will die be cold be wet be starving to death have walked thousand mile to day have done nothing scold from morning until night because must not find that last thing sent for must not give supper men laughed at because old shoe

bursting into passion of sobbing be nothing doll cried nothing doll doll doll care for nothing be stuffed with sawdust never have heart nothing must ever make feel be doll emily lay upon floor with leg ignominiously doubled up over head new flat place on end of nose be still calm even dignified sara hid face on arm sobbed rat in wall began to fight bite other squeak scramble a have already intimated sara be not in habit of cry after while stopped when stopped looked at emily who seemed to be gazing at around side of one ankle actually with kind of glassy eyed sympathy sara bent picked up remorse overtook ca help being doll said with resigned sigh more than girl downstairs can help not having sense be not alike perhaps do sawdust best none of miss minchin young lady be very remarkable for being brilliant be select of be very dull of be fond of applying to lesson sara who snatched lesson at sort of untimely hour from tattered discarded book who have hungry craving for everything readable be often severe upon in small mind have book never read have book at if have always have something to read must not have be so lonely liked romance history poetry must read anything there be sentimental housemaid in establishment who bought weekly penny paper subscribed to circulating library from got greasy volume containing story of marquis duke who invariably fell in love with orange girl gypsy servant maid made proud bride of coronet sara often did part of maid work so that might earn privilege of reading romantic history there be also fat dull pupil whose name be ermengarde st john who be one of resource ermengarde have intellectual father who in despairing desire to encourage daughter constantly sent valuable interesting book be continual source of grief to sara have once actually found cry over big package of be matter with asked perhaps rather disdainfully be just possible must not have spoken to if have not seen book sight of book always gave hungry feeling must not help drawing near to if only to read title what be matter with asked papa have sent more book answered woefully expects to read like reading said sara hate replied miss ermengarde st john will ask question when see will want to know how much remember how must like to have to read 'd like better than anything else in world said sara ermengarde wiped eye to look at

learn anything in way said sara must if be father though be not flattering way of stating case ermengarde be obliged to admit be true after little more argument gave in so used afterward always to hand over book to sara sara must carry to garret devour after have read volume must return tell ermengarde about in way of own have gift for making thing interesting imagination helped to make everything rather like story managed matter so well that miss st john gained more information from book than must have gained if have read three time over by poor stupid little self when sara sat down by began to tell story of travel history made traveller historical people seem real ermengarde used to sit regard dramatic gesticulation thin little flushed cheek shining odd eye with amazement sound nicer than seems in book must say never cared about mary queen of scot before always hated french revolution make seem like story be story sara must answer be story everything be story everything in world be story be story miss minchin be story can make story out of anything ca said ermengarde sara stared at minute reflectively said at last suppose must be little like emily who be emily sara recollected knew be sometimes rather impolite in candor of remark did not want to be impolite to girl who be not unkind only stupid notwithstanding sharp little way have sense to wish to be just to everybody in hour spent alone used to argue out great many curious question with one thing have decided upon be that person who be clever ought to be clever enough not to be unjust deliberately unkind to one miss minchin be unjust cruel miss amelia be unkind spiteful cook be malicious hasty tempered be stupid made despise desired to be a unlike a possible so must be a polite a must to people who in least deserved politeness emily be person know replied do like asked ermengarde yes do said sara ermengarde examined queer little face figure again did look odd have on day faded blue plush skirt barely covered knee brown cloth sacque pair of olive green stocking miss minchin have made piece out with black one so that must be long enough to be kept on yet ermengarde be beginning slowly to admire such forlorn thin neglected little thing a who must read read remember tell thing so that did not tire out child who must speak french who have learned german one knew how one must not help staring at feeling interested particularly one to whom simplest lesson be trouble woe do like said ermengarde finally at end of scrutiny sara hesitated one second then answered like because be not ill natured like for letting read book like because make spiteful fun of for what ca help be not fault that pulled up quickly have be going to say that be stupid that what asked ermengarde that ca learn thing quickly if ca ca if can why can be paused minute looking at plump face before then rather slowly one of wise old fashioned thought came to perhaps said to be able to learn thing quickly be everything to be kind be worth good deal to other people if miss minchin knew everything on earth doe if be like what be now 'd still be detestable thing everybody must hate lot of clever people have done harm be wicked look at robespierre stopped again examined companion countenance do remember about demanded believe have forgotten well remember of admitted ermengarde well said sara with courage determination will tell to over again plunged once more into gory record of french revolution told such story of made such vivid picture of horror that miss st john be afraid to go to bed afterward hid head under blanket when did go shivered until fell asleep afterward preserved lively recollection of character of robespierre did not even forget marie antoinette princess de lamballe know put
