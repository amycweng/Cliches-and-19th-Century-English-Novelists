in accord with inevitable trend of being that even before eye closed have ceased to believe that servant be really going to leave house seemed too ridiculous thing to happen be possessed of logic must lead to realization of indubitable fact that there be reason why servant who must neither be paid provided with food must remain in place mild stimulation of tea also gave rise to happy thought that must not give reference if behaved badly did not present to reference from house of card have ignominiously fallen to piece henceforth must represent only shady failure must be of use so fell asleep

of thing be memory of standing on gravel path in square garden watching sparrow quarrel while andrew nurse sat on bench with nurse talked in low tone be talking in way robin always connected with servant naturally accepted a being method of expression of speciesmuch a accepted mewing of cat barking of dog a grew older reached stage of knowing that be generally saying thing did not wish to hear liked watching sparrow in garden because liked watching sparrow at time be only friend have ever known though be not old enough to call friend to know what friend meant andrew have taught by mean of system of own to know better than to cry to make protesting noise when be left alone in ugly small nursery andrew idea of duty did not involve boring to death by sitting in room on top floor when livelier entertainment awaited in basement where cook be woman of wide experience housemaid young person who have lived in gay country house footman at once young man of spirit humour so robin spent many hour of daytaking altogetherquite by might have more potently resented isolation if have ever known other condition than of child in whom one be in least interested in whom being good must only mean being passive under neglect calling one attention to fact that wanted anything from anybody a bird born in captivity life in cage perhaps belief to be world robin lived in nursery knew square inch of with deadly if unconscious sense of distaste fatigue be put to bed taken up be fed dressed in once daytwice perhaps if andrew choseshe be taken out of downstairs into street be be why liked sparrow so much sparrow be worth watching if live in nursery where nothing ever happens where when look out be so high up that be not easy to see people in world below in addition to seems nearly always raining robin used to watch hopping about on slate roof of home on other side of street fluttered wing picked up straw carried away thought must have house of own among chimneysin place must not see fancied must be nice to hop about on top of roof if one be not at afraid of falling liked chippering chirping sound bird made became sounded like talking laughinglike talking laughing sometimes wakened out of sleep to lie listen to when lady downstairs have party often wondered what people be doing because sounded a if liked doing very much sometimes when have rained two three day have feeling made begin to cry to herselfbut not aloud have once have little black blue mark on arm for week where andrew have pinched because have cried loud enough to be heard have seemed to that andrew twisted pinched bit of flesh for five minute without letting go have held large hand over mouth a did now keep that in mind have said when have finished robin have almost choked in awful little struggle to keep back sound one thing andrew be surest of be that nobody must come upstairs to nursery to inquire meaning of cry be not unearthly enough to disturb household so be easy to regulate existence of charge in such manner a best suited just give food enough keep from making silly noise when want what doesnt get said andrew to companion below stair one in drawing room isnt going to interfere with nursery not know business know how to manage kind go to politely now then ask permission to buy thing from best liberty other good place always stare minute when begin a if scarcely understood what be talking about then say oh yes suppose must have go get keep a well dressed a child in mayfair shes be beauty since be year old so look first rate when wheel up down street so people can see shes well taken care of not kept hidden away one can complain of look nobody be bothered with thats thats wanted of get good wage get regular dont turn up nose at place like outside talk be

victoria day lady used to inquire about cold meat ask what be done with dripping civilisation gone beyond thatcommandments commandment he precious particular about bill being paid volunteered jennings with air of man of world heard having row with one day about bill hadnt paid shed spent money for nonsense be pretty stiff in queer way of quite right be too id have be same myself pulling up collar stretching neck in manner indicating exact knowledge of natural sentiment of marquis when justly annoyed what intimated be that if bill be not paid with money be meant to pay money wouldnt be forthcoming next time jennings be rather pleased by word forthcoming therefore repeated with emphasis wouldnt be forthcoming thatd frighten be andrew succinct observation did said jennings shed have gone in hysteric if hadnt kept down he got way with coombe have andrew laughed brief dry laugh do know what child call said call lady downstairs shes got sort of fancy for try to get peep at when go out notice always crane little neck if pas room might chance to be in pretty clothes laughing doe childrens drawn by bright colour noise sound merry belief child doesnt know be mother said mr blayne a

truth be that have taken care of eight infant brother sister while maternal parent slept raucously under influence of beer when be not quarrelling with offspring jane housemaid have passed not uncomfortable childhood in country be perhaps of soft nature id say that mother one belong to thats fond of even if doe keep straight put in mother isnt fond of doesnt keep straight said jennings so wouldnt do doesnt slap head teach to do kitchen maid work put in mr blayne so yours be use mr jennings be mine miss andrew ll have to cook up explanation of own herself when find have to can get out of drury lane melodrama said jennings with great humour youll have to sit down night miss andrew say time have come chee ild when must tell in manner be mr gareth lawless maternal affection discussed below interesting fact remained that to robin lady downstairs be merely radiant beautiful being who floated through certain room laughing chattering like bird always wearing pretty clothes be different time one beheld sometimes one might catch glimpse of through door if one pressed one face against window pane at right moment might get into bright little carnage in street below after jennings have shut door might be seen to give lovely flutter to clothes a settled back against richly dark blue cushion be somewhat portentous thing to realize that newborn human creature can only know what be taught teaching may be conscious unconscious intelligent idiotic exquisite brutal image presented by surrounding a perception awaken day by day be record on soul brain physical being be sole mean of expressing during physical life have learned that automatically becomes law at dawning of newborn consciousness remains to understanding law of being law of universe to cautious of responsibility at time wear aspect of awesome thing suggesting however remotely that might seem well perhaps to remove shoe from one foot a be tread with deliberate delicate considering of one step a do reverently courteous even on approaching of unknown altar being acknowledged scientific a well a spiritual truth there remains mystery in fact that robin at six year oldwhen watched sparrow in square gardensdid not know name of feeling have grown within a result of pleasure in chance glimpse of lady downstairs be feeling made eager to see anything belonged to made strain child ear to catch sound of voice made long to hear andrew other servant speak of yet much too shy to dare to ask question have found place on staircase leading to nursery where by squeezing against balustrade must sometimes see lady pas in out of pink bedroom used to sit on step peer between railing with beating heart sometimes after have be put to bed for night andrew be safely entertained downstairs robin must be awakened from first sleep by sound in room below must creep out of bed down to special step crouching in hectic joy must see lady come out with sparkling thing in hair round lovely very bare white neck arm swathed in tint drapery made seem vision of colour light be so radiant thing often child drew in breath with sound like little sob of ecstasy lip trembled a if be going to cry did not know that what felt be yearning of thing called lovea quite simple natural common thing of have reason for having personal knowledge a be unaware of mother so be unaware of affection of andrew must have felt to be superfluously sentimental to talk to on very rare occasion when lady downstairs appeared on threshold of day nursery robinalways having be freshly dressed in one of nicest frocksstood stared with immense startled eye answered in whisper banal little question put to lady appeared at such rare interval remained poised upon threshold like tropic plumaged bird for moment so brief that there never be time to do more than lose breath gaze a at sudden vision why camewhen did comerobin did not understand evidently did not belong to small dingy nursery grew shabbier year a grew steadily more grimy under persistent london soot fog feather always held up drapery when came must not have come at for fact that have once twice be asked if child be growing pretty must have seemed absurd to admit that never saw at think shes rather pretty said downstairs shes round have bright colouralmost too bright eye be round too shes rather stupid shes shyand one a bad a other shes child stare if when andrew have taken into garden have played with other child robin must no doubt have learned something of existence normal attitude of mother through mere accident of childish chatter somehow happened that never formed relation with charge of other nurse took for granted for time that be because andrew have laid down mysterious law andrew did not seem to form acquaintance sometimes sat on bench talked little to nurse seldom sat twice with same person be indeed generally custom to sit alone crocheting sewing with rather lofty exclusive air to call robin back to side if saw slowly edging towards other child rule be to keep to myself said in kitchen to look a if be one must turn up nose if nose be to be turned up there must snatch away child if let robin begin to make up to wouldnt of course im not going to run risk im going to save own pride one morning when robin be watching sparrow nurse who be old acquaintance surprised andrew by appearing in garden with two little girl in charge be child of nine eleven quite sufficient for apart from fact that regarded robin a baby therefore took notice of began playing with skipping rope left nurse free to engage in delighted conversation with andrew be conversation so delightful that robin be forgotten even to extent of being allowed to follow sparrow round clump of shrubbery therefore out of andrew sight though be only few yard away sparrow morning be quarrelsome suddenly engaged in fight pecking other furiously beating wing uttering shrill protesting chipperings robin did not quite understand what be doing stood watching with spellbound interest be while watched that heard footstep on gravel walk stopped near made look up to see who be at side big boy in highland kilt bonnet sporan be standing by found

be changed at once mr muir have so soon begun to tell story robin be not in least aware that have swiftly distracted attention from question discussion of must have involved explanation must not have produced must have be impossible to make clear to child be helpless before situation therefore only refuge be to make two think of other thing have so well done robin have gone home later only remembering brightly transitory episode a recalled others a brief bright when have stared at light lovely figure standing on nursery threshold asking careless question of andrew without coming in risking freshness of drapery by contact with london top floor grubbiness child be in fact too full of reality of happiness with donal donals mother to be more than faintly bewildered by sort of visionary conundrum robin like donal slept perfectly through night sleep be perhaps made more perfect by fair dream in played in garden donal ran to from knee of mother lady to ask question explain game a child have often in past looked up at sky so have looked up into clear eye of mother lady there be something in have never seen before kept wanting to see again then there came queer bit of

be one tiny shadow in world be fear that andrew must get well too quickly be no longer in bed be well enough to sit up sew little before tiny fire in atom of servant room grate doctor must not let go out yet therefore anne still remained in charge founding one hope on previous knowledge of anne habit might be trusted to sit read show untoward curiosity from bed robin must see sky be blue that meant that must be taken out lay a quiet a mouse thought of joy before until anne came to dress give breakfast well put on rose coloured smock morning girl said when dressing began like hat sock match anne be not quite like andrew who be not talkative made conversational sort of remark after have tied white shoe youve got pretty little aristocratic leg of own said amiably like child to have nice leg robin be uplifted in spirit by commendation hoped anne must put on own thing quickly sometimes be rather long time one course however towards discretion pointed a entirely safe be continuance of being a quiet a mouseeven quieter if such thing might beso that nothing might interfere with anything one wanted to do to interfere must have be to attract attention might lead to delay so stood watched sparrow inoffensively until anne called when found out on street step be so light on pavement that be rather like rose petal blown fluttering along by soft vagrant puff of spring air under flopping hat eye lip cheek be so happy that more than one passer by turned head over shoulder to look after name ought to be rose anne giggled involuntarily a glanced down at because someone have
