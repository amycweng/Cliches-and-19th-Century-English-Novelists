waggoner a passed 'what o'clock might be kept quite snug till be out of sight nay long afterwards be content to sit within waggon rather than venture out amused with listening to bell of team jingled continually on second day journey however ventured out of hiding place walked with waggoner up down hill enjoying fresh air singing of bird delightful smell of honey suckles dog rose in hedge wild flower even weed on bank by way side be to matter of wonder admiration at step almost paused to observe something be new to must not help feeling surprised at insensibility of fellow traveller who

utter single exclamation although be struck prodigiously at first sight of ocean a much almost a have be at spectacle of rising sun just ventured however to ask companion question about vessel beheld sailing on sea shipping with bay be filled answered coldly 'they be nothing in life boat ship man that see for first time be often struck on heap a have noticed in passing by here have seen many many time so turned away went on chewing straw seemed not whit more moved with admiration than have be at sight of thistle conceived high opinion of man who have seen so much that must admire nothing preserved increased respect for by profound silence maintained during five succeeding day of journey seldom never opened lip except to inform of name of town through passed have since reflected that be fortunate for have supercilious fellow traveller on first journey for made at once thoroughly sensible of own ignorance extremely anxious to supply deficiency to find one who must give other answer

bought who wish to have friend a well a servant must keep truth constantly in mind english spirit of independence induced to make many more such reflection whilst be at tippoo court day afforded fresh occasion to form comparison between sultan son attachment to pupil day increased pupil be with astonishment sometimes reflected that young prince be actually pupil thus obscure individual in country

surprise seemed to delight excessively examined part moved wire of puppet asked innumerable question concerning tin mine be more astonished at because have imagined must have considered object of commerce a beneath notice of sultan must guess why must be peculiarly interested in subject soon explained to by saying that have in dominion certain mine of tin have notion must if properly managed bring considerable revenue to royal treasury at present through negligence fraud mine be rather burdensome than profitable inquired from how model came into possession when interpreter told that made caused question answer to be repeated twice before must believe that understood rightly next inquired whether be acquainted with art of mining how came by information in short commanded to relate history replied that be long story concerning only obscure individual unworthy attention of great monarch seemed evening to have nothing to do to gratify curiosity apology only served to increase again commanded to relate adventure then told history of early life be much flattered by interest young prince took in escape from mine by praise bestowed on fidelity to master sultan on contrary

interpreter with difficulty translated into carnatic malabar be language sultan used in speaking to letter have counter signature of of east india company servant resident at madras whose name be well

royal treasury reward more than proportioned to service suitable to generosity of sultan day be given to consider of proposal though tempted by idea might realize in short time sum must make independent for rest of life yet suspicion of capricious tyrannical temper of tippoo made dread to have for master above resolved to hing without express permission of dr bell to whom immediately

given to during fit of generosity of ostentation sultan who cared more what became of made opposition to departure be obliged to wait day two for guard a hircarrahs who formerly conducted be now out upon expedition whilst waited impatiently for return prince abdul calie who have not be during time at devanelli fort arrived when went to take leave of inquired into reason of sudden departure in language a respectful a must use with a much delicacy a thought bound to observe in speaking to son of father related truth prince countenance showed what felt paused seemed to be lost in thought for few minute then said to 'the sultan father be at time so intent upon preparation for war that even must despair of being listened to on other subject have in possession a recollect what might be useful to either in war peace if desire will speak of machine to sultan did not immediately know to what machine of mine prince alluded explained to that meant portable telegraph must be of infinite use to tippoo in conveying order of intelligence across desert left matter entirely to prince after returning very sincere thanks for being thus interested in concern few hour after conversation be summoned into sultan presence impatience to make trial of telegraph be excessive who day before have be almost trampled upon by officer lord of court instantly became person of greatest importance trial of telegraph succeeded beyond even expectation sultan be in specie of ecstasy on occasion can not omit to notice instance of violence of temper sudden change from joy to rage one of black gentle hindoo lad of name of saheb be set to manage telegraph at one of station few yard distant from sultan have previously instructed saheb in what be to do from want of practice made mistake threw tippoo into transport of passion that instantly ordered slave head to be cut off sentence must infallibly have be executed if have not represented that must be expedient to suffer head to remain on shoulder

celebrated mine determined that when returned to europe must write description of description however will spare for present proceed with story diamond merchant with whom travelled have great deal of business to transact at various place be cause of much delay to must scarcely bear with patience for now have gratified curiosity be extremely desirous to return to madras with little treasure five year salary due to by east india company have never used have put out at interest at madras where sometimes rate be a high a twelve per cent if knew said mr jervas addressing to miner at mr r table

five per cent becomes double be one hundred pound put out at compound interest in fourteen year becomes two hundred few people have patience prudence to make use of money be however determined to

expectation received with smiling countenance pointing to officer who accompanied asked whether recollected to have ever seen face before replied sultan then informed that officer who be one of own guard have attended in disguise during whole visit to diamond mine that be perfectly satisfied of honourable conduct then after making signal to officer present to withdraw bade approach nearer to paid compliment to ability proceeded to explain to that stood in farther need of service that if served with fidelity must have reason to complain on return to own country of want of generosity

by feulinga brahmin a called whose agreement with adventurer in mine be that stone found under pago in weight be to be own above weight be to be for sultan use now seems that agreement be never honestly fulfilled by of party slave cheating merchant merchant cheating feulinga brahmin in turn defrauding sultan so tippoo assured have often purchased from diamond merchant stone of larger spread

great mystery to examine hole under foundation of cathedral mr hill repaired with grocer stationer lady to take walk in close where boasted to female acquaintance whom called friend of maternal discretion in prevailing upon mr hill to forbid daughter phoebe to wear limerick glove in mean time phoebe walked pensively homewards endeavouring to discover why father must take mortal dislike to

thought more thought le connexion must perceive between thing for a have not taken dislike to mr brian o'neill at first sight because be irishman must not think quite reasonable to suspect of making away with father dog yet of design to blow up hereford cathedral a be pondering upon matter came within sight of ruin of poor woman house few month before time have be burnt down recollected that

must not be after changing opinion of humble servant for reason in life because father mother who have taken prejudice against be little contrary replied phoebe must not change opinion without reason have not yet have time to fix opinion of mr o'neill to let know piece of mind then dear miss hill resumed more contrary be more pride joy must give to win wear in spite of 'em if without farthing in pocket so much more must rejoice in opportunity of proving to dear self else whom may consarn that brian o'neill be fortune hunter scorn be so narrow minded a to think that other kind of cattle there fortune hunter can come out of ireland so dear phoebe now understand one hope will not be paining eye longer with sight of odious brown bag be not fit to be worn by christian arm to say nothing of miss hill be handsomest without compliment that ever saw to mind must become pair of limerick glove beyond thing expect will show generosity proper spirit by putting on immediately expect sir repeated miss hill with look of more indignation than gentle countenance have ever before be seen to assume expect if have said hope thought must have be thing expect what right have to expect now miss hill unfortunately be not sufficiently acquainted with irish idiom to know to expect in ireland be same thing a to hope in england when irish admirer said expect meant only in plain english hope thus be that poor irishman often for want of understanding nicety of english language say rudest when mean to say civillest thing imaginable miss hill feeling be so much hurt by unlucky expect that whole of speech have before made favourable impression upon now lost effect replied with proper spirit a thought expect great deal too much mr o'neill more than ever gave reason to do must be neither pleasure pride to to be won worn a be pleased to say in spite of to be thrown without farthing in pocket upon protection of one who expects so much at first setting out so assure sir may expect will not put on limerick glove mr o'neill be not without share of pride proper spirit nay have must be confessed in common with others of countryman improper share of pride spirit fired by lady coldness poured forth volley of reproach ended by wishing a said good morning for ever ever to one who must change opinion point blank like weathercock be miss most obedient expect will never think more of poor brian o'neill limerick glove if have not be in too great passion to observe thing poor brian o'neill must have found out that phoebe be not weathercock left abruptly hurried away imagining while that be phoebe not who be in rage thus to horseman who be galloping at full speed hedge tree house seem rapidly to recede whilst in reality never move from place be that fly from not from on monday morning miss jenny brown perfumer daughter came to pay phoebe morning visit with face of busy joy so dear said fine doings in hereford what make look so downcast to be sure be invited a well a rest of invited

to have returned unopened because knew from hand writing of direction that came from mr o'neill must observe that phoebe have already told mother of meeting with gentleman at poor widow of have passed between afterwards openness on part have softened heart of mr hill who be really inclined to be good natured provided people must allow that have more penetration than one else in hereford be moreover good deal piqued alarmed by idea that perfumer daughter might rival outshine own whilst have thought sure of mr o'neill attachment to phoebe have looked higher especially a be persuaded by perfumer lady to think that irishman must not be bad match now began to suspect that perfumer lady have changed opinion of irishman since did not object to own jenny leading up ball at mr o'neill thought passed rapidly in mother mind with fear of losing admirer for phoebe value of admirer suddenly rose in estimation thus at auction if lot be going to be knocked down to lady who be only person have bid for even feel discontented despises nobody covets if a hammer be falling many voice answer to question who bid more then anxiety to secure prize suddenly rise rather than be outbid will give far beyond value why child said mr hill since have pair of limerick glove since certainly that note be invitation to to ball since be much more fitting that must open ball than jenny brown since after be very handsome genteel of young man to say must take without farthing in pocket show that be misinformed who talked of a irish adventurer since be not certain 't be made away with dog although said

brown need not come with hypocritical condoling face to anymore after running speech glibly off mr hill without waiting to hear syllable from poor phoebe trotted off in search of consort be not however quite so easy task a wife expected to bring mr hill round to opinion be slow in declaring of opinion when once have said thing there be little chance of altering notion on occasion mr hill be doubly bound to prejudice against unlucky irishman for have mentioned with great solemnity at club frequented grand affair of hole under foundation of cathedral suspicion that there be design to blow up several of club have laughed at idea others who supposed that mr o'neill be roman catholic who have confused notion that roman catholic must be very wicked dangerous being thought that there might be great deal in verger suggestion observed that very watchful eye ought to be kept upon irish glover who have come to settle at hereford nobody knew why who seemed to have money at command nobody knew how news of ball sounded to mr hill prejudiced imagination like news of conspiracy ay ay thought irishman be cunning enough will be too many for want to throw good sober folk of hereford off guard by feasting dancing carousing take so to perpetrate evil design when be least suspected will be prepared for fool a take plain englishman to be warrant in consequence of most shrewd cogitation verger silenced wife with peremptory nod when came to persuade to let put on limerick glove go to ball to ball will not go charge not to put on limerick glove a value blessing said mr hill please to tell so mr hill trust to judgment discretion in thing mr hill strange work may be in hereford yet will say more must go consult with knowing men who be of opinion sallied forth mr hill be left in state only who be troubled with disease of excessive curiosity can rightly comprehend compassionate hied back to phoebe to whom announced father answer then went gossipping to female acquaintance in hereford to tell that knew that did not know to endeavour to find out secret where there be none to be found there be trial of temper in condition lady in high low life must endure with better grace than phoebe whilst mr mr hill be busied abroad there came to see phoebe one of widow smith child with artless expression of gratitude to phoebe little girl mixed praise of o'neill who said have be constant friend of mother have given money week since fire happened mammy love dearly for being so good natured continued child have be good to other people a well a to to whom said phoebe to poor man who have lodged for few day past next door to replied child know name rightly be irishman go out haymaking in day time along with number of others knew mr o'neill in own country told great deal about goodness a child finished word phoebe took out of drawer clothes have made for poor woman child gave to little girl happened that limerick glove have be thrown into drawer phoebe favourable sentiment of giver of glove be revived by what have just heard by confession mr hill have made that have reason vague suspicion for thinking ill of laid glove perfectly smooth strewed over whilst little girl went on talking of mr o'neill leaf of rose have worn on sunday mr hill be time in deep conference with prudent men of hereford who be of own opinion about perilous hole under cathedral ominous circumstance of ball be also considered great expense at irish glover lived giving away glove be sure sign be not under necessity to sell consequently proof though pretended to be glover be something wrong in disguise upon putting thing together be resolved by over wise politician that best thing must be done for hereford only possible mean of preventing immediate destruction of cathedral must be to take mr o'neill into custody upon recollection however be perceived that there be legal ground on must be attacked at length after consulting attorney devised what thought admirable mode of proceeding irish hero have not that punctuality english tradesman usually observe in payment of bill have preceding year run up long bill with grocer in hereford a have not at christmas cash in hand to pay have given note payable six month after date grocer at mr hill request made over note to be determined that money must be demanded a be now due that if be not paid directly o'neill must be that night arrested how mr hill made discovery of debt to grocer agree with former notion that irish glover have always money at command can not well conceive anger prejudice will swallow down grossest contradiction without difficulty when mr hill clerk went to demand payment of note o'neill head be full of ball be to give that evening be much surprised at unexpected appearance of note have not ready money by to pay after swearing good deal at clerk complaining of ungenerous ungentleman like behaviour in grocer tanner told clerk to be gone not to be bothering at unseasonable time that must not have money then did not deserve to have at language conduct be rather new to english clerk mercantile ear can not wonder that must seem to a said to master more language of madman than man of business want of punctuality in money transaction mode of treating contract a matter of favour affection might not have damned fame of hero in own country where such conduct be ala too common be now in kingdom where manner custom be so directly opposite that must meet with allowance for national fault must be well for countryman if be made even by few mortification somewhat sensible of important difference in habit of irish english trader before come to settle in england to proceed with story on night of mr o'neill grand ball a be seeing fair partner perfumer daughter safe home felt tapped on shoulder by friendly hand when be told that be king prisoner vociferated with sundry strange oath forbear to repeat be not king prisoner be prisoner of shabby rascally tanner jonathan hill none must

sent for hour before by gentleman at distance from hereford to draw up will so that tanner be obliged to postpone legal operation forbear to recount return how many time walked up down close to view scattered bark to estimate damage have be done to at length that hour came usually suspends passion by more imperious power of hour of dinner hour of be never needful to remind mr hill by watch clock

must not be le than ten pound great sum for on house garden at first setting out when to be sure land must have paid better if money have be laid out there why must not make shift to live on in old cabin for while a others have done before time well enough poor man must be contented with poor house where be use said of laying out good ready penny in way must bring nothing in farmer gray calculated that must not have laid out money to better advantage for by ten pound have probably saved wife child from putrid fever from rheumatism former inhabitant of house who have be content to

be rough enough do what must must not do more than make rent of farm rent amounted to forty pound landlord be mr hopkins agent to gentleman who resided in england mr hopkins insisted upon having rent paid up to day so be gray contented by thinking that be perhaps for best when rent be once paid said can not be called for again be in man power be great comfort to be sure if half year rent be left in hand for few month might have be of service be better not to be under obligation to man a mr hopkins who must make pay for in shape other when least expected mr hopkins be what be called in ireland middle man one take land from great proprietor to set again at advanced often exorbitant price to poor gray have land at fair rent because be not from mr hopkins father have taken lease from gentleman to whom man be agent mr hopkins designed to buy land gray farmed therefore wished to make appear a unprofitable a possible to landlord who living in england knew little of own estate if gray pay rent

to day said wo be so next year man be laying out money on ground on draining fencing wo pay suddenly will leave rent in hand for year so bring down ejectment upon if once get into power a surely will then all that have done to house will be so much in way what fool be to lay out money so happened however that money gray have laid out in making house comfortable neat be of greatest advantage to at

privilege of member of parliament be necessary to protect from being arrested have large estate yet be one of poorest men in county for matter what person fortune may be if spend more than income must be poor sir hyacinth o'brien not only spent more than income desired that rent roll must be thought to be at least double what really be of course be obliged to live up to fortune affected to posse

light speech in parliament be much admired passion of ambition be now kindled in mind determined to be leading man in senate whilst pursued object with enthusiasm private affair be entirely neglected ambition economy never can agree sir hyacinth however found necessary to happiness be to splendour of existence to supply by mean other want of what called paltry selfish counterfeit virtue economy nothing must do than sacrifice of have be once in estimation most noble generous of human virtue patriotism sacrifice be painful must not avoid making because after living upon five thousand year must not live upon five hundred so from flaming patriot sunk into pensioned placeman then employed power of wit sophistry to ridicule principle have abandoned in short affected to glory in specie of political profligacy laughed sneered at public virtue a if must only be madness of enthusiasm meanness of hypocrisy by brilliancy of conversation gaiety of manner sir hyacinth sometimes succeeded in persuading others that be in right ala there be one person whom must never deceive be despised nothing must make amends for self complacency that have lost without approbation luxury of life be tasteless sir hyacinth o'brien however be for year thought by who must see only outward man to be happy be not till derangement of affair became public that world began at once to pity blame have

a possible expedition in matter of business must a body know be paid for exorbitantly there be men who upon such term will be a expeditious in lending money a extravagance ambition united can desire mr hopkins be one of be money lender who supplied baronet real imaginary want sir hyacinth did not know extreme disorder of own affair till sudden dissolution of parliament obliged to prepare for expense of new election when went into country be at once beset with dun constituent who claimed from favour promise miserable be man who court popularity if be not rich enough to purchase what covets baronet endeavoured to laugh off with good grace apostasy from popular party whilst must laugh at head of plentiful table must not fail to find many who must laugh with there be strong party formed against in county two other candidate be competitor one of be counsellor quin man of vulgar manner mean ability yet one who must drink cajole elector full a well a sir hyacinth with wit elegance other

stroll about country to sir hyacinth o'brien left dirty work of canvas soft simon have reduced to lowest class of stalkoes walking gentleman a be termed men who have nothing to do fortune to support who style esquire who to use own mode of expression be jealous of title of claim to family antiquity sir hyacinth o'brien knew at once how to flatter simon pride to lure on by promise soft simon believed that baronet if gained election must procure place equivalent to of have be lately deprived upon faith of promise simon worked harder for patron than ever be known to do upon previous occasion be not deficient in essential characteristic of electioneerer boasting carried habit sometimes rather too far for not only boasted so a to bully opposite party so a to deceive friend over bottle often persuaded patron that must command voter with whom have manner of influence for instance told sir hyacinth o'brien that be certain gray must vote for be in consequence of assurance that card of invitation to ball have be sent to rose mother that baronet be now come in person to pay respect at rosanna have kept waiting unconscionable time at cottage door must now show in chapter iv

be contented in obscurity be discontented even in full blaze of celebrity fate be fixed embarked on sea of politics a thoughtlessly a if be only on party of pleasure now be chained to oar galley slave can not be more wretched perhaps beauty of rose have share in exciting sir hyacinth sudden taste for rural felicity be certain at first expressed more disappointment at hearing must not go to ball than at being told father brother must not vote for farmer gray who be a independent in principle a in circumstance honestly answered baronet that thought mr molyneux fittest man to represent county that be for must therefore vote sir hyacinth tried power of persuasion in vain left cottage mortified melancholy met simon o'dougherty when have driven few mile from door in tone of much pique displeasure reproached for having deceived into belief that gray be friend simon be rather embarrassed genius of gossiping have luckily just supplied with hint by must extricate from difficulty fault be own if may make so free a to tell so sir hyacinth o'brien said a capital electioneerer a be will engage will find one will outdo here send stafford back again minute to rosanna will bring three vote a dead a crow in hour time name be not o'dougherty now protest mr o'dougherty understand then let whisper word in ear sir hyacinth will make sensible be right simon winked most significantly

that be in to father brother of course must must secure vote if properly spoken to intelligence did not immediately produce pleasing change of countenance might have be expected sir hyacinth coldly replied must not spare stafford at present drove on genius of gossiping according to usual custom have exaggerated considerably in report stafford be attached to rose have never yet told so a to rose might perhaps have known mind if sir hyacinth gig have not appeared just a be seated on father knee going to tell reason for wishing to go to ball stafford acted in capacity of house steward to baronet have management of master unmanageable servant have brought with from england idea of order punctuality be somewhat new extremely troublesome to domestic at hyacinth hall consequently be much disliked by not only by by most of country people in neighbourhood who imagined have strong predilection in favour of thing be english undisguised contempt for be irish however perceived that prejudice against irish admitted of exception family of gray stafford acknowledged be almost a orderly punctual industrious agreeable a if have be born in england be matter of so much surprise to that

connexion with girl whom nobody know rather whom body know too well be not offer of mine proof mr germaine that wish happiness why really mr darford having lived in world a have done from childhood be not apt to expect much friendship from one especially from people in habit of calculation have be so much deceived where have unguardedly trusted to friendship love of man brought up in sort of way that must forgive if must not bring mind to think have concern for happiness in offer made did indeed suppose must be mortifying circumstance to to see cousin quite ruined by infamous creature say did imagine must be shocked at seeing cousin sent to jail that know be thing discreditable to whole family let be of what sort may from kindness to child see consider a relation human being do suppose have family pride in own way own have great deal of family pride in own way madam replied mr darford with calm smile be proud for instance of having of being able to maintain in perfect independence number of good affectionate child wife whose good sense sweetness of temper constitute happiness of existence mr germaine coloured threw back head strove to conceal anguish of conscience william be sorry have inflicted pain saw that only way to make understood in conversation be to assert real superiority of character to in certain situation factitious pretension of rank fashion never fail to

obstacle to plan of economy have always be accustomed to such such thing there be possibility of living without relation must be perfectly astonished if did not appear in style in have always lived before marriage provoked by insolent absurdity of such argument mr germaine insisted with authoritative voice of husband who be conscious that have reason power on side hence arose daily altercation more bitter even than jealousy have formerly occasioned wife acknowledge can more easily forgive husband infidelity than interference in regulation of household expense of class of amiable female be mr germaine though husband strictly adhered to promise never to have farther connexion with mistress yet be not rewarded by increase of affection kindness from wife on contrary seemed to be rather vexed that be deprived of legitimate subject of complaint must not with so much tragic effect bewail that husband must ruin by folly to loud altercation silent hatred succeeded mr germaine grew sullen
