beaumont idea be utterly thrown out of order by speech part of be exactly what wished expected not that of sentiment contained suggested be new to be not prepared to meet thus clothed in distinct word in such compact form have drawn up force for battle in order unexpectedly decisive movement of enemy discomfited le able tactician might have be in circumstance not only embarrassed utterly defeated yet however unprepared for sudden shock with admirable generalship female hannibal falling back in centre admitted to advance impetuous triumphant till have completely surrounded being of age in few day continued mr beaumont will not make difference surely depend upon that will always invite whomever like to house of hope dear mother will always do favour to be mistress till marry at least for wife feeling added smiling cant engage before have before know who be to be said mr beaumont carelessly time enough a say to think of besides there be few woman in world know scarcely one with whom in relation of mother daughter in law must wish to live wherever live dear son a long a have house hope will always do justice pleasure to consider a master heaven know will never give other man right to dispute with sovereignty of castle cottage whichever may be a to rest pursued mr beaumont can not marry against wish dear edward for wish on a on other subject will ever govern mine son kissed hand with warm gratitude will not hope think that seek to prolong regency to assume undue power influence in affair continued mr beaumont if hint to in general term what think may contribute to happiness must afterwards decide for be now a have ever be master to do a please too much too much have have too much liberty have too little acquired habit of commanding will passion by reason of be sensible excellent friend captain walsingham told year ago that be fault of character charged to watch over so have not so strictly fear a if have watched along with well maam be going to give advice be attention dear son captain walsingham showed judgment more perhaps in pointing out cause than effect weakness of fond mother be sensible did indulge in childhood perhaps more imprudently in youth with unlimited liberty to judge act for mother system of education came ala more from heart than head captain walsingham can not be more sensible of error than be captain walsingham believe never mentioned in reproach to be not man to teach son to see mother error if have always spoke of with greatest respect since must at own expense do justice be well remember upon occasion where spoke too hastily insisted upon will in opposition to yours madam captain walsingham took aside represented to fault into want of command over have betrayed did so forcibly that have never from hour to flatter on material occasion forgotten impression made on mind madam interrupt be going to give advice about advice advice be in opinion fully adequate to direction of own conduct be merely going to suggest that since have not be accustomed to control from mother since have thank high spirit must sooner break than bend must be essential to happiness to have wife of compliant gentle temper not fond of disputing right attached to own opinion not one who must be tenacious of rule unseasonably inflexible unseasonably inflexible undoubtedly maam yet must despise mean spirited wife be sure must compliance proceeds from affection know can never deserve to be called mean spirited must so appear to be persuaded that there be degree of fondness of affection enthusiastic affection disposes temper always to certain softness yieldingness conceive must be peculiarly attractive to essential to happiness in short know temper must not bear contradiction oh indeed maam be quite mistaken quite mistaken at very moment reddens with anger because contradict even in softest gentlest manner in power opinion of dont understand indeed dont understand said mr beaumont beating with whip leaf of bush be near dont understand dont understand be much more able to bear contradiction than think be provided be direct love what be doing at instant added smiling dont love beating about bush look there now strange creature men be so like look to poor father who used to tell that loved to be contradicted yet who must not be sure have lived three day with woman who have ventured to contradict directly influence obtained in heart happiness enjoyed in union attribute to trusting to observation on character rather than to own account of therefore may be permitted to claim judgment of what must suit hereditary temper certainly maam certainly to come to point at once may ask plain question do by reflection mean to allude to particular person be there woman in world at instant must wish to marry yes miss walsingham mr beaumont started with joyful surprise when mother thus immediately pronounced very name wished to hear surprise delight dear mother surprise how can that be surely must know high opinion of miss walsingham added there be woman who may not be taxed with yet be not for friend to lower merit only objection to be will infallibly affront if name name name will not affront only objection to then be superiority be so superior that forgive dont know man not excepted who be at equal think precisely a do rejoice rejoice why there can not sympathize with own a mother must feel little little mortified to see son not superior when comparison be to be daily hourly made to last for life world to see a well a own have mother vanity must wish to see son always what have hitherto

universe have in of language name even for comfort french have be forced to borrow now have got dont know how to use even how to pronounce poor devil well there nothing like old england for comfort ah nothing like old england for comfort echoed mr beaumont in sentimental tone though at instant thought be far distant from word for declaration of love for old england alarmed with notion that might change mind about returning immediately to jamaica that might take root again flourish for year to come in native soil perhaps in neighbourhood to bane of favourite project what must become of scheme of marrying amelia to baronet son to docile albina what must become of scheme of preventing from being acquainted with walsinghams for week might be practicable to keep asunder by policising must never be effected if be to settle even to make long stay in country walsinghams must be affronted then what must become of interest in county son must not be returned without worse than rest mr palmer might take fancy to see walsinghams who be a nearly related to a beaumont seeing might prefer preferring might possibly leave half nay perhaps whole of large fortune to thus hope project might at once be frustrated little aware of long perplexing train of idea honest ejaculation in favour of native country have raised mr palmer went on with own comfortable thought of comfort native land affords know of none so grateful to heart continued a good friend be to be found nowhere else in such perfection man at time of life miss many old friend on return to native country then see still in representative love again in child mr beaumont looked at at instant so like father be image of what friend be when first knew be rejoiced see likeness said mr beaumont amelia dear pour out coffee miss

seldom be even so good a truth there father smile again for young lady if smile deceives there truth in woman find coffee here very bad compared with what have be used to abroad said mr beaumont do rejoice to find here quiet in country continued mr palmer without hearing lady question nothing after like good old english family where thing speaks plenty hospitality without waste ostentation where be received with hearty welcome without compliment let do just a please without form without being persecuted by politeness be image of english country family impressed early upon good old gentleman imagination have remained there fresh unchanged since day of youth now took for granted that must see realized in family of late friend be afraid resumed mr beaumont that after being so long accustomed to west indian life must find many thing unpleasant to feeling here be so kind so accommodating be really possible that have not since return to england experienced uncomfortable sensation suffered serious injury to health dear sir from damp chill of climate why now think of have have cough said mr palmer coughing mr beaumont officiously shut window do acknowledge england be not quite so superior to other country in climate a in thing else yet dont damn climate like lord at time of life man must expect to be valetudinarian must be unjust to blame one native climate for man of seventy five must live where can not where will dr y tell that can live nowhere in west indie oh sir never mind dr y exclaimed young beaumont live with in england many englishman live to great age surely let people say what will of climate perhaps brother interposed amelia who like mr palmer have lived much in warm climate might find return to cold country dangerous must consider what be best for not merely what be most agreeable to ourselves true dearest amelia said mr beaumont to be sure dr y be one of most skilful physician must not be so rash so selfish a to set private wish private opinion in opposition to dr y s advice surely dear sir wont let one physician however eminent send away from banish again from england have very clever physician here dr wheeler in whom have greatest confidence in own case confess must prefer judgment to of london fashionable physician who be so fine so hurried that cant take time to study one particular constitution hear one have to say to now be wheeler great excellence must so like to hear opinion be sure if give against will not say word more if decide for jamaica may be vexed must make point of conscience to submit not to urge good friend to stay in england at own peril happy who can live where please whose fortune put in power to purchase climate to combine comfort luxury of country nothing more be said upon subject mr beaumont turned conversation to different luxury of west east indie mr palmer fatigued by journey retired early to rest little dreaming that kind hostess waked whilst slept for purpose of preparing physician to give proper opinion upon case mr beaumont left note to favourite dr wheeler to be sent very early in morning a if by accident doctor dropped in at breakfast time mr beaumont declared that be luckiest chance imaginable that must happen to call just when be wishing to see when question in debate be stated to with becoming gravity of countenance suavity of manner entered into discussion upon effect of hot cold climate upon solid fluid nervous system in general then upon english constitution in particular lastly upon idiosyncrasy last word cost mr palmer breakfast on hearing turned down cup with profound sigh pushed plate from indication did not escape physician demure eye gaining confidence from weakness of patient dr wheeler now boldly pronounced that in opinion gentleman who after having habituated long to hot climate a jamaica for instance must come late in life to reside in colder climate a england for example must run very great hazard indeed nay must almost venture to predict must fall victim to sudden tension of lax fibre though man of sound good sense in most thing mr palmer weakness be on medical subject a great a ignorance superstitious faith in physician be a implicit a dr wheeler mr beaumont must desire then said mr palmer with sigh still deeper than first for first be for second for country then england old england farewell for ever judge pronounce sentence of transportation upon mr beaumont amelia in eager persuasive tone of remonstrance expostulation at once addressed doctor to obtain mitigation suspension of sentence dr wheeler albeit unused to imperative mood reiterated dictum though little accustomed to hold opinion against argument wish of rich fair upon occasion stood ground against miss mr beaumont wonderfully well for nearly five minute till to utter perplexity dismay saw mr beaumont appear amongst assailant well said must submit not say word if dr wheeler be against began can not sit by silent must protest against cruel cruel decree so contrary too to what hoped expected must be dr wheeler opinion poor dr wheeler twinkled seemed a if must have rubbed eye not sure whether be awake in dream in perplexity apprehended that have misunderstood mr beaumont note now prepared to make way round again through solid fluid whole nervous system till by favour of idiosyncrasy hoped to get out of difficulty to allow mr palmer to remain on british ground mr beaumont face in spite of power of simulation lengthened lengthened darkened darkened a proceeded in recantation when exception to general axiom be fairly made out clear permit to remain in england granted by such high medical authority forced smile joined loudly in general congratulation whilst son be triumphing shaking hand with mr palmer slipped down stair after dr wheeler ah doctor what have done ruined ruined didnt read note didnt understand thought word to wise be enough why then be a understood at first so thought then fancied must be mistaken afterwards for when expected support dear madam opposed opinion in favour of jamaica more warmly than one be to think to think oh dear doctor might have guessed be only sham opposition dear maam cried dr wheeler who though mildest of men be now worked up to something like indignation dear maam sham upon sham be too much for man doctor went down stair murmuring thus by excess of hypocrisy heroine disgusted even own adherent in have honour to resemble of most wily politician famous in english history be too wise ever to let one who must serve injure go discontented out of presence dear good dr wheeler never saw angry before come come cried mr beaumont sliding douceur into hand friend must not be vexed for trifle be only mistake de part dautre youll return here to morrow in way home breakfast with now understand one added in whisper can talk over thing have cool judgment best when only mr palmer be present comprehend who practise many manoeuvre carry on many intrigue at same time have advantage that if one fails success of compensates for disappointment however might have be vexed by slight contre temp with dr wheeler mr beaumont have ample compensation of different sort day due to own exertion owing to accident own exertion prevented dear albina hunter from returning for mr beaumont never sent promised carriage only note of apology nail have run into one of coach horse foot to accident owed that walsinghams be not at home when son galloped over to see next morning to inquire what news from captain walsingham day paper also brought contradiction of report of engagement victory so that mr beaumont apprehension on subject be allayed have doubt that by proper management with sufficient number of note message misunderstanding lame horse crossing upon road might actually get through week without letting walsinghams see mr palmer at least without more than vi morning visit from great danger must be apprehended few indeed have so much character thought so much dexterity in showing a to make dangerous impression in course of formal morning visit chapter vi ah cest mentir tant soit peu jen conviens cest un grand mal mais il produit un bien voltaire third day went off still more successfully dr wheeler called at breakfast frightened mr palmer out of sens about health convinced that life depended upon immediate return to climate of jamaica so point be decided mr beaumont calculating justly that walsinghams must return mr beaumont visit come to pay respect to mr palmer morning settled a soon a breakfast be over plan of operation must keep mr palmer out till dinner time must see charming drive son have made round improvement must have pleasure of showing to assured that might trust to driving so into mr beaumont garden chair got when have fairly prisoner carried far away from danger of intruding visitor may readily be supposed that heroine made good use of five six hour leisure for manoeuvring thus secured so frank cordial be simple hearted old man one mr beaumont must have thought that with manoeuvring be necessary that need only to have trusted to friendship generosity have directly told wish be so prepossessed in favour a being widow of friend that be almost incapable of suspecting of unhandsome conduct besides having have little converse with modern lady imagination be so prepossessed with old fashioned picture of respectable widow lady guardian mother that took for granted mr beaumont be just like one of good matron of former time like lady bountiful lady lizard a such spoke to of family concern in openness of heart knew guile now good mistress beaumont must look upon just a friend colonel must have done a man who have family interest at heart just a much a if be one of yourselves let in to little affair trust with little plan let talk over thing together settle how thing can be done for best for young people know have relation in world family walsinghams of whom by bye know nothing one living have claim upon can leave give own just a please yours be of course first object for how what when must consult only beg to keep in mind must a soon give a bequeath rather for a to what man leaf to friend can only have satisfaction of thinking that will be better for after be dead gone be cold comfort what give have warm comfort of seeing enjoy whilst be alive with generous sentiment exclaimed mr beaumont so unlike person in general who have large fortune at disposal feel so much obliged so excessively not at not at not at more of more of that good lady colonel be friend so there can be obligation between thanks speech just a if be talking to yourself tell mind if there be little embarrassment that son may want to clear off on coming of age if there thing wanting to jointure dear madam if there must be marriage in wind where few thousand more le might be making breaking of heart let hear about do justice to let have pleasure of making young folk old folk too happy own way for have notion of insisting on people being happy way ive too much english liberty in for im sure good lady be a great foe a be to family management mystery where old dont know what young do young what old think thats nonsense french convent work nothing like good old english family so dear mistress beaumont out with make one of yourselves free of family from minute here hand heart upon old friend may presume so far frankness must have opened heart except mr beaumont be misfortune of artful people that can not believe others to be artless think simplicity of character folly else suspect that openness be only affected a bait to draw into snare heroine balanced for moment between two notion must not believe mr palmer to be absolute fool having made large fortune forbad thought then must have thrown thus open merely to try to come at knowledge of debt embarrassment if brought to light must lower opinion of prudence of family excellent friend to be candid with began there be need of generosity at present to relieve son from embarrassment for know that have debt be confident will make jointure thing more than thing must desire a to marriage amelia be so young there time enough to consider true true doe well to take time to consider though dont understand matter much look mightily like notion have of girl thats little bit in love in love oh dear sir dont say so in love why suppose must not say in love there other way of expressing come into fashion since time doubt even then know be not to be said of young lady till signing sealing day popped out cant get back again so must even let pas what harm for know madam without love what must become of world though be jilted once away acknowledge forgive forget dont like girl whit worse for being little bit tender hearted for im morally certain even from little have heard say from way have be brought up from being father daughter mother madam must not fix affection on one must not do honour to choice be only saying same thing in other word that must not approve ah there thing said mr beaumont sighing why now took into head from blush saw morning though how came to notice dont know for to recollection have not noticed girl blushing before twenty year to be sure here have a near interest almost a if be own daughter say from blush saw morning when young beaumont be talking of gallop have taken to inquire about captain walsingham took into head that be happy man oh dear sir never made proposal for amelia be strictly true be sure ever thought of a far a ever heard saving clause of a far a ever heard prevented last assertion from coming under description of falsehood denominated downright lie indeed how must pursued mr beaumont for know be match for amelia have nothing in world commission no there never be proposal from quarter of course be impossible daughter must think of man who have thought of know best good madam merely spoke at random im worst guesser in world especially on matter what people tell know more not le mr beaumont rejoiced in simplicity of companion then good friend be fair to tell said that amelia have admirer lover hey who ah there misfortune be thing never can consent to have then now be out there reason girl blush be so absent at time plan now occurred to mr beaumont scheming imagination thought master piece of policy determined to account for symptom of embarrassment mr palmer might observe in daughter by attributing to thwarted attachment for sir john hunter mr beaumont resolved to make merit to mr palmer of opposing match because lover be baronet thought that mr palmer must be pleased by showing aversion to thought of daughter marrying sprig of quality ingenious method of paying court to open hearted friend at expense equally of truth of daughter executed with usual address well im heartily glad dear good madam to find that have same prejudice against sprig of quality have one good commoner be worth million of to mind so told puppy of nephew of mine who must go buy baronetage forsooth disinherited be dead poor puppy poor young man be new to said mr beaumont with well feigned surprise did not know dear madam have nephew that be dead oh yes not particular particular never talk of not to poor dog credit well he dead for if have lived be afraid must have forgiven never must there be use in thinking more of be saying about amelia amelia let call if be so much attached poor thing to man though be baronet own be against to fancy yet be to be presumed have good quality to balance since value young people must be young have little foolish prepossession for title so forth to be sure must have thought friend daughter above of good family a be with such good sense a inherits too have foible suppose since be so with amelia why do let see baronet swain of hers let try what good can find out in let bring if can over prejudice then dear madam so good kind mother a be will make effort too on part for must see girl happy if be not out of sense reason if man be worthy of be not fault that be sprig of quality must forgive forget give consent dear mr beaumont must ever give consent to marrying sir john hunter cried mr beaumont breathless with amazement for moment thrown off guard so a to speak quite naturally sudden difference in tone manner struck even unsuspicious companion attributed to displeasure at last hint why very dear good friend wife forgive said for interference for a seems opposing opinion about daughter marriage man have right to do if ask plump whether must forgive for marrying sir john hunter answer for can speak nothing truth must if be worthy man thought said mr beaumont astonished disinherited own nephew because took baronet title against will bless dear madam did displease to be sure be least cause of displeasure have let world fancy say what must rather than bring fault to light more about did not take oath that must never leave shilling of fortune to sprig of quality never dearest madam never cried mr palmer laughing never be such gander see what oath people put into one mouth what lie world tell said mr beaumont belief said mr palmer with sly smile surprise mr beaumont felt be mixed with strange rapid confusion of other sentiment regret for having wasted quantity of contrivance manoeuvring against imaginary difficulty arose from too easy belief of secret underhand information through maze of artifice in have involved affair now with difficulty perceived that plain truth must have served purpose better regret for past be not in least mixed with thing like remorse penitence on contrary instantly began to consider how must best profit by own wrong thought saw two of favourite object almost within reach mr palmer fortune future title for daughter obstacle seemed likely to oppose accomplishment of wish except amelia own inclination thought must readily prevail upon to give up for knew that daughter be of timid of affectionate temper that have never in instance withstood even disputed maternal authority that dread of displeasure have often proved sufficient to make amelia suppress sacrifice own feeling combining reflection with wonted rapidity mr beaumont determined what play must now be saw thought saw that ought either by gentle strong mean to lure intimidate amelia to purpose that while carried on part of plot with daughter in private must appear to mr palmer to yield to persuasion by degree to make young people happy own way to be persuaded reluctantly out of aversion to sprig of quality to be sure must be necessary to give fresh explanation instruction to sir john hunter through sister with new part that be to act in domestic drama a soon a mr beaumont returned from airing therefore retired to own apartment wrote note of explanation with proper proportion of sentiment verbiage to dear albina begging to see sir john hunter very next day horse have be lamed by nail now of course have recovered be found by mr beaumont that have be misinformed that have be lamed only by sudden cramp excuse knew must be sufficient in present state of affair to young lady who be more ready to be deceived than even heroine be disposed to deceive indeed a machiavel say a there be people willing to cheat there will always be who be ready to be cheated chapter vii vous menchantez mais vous mpouvantez ce pieges l sont il bien ajusts craignez vous point de vous laisser surprendre dans le filet que vos main savent tendre voltaire to prepare amelia to receive sir john hunter properly be mr beaumont next attempt for a have represented to mr palmer that daughter be attached to sir john be necessary that manner must in degree accord with representation at least must not exhibit symptom of disapprobation dislike coldness reserve might appear must be easy to attribute to bashfulness dread of mr palmer observation when amelia be undressing at night mother went into room having dismissed maid threw into arm chair exclaimed half yawning how tired be wonder long airing a took to day dear amelia must not sleep to night without telling how glad be to find that be such favourite with mr palmer be glad like said amelia be sure like what benevolent excellent man seems to be excellent excellent best creature in world so interested about so anxious that must be well soon established almost a anxious about a be be very good be very good mamma there be occasion must be soon established a be called be there be regular answer know in case from young lady that ever be born in out of book within memory of man will suppose to be said prettily on part answered properly on mine so give leave to go on to something more to purpose dont look so alarmed love know be not hurrying person will take own time thing will be done a like whole will be kept amongst ourselves entirely for nothing be so disadvantageous distressing to young woman a to have thing talked of in world long before take place maam surely there be marriage determined upon for without even knowing determined upon oh dear darling will decide thing for thank mother now be kind indeed indubitably dearest amelia must not decide on thing without consulting for have greatest dependence on prudence judgment with silly romantic girl who have discretion must certainly think duty to do otherwise if saw daughter following headlong idle fancy of fifteen must interpose authority at once say must not be know amelia so well that be confident will judge a prudently for a must for indeed be persuaded that opinion will be now a almost always be sweet girl same hope so mamma well well ill allow maidenly will allow sir john hunter will be man at last oh mamma can never be said amelia with much earnestness never young lady never amelia will allow too dont interrupt dear give leave to tell again that will have own time mr palmer have given consent approbation consent approbation cried amelia be come to without even consulting be way be left to judge for oh mother mother what will become of amelia who have long have experience that be vain for to attempt to counteract oppose scheme that mother have planned sat down at instant in despair even from despair took courage rising suddenly exclaimed never can will marry sir john hunter for love person mother know do will speak truth abide by let consequence be what may well dear dont speak so loud at event for though may be very proper to speak truth be not necessary that whole universe must hear speak of attachment be possible that allude to captain walsingham captain walsingham have never proposed for even given reason to think must if have must have deceived in grossest manner be incapable of deceiving body said amelia never gave reason to think must propose for ever made slightest attempt to engage affection saw conduct be always uniform be incapable of double underhand practice in warmth of eulogium on captain walsingham seem amelia to forget that reflect in most severe manner upon for what

at time when mr beaumont have proposed to set out for walsingham house mr beaumont with well dissembled look of vexation exclaimed a looked out of window at carriage how provoking who can people be hope martin will say be not at home ring ring amelia oh too late have seen martin stupid creature have let in mr palmer be much discomfited grew more more impatient when troublesome visitor protracted stay proposed walk to see improvement in ground good mistress beaumont said know be engaged to cousin walsingham morning if will give leave will go on before with mr beaumont can say what detains disconcerted by simple determination of straight forward plain spoken old gentleman mr beaumont saw that farther delay on part must be not only inefficacious dangerous now be eager to be relieved from difficulty have contrived must not for consideration have trusted mr palmer to pay visit without therefore by able counter movement extricated not only without loss with advantage from perilous situation made handsome apology to visitor for being obliged to run away from must leave amelia to have pleasure of showing ground mr beaumont be irresistible in arrangement amelia disappointed afraid to show how deeply felt disappointment be obliged to stay to do honour of beaumont park whilst mother drove off rejoicing in success at least of stratagem even a politician used upon occasion too much artifice be said of cardinal mazarin be great politician in politics there be one capital defect cest quil veut toujours tromper how tiresome people be thought never must have got away from said mr beaumont what possessed to come morning to pay horrid long visit besides duttons at time be most stupid creature upon face of earth can not endure so awkward ill bred too yet of good family who must think be people one must see be absolutely insufferable insufferable said mr palmer why good madam then have patience of martyr for suffered so patiently that never must have guessed suffered at protest thought be friend favourite of yours that be very glad to see well well ti way of world continued mr palmer sort of what do call double dealing about visitor go on where madam beaumont how do know that when go away may not be a glad to get rid of a be to get away from duttons added in tone of forced jocularity how do know that minute back be turned may not begin to take to piece in turn say that old palmer be most tiresome humoursome strange old fashioned fellow thought must never have got rid of dear dear sir how can speak in such manner cried mr beaumont who have made several vain attempt to interrupt speech who be best friend be possible must suspect be there difference to be made between friend common acquaintance be sure hope there be said mr palmer smiling there be something so near truth in mr palmer raillery that mr beaumont must not take with a much easy unconcern a occasion required especially in presence of son who maintained provoking silence unhappy indeed be who can not in such moment of distress in own family in nearest connexion find relief from embarrassment who look round in vain for one to be responsible for sincerity mr beaumont sat uneasy almost disconcerted mr palmer felt for snuff box usual consolation be not in pocket have left on table now mr beaumont be relieved for have something to do something to say with wonted politeness in spite of remonstrance from mr palmer man martin be sent back for snuff box conjecture about finding being able to overtake before arrived at walsingham house supplied conversation for mile two here martin coming back full gallop vow said miss hunter who must also talk on topic come come good lady said mr palmer taking moment when young lady have turned back a stretched out of carriage for pleasure of seeing martin gallop come come good mr beaumont shake hand be friend hang duttons did not mean to vex by what said be not so polite a must be know perhaps be little too polite be great harm especially in woman martin snuff box came up at instant be apparently a well a ever yet mr beaumont who valued reputation for sincerity a much a chartres valued reputation for honesty nearly upon same principle be seriously vexed that even transient light have be let in upon real character to such accident duplicity be continually subject chapter ix led by simplicity divine pleased never tried to shine gave to chance unschoold feature left cause to sense nature more arrived at walsingham park met miss walsingham walking at distance from house be captain walsingham come be first question asked expected hour that have not actually arrived be comfortable reprieve to mr beaumont breathing more freely in refreshed spirit prepared to alight from carriage to walk to house with miss walsingham a mr palmer proposed miss hunter who be dressed with uncommon elegance remonstrated in favour of delicate slipper not that named real object of solicitude have not spent so much time with mr beaumont great mistress of art of apologizing without learning at least inferior practice of trade of course have little common art of excuse ever ready instead of saying that did not like to walk because be afraid to spoil shoe protested be afraid of heat must not walk so far mr beaumont have jumped out of carriage mr beaumont did not wish that must walk home tte tte with miss walsingham therefore miss hunter remonstrance be of avail love will not be heated for walk be through charming shady grove if be tired here son will give arm satisfied with arrangement young lady thus supported found possible to walk mr palmer walked own pace looking round at beauty of place desiring that nobody might mind be way mr beaumont never teased with talking to when did not seem to be in humour for who made something of thing began to manage conversation with other companion during walk so a to favour view upon several party pursuing principle that love be in men mind generally independent of esteem believing that son might be rendered afraid of superiority of miss walsinghams understanding mr beaumont took treacherous pain to draw out starting from chance seemingly a well knew how subject of debate went from talking of late marriage of neighbouring couple to discus question on believed that miss walsinghams opinion must differ from of son point be whether wife must must not have pin money miss walsingham thought that wife accepting must tend to establish separate interest between married people mr beaumont on contrary be of opinion that wife having separate allowance must prevent dispute so miss hunter thought of course for have be prepared to be precisely of mr beaumont opinion reason have none in support indeed said with pretty simper thought that woman have nothing to do with reason reasoning that thought woman who really loved body be always of person opinion especially in wife did not see of what use reasoning must be except to make woman contradict be odd fond of ruling that for part have pretension to understanding if have ever so much must be glad declared upon honour to get rid of if must for what use must possibly be of to when must be husband understanding must always judge rule wife ought only to obey be always of opinion of man of choice having thus made profession of folly in broken sentence with pretty confusion becoming grace leaned upon mr beaumont arm with bewitching air of languid delicacy solicited support mr beaumont suppressing sigh however took care that son must hear turned to miss walsingham in whisper owned that must not help loving ability spirit too even in own sex then observed aloud that much might be urged on side of question with regard to pin money for not only a miss walsingham justly said might tend to make separate interest between husband wife wife must probably be kept in total ignorance of husband affair in case might be very disadvantageous a woman be more capable from superior understanding of managing thing than most men indeed than man must name even under favour of pretty compliment be plainly directed by glance of mr beaumont eye miss walsingham must not accept of painful pre eminence explained made clear that have not ambition to rule manage can readily believe said mr beaumont for have observed that be not always woman who be most able to decide who be most ambitious to govern observation be not heard be not understood by miss hunter whose whole soul be occupied in settling fold of drapery mr beaumont speech have full effect on mr beaumont who bit lip looked reproachfully at son a if thought infringement of promised truce moment afterwards felt imprudence of own reproachful look be sensible that must have done better not to have fixed opinion feeling in son mind by noticing thus with displeasure recovering for never be disconcerted for more than minute passed on with easy grace to discus merit of heroine of new novel historic novel gave opportunity of appealing to miss walsingham on disputed point of history dexterously attempted to draw well informed young friend into display of literature might alarm mr beaumont education have in respect be shamefully neglected for mother have calculated that ignorance must ensure dependence have endeavoured to supply at late period of education defect of commencement be sensible that have not supplied deficiency be apt to feel with painful impatient sensibility inferiority whenever literary subject be introduced miss walsingham however be so perfectly free from affectation vanity of bel esprit that did not alarm even who be inferior to in knowledge self complacency instead of being depressed by comparison of attainment with hers be insensibly raised by perception that notwithstanding must take pleasure in conversation must appreciate good sense originality of thought without recurring to authority of book of great name in fact mind have never be overwhelmed by wasteful torrent of learning that stream of literature have passed over be apparent only from fertility mr beaumont repented of having drawn into conversation indeed heroine have trusted too much to expression have at time dropped from son about learned lady certain conversaziones have concluded that must never endure literature in wife now perceived mistake discerned too late at moment be doubly vexed for saw miss hunter produce in most disadvantageous contrast to rival in conformity to instruction mr beaumont have secretly given not to show too much sense learning because gentleman in general in particular mr beaumont disliked young lady now professed absolute ignorance incapacity upon subject meaning to have air of pretty childish innocence timidity really made appear quite like simpleton at same time tinge of ineffectual malice envy appeared through ill feigned humility must give opinion of book oh must not give judgment for whole world did not think qualified to speak even if have read book indeed have not for really never read be not reading lady a miss hunter have portion of mr beaumont quick penetration did not see unfavourable impression word made certain that be following exactly secret instruction be confident of being in right line so on went whilst mr beaumont sighed in vain miss walsingham who now saw understood whole play almost smiled at comic of scene o dear mr beaumont continued miss hunter how can ever appeal to about book sort of thing when know know nothing about matter for mercy sake never do so more for know ive taste for sort of thing besides own even if must must so hate to be thought blue stocking must not have least bit of blue in stocking for whole world id rather have other colour black white red green yellow other colour so own im not sorry im not what call genius for though genius to be sures very fascinating sort of thing in gentleman yet in woman be not so becoming think especially in lady doe very well on stage for artist so on really now in company think awkward thing must make one look so odd now mr beaumont must tell anecdote stop dear miss hunter ear ring be coming out stay let clasp love exclaimed mr beaumont determined to stop in career of nonsense by giving sensation since must not give idea new turn oh maam maam oh ear be killing dearest mr beaumont pinching to death maam did pinch dear be hinge of ear ring suppose dont know what be here blood declare love beg thousand pardon how must be so awkward why must not for one moment hold little head still miss walsingham applied patch to wound pretty ear a be continued mr beaumont be sure be pity to hurt really did hurt said mr beaumont in tone of compassion oh horridly cried miss hunter always faint at sight of blood afraid that young lady must again spoil part in acting lose advantage might result from combined effect of pretty ear of compassion mr beaumont endeavoured to take off attention from wound by attacking ear ring love said dont wear ear ring more for assure there be possibility of shutting opening without hurting expedient however nearly proved fatal in consequence miss hunter entered most warmly into defence of ear ring appealed to mr beaumont to confirm decision that be prettiest best ear ring in world unluckily did not particularly suit fancy young lady who have hour before professed that must never be of different opinion in thing from of man loved now pettishly declared that must not must not give up taste incensed still more by bow of submission not of conviction from mr beaumont went on regardless of dearest mr beaumont frown vehemently maintained judgment quoting with triumphant volubility innumerable precedent of lady who have just bought very same ear ring whose taste believed nobody must dispute mr beaumont have seen enough now upon many other occasion to be convinced that be not on matter of consequence that lady be apt to grow most angry stood confirmed in belief that who in theory professed to have humble opinion of own ability that can not do understand thing useful be often in practice most prone to insist upon infallibility of taste judgment mr beaumont who saw with one glance of quick eye what passed at moment in son mind sighed said to herself how impossible to manage fool who ravel a fast a one weave web of fortune yet though mr beaumont perceived acknowledged impracticability of managing fool for single hour be one of favourite object of manoeuvre to obtain very fool for daughter in law with hope of governing for life so inconsistent be cunning people even of best ability so ill do calculate value of ultimate object however ingeniously devise mean adapt to end during walk mr palmer have taken part in conversation have seemed engrossed with own thought occupied with observing beauty of place tired with walk for mr beaumont always complained of being fatigued when be vexed thus at once concealing vexation throwing fault of mind upon body stretched upon sofa a soon a reached house did recover from exhausted state till cast eye upon tamborine knew must afford mean of showing miss hunter figure grace to advantage slight a resource may seem mr beaumont well knew that slighter still have often produced great effect soon afterward observed son smile repeatedly a read passage in book that lay upon table have curiosity to take up book when turned away found that be cumberland memoir saw following little poem marked with reiterated line of approbation why affectation why mock grimace go silly thing hide that simpring face thy lisping prattle thy mincing gait thy

beaumont moment have read line perceived why son have smiled portrait seemed really to have be drawn from miss hunter line be so propos to scene have just passed during walk that be impossible to avoid application mr beaumont shut book hastily a dear albina approached for be afraid that young lady must have known own picture so few people however even of much wiser than miss hunter know that need not have be alarmed have longer leisure to devote thought to subject for mr walsingham who have be out riding have by time returned moment entered room mr beaumont attention be directed to to mr palmer introduced to other with many expression of regret that must not sooner have met character be free from artifice immediately coalesce a metal be perfectly pure can be readily cemented together mr palmer mr walsingham be intimate in hour there be air of openness sincerity about mr walsingham freedom directness in conversation delighted mr palmer be heartily glad have met at last good cousin walsingham said very sorry must have be to have left country without becoming acquainted with now wish gallant captain be arrived be to set off day after to morrow be sadly afraid will miss seeing mr walsingham said that a expected hour hoped mr palmer must persuade mr beaumont to spend day at walsingham house mr beaumont dared not object on contrary be now policy to pretend fondest friendship for walsingham family yet time pursuing plan of preventing mr palmer from discerning real character superior merit managed with great dexterity to keep conversation a much a possible upon general topic tried to prevent mr palmer from being much alone with mr walsingham for dreaded growing intimacy after dinner however when lady retired gentleman drew chair close together have great deal of conversation on interesting subject most interesting be captain walsingham mr palmer earnestly desired to hear particular of history from whom said young beaumont turning to mr walsingham can hear better than from captain walsinghams guardian friend chapter x yet never seaman more serenely brave led britain conquering squadron oer wave friend be not always best biographer said mr walsingham will try to be impartial ward first desire to be sailor be excited a have often since told by reading robinson crusoe when be scarcely thirteen went out in resolute frigate under command of captain campbell campbell be excellent officer very strict in related to order discipline be principle practice never to forgive first offence by number of second fault be considerably diminished ward be not much pleased at first with captain be afterwards convinced that strictness be what made man of be buffeted about shown rough of life made to work hard submit to authority to reason be always ready to yield by degree learned that first duty a sailor be implicit obedience in due time be made lieutenant in situation mixed duty of command obedience be difficult because first lieutenant captain son be jealous of walsingham found more difficult task to win confidence of son than have be to earn friendship of father punctuality in obeying order respectful manner to lieutenant availed little for young campbell still viewed with scornful yet with jealous eye imagining that only wanted to show better officer of falsehood of suspicion walsingham have at last opportunity of giving unquestionable proof

taste gloried in descanting with technical precision on merit of dish of cook table even on shipboard be to be equalled in elegance only by toilet puppy exclaimed mr palmer how must captain walsingham go on with coxcomb very ill may be sure said beaumont for walsingham ill answer for never must conceal control feeling of contempt indignation yet a captain jemmisons lieutenant always behaved with perfect propriety said mr walsingham bore with foppery impertinence with patience becoming subordinate officer to superior jemmison must not endure lieutenant whose character manner be continual

being observed by lady that have nothing of sea captain about other officer encouraged by precept example left ship walsingham stayed on board have severe duty to perform for must not allow crew to go on shore because got into riot with townspeople soon after arrival even during course of voyage have observed among sailor something like disposition to mutiny encouraged probably by negligence apparent effeminacy of captain though knew to be man of intrepidity yet ridiculed despised coxcombry relaxation of discipline gave hope of succeeding in mutinous scheme walsingham strongly repeatedly represented to captain jemmison danger remonstrated with other officer upon imprudence of leaving ship at juncture jemmison in prettily rounded period protested saw penumbra of danger till be called upon by mar owned preferred charm of venus be vastly elegant nevertheless happened one night when captain after having eaten admirable supper be paying court to creole lady of spanish town news be

fellow thought there be time to be lost twice before must finish what be about message came from captain jefferies to order to something else then violent crash above from fall of mast then heard one cry ill be cursed if must care if did know where abouts be then be in such uproar that voice must be distinguished at last cabin door unlocked many voice called upon at once to come upon deck instant save ship walsingham absolutely refused to do thing for till returned to duty delivered up to arm ringleader jefferies at answer stood aghast tried entreaty threat in vain walsingham coolly said must go to bottom along with ship rather than say word to save till submitted storm blew stronger danger moment increasing one of mutineer came with drawn cutlas levelled blunderbuss at walsingham swearing to despatch instant if must not tell where be murder will be hanged persist in mutiny youll be drowned said walsingham youll never make swerve from duty know have answer enraged sailor seized in arm carried by force upon deck where sight of danger cry of throw overboard over with only seemed to fortify resolution not word not sign must get from rudder be now unshipped at sailor fury turned suddenly upon jefferies who between terror ignorance be utterly incapacitated seized bound gave up to walsingham returned to duty then not till then walsingham resumed command walsinghams voice once more heard inspired confidence with hope revived exertion of sailor be not seaman enough to tell how ship be saved that be saved saved by walsingham be certain remember only that made ship manageable by contrivance substituted in place of rudder have be unshipped storm abating made for first port to repair ship damage intending to return to jamaica to deliver up to captain from vessel spoke at sea

place where gunpowder be kept said have mean of blowing up ship if ever attempt to mutiny again first finger lay upon blow up instantly have found to be man of resolution kept to duty not symptom of disobedience during rest of voyage in passage fell in with enemy ship far superior to in force there lad said walsingham if have mind to earn pardon there best chance take home with to captain king loud cheer be answer fought like devil to redeem walsingham without stopping to make panegyric need only tell that walsinghams conduct intrepidity be time crowned with success took enemy ship carried in triumph into portsmouth jemmison be on platform when came in what mortifying sight be to what proud hour to walsingham may imagine having delivered dreadnought prize over to captain next thing to be thought of be trial of mutineer except jefferies obtained pardon in consideration of return to duty subsequent service jefferies be hanged at yard arm trial of mutineer brought on a jemmison foresaw must many animadversion on own conduct powerful connexion friend in place silenced a much a possible public voice jemmison gave excellent dinner endeavoured to drown whole affair in choice champagne london particular madeira so health success to british navy be drunk in bumper toast ay ay think to do thing now in england by dinner bumper toast three time three said mr palmer did not do

must like puppy related to not be that a may youll do justice im sure for though be puppy be brave fellow here for party purpose have raised cry of being coward want to shoot pour encourager le autres what say will damn save have too good opinion of to think that old grudge though might have cause for must stand in way walsingham answered a usual that opinion evidence must be known on day of trial dashleigh went away very ill satisfied persuaded that walsingham harboured revenge against relation at last when be called upon in court walsinghams conduct be just generous for though answer spoke exact truth yet brought forward nothing to disadvantage of jemmison what truth compelled to state in captain favour on contrary spoke so strongly of intrepidity of gallant action in former instance have performed in service a quite to efface recollection of foppery epicurism a much a possible to excuse negligence walsinghams evidence absolutely confuted unjust charge suspicion of cowardice have be raised against jemmison made impression in favour that instead of being dismissed service even having ship taken from a be expected jemmison got off with reprimand be sure well deserved said mr palmer certainly walsingham be right not to let be run down by popular cry especially a have used ill said mr beaumont well well dont care about puppy cried mr palmer only go on sooner be trial over

determination to stay in england have spread degree of cheerfulness over whole family have not be felt for time at beaumont park in general delight mr beaumont be compelled seemingly to sympathize performed part so well that even dr wheeler captain lightbody who have be behind scene began to believe that actress be in earnest amelia ala knew mother too well to be dupe even of most consummate power of acting mr beaumont said about joy hope that captain walsingham must soon appear confirm happy pre sentiment amelia heard without daring to believe have such opinion of mother address sublime superstitious dread that mother must by inscrutable mean work out own purpose that felt a if must not escape from secret machination amelia still apprehended that sir john hunter must not be irrevocably dismissed that by turn of artifice must find bound to next morning sir john hunter however finally relieved from apprehension after having be closeted for upwards of two hour with mr beaumont begged to speak to miss beaumont resigned pretension to honour have so long so ardently aspired to be pride to show that spirit be not affected by disappointment scarcely indeed exhibited that decent appearance of mortification be usually expected on occasion with provoking haughtiness professed sincerely obliged to miss beaumont for having however late in business prevented by candour from danger of crossing inclination for must scarcely be sufficiently thankful when considered how day showed consequence of marrying young lady whose affection be previously engaged have only to add that hoped world must see thing in same light in took that miss beaumont might not find herself blamed for breaking off matter after have be so publicly reported that for part assured must a far a be concerned do utmost to silence unpleasant observation that a most effectual mean to do conceived must be to show that continued on amicable footing with family must do honour to avail of permission invitation indeed have just received from mr beaumont to continue visit a usual at beaumont park to amelia must make objection after express declaration have just made that renounced pretension to favour however keenly felt implied reproach of having encouraged sir john a admirer while affection be previously engaged of having shown candour late in affair must not vindicate without accusing mother therefore attempted excuse apology submitted to let unfeeling baronet enjoy confusion whilst said in general term felt obliged by assurance that must not be cause of quarrel between two family who have hitherto lived in friendship chapter xiv soft thought gratitude must move to gold fled from beauty from love dryden passed in two hour conversation between discarded baronet mother of late mistress did not transpire mr beaumont said that have taken infinite pain to reconcile sir john to fate subsequent behaviour showed that have succeeded attention towards also plainly proved that be not dissatisfied by part have acted rather by part that thought have acted thus thing went on smoothly mr beaumont in confidence told friend miss hunter sir john have behaved with greatest propriety candour candour that hackneyed word that have acknowledged that principal inducement to propose for daughter have be desire to be connected with family for have such peculiar regard love continued mr beaumont be know that brother must with propriety say on occasion indeed must permit to say a to rest on amelia account know must not refuse request to continue visit in family on same footing of friendship a usual whether be truth whole truth mystery involves cabinet council more especially of female politician prevents cautious historian from presuming to decide arguing from general cause from established character ruling passion of party concerned may safely conjecture that baronet did not at time make decisive proposal to lady that kept at liberty to advance recede a circumstance must render expedient ruling passion be avarice though have be allured by hint sister have thrown out concerning mr beaumont increased jointure vast expectancy from mr palmer yet be not so rash a to act decisively upon such vague information have wisely determined to obtain accurate positive evidence from captain lightbody who seemed in case to be common vouchee lightbody happened to be gone out to shoot flapper consequently sir john wisely entrenched in general profession of regard to mr beaumont reflection on happiness of being connected with respectable family mr beaumont who understood

absurdity of resolution against marriage in general at instant formed plan of marrying miss hunter to one of nephew instead of son have one unmarried nephew young man of good figure agreeable manner with only younger brother portion to thought miss hunter large fortune must be highly convenient have reason to believe that taste in choice of wife must be easily governed by advice by interest thus must at least prevent young friend affection fortune from going out of family in consequence of glimpse of new scheme indefatigable politician applied to prepare way for with wonted skill soothed lovelorn pettish damsel with expression must gratify pride rouse high thought of revenge suggested that instead of making rash vow of celibacy must only show forlorn constancy miss hunter must abide

time when mr beaumont have be somewhat to blame in roughness of sincerity towards mother when have be disposed to break from artful restraint captain walsingham by conversation by letter have always used power influence to keep within bound whenever must do so with truth to raise mr beaumont in opinion now appeared in more advantageous light to family be more disposed to believe in sincerity than have ever be since credulous day of childhood day of love childhood be perhaps in good mind almost equally credulous at least confiding even mr walsingham be won over by pleasure felt in prospect of daughter happiness good mr palmer be ten time more attentive than ever to madam beaumont in attention however there be something more ceremonious than formerly be evident for be too honest to conceal feeling that opinion of be changed that attention be paid to rather a widow of old friend than on own account amelia who particularly remarked change who feared that must be severely painful to mother tried by honest art of kindness to reinstate in regard amelia however succeeded only in raising in esteem disturb dear young lady said to one day about mother thing be on right footing between can never be on other see be quite satisfied mr beaumont indeed have not amelia quick sensibility with regard to real affection of friend though be awake to external mark of attention be content a mr palmer before others always treated with marked deference gave reason to apprehend alteration in testamentary disposition when settlement be talked of for intended marriage mr palmer seemed to consider mr beaumont first in consultation appealed for opinion have ever most cautious eye upon interest observed with satisfaction be gratified by demonstration of increased regard from son daughter because thought must facilitate project wished that marriage with sir john hunter must appear well to world for reason desired that must seem to be liked by family seem for a to real opinion be indifferent thing be in situation when mr beaumont caused to be surprised one morning by mr palmer with letter in hand deep in reverie oh dear mr palmer be cried starting very naturally be really so lost in thought mr palmer hoped that did not disturb disturb good friend be very person wished to consult eye glanced again again upon letter held in hand mr palmer seemed provokingly destitute of curiosity however took chair snuff box with polite cold manner said be much honoured by consulting that of course judgment must be of little service to lady of mr beaumont understanding understanding ah said there be case where understanding be of use to woman contrary mr palmer did not contradict assertion did assent to waited with pinch of snuff arrested in way to have case specified in love affair for instance poor woman said mr beaumont looking down prettily mr palmer afforded assistance to bashful hesitation be under necessity of finishing sentence of beginning upon different construction latter be most convenient took new franker tone here letter from poor sir john hunter mr palmer still sat bending forward to listen with most composed deference pressed not in slightest degree upon confidence by question look down towards letter up towards lady face straightforward looked till quite provoked by dulness mr beaumont took matter up again in new tone said to be candid with dear friend be subject on feel awkwardness reluctance in speaking to for of men breathing must in important action of life wish for approbation yet on present occasion fear so doe sir john that

father give consent madam though be old enough certainly to be father yet even if have honour to be so in reality a be arrived at year of discretion know can not need consent seriously excellent friend cried never must be happy in marrying against approbation let in own vindication explain to whole of affair here mr palmer dreading one of long explanation knew must never comprehend besought not to invest with unbecoming character of judge represented that vindication be necessary that none must be of use however persisted in going through sentimental defence of conduct assured mr palmer that have determined never to marry again that inviolable respect for dear colonel beaumont memory have induced to persist in resolution for many year motif of delicacy generosity be what first prevailed with to listen to sir john suit that now consoled supported by proud reflection that be acting a dear colonel beaumont must know circumstance read heart must wish enjoin to act here smile seemed to play upon mr palmer countenance smile have vanished in instant be followed by sudden gush of tear be a suddenly wiped away not however before reminded mr beaumont to spread handkerchief

certainly occasion to use management with eloquence be only wasting for be not so presumptuous so unreasonable a to set up for judge of action do honour by consulting a already know opinion of gentleman must decline saying thing further on subject mr beaumont be left in painful state of doubt a to main point whether mr palmer must must not alter will however a be determined that match must be accomplished took advantage of declaration mr palmer made that have right to object to following own inclination told sir john hunter mr palmer be perfectly satisfied that have indeed relieved mind from foolish scruple by having assured that be colonel beaumont particular wish often expressed in confidential letter that widow must marry again so far so good then affair be to be broken to son

elmours when evening be over when have leisure to be good almeria called severely to account for secret satisfaction of have be conscious from preference given over friend accused of ingratitude endeavoured to recover own self complacency by redoubled profession of esteem affection for to whom have so much reason to be attached fresh invitation came from lady stock course of thought again changed ellen declined accompanying miss turnbull regretted exceedingly because must be so distressing awkward for to go alone then why do go at dear said ellen speak a if there be moral necessity for visit moral necessity oh said almeria laughing really think there be polite necessity if will allow expression must not be rude for of to refuse when lady stock have made music party a say entirely on account on account mean for see mention fondness for music if have not written so remarkably civilly to assure must neither go think of pressing to go oratory have effect upon ellen heroine went alone

sat down to dinner in silence colouring prodigiously totally abashed good old mr elmour be first to relent to endeavour by resuming usual kind familiarity to relieve painful confusion ellens coolness be also dissipated when miss turnbull took aside after dinner with tear in eye declared be sorry have not have sufficient strength of mind to resist lady stock importunity to stay night a to carriage be sent back without knowledge that morning though have three four time expressed fear that must keep friend at elmour grove waiting for dinner yet lady stock must not understand hint declared got away very instant ladyship carriage came to door by ellens kind interposition frederick whose pride have be most ready to take alarm at least appearance of slight to father sister be pacified laid aside ceremony to miss turnbull called almeria a used to do be well again with difficulty blush almeria came out with after confession that have be so silly a to make promise to lady stock of going to ball of spending few day with at york before left country promise be only conditional said if father must take least ill unkindly of assure will not go must rather offend lady stock in world than dearest ellen father to whom be so much obliged talk of obligation interrupted ellen amongst friend there can be obligation will answer for that father will not be offended at going to ball assure will not take unkindly if must not think very proud must tell wish for sake a well a own that must see a much of lady stock a many lady stock a possible for be convinced that upon intimate acquaintance must rise in opinion almeria protested that have never for instant thought of comparing ellen with lady stock friend bosom friend with acquaintance acquaintance of yesterday never thought of making such comparison be very thing of complain said ellen smiling beg will make comparison dear almeria more opportunity have of forming judgment better notwithstanding that there be something rather humiliating to miss turnbull in dignified composure with ellen now for first time in life implied own superiority almeria secretly rejoiced that be at friend own request that visit to fine acquaintance be repeated at lady stock ball miss turnbull be much distinguished a be called sir thomas eldest son be partner though be not remarkably agreeable yet attention be flattering to vanity because rival belle of york vied for homage delight of being taken notice of in public be new to almeria quite intoxicated brain six hour sleep afterwards be not sufficient to sober completely a friend at elmour grove perceived next morning talked looked moved like though be perfectly unconscious that in delirium of vanity affectation be object of pity disgust to man loved have sufficient good nature candour to make allowance for foible in others from own character be totally free be clear sighted to merit not blind to fault of friend resolved to wait patiently till almeria must return to herself miss turnbull in compliance with friend advice took a many opportunity a possible of being with lady stock ladyship company be by mean agreeable to almerias natural taste for ladyship have sense knowledge conversation consisted merely of common place phrase second hand affectation of fashionable nonsense yet though miss turnbull felt actual pleasure in company be vain of being of party even condescended to repeat of saying in there be sense wit from having lived much in london world ladyship be acquainted with prodigious number of name of person of consequence quality by heroine ear be charmed ladyship dress be also object of admiration imitation york lady begged pattern of thing wore almeria consequently thought that other clothes must be worn with propriety be utterly ashamed of past self for having lived so long in ignorance for having have so bad taste a ever to have thought ellen elmour model for imitation miss elmour ladyship said be very sensible young woman doubt must hardly be considered a model of fashion new standard for estimating merit be raised in almerias mind friend for instant sunk before vast advantage of having most fashionable mantua maker milliner in town ashamed of dereliction of principle few minute afterwards warmly pronounced panegyric on ellen to lady stock only replied with vacant supercilious countenance may be so doubt of course elmours be very respectable family im told really more genteel than country family one see be not odd dont mix more one seldom meet in town where at of watering place in summer to charge almeria with blush be forced to plead guilty for friend however observed in mitigation that when be in town what company did see be always best believed that knew for one person duchess of be friend of elmours corresponded with ellen judicious defence produced immediate effect upon lady stock countenance eyebrow descended from high arch of contempt after pause remarked be strange that have not accepted of of invitation have lately sent fancied be a indeed have character of being very proud people very odd almeria denied pride oddity observed that be remarkably fond of home well dear miss turnbull thats what call odd be sure have nothing to say against that be fashion now to let body do a please if elmours like to bury alive im sure cant have smallest objection only hope dont insist upon burying along with im going to harrowgate for few day must have with dear heroine hesitated lady stock smiled said saw miss turnbull be terribly afraid of elmours for part be last person in world to break through old connexion really people ought to consider that other people can not always live a do one style of life be fit for one style of fortune one for that must look very strange to world if heiress with two hundred thousand pound fortune who if produced might be in first circle in town be to be boxed up at elmour grove precluded from advantage offer that might of course expect to do heroine justice here interrupted lady stock with more eagerness than strict politeness admitted positively declared that friend never for one moment wished to confine at elmour grove on contrary said urged to go into company to see something of world before marry be going to say paused lady stock waited for finishing word when did not come went on just a if have be pronounced elmours do vastly right proper to talk to in style for must be very much blamed in world if acted otherwise know young elmour have fortune to make very clever certainly be will rise doubt im told in profession be not same a ready made fortune heiress like have right to expect let annoy with reflection perhaps there be nothing in report really only repeat what hear body say in what body say know there must be something positively think ought to show in justice to elmours that be at liberty that want to monopolize in unaccountable sort of way to last argument heroine yielded to chose to attribute yielding went to harrowgate with lady stock day hour became more desirous of appearing fashionable to one object thought be directed living in public be to new life be continually sensible of dependence upon opinion of more experienced companion felt awkwardness of being surrounded by people with whom be unacquainted at first whenever appeared imagined that body be looking at talking about be in perpetual apprehension that something in dress manner must become subject of criticism ridicule from fear be soon relieved by conviction that most people be so occupied with a totally to overlook sometimes indeed heard whispered question of who be that with lady stock mortifying answer know however when lady stock have introduced to of acquaintance a great heiress scene changed found treated with much consideration though still fashionable belle took sufficient care to make sensible of inferiority longed to be upon equal footing with whilst mind be in state sir thomas stock one morning when be settling money

a in certain optical deception object appears close to eludes hand if attempt to grasp almeria felt want of specie of unreserved confidence friendship have formerly enjoyed with ellen in judging of what will make happy be apt to leave time out of account lead to most important error for short period may be amused gratified by what will fatigue disgust if long continued first winter that spent in

money have borrowed from heiress female politician made objection to proposal continually repeating that miss turnbull might do better that might look higher that with pretension there must be doubt that must have variety of advantageous offer that play must be to raise value by rejecting without hesitation pretender of first distinction lady pierrepoint who usually spoke with ambiguity of oracle

indeed nothing pleasure received from mr vickarss favourable prognostic upon subject must have in degree balanced pain daily endured from lady fretful temper almeria submitted to domineering humour continued to propitiate with petty sacrifice more from fear than love from fear that adverse influence might be fatal to present scheme of aggrandizement weak mind be subject to apprehension of control from secret cause utterly inadequate to supposed effect thus put destiny into hand of person who must not otherwise obtain influence over fate time at length arrived when heroine be to be confirmed in expectation wakened from state of self delusion marquis returned from abroad lady pierrepoint wrote note more mysteriously worded than usual signifying that wished to have conference with

miss turnbull may imagine have world of business on hand with utmost appearance of cordiality lady pierrepoint shook heroine receding hand without seeming to notice painful emotion visible in almerias countenance departed smiling perfectly composed moment that ladyship have left room heroine retired to own apartment hastily bolted door to prevent intrusion of mr vickars whose curiosity condolence whether real affected be not in humour to endure walked up down room in great agitation by turn angry with lady pierrepoint with marquis with lady gabriella with mr vickars with after anger have spent

that never saw so beautiful blue mr ingoldsbys taste be not infallible imagine said mr vickars with contemptuous smile may not be infallible replied heroine be at least a much to be relied upon a other people be sure pretend to compare taste to mr ingoldsbys may be permitted to have opinion of own hope in opinion be frightful blue shockingly unbecoming at event like green infinitely better than blue beseech miss turnbull not to wear hideous riband be sure dont pretend to set taste in competition with mr vickarss must confess can not think frightful blue shockingly unbecoming can agree with body in preferring green to blue for once will take liberty of following own fancy for once be sorry ever presumed to offer opinion upon other subject to miss turnbull will be more cautious in future candidly own did think might prefer green to blue without giving offence give offence assure mr vickars that must prefer green to blue be not so ridiculous people who can not bear to be contradicted be always apt to fancy that others have same strange sort of domineering temper people who can bear nothing flattery miss turnbull must have friend a mr ingoldsby who must swear that blue

exquisite dissimulation for of sex have be celebrated by judicious davila thrown off guard by last sarcastic insinuation mr vickars burst into angry defence of own sincerity with respect to affair of marquis lady gabriella almeria observed that defence be quite unnecessary a have not made accusation apology must be prompted only by mr vickarss own tenderness of conscience mr vickars replied with increasing acrimony said that conduct needed apology that must not stoop to make to soothe disappointed ambition of person reproach succeeded reproach sarcasm produced sarcasm till at last mr vickars declared that after what have passed be impossible must remain day in miss turnbulls house declaration be heard by almeria with undisguised satisfaction next day mr vickars accepted of invitation from marchioness heroine afterwards protested that be a much rejoiced to be freed from encumbrance of such companion a sinbad sailor be to get rid of old man of sea who fastened upon shoulder with such remorseless tenacity resolved to be more cautious in choice of next companion there be many candidate for honour of supplying place of mr vickars amongst be mr ingoldsby lady who be perfect mistress of whole art of flattery by mean of have so far ingratiated with miss turnbull that felt secure of preference over competitor almeria have indeed almost decided in favour when received note from mr wynne old lady with whom have formerly be acquainted in yorkshire who being just come to town be eager to renew intimacy with miss turnbull be woman of excellent heart absolutely incapable of suspecting that others must be le frank friendly than be sometimes led into mistake by undistinguishing benevolence for imagined that appeared wrong must prove right if properly understood that there must be good reason for thing seemed to be bad that instance of unkindness insolence be undesigned quarrel be only misunderstanding possessed by good natured kind of wrong headedness frequently did most provoking by way of doing most obliging thing imaginable upon principle must place contending party by surprise in very situation of others most wished to avoid then give signal for pitched battle by begging enemy must shake hand with one now have heard reported in yorkshire that there be coolness between elmours miss turnbull be morally certain there must be truth in report for variety of very best reason in world in first place argued mr wynne to certain knowledge miss turnbull be from infancy always greatest favourite at elmour grove pupil of good old gentleman intimate friend of daughter during odd hodgkinsons lifetime almeria be always with miss ellen elmour who treated quite like sister be sure remember a if be yesterday introducing miss turnbull to affectionate way in spoke of particularly recollect hearing almeria turnbull amongst other grateful thing say that must wish to live die with friend at elmour grove then have stronger reason afterwards for being attached to know be mr frederick elmour who gained large fortune for be in court house in york very day cause be decided never heard man speak with more energy eloquence than frederick elmour did in defence be plain indeed that eloquence came from heart a to law part of business know nephew who understands thing said be very nice question that if cause have not be managed a ably a be must not have gained fortune now of course be thing never must be forgotten own expected that there must have be match between miss turnbull mr elmour sir thomas stock guardian took away from mr elmour fell in love with lady time miss turnbull have never married though have be so much in great world from large fortune must have have so many offer heard said yesterday that have refused sir thomas stock eldest son lord bradstone others now be plain must not marry merely for money title nephew who be so amiable sensible be just man for have used to admire very much in former time when met at elmour grove mr wynne hinted wish to nephew seemed not much inclined towards miss turnbull because said though frederick sister never uttered syllable to disadvantage can not from circumstance help imagining that have not behaved well to besides after five six year spent in great world in dissipation in have lived disposition can not probably be same a be when knew in country mr wynne must not with good natured eye see force of of objection be determined to convince nephew of futility with view formed scheme be to be kept profound secret from party concerned till moment when must be ripe for execution heard that miss turnbull be in want of companion knew that mr henry elmour very amiable young widow distantly related to elmour family who have formerly be friend of almerias be at moment in great distress have doubt that miss turnbull must be delighted with opportunity of serving one connected with family to whom owed such obligation mr wynne fancied that must be finest occasion imaginable to prove to nephew that notwithstanding almeria have lately lived so much in fashionable world have same grateful heart a formerly eager to come to demonstration mr wynne wrote immediately to distressed widow begging to come to town with possible expedition for have found at least be morally sure of finding most charming situation heart can desire say more may not deprive of pleasure of surprise same day that sent letter to post despatched following note to almeria dear miss turnbull be too well persuaded of goodness of heart to fear that must think present interference impertinent used to be very good friend in yorkshire be sure will be just same in london therefore write without ceremony a friend must called upon twice found be unluckily not at home now have matter very near heart to speak to about perhaps will turn out a much to satisfaction a to mine can not express so well a must wish in writing be sure will not repent kindness if will do honour of dining with in family way on friday next in mean time let beg will not decide choice of companion can not be more explicit lest a have said once before to day must deprive of pleasure of surprise dear madam forgive freedom in one who most sincerely wish well a friday will prove nephew henry wynne whom may remember great admirer of yours desire best respect with good wish remain dear miss turnbulls affectionate humble servant m wynne letter at first surprised heroine afterwards afforded subject for much ridicule to mr ingoldsby to whom almeria showed laughed at odd freedom of yorkshire dame at old fashioned plainness of style parenthesis within parenthesis at last concluding with respect best wish remaining dear miss turnbulls humble servant opined however upon third perusal of letter mr wynne be anxious to present nephew to miss turnbull that be real meaning of curious note probably wished to surprise with sight of yorkshire damsel who have formed reasonable expectation that because miss turnbull have done honour to notice age ago in country be to be companion in town mr ingoldsby further observed that mr wynne though have not practised at court be bad politician in thus attempting to recommend companion to miss turnbull who must of course be entirely in nephew interest almerias vanity be indirectly flattered by insinuation tended to prove vast consequence in being thus object of plot counterplot more readily believed from experience have have of lady pierrepoints manoeuvre be really dreadful thing said to be great heiress one must be so circumspect so much upon one guard with

conversation there be mixture of excellent sense general literature with frivolity of fashionable world anecdote of day in certain high circle of seemed to talk more from habit than taste to annex importance more from compulsion of external circumstance than from choice son son be great object of thought serious frivolous be delighted by improvement saw in understanding character by taste talent displayed for fine literature for solid information flattered hope that must both shine a polished gentleman make figure in public life to friend russell attributed happy improvement though be not tutor of own original selection yet pride on occasion yielded to gratitude graciously declared that must not feel jealous of pre eminent power have obtained over son when saw admirable use made of influence vivian like candid generous person being peculiarly touched by candour generosity in others felt affection for mother rapidly increased by conduct did enthusiasm for friend in least abate in consequence of high approbation with honoured even in consequence of ladyship frequent rather injudicious expression of hope that son must always preserve show worthy of such friend joined in mother entreaty to russell to prolong visit a ladyship declared thought of essential consequence to son interest future happiness that must at turn of life have companion russell consented to remain with

anticipation of time when must make appearance in fashionable in political world foresaw respect must be paid to on account by senator by matron by minister who might want to gain rising orator vote by mother who might wish to make excellent match for daughter not only by mother who have daughter to marry by daughter who have heart hand to dispose of lady mary felt secure of having society courted now have rather extravagant expectation for son expected to marry so a to secure domestic happiness at same time to have fashion beauty rank high connexion amiable quality in wife vision of future daughter in law continually occupied ladyship imagination already with maternal alnascharism have in revery thrown back head with disdain a repulsed family advance of wealthy low born heiress a rejected alliance of of new nobility already have arranged very word of answer to determined degree shade of intimacy with already have settled to whom to nod whom take into coach whom honour with hand when one morning a sat at work absorbed in one of revery be so far rapt into future time that without perceiving that body be present began to speak thought said aloud to herself a if son must possibly think of son who be opposite to lying on sofa reading seeming to read started up putting down book exclaimed in voice showed at once that be conscious of thinking of particular person determined to persist in thought a if son must possibly think of her of whom maam whats matter child be mad not in least maam said what cried lady mary looking round what did say have occasioned so much disturbance be not conscious of saying thing dear selina continued ladyship appealing to young lady who sat very intent upon drawing beside dear selina must have heard what did say young lady looked embarrassed colour spread over face brought sudden suspicion into lady mary mind eye darted back upon son suspicion fear be confirmed grew instantly pale silent breathless in attitude in be struck with panic young lady blush embarrassment have very different effect on vivian joy suddenly sparkled in eye illumined whole countenance for be first instant have ever felt hope of having obtained interest in heart be too much transported at moment to think of prudence of mother when recollected be too little practised in dissimulation to repair indiscretion something did attempt to say blundered laughed at blunder when mother looked up at in serious silence only begged pardon for folly confessed believed be mad turning away abruptly left room exclaiming that wondered where russell have be morning that must go look for long silence ensued between vivians mother young lady who be left alone together lady mary first broke silence in constrained tone asked a took up newspaper whether miss sidney have found news dont know maam answered miss sidney in voice scarcely articulate must have imagined there must be news from continent did not find think say miss sidney continued lady mary with haughty averted eye after turning over page of paper without knowing one word contained laid down rose to leave room miss sidney rose at same time lady mary one instant dear lady mary lady mary turned saw selinas supplicating eye full of tear ladyship still retaining severity of manner coldly said doe miss sidney desire must stay doe miss sidney wish to speak to do a soon a can said selina in faltering voice raising eye perceiving contemptuous expression of lady mary countenance own instantly changed with firm tone of conscious innocence repeated do wish to speak to ladyship if will hear with usual candour expect solicit usual indulgence miss sidney replied lady mary before say more becomes to point out to that moment be past for confidence between two that in moment must wish to hear from person much le from one whom have considered a friend confession extorted by circumstance degrading unavailing ladyship need not be apprehensive of hearing from degrading confession said miss sidney have none to make since without just cause without cause for suspicion what blush perhaps moment embarrassment of manner may have created think becomes to point out to that moment for confidence between be past can only lament mistake in having believed that ever existed lady mary countenance manner totally changed pride of rank yielded before pride of virtue perhaps hope that have really no cause for suspicion at once restored affection for young friend let understand one dear selina said if said hasty harsh word forgive know affection for real confidence in action not in word have shown in thought a well a in action confidence in have be entire for upon word know be not asseveration lightly use upon word till unfortunate moment suspicion of never crossed imagination proof if there must need proof to of what assert proof be delight take in society urgent manner in have so frequently summer begged company from mother know must have not only be height of insincerity of folly madness if have not felt reliance upon that made consider a absolute impossibility that must ever disappoint friendship thank ladyship said selina softened by kind tone in lady mary now spoke yet still retaining reserve of manner thank ladyship for kindness have flattered much touched deeply commanded gratitude influenced conduct uniformly can do entirely forgive injustice of moment now bid adieu dear lady mary with conviction that if be never to meet again must always hold place in esteem affection with have honoured if be not too proud expression hope have deserved wont bid farewell tear gushed from lady mary eye dear charming prudent selina understand perfectly thank grief to part with believe be right believe there be other safety other remedy how indeed must expect that son must see hear live in house with become intimately acquainted with character a yours without danger have be very imprudent unaccountably imprudent to expose to temptation hope trust that prudence will repair in time effect of rashness again again thank dear young friend perhaps might be still better that must not leave abruptly still better than absence think must be conviction might impress on mind of impossibility of hope if be to stay day two convince by indifference that excuse be what can not undertake said selina blushing conscious of blushing lady mary be too polite too delicate to seem to observe confusion embracing said if must part then take with highest esteem affection gratitude much let add that most sanguine expectation for son happiness must be realized if amongst woman to whom family interest must restrict choice must meet with one of merit half attraction amongst woman to whom family interest must restrict choice repeated selina to herself many time a journeyed homewards pondered much upon meaning of phrase vivian be sole heir to very large property without encumbrance of kind what therefore be necessity restricted choice imaginary necessity of ambition confined to certain circle of fashionable highly connected people selina sidney though be not rich be of very good gentleman family father have be colonel in british army during life mr sidney have be in habit of living great deal in what be called world in best company though since death have lived in retirement miss sidney have received education put upon footing with young lady of highest accomplishment refinement in kingdom with solid amiable quality have external advantage of appearance manner lady mary vivian valued most highly selina who be convinced that lady mary appreciated character be peculiarly fond of company conversation must not feel surprise mixed with indignation perhaps with little resentment when perceived that ladyship prejudice ambition made act so completely in contradiction to better judgment to profession to feeling of affection miss sidney thought upon subject however determined to continue to avoid seeing vivian more excellent resolution in leave return to lover walk with russell have brought back in full determination of avowing attachment sincerely to mother of speaking to ladyship in most respectful manner when found that miss sidney be gone anger disappointment made at once forget prudence intended respect declared in most passionate term love for selina sidney irrevocable determination to pursue to end of time space in spite of opposition whatsoever from person mother who be prepared for scene of sort though not for one of violence have sufficient command of temper to sustain properly command of temper be indeed little assisted by hope that passion must be transitory in proportion to vehemence much by confidence have in miss sidney in absence lady mary therefore calmly disclaimed having have part in persuading miss sidney to measure have so much enraged lover ladyship avowed that though have not be necessary for to suggest measure highly approved of admired now a have ever admired that young lady prudent noble conduct softened by only thing must at moment soften praise of mistress vivian in most affectionate manner assured mother that be warm eulogium of miss sidney have first turned attention to perfection of character now inquired what possible objection must make to choice with generous enthusiasm of disposition heightened by eloquence of love pleaded that fortune be surely sufficient to put above mercenary consideration in choice of wife that in point except one of money selina sidney be in own mother opinion superior to other woman must name wish for a daughter in law taste be not to blind to interest said lady mary be entitled to look for rank high connexion be representative of ancient family have talent to make figure in public in short prejudice not confess be one of first wish of heart that must marry into noble family at least into one will strengthen political interest a well a secure domestic happiness vivian of course cursed ambition a men do whilst be in love argument eloquence in favour of private station of joy of learned leisure competence domestic bliss be worthy of most renowned of ancient modern philosopher russell be appealed to with much eagerness by mother son during debate frankly declared to lady mary that thought son perfectly right in now urged especially in opinion of miss sidney at same time added russell apprehend that speaks at moment more from passion than from reason fear that in course of few month might perhaps entirely change mind therefore think ladyship be prudent in refusing during minority of son consent to hasty union of might afterwards repent thus render most amiable woman miserable russell after having given opinion with utmost freedom when be required by lady mary assured that must no farther interfere trusted present sincerity must be best pledge to of future discretion honour equitable judgment sincerity of russell at first displeased party in time operated upon reason of not however before contest have gone on long loud between mother son not before great deal of nonsense have be talked on side people of best ability often talk most nonsense where passion be concerned because then whole of ingenuity be exercised to find argument in favour of folly be not like fool content to say be will pique on giving reason for will reason be reason of madman excellent upon false premise happened here a in most family quarrel that disputant did not allow sufficiently for prejudice error incident to different age mother must not allow for romantic notion of son must son endure worldly view of mother son who have a yet experience of transitory nature of passion of love thought mother unfeeling barbarous for opposing on point where whole happiness of life be concerned mother who have seen decline fall of so many everlasting love considered only a person in fever thought prevented by calmness from doing must repent when must regain sober sens without detailing daily dispute now arose will be sufficient to mark result vivians love have be silent tranquil not seemingly of great consequence till be opposed from instant that obstacle intervened gathered strength force presently rose rapidly with prodigious uproar threatening to burst bound to destroy thing stopped course lady mary be now inclined to try what effect lessening opposition might produce to do justice be also moved to by nobler motif than fear at least fear be not of selfish kind dreaded that son health permanent happiness might be injured by violent passion be apprehensive of becoming object of aversion of utterly losing confidence power over mind chiefly generous temper be moved won by selina sidney admirable conduct during whole time vivian used mean to see to write to to convince of fervour of love though won friend over to interest though heard praise from morning till night from who surrounded though own heart perhaps pleaded more powerfully than rest in favour yet never for one instant gave slightest encouragement lady mary esteem affection be so much increased by strong proof of friendship honour that prejudice yielded at length declared that if son continued till be of age to feel same attachment for amiable girl must give consent to union added promised only on one condition that son must abstain from attempt in interval to see correspond with miss sidney that must set out immediately to travel with mr russell transported with love joy victory vivian promised thing be required of embraced mother set out upon travel allow said triumphantly to russell a chaise drove from door allow good friend that be mistaken in fear of weakness of character of yielding facility of temper see how firm have be see what battle have made see how have stood out never doubted said russell love of own free will never doubted fear of being governed especially by mother expect must allow to be proof of strength of character what do suppose act from love of own free will merely do call love for selina sidney weakness oh take care russell for if once find pleading mother cause against conscience will never find pleading cause against conscience have told mother a have told opinion of miss sidney firm opinion that be peculiarly calculated to make happiness of life provided continue to love provided oh cried vivian laughing spare musty proviso dear philosopher must not one think now be old man of ninety if be have to fear be happy indeed at present said russell calmly have fear a have just told mother that must change mind before be of age vivian grew quite indignant at suggestion be angry with said russell so be mother be angry because said feared instead of hoped must change mind party be angry with for sincerity sincerity be angry with for absurd suspicion of constancy if be absurd need not be angry said russell will be well pleased to see absurdity demonstrated then can demonstrate moment pardon not moment must take time into account make doubt at moment be heartily in love with miss sidney thing to be proved be that passion will not decline in force in proportion a meet with le resistance if doe will acknowledge that be more love of own free will than love of mistress have actuated be thing to be proved hateful qed cried vivian will see contrary at least will triumph over if russell have ever used art in management of vivians mind might have be suspected of using in favour of miss sidney at instant for prophecy of vivians inconstancy be most likely mean to prevent accomplishment frequently in course of tour when vivian be in situation where constancy be tempted recollected russell prediction be proud to remind how much have be mistaken in short destined time for return home arrived vivian presented before mother claimed promise be somewhat surprised little disappointed by hero constancy must not retract word since compliance be now unavoidable be determined that must be gracious wrote to selina therefore with great kindness saying that view of other connexion might formerly have have for son have now relinquished convinced by constancy of son attachment by merit of object that own choice must most effectually ensure happiness that of friend ladyship added expression of regard esteem of pleasure felt in thought of finding in daughter in law friend companion whose society be peculiarly agreeable to taste suited to

cardinal virtue cardinal virtue very good faith lord said lawyer looking at clergyman temperance repeated chaplain winking at officer upon soul lord thats too bad prudence repeated captain thats too clean cut at poor wicksted lord before lordship have time to preach more prudence arrived within bowing distance of lady who have indeed advanced at very slow rate vivian be not acquainted with of lady of glistonbury family for have till summer resided at of country seat in distant county mother have often met at party in town lady glistonbury be thin stiffened flattened figure be accompanied by two other female form one old other young not different grace alike three in angularity in cold haughtiness of mien after reconnoitring with glass party of gentleman lady quickened step lady glistonbury making countenance a affable a be in nature to be exclaimed dear lady mary vivian have pleasure to see ladyship told be only visitor to lord mr vivian have then honour of being introduced to ladyship to eldest daughter lady sarah lidhurst to miss strictland governess by of lady be most graciously received poor russell be not so fortunate nothing must be more cold repulsive than reception of did not make lady sarah appear very agreeable to vivian thought at first view one of least attractive young woman have ever beheld where be julia inquired lord glistonbury ah there go yonder life spirit vivian looked a lordship directed eye saw at farthest end of terrace young girl of about fifteen running very fast with hoop be keeping up with great dexterity for amusement of little boy who be with governess sooner saw than went in pursuit of young ladyship calling after in various tone phrase of reprehension in french italian english asking whether be becoming employment for young lady of age rank heedless of reproach lady julia still ran on away from governess to chase rolling circle speed down slope of terrace thither miss strictland dared not pursue contented with standing on brink reiterating remonstrance at length hoop fell young lady returned not to governess running lightly up slope of terrace to surprise came full in view of company before be aware that stranger be there straw hat being at back of head lady glistonbury with indignant look pulled forward what beautiful colour what sweet countenance lady julia have whispered lady mary vivian to lord glistonbury at same time must not refrain from glancing eye towards son to see what effect be produced upon vivians eye met hers single look of mother revealed to that have in great prudence resolved to conceal smiled at then at russell a much a to say surely there can be comparison between child a selina sidney few minute afterwards in consequence of sign from lady glistonbury julia disappeared with governess moment be unnoticed by vivian who be then a mother observed looking up at one of turret of old castle inhabitant be at time uninteresting to except so far a regarded friend russell castle absorbed attention lord glistonbury charmed to see how be struck by offered to show over part of edifice offer lady mary gladly accepted lady glistonbury excused professing to be unable to sustain fatigue deputed eldest daughter to attend lady mary in stead be only circumstance diminished pleasure to vivian for be obliged to show due courtesy to stiff taciturn damsel at turn whilst be intent upon seeing architecture of castle view from window of tower loop hole of gallery lady sarah pointed out with cold ceremonious civility formal exactness of proceeding enraged vivians enthusiastic temper visit ended railed time be going home against fair a called petrified guide then full of gothic beauty of glistonbury determined a soon a possible to turn own modern house into castle very next morning have architect to view to examine capability happened that about time several of nobleman gentry in county in vivian resided have be seized with rage for turning comfortable house into uninhabitable castle however perverse impracticable retrograde movement in architecture might seem there be always at hand professional projector to convince gentleman that nothing be so feasible provided always that gentleman approve estimate a well a plan undertake to carry building back in trice two three dozen century a may be required to make gothic saracenic to add grace that time alone can give few day after vivian have be at glistonbury castle when lord glistonbury came to return visit russell who accompanied lordship found friend encompassed with plan elevation surely dear vivian said seizing first moment must speak to be not going to spoil excellent house be completely finished in handsome modern architecture perfectly comfortable convenient light airy large enough warm room well distributed with ample mean of getting at apartment if set about to new model transform into castle must see by plan alter proportion of almost room spoil comfort of whole turn square to round round again to square worse than turn light to darkness only for sake of having what be called castle what have not in fact thing of grandeur solid magnificence of real ancient edifice modern baby house miniature of castle gentleman ruin to build be after most paltry absurd thing imaginable to vivian be after dispute forced to agree said that must not be baby house that must go to expense to make really magnificent a magnificent suppose a glistonbury castle if possible be confess object of emulation ah said russell shaking head be object of emulation for country gentleman often ruin barter independence real respectability reduce to distress disgrace be object for sell estate country become placeman beggar end either in liberty of king bench slavery of st james impossible for know public principle said vivian know that think life of independent country gentleman most respectable of others know principle know facility said russell if begin by sacrificing thus to taste do think will not end by sacrificing to interest never never cried vivian then imagine that strong temptation will not act where weak one have be found irresistible of be certain said vivian must never be brought to sell country to forfeit honour perhaps not said russell might in utmost need have alternative might forfeit love might give up selina sidney marry for money for sake of castle struck by speech vivian exclaimed must give up thousand castle rather than run such hazard let then coolly calculate said russell what must castle cost expense even by estimate of architect in execution be usually doubled be enormous such a vivian acknowledged be unsuited even to ample fortune fortune though considerable be so entailed that must if exceeded income be soon reduced to difficulty for ready money then mother have several thousand in stock be ready to lend to forward castle building be project pleased taste gratified aristocratic notion vivian assured friend at parting that reason be convinced that must not yield to whim of taste that must prudently give up folly so determined abided by determination till heard number speak on other side of question with vivian who spoke last frequently seemed to speak best in general number of voice overpowered weight of argument by persuasion of mother example of neighbour urgency of architect men of taste who got about soon afterwards be convinced that there be living without castle that expense must be next to nothing at convinced must not say for yielded against conviction from mere want of power to resist reiterated solicitation have other motive for enthusiasm raised by view of glistonbury castle have passed away plainly saw what russell have pointed out to that must spoil inside of house for sake of outside for own part preferred comfort to show be not therefore to please own taste that ran into imprudent expense merely to gratify taste of others now bustle of building began workman swarmed round house foundation sank scaffold rose many time did vivian sigh repent when saw how much be to be undone before thing must be done when found house dismantled saw good ceiling elegant cornice knocked to piece saw light dome modern sash give way taken out to be replaced at profuse expense by clumsy imitation of gothic how often did be sigh calculate when saw tribe of workman file off a dinner bell rang how often did bless when beheld huge beam of timber dragged into yard solid mass of stone brought from quarry at enormous distance vivian perceived that expense must be treble estimate said that if thing be to be done again must never consent to now a lady mary observed be too late to repent be at rate best to go on finish with spirit since be impossible nobody knew why to stop hurried on workman with impatience for be anxious to have roof apartment in castle finished before marriage dilatoriness of lawyer want of trustee who have not yet arrived in england be no longer complained of so grievously by lover russell one day a saw vivian overlooking workman urging to expedition smiled asked whether impatience of architect of lover be now predominant in mind vivian rather offended by question replied that eagerness to finish part of castle arose from desire to give agreeable surprise to bride declared that passion for selina be a ardent at moment a have ever be that be impossible to make lawyer move faster than accustomed pace that miss sidney be too secure of affection too well convinced of hers to feel that sort of anxiety person who have le confidence in other might experience in similar circumstance be very true very reasonable russell must not help perceiving that vivians language tone be somewhat altered since time when be ready to brave heaven earth to marry mistress without license consent of friend without possibility of waiting few month till be of age in fact though vivian must not allow consent of friend ceasing of opposition security tranquillity of happiness have considerably changed appearance at least of love lady mary perceived with resolution to say nothing see how must end selina did not perceive for time for be of most unsuspicious temper confidence in vivian be equal to fondness of love began to think indeed that lawyer be provokingly slow when vivian did not blame a much a used to do only thought that understood business better than did besides necessary trustee be not come in short last thing occurred to mind be to blame vivian trustee at length arrived castle be almost in wished for state of forwardness when new cause of delay arose county election how election be brought on how be conducted be necessary to record happened that relation of vivians be appointed to new seventy four gun ship of came to take command at yarmouth be within few mile of vivian recollected that russell have often expressed desire to go on board man of war vivian therefore after having appointed day for going went to glistonbury to invite russell pupil lord lidhurst begged to be permitted to accompany lady julia moment heard of new seventy four gun ship be a governess expressed wild to be of party indeed thing have name of party of pleasure promised transient relief from tedious monotony in day passed thing gave chance of even few hour release from bondage in be held between restraint of most rigid of governess proudest of mother appeared delightful to lively childish girl persecuted governess with entreaty till at last made miss strictland go with petition to lady glistonbury whilst in mean time lady julia overwhelmed father with caress till consented with much difficulty prevailed upon lady glistonbury to give permission for young lady to go with governess brother father lady mary vivian on excursion invitation be now extended to company then at castle including representative of county who being just threatened with fit of gout brought on by hard drinking at last election expressed reluctance to going with party on water gentleman be now paying humble devoir to lady sarah lidhurst be represented to by who understood ground that must give mortal offence if did not go so be ruled that hot cold gout gout must appear in lady sarah train submitted to perilous necessity in most gallant manner day proved tolerably fine vivian have elegant entertainment provided for company under marquee pitched on shore embarked in pleasure boat lady sarah be very sick admirer very cold lady julia be in extasies at thing saw felt feared nothing found nothing inconvenient be charmed to be drawn so easily from boat up high side of ship charmed to find on deck charmed to see sail rope rigging wave sea sun cloud sailor cook dressing dinner indiscriminately charmed like school girl broke loose ran about wild with spirit asking question sensible silly laughing at own folly flying from side to from one end of ship to other down ladder up again whilst mr russell who be deputed to take care of must scarcely keep up with lord glistonbury stood by holding side laughing aloud miss strictland quite disabled by smell of ship be lying on bed in state cabin lady sarah time shaded by umbrella held by shivering admirer sat a if chained upright in chair of state upon deck scorning sister childish levity proving with due propriety incapable of being moved to surprise admiration by object on land sea lady mary vivian while observed with quick eye passed read son thought be fully persuaded that of lady lidhursts must be likely to suit taste even if affection be disengaged one be too childish other too stiff yet birth connexion consequence in county thought lady mary must have made alliance highly desirable body seemed weary at close of day entertainment except lady julia who kept up with indefatigable gaiety must hardly believe that be time to go home when boat be announced to row to shore heedless absolutely dizzy with talking laughing ladyship escaping from assistance of sailor gentleman made false step in getting into boat falling over must have sunk for ever for mr russell presence of mind seized with strong grasp saved fright sobered completely sat wrapped in great coat a silent a tractable a wet a possible during remainder of way to shore scream ejaculation reprimand from miss strictland question reflection to incident led may possibly be conceived can not be enumerated event however alarming at moment have serious consequence for lady julia caught neither fever cold though miss strictland be morally certain ladyship must have one other indeed insinuated that ladyship deserved to have lady sarah poor shivering knight of shire however did not escape so well obliged to row home in damp evening without great coat have be forced to offer to lady julia in pleasure boat when must have be in flannel in bed have cause to rue boating of day usual panacea of gout did not come a expected to set up again cold caught day killed lady sarah lidhurst be precisely a sorry a decorum required bustle of new election be soon to obliterate memory of old member in mind of numerous friend lord glistonbury several other voice in county called upon vivian to stand on independent interest there be to be contest for government candidate declared at same moment that application be made to vivian expense of contested election alarmed vivian mother gratified a be by honour of offer yet have prudence to advise son rather to go into parliament a representative for borough than to hazard expense of contest for county miss sidney also whom consulted upon occasion supported mother prudent advice in most earnest manner vivian be inclined to follow counsel till lord glistonbury came one morning to plead contrary side of question assured vivian that from experience of county be morally certain must carry without trouble with expense worth mentioning be only general phrase to be sure not argument joined to ambition to see son member for county at length overpowered lady mary better judgment urgent entreaty be now joined to of lord glistonbury of many loud tongued electioneerers who proved to vivian by thing calculation that must be returned if must stand if must only declare russell own prudence strongly counselled to resist clamorous importunity two preceding candidate whose fortune have be nearly a good a have be ruined by contest vivian be very young just of age russell observed that must be better for to see something more of world before must embark in politics plunge into public business true said vivian mr pitt be only three twenty when be minister of england be not ambitious must certainly like to distinguish if must whilst feel in youth glow of patriotism why must not serve country serve welcome said russell dont begin by ruining by contested election else glow of patriotism may feel will be out of power to be honest member of parliament if must go into parliament immediately for good of country go in a member for borough will not ruin committee of friend will be so disappointed if decline mother who have now set heart upon lord glistonbury mr c mr g mr d who be such zealous friend who urge so much judge for yourself said russell dont let person who happen to be near persuade to see with eye decide with wish zealous friend indeed because love to make of consequence by bawling scampering about at election must let such people draw on to ruin will show that will not cried vivian seizing sheet of paper sitting down immediately to write copy of circular letter to friend informing with many thanks that declined to stand for county russell eagerly wrote copy of letter vivian declared must be sent early next morning sooner be russell out of sight than lady mary vivian resumed argument in favour of commencing canvas immediately before friend must cool when saw letter that have be writing be excessively indignant by torrent of female maternal eloquence be absolutely overwhelmed auxiliary poured in to ladyship on side horseman after horseman freeholder of degree now flocked to house hearing that mr vivian have thought of standing for county be unanimously loud in assurance of success old new copy of poll book be produced different interest of county counted recounted balanced counterbalanced again again by person after own fashion be proved to mr vivian in black white a plain a figure must make that have game in own hand that if must declare other candidate must very next day must be bound for decline contest vivian have clear head competent knowledge of arithmetic saw fallacy inaccuracy in mode of computation saw upon examining book that state of county interest be very different from what pretended believed be convinced that opposite candidate must not decline after vivian have stated reason ten time mother electioneering partisan have reiterated assertion twenty time yielded merely because have said twice a much a have because poor easy man have not power to resist continuity of solicitation declared candidate for county be soon immersed in toil trouble vexation expense of contested election of course marriage be now to be postponed till election must be over love county politics have little affinity what evil of contested election be can be fully known only to by whom have be personally experienced contest be bitter glistonbury interest be strongest supported vivian lord glistonbury lordship friend be warm in cause not that have particular regard for vivian be to be member opposed to court candidate whom lordship be anxious to keep out of county lord glistonbury have once be strong friend to government be thought confirmed courtier especially a have be brought up in high aristocratic notion have made great object to turn earldom into marquisate government having delayed refused to gratify in point quitted with disgust set up standard amongst opposition be now loud zealous on occasion must a said annoy government merely because must not be marquis became patriot mistaken abused name how glorious in original how despicable in debased signification lord glistonburys exertion be indefatigable vivian felt much gratitude for apparently disinterested friendship during few week whilst canvas be going on formed degree of intimacy with glistonbury family in other circumstance must scarcely have be brought about during month year election in england seems for time to level distinction not only of rank even of pride lady glistonbury at season found necessary to relax from usual rigidity there be extraordinary freedom of egress regress haughty code of glistonbury lay dormant vivian of course be centre of interest whenever appeared individual of family be eager to inquire what news what news how do thing go on to day how will election turn out have written to mr one have be to mr one ill write note for ill copy letter there be one common cause miss strictland even deigned to assist mr vivian to try awkward hand to forward canvas for be to support glistonbury interest there be impropriety must attach to thing russell extreme anxiety made vivian call more frequently even than be necessary at castle to quiet apprehension to assure that thing be going on well young lord lidhurst who be really good natured over whose mind russell began to gain ascendancy used to stand upon watch for vivians appearance must run up back stair to russell apartment to give notice of to be first to tell news lady sarah icy lady sarah began to thaw day in same phrase condescended to say to mr vivian that hoped poll be going on a well a must be expected be of course reported that vivian be to succeed late representative of county in honour in eight day be confidently given to lady sarah by generous public day of nuptials be positively fixed a lady be even by account of friend two three year older than mr vivian four five year older by look a be peculiarly unsuited to taste heard report without slightest apprehension for own constancy to selina laughed at idea a excellent joke when be first mentioned to by russell lord glistonburys manner however cordial familiarity with treated vivian gave day increasing credit to report if be son lord must not be more anxious about mr vivian said one of plain spoken freeholder in presence of lady lidhursts lady sarah pursed up mouth threw back head lady julia archly looking at sister smiled vivacity of lady julias manner did not appear excessive during election time when world seemed mad on contrary there be in utmost freedom raillery that air of good breeding politeness in vulgar mirth liberty be always deficient vivian began to think that be become le childish that there be something of mixture of womanish timidity in appearance rendered infinitely more attractive one evening in particular when father having sent for morning work returned with basket full of vivian cockade have made with own delicate hand vivian thought looked very pretty father desired to give to person for whom be intended presented to mr russell saying be for friend sir vivian thought looked very graceful lady mary vivian suppressed sigh thought kept whole of mind to herself happy day of canvassing freedom of election must not last for ever after polling county to last freeholder contest be at length decided vivian be declared duly elected be chaired scattered money with lavish hand a passed over head of huzzaing populace have honour of election horse be taken from carriage be drawn by men who be soon afterwards so much intoxicated that retained vestige of rationality not only inferior superior rank of elector a usual upon such occasion thought proper to do honour to choice to power of judgment by drinking member health at expense of own till must neither see hear understand hero be not by mean fond of drinking must not refuse to do a others did lord glistonbury swore now have found out that vivian must be such pleasant companion over bottle must never listen to excuse in future few day after election parliament met for dispatch of business a important question be to come on member be summoned by peremptory call of house vivian be obliged to go to town immediately compelled to defer marriage regretted being thus hurried away from selina with thousand tender passionate expression assured that moment attendance on public business must be spared must hasten to country to claim promised happiness castle must be finished by time session be over lawyer must also have completed settlement vivian said must make other necessary preparation whilst be in town therefore urged selina now to fix time for marriage to let be first week of recess of parliament miss sidney who have great delicacy of feeling dignity of character thought that vivian have of late shown symptom of decreased affection that have betrayed sign of unsteadiness of character in whole affair of castle building of election have evidently be led by others instead of following own conviction wisely dreaded that might in more important action yield judgment to others then what security must have for principle might perhaps be led into sort of fashionable dissipation vice besides fear considered that vivian be possessor of large fortune that mother have with difficulty consented to match that be very young have seen little of world might perhaps in future repent of having made thus early in life love match therefore absolutely refused to let now bind to by fresh promise desired that must consider a perfectly at liberty released from engagement to be evident however from manner in spoke that wished to restore lover liberty for sake only that own feeling however might be suppressed be unchanged vivian be touched charmed by delicacy generosity in fervour of feeling swore that affection must never change believed what swore lady mary vivian be struck also with miss sidney conduct at parting acknowledged that be impossible to show at once more tenderness dignity one however not even vivian knew how much pain separation gave good sense prudence told indeed that be best for happiness vivians that must see something more of world that must have farther proof of steadiness of attachment before must unite with irrevocably whilst endeavoured to fortify mind with reflection love inspired many painful fear though never repented having set free from promise engagement trembled for consequence of being thus at liberty in such scene of temptation a london life must present chapter iii when hero arrived in london when be first introduced into fashionable society thought be so intent upon selina sidney that be in danger of plunging into dissipation be surprised at eagerness with young men pursued frivolous pleasure be still more astonished at seeing apathy in others of own age be sunk listless insignificance in lounged away life call of house brought vivian to town brought lord glistonbury also to attend duty in house of peer with lordship family came mr russell whom vivian went to see a soon a often a must russell heard with satisfaction indignant eloquence with friend spoke only wished that sentiment might last fashion might never lead to imitate to tolerate fool whom now despised in mean time tell how go on said vivian how do like situation here pupil glistonbury family let behind scene at once for know see only on stage russell replied in general term that have hope lord lidhurst must turn out well that therefore be satisfied with situation avoided entering into particular because be confidential person in family thought that preceptor physician be in respect bound by similar specie of honour to speak cautiously of malady of patient fault of pupil admitted into secret of family must never make use of confidence reposed in to disadvantage of by whom be trusted russell strictly honourable reserve upon occasion be rather provoking to vivian who to question must obtain only dry answer of judge for nature of town life sort of intercourse capital city afford put very little in vivians power obligation be under to lord glistonbury for assistance at election made anxious to show lordship respect attention sort of intimacy election have brought on be to certain degree kept up in town lady mary vivian be constantly one at lady glistonburys card party vivian be frequently at lordship dinner considering coldness formality of lady glistonburys manner be particularly attentive to lady mary vivian hero be continually attendant upon lady of glistonbury family to public place be by mean disagreeable to a be person of high consideration be sure of drawing into circle very best company lady mary vivian observed that be great advantage to son to have house a lord glistonburys open to to go to whenever pleased besides advantage to moral ladyship be by mean insensible to gratification pride received from son living in such high company report have be raised in country during election that mr vivian be going to be married to lady sarah lidhurst now began to circulate in town be not surprising since young man in london of fortune notoriety can hardly dance three four time successively with same young lady can not even sit beside converse with in public dozen time without being reported that be going to be married to of vivian during noviciate in town be not perhaps sufficiently aware be soon surprised at being asked by almost one met when marriage with lady sarah lidhurst be to take place at first contented with laughing at question declaring that there be truth in report asseveration be not to be believed be attributed to motif of discretion be told by companion that kept own counsel very well knew thing be to be be congratulated upon good fortune in making such excellent match for though a said must have little money with lady sarah yet connexion be so great that be luckiest fellow upon earth degree of importance report gave among young men of acquaintance envy excited amused gratified vanity sort of conversation be now in constant habit of hearing from young old in company about marriage of people in fashionable world where fortune rank connexion be always first thing spoken of considered began insensibly to influence vivians mode of speaking if not of judging before mixed in society knew perfectly well that be principle by people of world be guided whilst have believed only on hearsay have not appeared to so entirely true so important a when saw heard effect of opinion of set of fine people now be actually in society whilst other society be excluded from perception be very different from what have imagined might be when be in country at college to do hero justice however be sensible of aberration in own mind have sense enough to perceive from what cause arose steadiness sufficient to adhere to judgement have previously deliberately formed did not in material point change opinion of mistress thought far far superior to saw heard amongst belle who be most admired in fashionable world at same time began to agree with mother former wish selina added to other merit have advantage of high birth connexion at least of belonging to certain class of high company determined that a soon a must be wife must have introduced to very first society in town pleased imagination with anticipating change must be made in appearance by addition of certain elegancies of mode delighted in thinking of sensation must produce respect must be paid to a mr vivian surrounded a must take care that must be with external sign of wealth fashion command immediate universal homage from great little world one day when vivian be absorbed in pleasing revery russell startled with question when be to be married to lady sarah lidhurst from question said vivian why not from be question body asks of because be intimate friend must really be obliged to if must furnish with answer may give air of little more consequence than have at present being forced to answer dont know dont know why answer never a do said vivian to fool who ask same question because say be answer only come off cant help be fault if wont believe truth why people be apt to trust to appearance in case if appearance be contrary to assertion must not wonder that be not believed well time will show mistake said vivian dont know what appearance mean what appearance be against never in life saw woman be le disposed to like whom must be more impossible for to love than lady sarah lidhurst be sure never gave of family least reason to imagine have thought of very likely yet be at lord glistonburys continually attend ladyship to public place be way do think to put stop to report have be raised care not whether stop go on said vivian how dont know be false thats enough for may embarrass yet said russell good heaven can who know so well russell fancy so weak a to be embarrassed by such report look must rather put hand into fire let be burned off than offer to lady sarah lidhurst very likely dont doubt think so said russell must do so said vivian possibly yet might be embarrassed nevertheless if found that have raised expectation must not fulfil if found accused of having jilted lady if friend be to say have used very ill know nature vivian thing must disquiet very much be not better to prevent lady sarah friend blame see sign in family of of thought feeling suppose lady especially young fashionable lady

in virtue to love wherever must be found genuine by success of first petty attack learned power that ridicule have over hero mind did not fail to make use of continually after having a perceived succeeded in making vivian ashamed of sonnet to selina of appearing a romantic lover doubted not in time must make true love ridiculous wharton thought be now moment to hazard stroke to commence

russell play in house where have got than think do can form shrewd guess why be so zealous in warning of report about lady sarah lidhurst have own snug reason for wanting away trust for scenting out self interest through doubling winding of cunning moralist reddening with indignation at attack upon friend vivian warmly replied that mr wharton ought to restrain wit where feeling of friendship character of man of honour be concerned that did not in least comprehend insinuation with regard to russell that for own part have such firm reliance upon friend attachment integrity that be at time ready to pledge own honour for russell to answer for with life spare heroic dear vivian cried wharton laughing for be not in day of pylades orestes yet upon soul instead of being a angry with a be

counteracts envy dear boy a to rest know russell merit better than do ill take henceforward upon trust from thus wharton finding that be upon dangerous ground made timely retreat playful manner open countenance with now spoke quick transition that made to other subject of conversation prevented vivian from suspecting that settled design have be formed to detach from russell from time forward wharton forbore raillery on love friendship far from seeming desirous of interfering in vivians private concern appeared quite absorbed in politics avowing a did that be guided solely by interest in public life laughed at vivian for professing more generous principle know cried wharton how to make use of fine word to round fine sentence a well a best of what simpleton must be who be cheated by

counterfeit coin cant be taken in by at time of day vivian must not forbear to smile at drollery wit with profligate defended want of integrity yet sometimes seriously warmly asserted own principle upon occasion wharton either overpowered by fine flow of word else listened with most flattering air of admiration silenced by compliment to eloquence vivian thought that be quite secure of own firmness contagion of bad example sometimes affect mind imperceptibly a certain noxious atmosphere steal upon sens excite most agreeable sensation while secretly destroy principle of health life day be fixed when question of importance be to come on in house of common wharton be extremely anxious to have vivians vote vivian according to parliamentary phrase have not made up mind on subject heap of pamphlet on question lay uncut upon table morning resolved to read that might form judgment vote according to unbiassed opinion morning be interrupted by of fashionable idler whom facility of temper have indulged in habit of haunting daily oh vivian be going to such such place must come with be mode of persuasion must not resist if dont do a do thought will be quite unfashionable russell may say what plea be necessary to yield to one companion in trifle must be pleased please must do what others do with ease couplet have be repeated to by wharton recurred to continually thus wharton by slight mean in seemed to have interest design prepared vivian for purpose by working gradually on easiness of disposition always argued that must not possibly signify what did with hour two of day till at last vivian found that have hour of own that whole time be at disposal of others now that really wanted leisure to consider important question when credit a member of senate a man just entering political life depended on decision literally must not command time to read over necessary document so appointed day arrived before vivians opinion be formed from mere want of time to decide for voted a wharton desired political question came on same cause operated same consequence ensued wharton managed with great address so a to prevent from feeling that gave up freewill before vivian be aware of whilst thought that be perfectly independent of party public opinion have enrolled amongst wharton partisan of russell be first to give warning russell heard of amongst political leader who met at lord glistonburys dinner knowing danger there be of young man committing on certain point with eagerness of true friend wrote immediately to put vivian upon guard dear vivian be just going into country with lord lidhurst perhaps may not return for time can not leave without putting on guard once more against mr wharton understand that be thought to be one of party that countenance report take care that be not bound hand foot before know where be sincere friend h russell with natural frankness of disposition vivian immediately spoke to wharton upon subject what people say that be one of party do said wharton never heard before be heartily glad to hear be in for now vivian be one of with must stand fall excuse there cried vivian be not of party be determined to keep independent do remember honest quaker answer to man of party said wharton think be about year when party dispute about whig tory ran high matter what year will do for time gentleman of undeviating

other situation why must moderate man be condemned to kennel said vivian be there middle to quaker road stout man can not be easily jostled into kennel pshaw pshaw said wharton jesting out of question man be nothing in public life worse than nothing trimmer unless join party unless abides by too a long a party be in right presume mean said vivian right wrong cried wharton man must abide by party power popularity trust without better stride on greasy head of mob than be trampled under dirtier foot armed neutrality may be good thing unarmed neutrality be fit only for fool besides in russell grand style can bring down ancient upon tell that when commonwealth be in danger can not be good man who side with party if be so necessary to join party if after once joining must abide by right wrong for life said vivian behoves to consider well before commit before go into rank must see good reason to confide not only in ability in integrity public virtue of leader public virtue sound fresh from college said wharton must a soon sooner hear schoolboy read theme a hear man begin to prose about public virtue especially member of parliament keep that phrase dear vivian till of treasury bench come to court then look superb like french tragic actor swelling out chest throwing head over left shoulder thus exclaim public virtue forbid practise practise for if do well may be worth loud huzza to yet better still snug place pension stay till youre asked stay till youre asked thats etiquette never till then let hear public virtue come out of lip else youll raise suspicion of virtue lower price what must think of pretty actress who began to talk to of reputation before put in danger oh vivian honest fellow unless must make think better than thousand have gone before never let hear from lip again till proper time hypocritical state phrase public virtue have always till now understood that be possible to be patriot without being hypocrite replied vivian always understood that mr wharton be patriot very fair sarcasm on said wharton laughing know im sad dog never set up for pattern man come let home to dinner truce with politics morality find vivian youre sturdy fellow must have own way bending no leading see well be good thing to have so much strength of mind envy must be recorded to credit of hero that in defiance of wharton raillery talked oh still more wonderful thought of public virtue during nearly half of first session in parliament ala whilst political principle thus withstood force of ridicule temptation soon presented to vivian in new shape in form so seducing a to draw attention totally away from politics to put private if not public honour in most imminent peril chapter iv one morning a vivian be walking with mr wharton up bond street be met by party of fashionable lounger one of whom asked whether mr wharton be not come to town yet mr wharton said vivian with air of surprise yes came to town morning said wharton carelessly then laughing a turned to look at vivian vivian good fellow what smites with such surprise did not know be married suppose must have heard really forgot said vivian there have advantage of said wharton still laughing if never heard of mr wharton before keep own secret for can tell must never forgive though might put good face on matter at rate swear youve heard so much of that be dying to see of gentleman who have nothing else to do will introduce whenever please can not said vivian have honour of introduction mine worst must possibly have honour a be pleased to call must be favour assure honour honour of husband introduction what novice be must make believe to be seriously be engaged to day at glistonburys so good morning to accustomed to hear wharton talk in freest manner of woman marriage in general scarcely having heard mention own wife vivian have a said absolutely forgotten that wharton be married man when be introduced to mr wharton be still more surprised at husband indifference for beheld lady in radiance of beauty elegance of fashion be so much dazzled by charm that have not immediately power inclination to examine what understanding disposition might be must only repeat to how be possible that wharton can be indifferent to beautiful creature incapable of feeling of what called romance of love passion of course have always be with mr wharton of very transient nature tired of wife person showed indifference without scruple ceremony notorious glorying in gallantry be often heard to declare that price be too high to be paid for beauty except man liberty be sacrifice must never make to woman especially to wife marriage vow custom house oath classed in same order of technical form nowise binding on conscience of fool dupe whilst husband went on in manner wife satisfied by indulgence in strongest passion passion for dress public admiration childishly eager to set fashion in trifle spent unconscionable sum on pretty person devoted day rather night to public amusement so insatiable restless be passion for admiration that be never happy for hour together at place of public amusement unless fixed gaze of number first winter after marriage enjoyed prerogative of fashionable beauty reign of fashion be more transient even than bloom of beauty mr wharton beauty soon grew familiar faded in public eye newer face be season mode mr wharton appeared twice at opera in most elegant becoming dress one followed lead mortified utterly dejected felt with keenest anguish first symptom of decline of public admiration be just at period when be miserably in want of consolation of flattery that vivians acquaintance with commenced gratified by sort of delighted surprise saw in countenance first moment beheld seeing that be agreeable man knowing that be man of fortune family took pain to please by common art of coquetry vanity be proof against weakness of lady understanding frivolity of character be for week sufficient antidote against power of personal charm so much so that at period often compared rather contrasted mr wharton selina blessed happy fate wrote to friend russell soon after be introduced to celebrated beauty drew strong just parallel between character of two lady concluded with saying notwithstanding well founded dread of volatility of character will not hope dear russell do injustice to apprehend be in danger from charm of mr wharton vivian wrote with perfect sincerity believed to be impossible that must ever become attached to woman a mr wharton even if have not be married wife of friend so in security of conscious contempt went day to wait upon rather to meet agreeable company at house house in be fashionable dissipated assembled where beauty talent rank met mingled where political other arrangement prevented host hostess from scrupulously excluding whose character be not free from suspicion lady mary vivian never went to mr wharton acknowledged that knew many lady of unblemished reputation who thought impropriety to visit there mr wharton own character knew be hitherto unimpeached be indeed woman of cold selfish temper said lady mary not likely to be led into danger by tender passion by of delusion of imagination vivian agreed with mother in opinion went on paying devoir to day be fashion of time peculiarly mode of house for gentleman to pay exclusive attention to matron few of young men seemed to think while to speak to unmarried woman in company few who might be inclined to be a declared deterred by danger for young lady mother immediately formed expectation scheme of drawing into matrimony grand object of lady wish of gentleman fear men said must not speak to unmarried woman even dance with more than twice without being reported that be going to be married then friend relative of young lady pretended to think injured ill treated if report be not realized hero have slight experience of truth of complaint in own case with lady sarah lidhurst willingly took rest upon trust believed exaggeration of companion began to think prudent necessary to follow example to confine attention to married woman many irresistible reason concurred to make mr wharton most convenient proper person to whom must pay sort of homage besides seemed to fall to share by lot necessity for at wharton house other lady other gentleman being engaged in gallantry play politics mr wharton must have be utterly neglected if vivian have not paid attention common politeness absolutely required attention became matter of course be habitually expected still have not slightest design of going beyond line of modern politeness in certain circumstance people go wrong great way before be aware that have gone single step be presently repeated to mr vivian by of mr wharton confidante in whisper under solemn promise of secrecy that certainly be prodigious favourite of hers laughed affected to disbelieve insinuation made impression however be secretly flattered by idea of being prodigious favourite with beautiful young creature in moment saw with eye of compassion pitying for neglect with be treated by husband began to attribute much of apparent frivolity many of fault more to want of guide friend than to deficiency of understanding to defect of character mr wharton have just sufficient sense to be cunning implies very small portion perceived advantage gained by thus working upon vivians vanity upon compassion continued operation without being violently interested in success for have at first only general wish to attract attention because be fashionable young man one morning when called upon wharton to accompany to house of common found mr wharton in tear husband walking up down room in evident ill stopped speaking when vivian entered mr wharton endeavoured seemed to endeavour to conceal emotion began to play on harp wharton addressing to vivian talked of politics of day there be incoherence in conversation for vivians attention be distracted by air mr wharton be playing of be passionately fond there possibility of doing thing while there be such cursed noise in room cried wharton here have head of bill to draw up can not endure to have music wherever go snatched up paper retired to adjoining apartment begging that vivian must wait one quarter of hour for mr wharton tear flowed afresh looked beautiful in tear see see mr vivian be ashamed must see how be treated be indeed most unfortunate creature upon face of earth nobody in world have least compassion for vivians countenance contradicted last assertion most positively mr wharton understood attitude of despondency be most graceful imaginable dear mr wharton be first time hero have ever called dear mr wharton be only platonic dear take trifle much too seriously wharton be hurried by business moment impatience must be forgiven moment replied mr wharton casting up to heaven beautiful eye oh mr vivian how little do know of be most miserable creature ever existed there be not man upon earth to whom must say so except vivian must not help feeling gratitude for distinction a leaned over harp with air of unusual interest said hoped that must ever prove worthy of esteem confidence at instant wharton interrupted conversation by passing hastily through room come vivian said will be very late at house will see again of course at dinner said mr wharton to vivian in low voice hero replied by assenting bow five minute afterwards repented that have accepted invitation because foresaw that must resume conversation be at once interesting embarrassing felt that be not right to become depository of lady complaint against husband yet have be moved by tear idea that be only man in world to whom must open heart upon delicate subject interested irresistibly in favour returned in evening be flattered by observing that amongst crowd of company by be surrounded be instantly distinguished be perfectly persuaded of innocence of intention a be attached to woman fancied that must become friend of beautiful mr wharton without danger first time have opportunity of speaking to in private expressed idea in manner that thought most delicately flattering to self complacency mr wharton seemed to be perfectly satisfied with conduct declared that unless have be certain that be not man of gallantry must never have placed confidence in friendship consider said quite a married man by bye when be to be married what sort of person be miss sidney be told be excessively handsome amiable sensible what happy creature be just going to be united to man love here lady gave profound sigh vivian have opportunity of observing that have longest dark eyelash that have ever seen be married continued before knew what be about know mr wharton can be so charming when plea then be so much in love with swore must shoot if must not have sort of thing protest be terrified be quite child know have be out six week thought be in love with be because did not know what love be then besides hurried teased to such degree after im convinced married more out of compassion than thing else now see how treat most barbarously tyrannically must not give least hint of to man living conjure to keep secret pity be ask pity sometimes when thought be not absorbed in happier manner vivians generosity be piqued must not be so selfish a to be engrossed exclusively by own felicity thought that delicacy must induce to forbear expatiating upon selinas virtue accomplishment upon passion carried delicacy so far that sometimes for fortnight three week never mentioned name must not observe that mr wharton did not like le for specie of sacrifice may be observed that mr wharton managed attack upon vivian with more art than must be expected from so silly woman must consider that faculty be concentrated on one object so that seemed to have instinct for coquetry most silly animal in creation from insect tribe upwards show on occasion where interest be immediately concerned degree of sagacity ingenuity compared with usual imbecility appears absolutely wonderful opinion vivian have early formed of weakness of lady understanding prevented from being on guard against artifice must not conceive possible that must be duped by person so obviously inferior with woman of talent knowledge might have be suspicious there be nothing in mr wharton to alarm pride to awaken fear fancied that must extricate in moment with slightest effort from snare must contrive under persuasion neglected to make even slight effort thus continued from hour to hour in voluntary captivity insensibly vivian became more interested for mr wharton at same time submitted with increased facility to influence of husband be necessary that must have excuse to world yet more to own conscience for being so constantly at wharton pleasure took in wharton conversation be still sort of involuntary excuse to for intimacy with lady wharton wit more than mr wharton beauty thought be attraction that draw here be full a ready to be of party a of hers be best proof that be a must be wharton party be not always such a vivian must have chosen be pressed on without power of resistance for instance one night wharton be going with lord pontipool set of dissipated young men to house of lady who made fashionable by keeping faro bank vivian youll come along with said wharton come must have unless be more happily engaged eye glanced with mixture of contempt jealousy upon wife mr wharton alarmed imploring countenance at same moment seemed to say for heaven sake go with be undone in such circumstance be impossible for vivian to say no followed immediately acting a thought from principle of honour generosity wharton be not man to give up advantage have gained day showed more capricious jealousy of wife though at same time expressed most entire confidence in honour of friend vivian still thought must not do too much to convince that confidence be not misplaced thus to protect mr wharton from suspicion yielded to husband wish vivian now felt frequently ashamed of conduct always proud of motif with ingenious sophistry justified to worst action by pleading that did with best intention chapter v by time lady mary vivian began to hear hint of son attachment to mr wharton much alarmed repented having encouraged to form political fashionable intimacy with wharton suddenly awakened to perception of danger lady mary be too vehement in terror spoke with so much warmth indignation that there be little chance of counsel being of use dear madam be only platonic attachment argued vivian when mother represented to that world talked loudly of intimacy with mr wharton platonic attachment fashionable dangerous sophistry said lady mary why so maam said son warmly why must mind what world say world be so fond of scandal that man woman can not have degree of friendship for one without hue cry being immediately raised prude coquette join at once in believing pretending to believe that there must be something wrong wonder pretty woman a mr wharton can not escape envy of course censure conduct can defy utmost malice of enemy hope so said lady mary at event be not one of know care very little about mr wharton whom have always be accustomed to consider a frivolous silly woman what wish to say though fear have lost confidence that advice will not frivolous silly interrupted vivian believe dear mother world be have be under great mistake about understanding character forming platonic friendship with young man be great proof of sense of virtue said lady mary danger of platonic attachment thought have be sufficiently understood pray dear charles never let hear more from of platonics with married woman use expression maam if have objection to said vivian wish to live in most fashionable company yet desire not to live a live talk a talk now be next to impossible pardon must not have thought added laughing that who like most thing be fashionable must object to platonics object to despise detest abhor platonics have be ruin of more woman destruction of peace of more family than open profligacy ever must have accomplished many married woman who must have started with horror at idea of beginning intrigue have be drawn in to admit of platonic attachment many man who must a soon have thought of committing murder a of seducing friend wife have allowed to commence platonic attachment how end world know struck by word vivian suddenly quitted air of raillery became serious have mother stopped there left rest to good sense awakened perception of danger must have be well be ever prone to say too much in ardour to prove to be in right forgot that people be apt to be shocked by having pointed out that be utterly in wrong indeed very word platonics pursued be considered by who have seen thing of life a mere watchword of knave dupe of who deceive of who wish to be deceived be assured maam said vivian that mr wharton be not one of who wish to deceive to be deceived a to hope be a far from danger of being dupe a of being knave connexion with mr wharton be perfectly innocent be justified by example of hundred thousand day in fashionable world must do great injustice if broke off intimacy suddenly a if acknowledged that be improper what can be more improper since force to speak plainly cried lady mary what can be more improper than intimacy especially in circumstance circumstance what circumstance maam have forgotten miss sidney by mean maam said vivian colouring deeply mr wharton be well apprized be from first moment of friendship clearly informed of engagement with miss sidney how do agree with attachment to mr wharton perfectly well maam mr wharton understands perfectly well maam miss sidney do think will understand be not extraordinary must think more of feeling than do at question vivian became so angry that be incapable of listening farther to reason to best advice even from mother for whom have highest respect mother son parted with feeling of mutual dissatisfaction vivian from spirit of opposition so often seen in weak character went immediately from mother lecture to party at mr wharton lady mary in mean time sat down to write to miss sidney reluctance have originally felt to son marriage with young lady must be repeated to ladyship credit that selinas honourable disinterested conduct have won entire approbation wrote therefore in strongest term to press immediate conclusion of match now considered a only chance of securing son moral happiness letter concluded with word will expect in town directly dear let idle scruple prevent from coming to house consider that happiness own son depend upon compliance be persuaded that moment see moment exert power over will be again believe know young men of present day better than do constancy be not proof against absence if lose habit of seeing conversing with can not answer for rest adieu be so much harassed by own thought by report hear that scarcely know what write pray come immediately dear selina may talk to of many subject on dont like to trust to write feeling have be too long repressed must unburden heart to only can console assist independently of other consideration owe to friendship for selina not to refuse first request ever made farewell will expect to see a soon a possible yours c mary vivian st james street in letter lady mary vivian have not explained nature of son danger of fear for motif of delicacy have prevented from explicitly telling miss sidney suspicion that vivian be attached to married woman selina said ladyship to herself must probably have heard report from mr g who be so often at mother therefore there can be necessity for saying more than have done will understand hint unfortunately however miss sidney did not comprehend in least suspect most material part of truth understood simply from lady mary letter vivians affection wavered imagined that be perhaps on point of making matrimonial proposal for fashionable belle probably for one of lady lidhursts idea of becoming attached to married woman never entered thought many motif conspired to incline selina to accept of invitation certainty that lady mary must be highly offended by refusal hint that influence over vivian must operate immediately in force if be to see converse with that on contrary absence might extinguish passion for ever curiosity to learn precisely nature of report mother have heard to disadvantage above fond wish to be nearer to man loved to have daily opportunity of seeing prompted selina to comply with lady mary request on contrary good sense delicacy represented that have released vivian from promise engagement at parting have professed to leave perfectly at liberty that must therefore be a indelicate a imprudent to make such attempt to reclaim inconstant heart have told that desired to have proof of steadiness of character of attachment before must consent to marry from decision must not must not recede have fortitude to persist in resolution wrote to lady mary vivian in kindest at same time in most decided term declining tempting invitation happened that vivian be with mother at moment when selinas answer arrived in firm belief that pressing invitation a have sent to person in selinas circumstance of selinas temper must not be refused ladyship have made point with son to dine tte tte with day have be talking to in most eloquent imprudent manner of contrast between character of mr wharton miss sidney protested that esteem love for miss sidney be unabated yet when mother told that must perhaps in few minute see selina changed colour grew embarrassed melancholy thus by look effectually contradicted word be roused from reverie by arrival of selinas letter mother disappointment anger be expressed in strongest term when found that selina declined invitation such be quick seemingly perverse turn of human heart vivian grew warm in selinas defence moment that mother became angry with read letter with tender emotion for saw through whole of strength a well a delicacy of attachment that mother praise have failed to effect be immediately accomplished by letter who instant before dreaded to meet selina now that refused to come be seized with strong desire to see impatience be so great that must willingly have set out that instant for country men of such character a vivians be peculiarly jealous of free will precisely because know that be easily led resist in affair of heart especially slightest appearance of control lady mary be delighted to hear son declare resolution to leave town next morning to see miss sidney a soon a possible must not forbear reproaching for not doing what wanted precisely in manner in have planned that must be done see dear charles cried that even when do right must not flatter that be owing to influence of mine give compliment to miss sidney assure will in future forbear to injure in opinion by interference even by expressing approbation of character anger be obvious have served better than kindness therefore have reason to regret that affection have be lessened a confess have be by late conduct next morning when vivian be prepared to leave town called upon wharton to settle with about political business be to be transacted in absence wharton be not at home vivian knew that must be best to avoid seeing mr wharton be afraid that must be offended must not help sacrificing few minute to politeness lady be alone apparently very languid charmingly melancholy before vivian must explain poured forth in silly phrase in voice that made even nonsense please rariety of reproach for having absented for length of time positively must keep prisoner now that have safe once more to be kept prisoner by fair lady be so flattering that be full hour before must prevail upon to assert liberty fear of giving pain indeed influenced still more than vanity at last when mr wharton spoke of engagement for evening seemed to take for granted that must be of party summoned resolution sufficient oh wonderful effort of courage to tell that be under necessity of leaving town immediately going presume to to country said vivian firmly to country say at once to selina tell worst in one word astonished beyond measure vivian have not power to move lady fell back on sofa in violent hysteric hero trembled lest of servant must come in lest husband must at return find in condition discover cause endeavoured in vain to soothe compose weeping fair one must not have barbarity to leave in state by sweet degree recovered recollection be in most lovely confusion asked where be what be going to happen vivian have not rashness to run risk of second fit of hysteric gave up thought of journey for day lady recovered spirit in most flattering manner vivian intended to postpone journey only for single day after have yielded one point found that there be receding be now persuaded that mr wharton be miserable that must never forgive for having betrayed state of heart self love pleaded powerfully in favour considered that husband treated with mortifying neglect provoked spirit of retaliation by gallantry vivian fancied that mr wharton attachment to might render wretched must never make criminal with sophistical delicacy veiled own motif instead of following plain dictate of reason involved understanding in specie of sentimental casuistry confounds principle of right wrong dread that felt lest wharton must discover what be going on might have sufficiently convinced that be not acting honourably suspicion mr wharton formerly showed of wife seemed now to be completely lulled asleep gave vivian continually such proof of confidence a stung to soul by absurd not uncommon error of self love vivian be induced to believe that man who professed to cheat mankind in general behaved towards in particular with strict honour even with unparalleled generosity honesty be too vulgar virtue for wharton aristocratic exclusive virtue of gentleman laid claim to in highest tone very frankness with wharton avowed libertine principle with respect to woman convinced vivian that have not slightest suspicion that must be immediately applied to ruin of own wife how can dear wharton talk in manner said vivian once when have be speaking with great freedom be better added with sigh to speak than to act like villain villain repeated wharton with sarcastic laugh be grown

expressed sincere satisfaction on hearing of release from unworthy bondage at return home to friend tone in russell spoke seriousness embarrassment of manner alarmed vivian inexpressibly stood silent dared not ask farther explanation for minute at length broke silence conjured friend to go immediately to miss sidney mother to request permission for to see in others presence russell said that if vivian insisted must comply with request that advised not to attempt to see miss sidney at present not till have be time in london till have given earnest of steadiness of conduct till have appeared again distinguished in public life might raise again in esteem continued russell must be aware that love depends on esteem at least that one can not exist without other will deliver letter to from said vivian if think have better not attempt to see yet will deliver letter for after hesitation rather deliberation russell answered in constrained voice will deliver letter if insist upon vivian wrote russell undertook to deliver letter though with evident reluctance in mean time vivian went to see mother whom longed yet dreaded to meet manner be not now severe haughty a when last addressed mild benign held out hand to said thank god son be restored to to must say no more embraced tenderly russell have shown lady mary that son have be dupe of preconcerted scheme to work upon passion deplored weakness have be touched by suffering be persuaded that remorse must guard against future error therefore not word look of reproach escaped from when spoke of selina lady mary with great animation of countenance warmth of eulogium declared that be first wish of heart to see son married to woman of such noble character angelic temper added ladyship manner changing suddenly a pronounced word before must explain russell came into room told vivian that miss sidney desired to see vivian heard word with joy joy be checked by great gravity embarrassment of friend countenance by sigh of ill omen from mother eager to relieve suspense hastened to selina who a russell told be in lady mary dressing room room in have first declared passion for hope fear alternately seized fear prevailed moment that beheld selina not that strong displeasure appeared in countenance be mild placid be changed towards very serenity be alarming whilst welcomed to native country to friend while expressed hope for future happiness hope forsook in broken sentence attempted to stammer out answer then throwing into chair exclaimed see future happiness be lost for deserve reproach said selina in sweet voice voice though sweet be so altered to that threw into despair be wish not to inflict to spare pain have therefore desired to see a soon a possible that might not form false expectation then no longer love selina now after have suffered have cruelty to tell so who must form character to thing be good honourable who alone must restore to myself reject cast from for ever have suffered much said selina in trembling voice since parted vivians eye quickly ran over face whole form a spoke word saw indeed trace of sickness suffering with idea of power over affection hope revived seized feeble hand lay motionless withdrew decidedly hope again forsook when gently raised head continued to speak have suffered much since parted mr vivian hope will spare unnecessary useless pain in interview painful to certain degree must be to of for can not even now that feeling of passion have subsided that possibility of being united to be past tell so with composure have expected to do with firmness of voice manner be necessary perhaps to convince of truth to restore mind to possibility of being united to be past why interrupted vivian incapable of understanding listening to thing else till question be answered force to what may seem like cruel reproach let suffice for to say that sentiment have be so much altered by year experience that be impossible for ever to become wife love be founded on esteem have indeed always fear of instability of character therefore put resolution to proof event have proved to that fear be too just speak with difficulty for can not easily give so much

heart that determination have not be hastily formed can not be altered deliberate manner in now speak to will hope persuade of truth if have hesitated showed agitation in interview attribute to real cause weakness of health feebleness of body not of mind rose to leave room vivian detained beseeching with eloquence of passion in despair to hear for one moment whilst urged that there be probability of ever relapsing into error from have suffered so much that now character be formed by adversity that such be power selina possessed over heart that union with must at crisis decide fate that steadiness must give stability to resolution that gratitude must so increase affection that must have strongest possible motif to make good husband when be happy in domestic life must feel energy of mind revive that must exert power to distinguish to justify choice of woman adored in spite of word adored have usually such power to confound female judgment selina perceived that said be merely repetition of former argument of experience have proved insufficiency be aware that if before marriage resolution constancy have not be able to support trial must be folly madness to marry with vague hope that might reform character therefore continued steady to resolution a found that vivians disappointment be greater than have expected immediately withdrew from mother house next morning when vivian came to breakfast after having spent sleepless night planning new argument new intreaties in favour of love found that miss sidney be gone mother friend russell joined in representing to that must be useless to follow that must only give selina unavailing pain vivian felt stroke severely mind be a be adrift again after first violence of feeling have spent when sunk into kind of apathy be consequence of exhausted passion friend russell endeavoured to excite to honourable ambition vivian caught idea that if distinguished in public life if there displayed steadiness of character might win back selinas esteem affection fired with hope immediately turned whole mind to object applied with indefatigable ardour day night to make master of subject likely to be discussed in ensuing session of parliament at length application energy be crowned with success on question of considerable political importance have carefully considered made excellent speech speech directly made of consequence in house in language of newspaper be received with unbounded applause be distinguished for strength of argument lucid order happy choice of expression what encouraged hero more than newspaper puff party panegyric be approbation of friend russell russell never praised violently few word even look of satisfaction from went farther than most exaggerated eulogium from others vivian pursued course for time with honour increasing reputation there be one man who never joined in of compliment paid to rising orator there be one man who always spoke of with contempt who pronounced that vivian must never go far in politics that be not in that be too soft que ctoit btir sur de la boue que de compter sur lui depreciator enemy of vivian be man who few month before have be political proneur unblushing flatterer mr wharton exasperated by consciousness of own detected baseness provoked still more by being frustrated in scheme wharton now practised art that malicious unprincipled wit must devise to lower opinion of vivians talent to prevent obtaining power celebrity hero be stimulated by conduct to fresh exertion so far wharton enmity be of service to be of disservice by changing in measure purity of motif from acted with love honourable ambition now mixed hatred thought of vengeance view of vulgar vanity interest thought more of contradicting mr wharton prophecy than of fulfilling own idea of what be fair right be anxious to prove that must go far in politics that be in that be not too soft that be not building on mud to depend on indefinite expression operated powerfully perniciously on imagination to prove that wharton be mistaken in prognostic be necessary to hero to obtain price stamp of talent be essential to gain political power must not be attained without joining party vivian joined party then in opposition wharton though in opposition of course after what have passed must never meet in private company have communication in public though on same side of question enmity be so great that not only business of nation even interest of party be often impeded by quarrel in midst of dispute vivian insensibly adopted more more of language principle of public men with whom daily associated began to hear talk of compensation job a did to consider measure proved to be necessary for support of party a expedient if not absolutely right country must not be saved unless friend must obtain management of affair men be found must gain parliamentary influence raise into political power without acting a body then of course subordinate point of right be to be sacrificed to great good of promoting view of party still however patriotism be upon whole pure have personal view of interest desire even to be in place independently of wish to promote good of country secret overture be about time made to by government inquiry be made if there be thing must gratify by must be induced to lay aside opposition to assist in supporting measure many compliment to talent eloquence usual commonplace about expediency propriety of strengthening hand of government be of course added something specific be at length mentioned be intimated that a be of ancient family might gratify that mother must be made baroness in own right offer be declined temptation be firmly withstood by hero credit be now at acme with own coadjutor lady mary whispered circumstance a state secret to acquaintance russell took care that miss sidney must hear of vivian be now cited a incorruptible patriot wharton malice even wit be almost silenced yet be heard to say amidst din of applause be only first offer be in right to make show of resistance will coquet for time keep philandering on till suit then hell jilt youll see such speech though reached vivians ear by kind officiousness of friend be never made by mr wharton so directly that must take hold of russell strenuously advised not to seek occasion to quarrel with man who evidently desired only to raise own reputation by making vivian angry getting in wrong forcing into imprudent duel let action continue to contradict word can never injure said russell for time vivian adhered to friend advice proudly felt superiority of principle character ala there be one defence that patriotism wanted economy whilst be thus active in public cause exulting in disinterestedness private affair be getting into terrible disorder expense of building castle have increased beyond calculation expense of election money have lost at play whilst be in wharton society sum have lent to wharton money have spent abroad

to be done at critical moment offer from certain quarter be renewed in a seemed more acceptable form pension be proffered instead of title be promised that business must be so managed pension so held in name that nothing of transaction must transpire that seceding from opposition must be made to appear change of sentiment from conviction not from interested motif vivians honourable feeling revolted from offer abhorred subterfuge distress pecuniary distress have never before felt pressure have never till now felt how powerful how compulsatory be over even generous high spirited soul whilst vivian be thus oppressed with difficulty imprudence have brought upon whilst mind be struggling with opposing motif be most fortunately for political integrity relieved partly by accident partly by friendship happened that incumbent of rich living of vivian have presentation be dying just at time russell instead of claiming living vivian have promised to relinquished pretension to insisted upon friend disposing of right of presentation sum enabled vivian to raise be fully sufficient to satisfy execution have be laid on castle le clamorous creditor be content to be paid by instalment annually from income thus be saved for present formed most prudent resolve for future be most sincerely grateful to disinterested friend full extent of sacrifice russell made be not however known at time for year afterwards without anticipation let proceed with story amongst fashionable political friend with whom hero have since return to england renewed connexion be lord glistonbury lordship far from thinking worse of for affair with mr wharton spoke of in modish slang a new fine feather in cap congratulated vivian upon having carried off prize without paying price vivians

glastonbury abhorrent of what termed modern philosophy classing under name almost science literature especially attempt to cultivate understanding of woman have with assistance of double miss strictland brought up lady sarah in ignorance rigidity of most obsolete of old school have made lady sarah precisely like with virtue stiff dogmatical repulsive with religion gloomy puritanical with manner cold automatic in course of eighteen year whilst lady glistonbury went on like clock work same round punctual to letter unfeeling of spirit of duty contrived even by wearisome method of minuted diary of education to make house odious to husband task master hour of lesson continually immitigably plagued went abroad for amusement found dissipation thus by unaccommodating temper obstinacy of manifold virtue succeeded in alienating affection of husband in despair one day exclaimed ah que de vertu vous faites har repelled by virtue in ungracious form flew to more attractive vice finding that must not have comfort solace in society of wife sought consolation in company of mistress lady glistonbury have in mean time consolation in being pattern wife in hearing at card table be universally said that lord glistonbury be worst of husband that ladyship be extremely to be pitied in process of time lord glistonbury be driven to home again by united torment of virago mistress gout be at period that formed notion of being at once political leader mecaenas be at period that became acquainted with daughter determined that julia must never resemble lady sarah saw own genius in julia resolved a said to give fair play to make one of wonder of age after month counteraction altercation lord glistonbury with high hand took daughter from under control of miss strictland in spite of representation prophecy denunciation of mother consigned julia to care of governess after own heart miss bateman a called rosamunda from moment lady be introduced into family there be irreconcileable breach between husband wife lady glistonbury be perfectly in right in dread of such governess a miss bateman for daughter ladyship be only partially accidentally right right in point of fact wrong in general principle for objected to miss bateman a being of class of literary woman to real fault inordinate love of admiration romantic imprudence lady glistonbury did not object because did not at first know when did considered a necessary consequence of cultivation enlargement of miss batemans understanding wonder ladyship must say knew must be so knew must not be otherwise clever woman a be called be same come of literature literary lady thus moralizing in private with miss strictland own small party lady glistonbury appeared silent passive before husband adherent after prophesying how must end in ruin of daughter julia declared that must never speak on subject again showed ready with maternal resignation in silent obduracy to witness completion of sacrifice of devoted child lord glistonbury be quite satisfied with having silenced opposition new governess established in office with full unlimited power went on triumphant careless of charge thought of little displaying own talent in company castle be consequently filled with crowd of amateur novel play be order of day theatre be fitted up in open defiance of poor lady glistonbury daughter commenced new course of education by being taught to laugh at mother prejudice such be state of affair when vivian commenced observation secret history learnt by scrap hint inuendoes from very particular friend of party friend who be not troubled with of mr russell scruple discretion vivians attention be now fixed upon lady julia observed with satisfaction that notwithstanding governess example excitement lady julia did not show exorbitant desire for general admiration that manner be free from coquetry affectation seemed rather to disdain flattery to avoid homage company of men who be inferior in mental qualification addressed conversation principally to vivian friend russell with indeed conversed great deal with much eagerness enthusiasm expressing opinion without disguise showing on most occasion more imagination than reason more feeling than judgment vivian perceived that be soon suspected by many of observer especially by lady glistonbury lady sarah julia have design upon heart plainly discerned that have design to captivate that though gave so large share of company be without thinking of a lover saw that conversed with mr russell preferably to others because spoke on subject interested more because drew out brother of whom be very fond being capable at so early age to appreciate russell character talent preferring solid sense plain sincerity to brilliancy fashion even gallantry of men whom father have now collected round appeared to vivian most unequivocal proof of superiority of understanding of goodness of disposition on various occasion marked with delight deference paid to friend opinion readiness with listened to reason from albeit unused averse from reason in general impatient a be of control confident both in own power in instinctive moral sense about by bye talked great deal of eloquent nonsense yet word look from mr russell must reclaim in highest flight soon after vivian commenced observation upon interesting subject saw instance of what russell have told of ease with lady julia might be guided by man of sense strength of mind tragedy of fair penitent calista by miss bateman be represented with vast applause to brilliant audience at glistonbury theatre same play be to be reacted week afterwards to fresh audience be proposed that vivian must play lothario that lady julia must play calista miss bateman saw objection to proposal lord glistonbury might perhaps have have parental prudence to object to daughter appearing in public at age in such character before mixed audience unfortunately lady glistonbury bursting from silence at critical moment said so much in such prosing puritanical manner not only against daughter acting in play in circumstance against stage play playwright actor actress whatsoever denouncing anathematizing indiscriminately that immediately lord glistonbury laughed miss bateman took fire became trial of power between contending party lady julia who have lately escaped from irksomeness of mother injudicious minute control dreaded above thing to be again subjected to miss strictland therefore without considering real propriety impropriety of point in question without examining whether miss bateman be right wrong in licence have granted lady julia supported opinion warmly with eloquence at once asserted own liberty defended cause of theatre in general have heard mr russell once speak of utility of well regulated public stage of influence of good theatric representation in forming taste rousing soul to virtue have shown marmontels celebrated letter to rousseau on subject consequently thought knew what opinion must be on present occasion therefore spoke with more than usual confidence enthusiasm eloquence ability transported father most of auditor vivian among rest with astonishment admiration enjoyed at moment what french call un grand succs in midst of buzz of applause vivian observed that eye turned anxiously upon russell who stood silent with disapproving countenance be sure friend mr russell be displeased at instant with must know why let ask do bring here immediately disengaged from admirer making room for mr russell beside waited a said to hear from s vrits russell must have declined speaking ladyship appealed earnestly urgently for opinion saying who will speak truth to if will not on whose judgment can rely if not on yours direct brother mind to thing be wise good direct mine be a desirous to do right a can be will find willed volatile a know think will find docile pupil then tell frankly did just now speak too much too warmly thought be speaking sentiment must be right perhaps be not right for woman so young woman a be to support even just opinion so resolutely yet be crime to be young be honour of maintaining truth to be monopolized by age surely for mr russell have not claim to stand forth a so often doe in defence if think that ought not to act calista if think that have better not appear on stage at only say so all ask be opinion advantage of judgment see mr vivian how difficult be to obtain friend probably never felt difficulty with degree of sober composure almost provoked vivian mr russell answered animated lady with sincerity though politely shown vivian thought severe almost cruel russell acknowledged that ladyship have anticipated not of objection represented that have failed in becoming respect to mother in thus publicly attacking opposing opinion even supposing to be ill founded declared that a to case in discussion be entirely of lady glistonburys opinion that must be unfit injurious to young lady to exhibit even on private stage in character in have be proposed that lady julia must appear whilst russell spoke vivian be charmed with manner in lady julia listened thought countenance enchantingly beautiful alternately softened a be by expression of genuine humility radiant with candour gratitude made reply immediately went to mother in most engaging manner acknowledged that have be wrong declared that be convinced must be improper for to act character have proposed with cold haughtiness of mien most repulsive to warm generous mind mother turned to daughter said that for part have faith in sudden conversion start of good conduct made little impression upon that a far a be concerned forgave a in charity became undutiful insolence with have be treated that a to rest be glad to find for lady julias own sake that have given up strange a must say scandalous intention however added lady glistonbury be not so sanguine a to consider a thing respite from ruin be not so credulous a to believe in sudden reformation despicable a lord do honour to think understanding be to be made dupe of little deceitful fondling julia withdrew arm have thrown round mother miss strictland after breaking netting silk with jerk of indignation observed that for part wondered young lady must go to consult brother tutor instead of more suitable perhaps a competent adviser lady julia now indignant turned away be withdrawing from before triumvirate when lady sarah who have sat looking even more stiff constrained than usual suddenly broke from stony state springing forward exclaimed stay julia stay dear sister oh miss strictland do sister justice when julia be so candid so eager to do right intercede for with mother first may presume to ask said miss strictland drawing up with starch malice first may presume to ask whether mr vivian upon occasion declined to act lothario miss strictland do sister justice cried lady sarah miss strictland be wrong very wrong miss strictland for moment struck dumb with astonishment opening eye a far a must open stared at lady sarah after pause exclaimed lady sarah protest never saw thing surprised so much in whole life wrong very wrong lady glistonbury trust ladyship lady glistonbury at instant showed by little involuntary shake of head that be inwardly perturbed lady sarah throwing upon knee before mother exclaimed oh madam mother forgive if failed in respect to miss strictland sister sister rise sarah rise said lady glistonbury be not fit attitude be wrong very wrong to fail in respect to miss strictland second self sarah lady julia lidhurst be who be cause of only failure of duty sister ever be guilty of towards in whole course of life beg of to withdraw leave daughter sarah at least have found sister when most wanted said lady julia always suspected loved never knew how much till moment added turning to embrace sister lady sarah have now resumed stony appearance standing motionless received sister embrace without sign of life feeling lady julia lidhurst said miss strictland humble in vain think mother lady glistonbury requested of to leave sister lady sarah to to duty duty repeated lady julia eye flashing indignation be what call duty never will humble before again will leave do leave now for ever duty withdrew thus be lost one of fairest occasion of confirming young candid mind in prudent excellent disposition after humbling in vain before mother poor young lady be now to withstand father reproach after inexorable miss strictland be to encounter exasperated miss bateman whether gorgon terror of one governess fury passion of other be most formidable be difficult to decide miss bateman have written epilogue for lady julia to recite in character of calista with combined irritability of authoress governess be enraged at idea of pupil declining to repeat favourite line lord glistonbury cared not for line considering own authority to be impeached by daughter resistance treated julia a traitor to cause rebel to party lady julia be resolute in declining to play calista vivian admired spirit steadiness of resistance to solicitation flattery with be assailed by numerous hanger on of family by amateur assembled at glistonbury russell who knew warmth of temper however dreaded that must pas bound of propriety in contest with father governess almost repented having given advice upon subject contest happily terminated in lord glistonburys having violent fit of gout a newspaper informed public ended for season christmas hospitality theatrical festivity at glistonbury castle whilst lordship suffered fit of torture daughter julia attended with so much patience affection that forgave for not being willing to be calista upon recovery announced to miss bateman that be will pleasure that daughter julia must do a liked on point that desired to be understood that be concession to lady glistonburys prejudice act of own pure grace to celebrate recovery lordship determined to give ball miss bateman persuaded to make fancy ball in family unfortunately occurrence even proposal of amusement became subject of dispute source of misery lady glistonbury a soon a lord announced intention of giving fancy ball declined taking direction of entertainment approached said too near to nature of masquerade to meet idea of propriety lord glistonbury laughed tried power of ridicule wit on thimpassive ice lightning playd lady cool obstinacy be fully match for lord petulance to must urge repeated that such entertainment did not meet idea of propriety ladyship lady sarah miss strictland consequently declared to be resolution to appear in own proper character own proper dress others three rigid seceders excepted world at glistonbury castle within sphere of attraction be occupied with preparation for ball miss bateman be quite in element flattered flattering consulting consulted in midst of novel play poetry print picture searching for appropriate character dress preceptress seemed to think to expect that others must deem office of governess merely subordinate part of business considered having accepted of superintendence of education of lady julia lidhurst a prodigious condescension on part derogation from rank pretension in literary fashionable world peculiar sentimental favour to lord glistonbury of lordship be bound in honour to show sense by treating a member of family not only with distinguished politeness by deferring to opinion in thing so a to prove to satisfaction that be considered only a friend not at all a governess thus be raised a much above station in family in must be useful a governess in other house have be sometimes depressed below proper rank upon a upon occasion miss bateman be first person to be thought of character dress be

immediately decided governess by pointing out beautiful head dress of flaxmans circe observing that miss batemans hair be wig might easily be arranged so a to produce same effect lady julia rewarded vivian for able successful manoeuvre by one of sweetest smile smile have now powerful influence over heart rebelled against russell advice to take more time to consider how far character be suited to hers be conscious indeed that must be more prudent to wait little longer before must declare passion a lady julia be so very young enthusiastic a education have be so ill managed argued that worse education more imprudent people about greater be merit in conducting with discretion in trying to restrain natural enthusiasm russell acknowledged gave due praise to lady julia yet still represented that vivian have be acquainted with so short time that must not be competent judge of temper disposition even if judgment be cool be evident that passion be now engaged warmly in favour russell urged for delay so far operated however upon vivian that adopted half measure determined to try what chance might have of pleasing before must declare love to ladyship make proposal to father favourable

brother have made in case vivian felt ready though man in love to approve of motif a to rest be certain that russell must decline part assigned a vivian expected russell came in few minute to resign pretension rather to state that though lord lidhurst have proposed have never thought of accepting honour that must in probability not appear at ball because be anxious to stay a much a possible with lord lidhurst whose indisposition increased instead of abating lord glistonbury after explanation came in high spirit with much satisfaction in countenance manner said be happy to hear that sigismunda

countenance said in low voice must think mr vivian very unreasonable whimsical have given up thought of being sigismunda will oblige so far a not to appear in dress of tancred to night will thus spare farther difficulty know mother sister have declared determination not to wear fancy dress though father be anxious must believe may be best that in instance follow own judgment may expect that will

tancred a must have made now be character at then be only on par with certain lady comfort with great pope fear too true reflection that most woman have character at miss batemans eye glanced insolently a spoke upon lady glistonburys trio who passed by at instant without fancy dress vivian shocked by ill breeding towards mistress of house offered arm immediately to lady glistonbury conducted with lady sarah miss strictland to proper place where having seated in same attitude precisely looked more like martyr prepared for endurance than like person in ball room vivian stayed to

dress doe not proclaim engaged to partner equally fanciful can not wish that daughter lady sarah must if dance at to night dance with gentleman in own proper character vivian thus called upon felt compelled to ask honour of lady sarah hand flattered that after first dance must have done duty that must be at liberty by time julia must make appearance to great disappointment mr russell who came

glistonbury vivian be last in ball room lordship began raillery upon hero having declined appearing a tancred upon having devoted night to lady sarah vivian seized moment to explain real feeling made proposal for lady julia be received with warm approbation by father who seemed to rejoice more in proposal because knew that must disappoint mortify lady glistonbury interest of hatred seemed indeed to occupy lordship more than interest of vivians love politeness threw decent veil over feeling after saying must be expected of satisfaction must be to father to see daughter united to man of mr vivians family fortune talent great respectability after having given incidentally parenthetically opinion not only concerning matrimony concerning other affair of human life wished future son in law

lordship have received after proof must may have fallen within cognizance of art of seduction have be employed here vivian interrupted mr mainwaring to beg that must not keep longer in suspense by inuendoes that must name distinctly object of suspicion however mr mainwaring begged to be excused from doing must only shake head smile leave people to own sagacity penetration vivian warmly answered that if mr mainwaring meant mr russell be well assured that mr mainwaring be utterly mistaken in attributing to most honourable conduct mr mainwaring smiled shook head smiled again sighed hoped mr vivian be right observed that time must show at event trusted mr vivian must keep profoundly secret hint friendship have indiscreetly perhaps hazarded scarcely have mr mainwaring retired when captain pickering met seized upon vivian led to same subject gave similar hint russell be happy rival who have secretly made master of lady julias heart vivian though much astonished finding that gentleman agreed in discovery suspicion still defended friend russell strongly protested that must be responsible for honour with life if be necessary captain shrugged shoulder said be none of business that a mr vivian took up so warmly must let drop for be by mean intention to get into quarrel with mr vivian for whom have particular regard said with frankness of soldier captain pickering withdrew adding a clergyman passed at instant there man who must tell more than of if must snug word with wicksted vivian in great anxiety much curiosity appealed to mr wicksted protested that knew nothing suspected nothing at least must venture to say nothing for be very delicate family matter gentleman must on occasion make principle to see with own eye gradually however mr wicksted let out opinion implied infinitely more than captain pickering mr mainwaring have asserted vivian still maintained in warmest term that be impossible friend russell must be to blame mr wicksted simply pronounced word friend with peculiar emphasis with incredulous smile left to reflection reflection be painful for though defended russell from attack of others yet have not sufficient firmness of mind completely to resist suggestion of suspicion jealousy particularly when have be corroborated by so many concurring testimony have no longer courage to go immediately to russell to tell of proposal for lady julia to speak to of of secret feeling turning away from staircase led to friend apartment determined to observe russell with own eye before must decide upon truth falsehood of accusation have be brought against ala vivian be longer in condition to observe with own eye imagination be so perturbed that must neither see hear thing a really be when next saw russell lady julia together wondered at blindness in not having sooner perceived mutual attachment notwithstanding that lady julia have now strongest motif to suppress indication of passion symptom of broke out continually more violent perhaps from endeavour to conceal knew that be passionately in love with russell that russell must not have perceived what other man even indifferent spectator have discovered appeared incredible russell calm manner entire self possession sometimes provoked vivian sometimes quelled suspicion sometimes looked upon calmness a extreme of art sometimes a proof of innocence must not be counterfeit at one moment be so much struck with russell friendly countenance that quite ashamed of suspicion be upon point of speaking openly to unfortunately intention be frustrated by slight obstacle at length miss strictland who have lately be very courteous to mr vivian took opportunity of drawing into one of recessed window where with infinite difficulty in bringing to speak on subject after inconceivable bridlings of head contortion of muscle of neck insinuated to fear that lord glistonburys confidence have be very ill placed in lord lidhursts tutor be aware that mr russell have honour of mr vivians friendship nothing must prevent from speaking where felt to be so much duty that a from unfortunate circumstance in family have no longer influence over lady julia lidhurst chance of being listened to on subject with patience by lord glistonbury thought best course must take be to apply to mr russell friend who might possibly by interference prevent utter disgrace ruin of one branch of noble family miss strictland in said hinted not at vivians attachment to lady julia gave reason to believe that be apprised of having proposed for ladyship spoke with much moderation candour attributed lady julias error to imprudence of new governess miss bateman miss strictland now showed desire not to make to prevent mischief even circumlocution stiffness of habitual prudery did not on occasion seem unseasonable therefore what suggested made great impression on vivian still however defended russell assured miss strictland that from long experience have have of friend honour be convinced that temptation must shake integrity miss strictland have formed opinion on point said must be in vain to argue against new assertion belief of new person who spoke to on subject combination coincidence of opinion wrought mind to height of jealousy that be now absolutely incapable of using reason went in search of russell in fit mood to speak to a ought looked for in own in lord lidhursts apartment in sitting room in castle mr russell be not to be found at last lady sarah maid who heard inquiring for mr russell from servant told fancied that if took trouble to go to west walk might find mr russell

stop cried advancing let not overhear secret be not traitor to friend a spoke eye fixed with expression of concentrated rage upon russell terrified by vivians sudden appearance strange address still more by fierce look cast on russell lady julia started uttered faint scream with astonishment without losing self command russell advanced towards vivian saying be out of sens dear friend will not listen to in present humour take turn two with to cool anger of friend must always be allowed three minute grace at least added russell smiling endeavouring to draw vivian away vivian stood immoveable russell calmness instead of bringing to sens only increased anger to distempered imagination coolness seemed perfidious dissimulation can not deceive longer mr russell by art cried though be last to open eye have opened why did pretend to be counsellor friend when be rival when knew that be successful rival yes start affect astonishment yes look if can with innocent surprise upon lady say that have not betrayed father confidence say that have not practised upon unguarded heart say that know that love to distraction oh mr vivian what have done cried lady julia must say no more fell senseless

russell russell made reply ran to river be near for water vivian be incapable of affording assistance even of forming distinct idea a soon a lady julia returned to sens russell withdrew vivian threw on knee before said something about violence of passion sorrow forgiveness mr vivian said lady julia turning to with mixture of despair dignity in manner kneel to make use of commonplace phrase can

follow have word two to say about something thats nothing to lord glistonbury kept vivian for full hour in state of considerable embarrassment talking to of lady julia implying that be favourably disposed towards that have little pride might make affect contrary at first then came disquisition on pride with quotation commonplace then eulogium by lordship on lordship own knowledge of human heart more especially of moving toyshop female heart then anecdote illustrative comprising gallantry of thirty year in various rank of life with suitable bon mot embellishment then little french sentiment by way of moral with philosophical axiom to show that though have led gay life have be deep thinker that though nobody must have thought that have have time for reading genius have supplied must not really tell how with what other people with study of year must not master vivian be compelled to hear whilst be whole time impatient to get away that might search for mr russell with whom be anxious to have explanation at last when lord glistonbury set free be not nearer to object mr russell found upon inquiry have not returned to castle did return to dinner sent word that be engaged to dine with party of gentleman at literary club in country town nine mile distant vivian spent greatest part of evening in lord lidhursts apartment expecting russell return grew so late that lord

yesterday because feared must not speak to with temper lest must misinterpret thing have formerly said must now solemnly assure that never have slightest suspicion of secret revealed to till moment when be betrayed by indiscretion still can scarcely credit what appears to so improbable even under uncertainty think duty to leave family have slightest idea of what suggested ever crossed imagination must then have acted a do now say not to justify to convince that what formerly hinted about reserve of manner prudence be merely general reflection for own part seem to act heroically must disclaim that applause to be not entitled all powerful a temptation must appear to dangerous a must have be in other circumstance to can not claim merit for resisting influence safety owe to own prudence fortitude must now vivian impart to secret be at liberty to confide where when think necessary heart be have long be engaged whilst be attached to miss sidney endeavoured to subdue love for symptom of be hope believe suppressed declaration can not now give pain except so far a may perhaps excite in mind remorse for having unwarrantably unworthily weakly suffered to feel suspicion of true friend well a know infirmity of character willing a have always be to make allowance for fault thought time experience must correct be not prepared for last stroke never thought weakness of mind must have shown in suspicion of best long tried friend be at last convinced that mind be not strong enough for confidence friendship pity see can no longer serve feel that can no longer esteem farewell vivian may find friend who will supply to place of h russell vivian knew russell character too well to flatter that latter part of letter be written in anger must quickly subside from tone of letter felt that russell be deeply offended in whole course of life have depended on russell friendship a solid blessing of must never be deprived by change of circumstance by possible chance in human affair now to have lost friend by own folly by own weakness be misfortune of must hardly believe reality at same moment too learned how nobly russell have behaved towards in most trying situation in human heart can be placed russell love for selina sidney vivian have never till instant suspected what force what command of mind what magnanimity what generous friend have ever be to poor vivian always sinning always penitent be so much absorbed by sorrow for loss of russell friendship that must not for time think even of interest of love consider advantage might derive from absence of rival from rival explicit declaration that affection be irrevocably engaged by degree idea rose clearly to vivians view hope revived lady julia must see absolute impossibility of russell returning of accepting affection good sense pride must in time subdue hopeless passion vivian be generous enough sufficiently in love to feel that value of heart must not be diminished rather increased in opinion by sensibility have shown to talent virtue of friend friend vivian ventured now to call for with hope of love hope of friendship rose may yet be well said to russell will forgive when hears how be worked upon by parasite prudish busybody who infused vile suspicion into mind weak a be never will allow that be incapable of confidence of friendship russell will retract that harsh sentence when be happy a be sure ardently hope will be in selinas love will restore to favour without friendship must not be satisfied with happy in full accomplishment of other fondest hope by time that hope have thus

remark can never be known to world for lord glistonbury so startled by loud rather angry tone in called for cream stood with captain that few idea be put to flight mr pickering who noticed lord glistonburys displeasure now resumed conversation about mr russell in new tone lawyer joined in eulogy upon gentleman lord glistonbury said not word looked embarrassed miss strictland cleared throat several time looked infinitely more rigid mysterious than usual lady glistonbury lady sarah ditto ditto almost body except such visitor a be stranger at castle perceived that there be something extraordinary going on in family gloom constraint spread so towards close of breakfast nothing be uttered by prudent people awkward sentence about weather wind likelihood of there being mail from continent still through regardless unknowing of rosamunda talked on happily abstracted egotistically secured from pain of sympathy of curiosity by sufficient power of vanity even patron lord glistonbury be at last provoked disgusted be heard under breath to pronounce contemptuous pshaw a rose from breakfast table whispered to vivian there woman now who think of nothing living talke talke begin to be weary of gentleman continued lordship ive letter to write morning youll ride youll walk youre for billiard room suppose mr vivian will find in study hope hour hence first have little

leave glistonbury thus must relieve whole family from embarrassment of presence by immediate change of scene of occupation have best chance of recovering from own disappointment if lady julia be to quit castle must have inducement to stay if ladyship remained continuing in society must be still more dangerous to happiness besides felt offended with lord glistonbury who evidently have wished to conceal from truth without considering what be just honourable have endeavoured to secure at event establishment for daughter connexion for family to weight of reason must be added desire to see mr russell to effect reconciliation with accumulated force of motif have power to overcome vivians habitual indecision servant be surprised by order to have thing ready for journey to town immediately

explained reason lord glistonbury must not allow weight entreated insisted that must stay at least few day longer for going just at moment must seem quite like break up in family must be most unfriendly cruel thing imaginable why lord glistonbury so earnestly pressed stay perhaps even lordship did not exactly know for with air of being person of infinite address depth of design lordship be in reality childishly inconsistent what french call inconsquent on subject great small where once took into head a called made point that thing must be so so be a peremptory where must not be peremptory a anxious a if be matter of life death in view there be perspective keeping object appeared of equal magnitude even now when might be conceived that whole mind be intent upon great family

vivian who have felt oppressed almost enslaved by compassion breathed more freely when at last found in carriage driving away from glistonbury own castle preparation for mother arrival for expected canvas occupied so much for ensuing day that have scarcely time to think of lady julia of lady sarah of russell selina must neither reflect on past anticipate future present vulgar present full of upholsterer paper hanger butler groom tenant freeholder parasite pressed upon attention with importunate claim dissolution of parliament took place lady mary vivian arrived almost a soon a newspaper brought intelligence with came new set of thought centering in notion of son consequence in world of happiness idea be too firmly associated in mind ever to be separated said that have regretted having made long stay in country during last session because have missed opportunity of distinguishing farther in parliament preceding session ladyship have received gratifying compliment on son talent on figure have already made in public life felt self love a well a affection interested in continuing political career with spirit success a to present election observed there must be little doubt that must be re elected with assistance of glistonbury interest added ladyship smiling significantly fancy interest be pretty strong in quarter world have given by turn to lady julia lady sarah lidhurst be asked continually of lady lidhursts be in love with one of lady certainly must be daughter in law pray if know empower to say lady mary vivian spoke half in earnest till extraordinary commotion word created in son convinced that report have not now at least be mistaken next to miss selina sidney continued lady mary who after positive long persisted in refusal be quite out of question have dear son always wished to see married to one of lady lidhursts of course lady julias talent beauty youth vivian interrupted hastily told mother that lady julia lidhurst be a much out of question a miss sidney must be for have offered have be refused that have reason to believe that determination of second mistress against must be at least a absolute unconquerable a of first mother be in amazement that son must be refused by lady julia lidhurst appeared moral political impossibility especially when desire for connexion between family have be so obvious on side of glistonburys what must be meaning of lady julia be perhaps under error fancied be way engaged to miss sidney perhaps said lady mary who have ready wit for invention of delicate distress perhaps there be difficulty about eldest sister lady sarah for know first winter be given to ay must be case will go to glistonbury to morrow will have lady julia to myself for five minute think have penetration will know truth lady mary be again surprised by hearing from son that lady julia be not at glistonbury that be gone with brother into devonshire so there be dead silence for minute succeeded by exclamation from lady mary there be grand secret here must know ladyship forthwith commenced close able cross examination vivian stopped at last by declaring that be not at liberty to speak upon subject knew said that mother be of too honourable generous temper to press farther mother be perfectly honourable at same time extremely curious though continually repeated will not ask question must not upon account lead to say syllable must betray confidence reposed in dear son yet indulged in variety of ingenious conjecture know be so be sure have guessed now dont ask to tell do right to deny amongst variety of conjecture lady mary did not find out truth be prepossessed by idea russell be attached to selina sidney secret own penetration have discovered whilst son be abroad with mr wharton thought mortal living knew pre occupied with notion russell be now omitted in combination having quitted glistonbury did not create suspicion of real cause of sudden departure because there be sufficient reason for going to north to see sick relation lady mary be too good philosopher to assign two cause for same event when have found one be adequate to production of effect therefore quietly settled in imagination that lady julia lidhurst be going to be married immediately to certain young nobleman who have be lately at glistonbury whilst be acting play next day went with vivian to glistonbury castle for waiving ceremonial of visiting be anxious to see poor lady glistonbury of whose illness have be apprised in general term by son impulse of curiosity mixed perhaps with motif of regard for good friend lady glistonbury hastened visit found lady glistonbury much better looked nearly a well a have done before stroke have now recovered memory full use of understanding vivian observed that lady sarah be convinced by lady mary vivians curiosity that have given hint of thing did not wish to be known pleasurable consciousness of integrity disposed to be pleased with lord glistonbury on side be convinced that vivian have behaved honourably with respect to daughter julia so party be well satisfied with other lordship answered lady mary vivians inquiry after son daughter julia by saying that miss strictland have just returned to glistonbury with rather more favourable account of lord lidhursts health that julia be now at brother bishop of s between brother lord glistonbury there have never be great intimacy character politics being very different moment lady mary vivian heard lord glistonbury pronounce with such unusual cordiality word brother bishop recollected that bishop have very amiable accomplished remarkably handsome son so arranged directly in imagination that be person to whom lady julia be engaged being now thoroughly convinced that last conjecture be just thought no more about lady julias affair turned attention to lady sarah whose cold guarded manner however resisted utmost penetration disappointed in attempt to lead to sentiment love conversation at last ran wholly upon approaching election upon canvas strength of various interest of county on subject lady sarah showed surprisingly exact information presently lord glistonbury took vivian with to study to examine poll book then put into hand letter from lady julia lidhurst have be enclosed in one to told intended to rusticate julia said lordship with poor parson wife relation distant relation of ours in devonshire plan have be defeated by foolish good brother bishop on journey passed close by palace charged miss strictland to be incog stayed to rest in town for lidhurst be fatigued of bishop people found out bishop sent for at last came be so sorry for lidhursts illness a miss strictland say so much charmed with julia whom have not seen since be child that absolutely took possession of julia have made party good with for writes word can not part with must allow to remain with that will take possible care of lyndhursts health believe must yield point to bishop for altogether look better that julia must be at palace than at parsonage though poor brother have not knowledge of world one must wish be necessary to bring romantic girl back to reason yet keep from reading letter see be impatient hey very natural be afraid in vain ill leave in peace at rate added lord glistonbury know have always stood firm friend in business know im discreet vivian never felt so grateful for instance of lordship friendship discretion a for gave at moment by quitting room leaving in peace to read letter chapter xiii before open letter will have heard probably that uncle bishop of have taken under protection can not sufficiently regret be not few year few month sooner blessed with mentor never till now knew how much power kindness have to touch mind in moment of distress did ever till now feel how deeply eloquence of true piety sink into heart excellent friend will hope in time restore to better self from abstraction selfishness of passion think be already somewhat recovered after being wholly absorbed by one sentiment begin to feel again influence of other motif to waken to returning sense of social duty among first object to in recovering from trance fever of soul have power to turn attention happiness sir next to of own nearest relation find interest most after giving assurance trust will believe that to insure felicity even to restore health preserve life of relation friend have upon earth must not think justified in attempting to influence mind to thing did not sincerely firmly believe must be for permanent advantage a well a for theirs under solemn faith of declaration hope that will listen to with patience confidence from have seen from have heard of character be convinced that wife must be woman of disposition precisely opposite in many respect to mine character be liable to vary according to situation in be placed be subject to sudden transient impression from external circumstance have hitherto have friend who have regulated fluctuation of passion now that be separated from how much will feel loss of cool steady judgment must not therefore in bosom friend wife look for certain firmness stability of character capable of resisting rather than disposed to yield to sudden impulse character not of enthusiasm of duty mind instead of increasing by example sympathy defect of own pardon expression must correct compensate by opposite quality supposing that with such sobriety strength of character a have described there must be connected certain slowness formality coldness of manner might not at first be attractive to man of vivacity let not repel when once have learned to consider manner a concomitant indication of quality essential to happiness must be persuaded become agreeable to especially a on nearer observation must soon discover beneath that external coldness under snow ice there be accumulated concentrated warmth of affection of sir must lately have seen example in own family at moment when poor mother be struck with palsy saw sister energy character probably then appeared to in new point of view from burst of latent affection for parent may form idea what power of passion of love must be in soul idea say for be persuaded that none who know a well a do can form adequate notion of strength of attachment of be capable will be surprised perhaps sir to hear reason so coolly for others on subject where have acted so rashly for may feel inclination to listen to advice of one who have shown so little prudence in own affair therefore having stated reason suggested conclusion leave to apply a think proper will only add that accomplishment of wish on subject must give peculiar satisfaction must relieve mind from part of weight of self reproach have made parent unhappy have reason to fear that shock mother received by mean contributed much to late illness event must restore whole family to happiness must therefore be to most desirable upon earth must feel immediate relief delight even in hope of contributing to by influence can have over mind independently of pleasure pride must feel in securing sister happiness yours must enjoy true satisfaction sir in intimate friendship with only tie of such near relationship must permit justify will accept of assurance instead of trite insulting because unmeaning unsafe offer of friendship lady sometimes make to who have be lover julia lidhurst palace at first reading of letter vivian felt nothing renewal of regret for having lost chance of obtaining affection of person by whom be written on second perusal be moved by earnest expression of wish for happiness desire to gratify on point on be so anxious influenced much more than of argument good sense letter contained be lost upon sentiment operated with full force yet not with sufficient power to conquer repugnance still felt to lady sarah person manner lord glistonbury made inquiry concerning content of daughter julias letter a far a politeness must permit examined vivians countenance when returned to drawing room lady glistonburys manner be a calm a usual slight shake of head be sufficient indication of internal feeling lady sarah looked pale so perfectly composed that vivian be convinced at least knew nothing of sister letter so great indeed be outward composure so immoveable be lady sarah that provoked lady mary past endurance a drove home in evening exclaimed never saw such young woman a lady sarah lidhurst be stick stone statue have completely satisfied mind on one point own that when found lady julia be out of question did begin to think wish lady sarah might be daughter in law because have really be so carefully brought up connexion with glistonbury family be so desirable then have notion before saw morning that girl liked might be really capable of attachment now indeed be convinced of folly of notion have feeling none upon earth scarcely common sense think of nothing how hold elbow formality importance with went on cutting off end of worsted from frightful tapestry work whilst talked of quite put out of manner of patience have feeling none upon earth oh maam said vivian do injustice certainly have feeling for mother ay for mother may be kind of mechanical affection maam if have seen at time that mother be struck with palsy much to own surprise vivian found engaged in defence almost in eulogium upon lady sarah injustice of mother attack on point be knew so great that must not join in lady mary invective why dear charles said do recollect on very road a be returning from glistonbury castle time two year called lady sarah petrifaction yes maam because did not know then well dear must have time to analyze more carefully suppose will discover a have done that be not petrifaction so then lady sarah really be to be woman after be content absolutely can not pretend to like like connexion however rest be affair havent proposed yet bless maam god forbid how fast imagination go dear mother be there difference between saying that woman be not petrifaction being in love with in love never said word about being in love know thats impossible asked only if have proposed for dear maam lady mary expressed satisfaction perhaps injustice with continued for day to asperse lady sarah lidhurst a being unfeeling served more in vivians opinion than other mode in must have spoken of ladyship still felt glad that have not yet proposed have not courage either to recede advance circumstance went on carried along with without bringing to decision business of election proceeded day lord glistonbury be with be at glistonbury castle hour saw more plainly expectation be formed sometimes felt that be inevitably doomed to fulfil at other time cherished hope that lady julia must soon return home that by fortunate revolution might yet be have not now advantage of russell firmness to support in emergency russell answer to letter be so coolly determined so absolutely declined interfering farther in affair that vivian saw hope of regaining friendship of benefiting by counsel thus be vivian in helplessness horror of indecision when event took place materially changed face of affair in glistonbury family just at time when account of health be most favourable when friend be deceived by most sanguine hope of recovery lord lidhurst died mother be only person in family who be prepared for catastrophe dreaded to communicate intelligence to lest must bring on attack of dreadful malady to astonishment heard with calm resignation said have long foreseen calamity that submitted to will of heaven after pity for parent who lost amiable promising young man heir to large fortune to splendid title people began to consider what change must be made in condition of rest of family lady lidhursts from being very small fortune became heiress to large estate earldom of glistonbury be to devolve to nephew of lord glistonbury in case lady lidhursts must not marry must not have heir male in case must marry title be to go to first son circumstance be of course soon known talked of in neighbourhood many congratulated vivian upon great accession of fortune upon high expectation of lady to whom supposed engaged on first visit vivian mother paid after death of lord lidhurst at glistonbury castle found there young man very handsome of dark reserved countenance whose physiognomy manner immediately prepossessed against on part seemed to eye with suspicion to be particularly uneasy whenever vivian mentioned election approached lady sarah young man be mr lidhurst lord glistonburys nephew heir at law be obvious almost at first sight that uncle disliked nephew be not so easy to perceive that nephew despised uncle mr lidhurst though young be excellent politician feeling be always regulated by interest have more ability than lord glistonbury vanity infinitely more ambition in lord glistonbury ambition be rather affected a air suited to rank proper to increase consequence mr lidhursts be earnest inordinate ambition yet be cold silent calculating pride preyed upon inwardly never hurried into saying doing extravagant thing who be not actuated solely by ambition always looked upon a fool who be considered in general a knave one marked a dupe other a rival have be at bishop of s during lord lidhursts illness at time of death ever since lady julias arrival at bishop have foreseen probability of event have in consequence of long sightedness of view endeavoured to make agreeable to found impossible be however easily consoled by hearing that have resolved never to marry only hoped that must keep resolution be now at glistonbury castle in determination to propose for other cousin lady sarah who must perhaps equally well secure to object well dear vivian said lord glistonbury drawing aside how dye relish nephew marmaduke lidhurst need not be afraid to speak truth for tell at once that be particular favourite here not en bonne odeur thats only between think that dont know that considers a willow fellow because havent head crammed with parcel of statistical table fiscal financiering stuff have at calculating finger end trust be almost a good politician a be im free to believe have rather more knowledge of world in men not book experienced be lord hey hey vivian can see through with eye can tell want to get lady sarah yes yes never came near till lost poor boy wont win lady sarah im much mistaken did observe how jealous be of right right have penetration stay stay dont know marmaduke yet dont know scheme how brow clouded when be talking of election must hint to have be sounding upon matter have great mind to stand for county talk of starting at first day of poll told must not do a be engaged to answered that of course be only conditional promise in case none of own relation stood fought shy pressed confoundedly gad must put in very awkward predicament if be really to stand for know what world must say if saw opposing own nephew rising young man not for relation marmaduke lidhurst be just deep fellow to plan thing execute not caring at what whose expense can tell however be not man to be bullied out of interest to be outwitted stand firm vivian good friend ill stand by depend on only wish here lordship paused can not say more to now for here be precious heir at law coming to break up confederacy ill ride over see to morrow now let be mute before marmaduke master politician a becomes hey vivian hey notwithstanding sort of jealousy of marmaduke bravadoing style in lord glistonbury spoke of spoke to in very different manner be apparent to vivian that lordship be under awe of nephew whilst cherished secret dislike dreaded coming to open rupture with man who be a lordship apprehended so well able to make own party good in world when marmaduke did emerge from depth of thought in generally seemed to be sunk when did condescend to converse rather to speak theme be always of person in power sarcasm against who never must obtain from one thing asserted must never be proved from said might be inferred that valued human quality talent merely a must must not obtain price in political market power of speaking in public a be mean in england of acquiring other specie of power deemed first of heaven gift successful parliamentary speaker be only person of whom expressed admiration a vivian have spoken have be listened to in house of common be in respect object of marmaduke lidhursts envy envy be mitigated by contempt for hero want of perseverance in ambition there be that mr vivian of yours said to uncle whilst vivian be gone to talk to lady youll find will be woman man after heaven with fluency in public what must have done by time of day poor fellow have consistency of ambition great view reach of mind put in for borough must be just a well content a if carried county youll see will after session two cut out retire without pension settle down into mere honest country gentleman must be connexion to increase consequence of family lady sarah lidhurst must be quite lost with nobody ladyship be convinced have too much discrimination value too highly to make such missy match lord glistonbury coughed cleared throat blew nose seemed to suffer extremely chiefly under repression of usual loquacity nothing must be at once greater proof of respect for nephew ability of lordship dislike to than unnatural silence mr lidhursts compliment on lady sarah discrimination seemed however to be premature unmerited for during course of day treated vast effort of cousin marmadukes gallantry with haughty neglect showed what have never before suffered to be visible in manner marked preference for mr vivians conversation sort of emulation mr lidhursts rivalship produced increased value of object for whom there be contention immediately became prize vivian be provoked amused by alternate contempt jealousy mr lidhurst betrayed gentleman desire to keep out of glistonbury family to supplant in lady sarah favour piqued to prove influence determined to maintain ground insensibly vivians attention to lady became more vivacious be vain of showing ease taste elegance of gallantry be flattered by idea that spectator perceived superiority success lady sarah whose manner have much improved since departure of miss strictland be so much embellished by hero attention that thought quite charming have be prepared to expect fire under ice be agreeably surprised by sudden spring of flower from beneath snow carriage be at door in evening have waited hour before be aware that be time to depart be right dear son lady mary began r moment be seated in carriage be quite right be quite wrong about lady sarah lidhurst have feeling indeed strong generous feeling show at proper time fine decided character manner to day so easy countenance so animated really looked quite handsome think charming woman what change love can make well now be satisfied be what always wished connexion family fortune thing very sort of character require in wife very person of others be suited to if be little more like sister selina sidney even said vivian with sigh very word even saying like selina sidney even show that have not much cause for sighing for see how quickly mere fancy in matter change may love lady sarah presently a much a loved even lady julia impossible maam impossible why dear charles astonish for can not see view expectation of family of young lady attention to day be such a must bear one construction be maam be not aware of at time be did not mean to engage good heaven surely be not engaged know man be not bound like woman by few foolish word compliment gallantry be not such serious thing with men men never consider engaged to woman till make absolute proposal know be common maxim with young men of present day consider a dishonourable base very sorry must be to see adopted by son cried lady mary indignantly ask friend mr russell opinion on point long ago told know did that if have not serious thought of lady sarah lidhurst must do very wrong after report have gone abroad to continue intimacy with glistonburys thus to deceive whole family only appeal to mr russell will ask friend russell opinion vivian sighed again deeply for loss of friend russell a must not without touching upon lady julias affair explain cause of coolness between friend answered only that appeal to mr russell be unnecessary when have mother opinion lady mary wish for glistonbury connexion fortified morality at moment replied then decided opinion be that must be immoral dishonourable action to break such tacit engagement a have voluntarily contracted absolutely must not break without destroying peace happiness of whole family even that cold lady glistonbury grew quite warm to day must see cause in lady glistonburys state of health who must answer for consequence of disappointment about favourite daughter just after loss of son too no more mother for heaven sake see feel must marry lady sarah then by what fatality be doomed be forced to marry woman whom can not love whose person manner be peculiarly disagreeable to when im half in love with woman must be shocking thing indeed said lady mary retracting alarmed for now train of association be wakened judged not by worldly by romantic system be sure must not upon account urge to act against feeling must not be responsible for such marriage if be really in love with sister if lady sarah person manner be peculiarly absolutely disagreeable to must do very wicked action must destroy son happiness moral perhaps by insisting on marriage heaven forbid silence of mile half long ensued charles after saw to day how can believe that lady sarah be so disagreeable to maam happened not to be absolutely disagreeable to to day oh well then may not happen to be disagreeable to to morrow next day ever again a to fancy for sister when hope be over know love soon dy of so ended conversation next morning at unusual hour lord glistonbury made appearance at castle vivian with air of great vexation embarrassment endeavoured to speak of trivial topic one after subject dropped then lady mary who saw that be anxious to speak to son soon took occasion to withdraw not without feeling curiosity forming many conjecture a to object lordship might have in view in conference lord glistonburys countenance exhibited in quick alternation look of absolute determination of utter indecision at length with abrupt effort said vivian have seen paper to day newspaper yes be on table did not look at be there thing extraordinary yes faith extraordinary very extraordinary be not here be not there be not right paper be not in paper thats extraordinary too then feeling in pocket be fool not to bring with may be have yes here be not public news private vivian be expectation for imagined that something about lady julia be coming lord glistonbury who in commerce with public men have learned art of paying in word to gain time when in danger of bankruptcy of idea went on stringing sentence together without much meaning whilst be collecting thought studying countenance of auditor recollect suggestion last time have honour of speaking to on particular subject confess mr lidhursts conduct doe not meet idea of propriety other person be free to form what judgment think fit upon occasion will submit matter to mr vivian feeling called upon to come forward immediately to explain to satisfaction fear to commit by stating at once sentiment light in strike for there must be decision shown somehow other on side other decision be in in public business a great bacon somebody say nobody know that better than marmaduke here lordship grew warm quitting parliamentary cant assumed familiar style gad have stolen march upon out generalled in private opinion not in handsomest style possible hey vivian hey dear lord have not heard fact yet said vivian oh fact be simply look here have without encouragement concurrence indeed a

useful to prevent imprudent match seldom happens that marriage turn out happily have be made from opinion of others rather than from judgment inclination of party concerned for let general reason on advice be grounded be ever so sensible be scarcely possible that adviser can take in little circumstance of taste temper upon so much of happiness misery of domestic life depends besides people be much more apt to repent of having be guided by judgment of than of having followed own be most likely to be case with weakest mind strong mind can decide for not by opinion by reason be laid before weak mind be influenced merely by opinion never before after decision be firm in abiding by preponderating reason letter intelligence from home except malicious hint now then from cousin marmaduke did not credit gave reason to suspect that pair whom have contributed to unite be not perfectly happy so lady julia exulted in success of past counsel indulged generous romantic disposition in scheme for forwarding union between russell selina determining to divide fortune amongst child of friend concluded one of letter to lady sarah vivian about time with word must see one other person whom must not name rewarded for virtue a be by happy love must die content must write on tomb je ne fus point heureux mais jai fait leur bonheur far removed from romance generosity of sentiment lord glistonbury in mean time went on very comfortably without observing thing passed in family uneasiness obtruded upon attention attributed to one cause anxiety relative to question on present thought be exclusively fixed viz whether lady sarah first child must be boy girl heaven grant boy said lordship for then know there end of marmaduke a heir at law whenever lordship saw cloud on brow of lady mary of lady sarah of vivian have one infallible charm for dispelling melancholy stepped up close to patient whispered will be boy life upon will be boy sometimes happened that universal remedy applied at random made patient start smile then lordship never failed to add with nod of great sagacity ah didnt know knew what be thinking of well well youll see will cut out marmaduke yet with hope of cutting out marmaduke lord glistonbury went on very happily day grew fonder of son in law who be enemy of heir at law whom considered a such easiness of vivians temper be peculiarly agreeable to lordship who enjoyed daily pleasure of governing man of talent be far superior to own easiness of temper in hero be much increased by want of motive stimulus thought that have now lost chance of happiness cared little for more le pain of succeeding day so passive be listlessness that to superficial observer like lord glistonbury looked like good nature of perfect content poor vivian in wreck of happiness one saving chance however yet remained have still public character be conscious of having preserved unblemished integrity a member of senate integrity still more than oratorical talent raised far above most of competitor preserved not only in opinion of others in own when parliament met went to town took very handsome house for lady sarah determining to do must to oblige please wife whom must not love lady sarah have complete power at home abroad of time expense dress equipage servant whole establishment be above vivians fortune equal to ladyship birth rank be mistress of thing of heart le liked more endeavoured to compensate for involuntary fault by allowing that absolute dominion that external splendour thought must gratify perhaps fill mind a for took refuge in house of common there forgot for time domestic uneasiness be truly animated by what so many affect zeal for good of country be proud to recollect that profligate wharton have failed in attempt to laugh out of public virtue be proud that wharton prophecy of apostasy have never be accomplished that a public character at least have fulfilled promise of early youth be still worthy of of friend whom have lost clung to idea a to only hope left in life one night in debate on question of importance made excellent speech be particularly well received by house because came from one who have unblemished character when vivian went into coffee room to refresh after have done speaking several of acquaintance crowded round complimenting upon success broke from for saw advancing towards with smile of approbation friend on whose approbation set higher value than did even on applause of house friend whose lost affection have so long so bitterly regretted russell stretched out hand vivian eagerly seized before have of spoken one word understood other perfectly reconciliation be completely effected yes said russell a walked out arm in arm together yes be fit must forget private resentment in pride pleasure feel not merely in public success in public virtue talent even rare talent of oratory know hold cheap in comparison with be so far more rare a well a more valuable political integrity abhorrence contempt of political profligacy have just expressed a member of senate consistent conduct by have supported principle be worthy of allow to say of education vivian felt exalted in own opinion by such praise by warmest expression have ever received of russell regard forgot even domestic uneasiness day first for many month have spent happily passed with friend supped together related mutually happened since parting russell told vivian that have lately be agreeably surprised by gift of valuable living from bishop of lady julia lidhursts uncle that bishop whom have till then never seen have written to in handsomest manner saying that knew obligation family owed to mr russell that have be dying request of nephew lord lidhurst that token of family esteem gratitude must be offered to to whom owed so much bishop added that family gratitude private friendship must have induced to bestow church preferment upon person whose character best entitled to distinction trust letter a vivian observed be well calculated to satisfy russell conscience delicacy conversation next turned upon lady julia lidhurst russell be not aware that vivian knew more of attachment to than what have be discovered day before left glistonbury vivian must not help admiring honourable delicate manner in friend spoke of without air of mystery with greatest respect told vivian have heard that proposal have be lately made to ladyship by gentleman of great talent of high character that have positively declined address have repeated declaration that must never marry good uncle left on point entirely at liberty did not mention proposal to lord glistonbury lest must be exposed to fresh difficulty russell expressed much satisfaction at part of bishop conduct a being not only most kind most judicious most likely to dispose niece to change determination repeated opinion united to man of sense strength of mind must make charming excellent wife vivian agreed with yet observed that be convinced must never marry there paused must lady julia have overheard conversation afterwards passed between two gentleman one of whom have loved other of whom have refused not word must have hurt feeling on contrary must have be raised in own opinion gratified by strong interest showed for happiness regretted only that young woman of such talent of such fine generous disposition have be so injudiciously educated now dear russell cried vivian that have finished chapter of lady julia let talk of miss sidney russell change of countenance showed that be not quite so easy for to talk upon subject to spare effort vivian resumed a be rich man now dear russell will certainly marry know added smiling that miss sidney will be wife if ever man deserved prize do will be first to wish joy stay good friend interrupted russell kindness for imagination be too quick in anticipation of happiness russell then told that never have declared attachment to selina till vivians marriage have put end to probability of rivalship with friend have expressed high esteem for russell have told that have suffered so much from first unfortunate attachment that felt averse from new engagement will assure a assured just now with regard to lady julia said vivian that miss sidney will prevailed upon to alter determination will add that though must like lady julia le must like selina better for changing mind went on generously expressing sincere hope that friend might obtain selina sidney affection might enjoy that domestic happiness vivian be going to say have forfeited checking regret only said that domestic happiness consider a summit of human felicity man can deserve better than do dear russell russell easily guessed that poor vivian have not attained summit of human felicity by own marriage never adverted to of conversation have held about lady sarah lidhurst never recalled of vivians vehement declaration concerning absolute impossibility of making such match never evinced least surprise at marriage inquired how have conquered passion for lady julia with friendly forgetfulness seemed to have totally obliterated from mind that must do good to remember vivian be sensible of delicacy grateful for to imitate russell reserve silence upon certain subject required force forbearance of be not capable at first have determined not to say one word to russell of domestic uneasiness have not be many hour together before vivian poured forth complaint confessed how bitterly repented marriage be declared that have be persuaded by united effort of family of mother against own judgment at least against taste inclination to marry lady sarah by persuasion by motif choice be decided interrupted russell reflect that be decided for life therefore abide by justify above make happy with mean be yet in power instead of wasting mind in unavailing regret be united to woman who have estimable quality a candidly acknowledge there be particular in doe not please taste withdraw attention from will be happy with wife who be so firmly attached to consider besides romance apart love though delightful passion be not only resource man of sense virtue activity may find for happiness public duty success reputation a public character will russell be interrupted in consolatory invigorating speech by entrance of servant of lord glistonburys who brought note from lordship to mr vivian requesting to see a soon a must make convenient to come to glistonbury house a lordship wanted to speak to on particular business of greatest importance vivian be provoked by being thus summoned away from friend to attend to one of what called lord glistonburys important mystery about nothing russell be engaged to go into country ensuing day to take possession of new living promised that must see again soon with hope two friend parted vivian went to lord glistonburys found lordship in study where have be vivian exclaimed have sent messenger after messenger to look for half over town thought be to have dined with ran away nobody must tell where with whom have be waiting for at cabinet council here with utmost impatience vivian answered that have unexpectedly met with friend russell be proceeding to tell lordship how handsomely bishop of have provided for friend lord glistonbury like many other great men having habit of forgetting service of from whom have nothing more to expect cut short vivians narration by exclaiming true true well well thats over now certainly that russell did duty by poor son acted a ought to do in thing im glad to hear brother have given good living hope a say will soon be married so best so best know vivian for reason of own well well im glad be provided for not what that living must have be of essential service if have be reserved for friend of mine brother bishop never can enter into political view might a well not have brother bishop however mr russell friend of yours be not regretting not so rude to to regret on contrary rejoice particularly a mr russell be man of so much merit thats over now want to talk to upon quite matter know have always said must sooner later succeed in grand object hey vivian lordship grand object be not sure that know oh surely know grand object son in law forget grand object marquisate know marquisate marquisate did not always tell must make government sooner later change earldom into marquisate well thing be done be a good a done have sent to treat with upon own term give joy dear lord said vivian joy to be sure do sober sir one must think have concern interest in business joy to be sure give joy can tell must give something more than joy must give support how look continued lord glistonbury a if did not know what be meant by support vivian did never hear of parliamentary support hope dear lord replied vivian gravely that have not entered into engagement made promise for can not have in power to perform lord glistonbury hesitated in confusion then forcing look of effrontery in assured tone replied have not made engagement promise for can not perform vivian be clear have not right to expect son in law will confirm with alacrity what have engaged what have promised for lord said vivian earnestly only dear boy said lord glistonbury assuming facetious tone only that will be always one of be not one of son in law deuce be in if be not one of in short know to be serious party must go together be family party must go together if ministry do business of course do theirs if have marquisate have vote not vote pardon lord vote can not be bartered in manner know mr vivian know be for interest a much a for mine for know marquisate will probably descend in due course of time to son so interest be full a much concerned a mine besides let tell have not forgotten immediate interest have stipulated that must have valuable place mr c be to have have russell have said of public virtue be fresh in hero mind thank dear lord said for be sure be kindly intended be not one of person who in public affair think only of private interest be not thinking of interest if man maintains certain public measure one day next for valuable consideration support diametrically opposite opinion measure will lose deserve to lose reputation for integrity integrity political integrity said lord glistonbury fine word mean nothing behind scene a be now vivian what use can there be in talking in strain between know be nonsense for who of party now think really truly of thing getting power keeping power know stand for measure of talent thing else worth having be included in word power speak plainly a honour be merely affair of opinion opinion again affair of number a there be number enough to keep one in countenance in thing really dear vivian be quite childish quite boyish smell of lamp to declaim about political integrity be not language of man who know thing of business thing of world why do say cried lord glistonbury checking assuming air of more reserved displeasure mr vivian certainly know a well a do know how nephew marmaduke who with fault be fool must interpret present language must say a have often heard say that political integrity be only civil put off political integrity only civil put off repeated vivian with unfeigned astonishment when formerly heard similar sentiment from avowed profligate hackneyed politician mr wharton be shocked to hear repeated a being coolly laid down by so young man a mr lidhurst excited so much disgust contempt in vivians mind that must hardly refrain from saying more than prudence politeness must justify now be free to confess pursued lord glistonbury must think more candid manly will add more friendly more natural open conduct of son in law to father in law instead of talking of political integrity to have said at once can not oblige in instance surely lord can not be in earnest said vivian tell sir be in earnest cried lordship turning suddenly in rage a walked up down room say must have be more candid more manly more thing much more like son in law much much be sure if have known a much a do now sir never must have be son in law never never seen lady sarah in grave first must must yes sir must be last person upon earth must have expected from have nephew have nephew now know difference man can distinguish friend till try vivian in vain endeavoured to appease lord glistonbury by assurance that must do thing in power to oblige except what considered a dishonourable lordship reiterated with diver passionate ejaculation that if vivian must not oblige in point on have set heart where great object of life be at stake must never believe have regard for that in short must come to open rupture between for that must never consider more a son having uttered denunciation a distinctly a passion must permit lord glistonbury retired to rest vivian went immediately to mother to tell what have passed felt almost secure of approbation though praised for generous spirit of independence be evident hope that title of marquis might descend to grandson of own weighed more with than patriotic consideration declared that indeed must not for title thing upon earth have son act dishonourably what be asked of a far a must understand be only such change of party such compliance a public man in place must make though must not have like must name corrupt tool of government yet on other hand be folly to expect that alone must do thing against general tide of corruption that must be madness in to sacrifice entirely without slightest possibility of doing good to country vivian interrupted to represent that if public man argued in manner nothing must ever be accomplished for public good on contrary if man hoped that something might be done even by individual exertion if determined to sacrifice portion of private interest in attempt perhaps much might be effected very likely lady mary said confessed knew little of politics so from argument went to persuasion entreaty conjured not to quarrel with glistonburys not to provoke lord glistonburys displeasure see artful marmadukes scheme said know uncle pertinacious temper hope that notion of patriotism will prevent from yielding on point on uncle have set heart marmaduke will know how to take advantage of believe vivian be shaken in resolution by mother entreaty by idea of family quarrel must ensue of difficulty in might be involved if persisted in generous determination dear son resumed must be absolute madness to refuse place be now offered only consider situation of affair consider beseech distress will be in by by if reject offer recollect immense demand upon recollect that heap of bill for election for building poor workman about castle that coachmaker too remember purchase money of house in town must be paid in three month only possible mean by can get out of debt be by accepting place must put at ease at once enable to continue in style of life to have of late be accustomed a to must alter style of life must do thing cried vivian to pay debt preserve independence will alter mode of living retrench decidedly vigorously well dear son admire spirit if can do will certainly be best fear that when come to trial will not be able to persevere will will believe have resolution enough for do injustice said vivian dear charles do justice for doubt resolution a far a own privation be concerned consider wife consider lady sarah consider luxury in have always be accustomed to live high sphere in relation move how pride must be hurt by looking down upon have doubt lady sarah must do duty make sacrifice for husband if be must now speak plainly if be passionately fond of for love husband must with honour propriety accept of such sacrifice what must retirement be to poor lady sarah with lady sarah vivian told mother that must take night to reconsider matter coolly satisfied with having gained so much suffered to go home a be quitting own dressing room paused to consider whether must consult wife who be a yet in ignorance of whole transaction who knew nothing of deranged state of affair did justice to believe that must be willing to live with in retirement to forego luxury pride of rank for sake of duty of love be convinced that in opposition between father interest husband honour must strongly abide by husband recollected lady julia have said of advantage that sister firmness of mind might be in steadying vacillating temper in moment of trial here be first great occasion since marriage where wife strength of mind must be of essential service to yet hesitated whether must avail of advantage moment a approached nearer to apartment hesitated more more did not in first place like to humble so far a to ask counsel then have not courage to confess debt embarrassment have hitherto concealed that mother have suggested about indelicacy of requiring accepting great sacrifice from woman whom though esteemed must not love horror of retirement with companion long year tte tte idea combined chiefly apprehension of immediate present pain of speaking to on disagreeable subject of being obliged to hear speak with formal deliberation detested added to dread of surprise if not of reproach when affair must be revealed operated so irresistibly upon weakness that decided on common resource concealment hand be upon lock of chamber door turned cautiously softly lest in entering apartment must waken lady sarah be not asleep what can have kept so late mr vivian said business dear answered with embarrassment may ask what sort of business oh only political business political business looked earnestly at husband a if repressing curiosity afterwards added sex have nothing to do with politics turning away from light composed to sleep very true dear replied vivian not word more did say content with evasion of difficulty thus by weakness deprived of real advantage of wife strength of mind whilst lady sarah in total ignorance of distress of husband slept in peace lay awake revolving painful thought in silence of night that mother have said about pecuniary difficulty to must soon be reduced recurred with fresh force idea of unpaid election bill mason carpenter painter glazier upholsterer bill with thousand yet unnamed behind rose in dreadful array before enthusiasm of patriotism be appalled with feverish reiteration ran over over in mind same circle of difficulty continually returning to question then what can be done bitterly did night regret foolish expense into have early in life be led if be to do over again certainly must not turn house into castle if have foreseen how much expense must surpass estimate assuredly nothing must have tempted to such extravagance architect mason workman one be knave one must be paid then what must do debt incurred by contested election contested election be cursed thing when bill come to be paid cursed not must be paid then what must do distress in must involve generous mother sacrifice must require from wife family quarrel lady sarah must suffer from situation of wife then what must do must submit to lord glistonbury take place be offered to vivian sighed turned in bed sighed thought turned sighed again last sigh of expiring patriotism escaped to end to miserable end must patriotism come be not supported by seemingly inferior virtue of prudence economy poor vivian endeavoured to comfort by reflection that must not act from merely mercenary consideration that be compelled to yield to solicitation of mother of father in law that be forced to sacrifice own public opinion to secure domestic peace to prevent distress of mother misery perhaps danger of wife child dereliction of principle in circumstance be something like amiable pardonable weakness then see in what light will a lord glistonbury observed there be so many who will keep patriot in countenance now day for merely changing side in politics man be not even thought to be man of talent till get something by talent bargain make price gain be in most people estimation value of public man vivian said to to quiet conscience knew must be abundantly satisfactory to generality of people with whom associated therefore from must fear reproach contempt must not bear even to think of russell felt pang of remorse agony of shame a idea of such friend came into mind again turned in bed groaned aloud so loud that lady sarah wakened starting up asked what be matter receiving answer imagined that have be in dream that husband have spoken in sleep groaned more did even sigh fatigued with thinking with feeling at last fell into sort of slumber lasted till be time to rise before vivian be dressed lord glistonbury called upon went into dressing room lordship came with best address most courteous face of persuasion held out hand in frank cordial manner a entered begging dear son pardon for warmth want of temper be free to confess have shown last night be persuaded said that vivian knew sincere regard for convinced that in short must never essentially differ so that be determined to come to talk matter over with when be cool that felt assured that vivian after night reflection must always act so a to justify preference of son in law to nephew hey vivian lord glistonbury paused for answer vivian cut a be shaving be glad of moment reprieve instead of answering only exclaimed cursed razor cut lord wont sit down will do honour to lord glistonbury seated in regular order with tiresome parade of expletive went through argument must be adduced to prove expediency of vivians taking place assisting a have taken for granted son in law must on occasion letter of great little men who have negotiated business of marquisate be then produced account given of have passed in confidence lord glistonbury finished by saying that affair be absolutely concluded having passed word pledged honour for vivian that must not have spoken acted for if have not felt that be when acting for son in law in fact acting for second self that there have be no time to wait possibility of consulting vivian that whole plan be suggested yesterday in two hour after house broke up be arranged in evening that search inquiry have be made where for vivian a must not be found lord glistonbury said have ventured to decide for a hoped for interest for of family thing now done must not be undone lordship word be sacred must not be retracted vivian in feeble irresolute tone asked if there be possibility of being allowed to decline place be offered suggested that must take middle course to avoid voting against lordship wish must believed that must accept of chiltern hundred go out of parliament for session lord glistonbury remonstrated against what termed madness of scheme man like dear vivian who have distinguished so much already in opposition who will distinguish so much more hereafter in place in power said vivian rising a finished shaving lord will never more distinguish if abandon principle believe to be just true what eloquence have if have have arisen from being in earnest will speak ill will not be able to speak at when get up against conscience oh said lord glistonbury laughing romantic patriotism may be very nice in feeling believe will not deprive of use of speech look at one of fine orator of time name one if can who have not spoken spoken equally well on side of house ay on side of most political question come come youll find will get on quite a well a got on before hey will find that will be of use to that will be dead weight on hand dead weight who be formed to be

allowed to be yet see make comparison between assure be judge in matter see house have confirmed judgment what be more for can keep nothing from if wont make too vain make set too high price upon will be very troublesome in present case say be that a may will frankly own to that believe have be of essential service in procuring great favourite object of life marquisate lord impossible for never took slightest step toward procuring pardon took most effectual step without knowing perhaps spoke so well in opposition that made interest of ministry to muzzle there be way so effectual of getting at a through being father in law heir dont see secret concatenation of thing with glance a do who have be used to so long there be way of coming to point with without marquisate be sine qua non see gained point by mean chiefly be free to allow though marmaduke must gladly persuade be by negotiating do justice did justice too in more than word when stipulated for place for in fact knew must not

political breakfast be just what reader who know world half a well a lord glistonbury knew have probably long since anticipated capitulation of patriot of glistonbury band with vivian at head be settled lord glistonbury lost character by transaction for have none to lose be quite at ease quite callous vivian bartered for paltry accommodation of pecuniary difficulty reputation stood high in public opinion be invaluable in own be last stake of happiness knew felt with anguish of exquisite useless sensibility lord glistonbury new friend secretary who be man of wit a well a politician
