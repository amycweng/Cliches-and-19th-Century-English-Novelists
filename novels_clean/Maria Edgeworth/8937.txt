title with happy facility of frenchman touched upon various subject dwelt upon none found mean on to say something to raise country in opinion of company at same time to make auditor pleased with presently taking seat between rosamond caroline applied to draw out talent for conversation did labour in vain did not shut up in stupid provoking silence did make ostentatious display of knowledge ability m de tourville a rosamond have justly observed seemed to be particularly struck with miss caroline percy be beautiful of uncommon style of beauty ingenuous unaffected with simplicity of youth there be certain dignity graceful self possession in manner gave idea of superior character have perhaps le of what french call esprit than m de tourville have be accustomed to meet with in young person on continent be more surprised by strength justness of thought appeared in plain reply to finesse of of question morning of second day that be at percy hall m de tourville be admiring miss

albert altenberg young nobleman who have till moment be one of prince favourite who by thus opposing passion lost entirely prince favour story be common story of intrigue such a happens day in country where there be young prince there be something uncommon in conduct of count altenberg mr percy expressed admiration of m de tourville though acknowledged a in morality bound that count conduct have be admirable just what ought to be upon occasion yet spoke of altogether a une tete exaltee young man of romantic quixotic enthusiasm to have sacrificed interest of family own hope of advancement at court in support of opinion m de tourville related several anecdote on of anecdote mr percy m de tourville differed in opinion be produced to prove that young count have judgment discretion appeared to mr percy proof of independence of character greatness of soul mr percy repeated anecdote to mr percy daughter m de tourville a soon a saw that lady especially caroline differed from immediately endeavoured to slide round to opinion assured caroline with many asseveration with hand upon heart that have merely be speaking of light in thing appeared to generality of men of world for own particular feeling be in favour of frankness generosity of character evinced by imprudence only lamented that certain quality must expose possessor to censure ridicule of who be like world incapable of being moved by motive interest unable to reach to idea of moral sublime more m de tourville said upon subject more gesture emphasis used to impress belief in truth le caroline believed more dislike contempt felt for duplicity pitiful meanness of character be always endeavouring to seem instead of to be understood felt expression of countenance mortified by dignified silence said more than word must express turned away never afterwards addressed to of confidential conversation from moment rosamond opinion of m de tourville changed gave up altogether denied at least gave grudgingly that praise eminently deserved for agreeable manner conversational talent not foible of now escaped quick observation lively perception of ridicule whether from accident from suspicion that have lost ground with lady m de tourville next day directed principal part of conversation to gentleman of family comforting with importance of political official character talked grandly of politics diplomacy rosamond who listened with air of arch attention from time to time with tone of ironical simplicity asked explanation on certain point relative to diplomatic code of morality professed much edified enlightened by answer received wished a told caroline that one must write advice to diplomatist in manner of swift advice to servant observed that m de tourville charge d'affaires c might supply anecdote illustrative might embellish work with portrait of finished diplomatist unfortunately for public on third morning of diplomatist visit circumstance occurred prevented farther development of character stopped flow of anecdote snatched from company of hospitable host in looking over paper in order to show mr percy complimentary letter from crowned head m de tourville discovered that important packet of paper belonging to despatch be missing have in moment of danger terror stuffed despatch into great coat pocket in getting out of boat have given coat to comtois to carry strange to tell charge d'affaires have taken upon trust from assertion of valet that paper be safe once indeed have looked over so carelessly that never have missed packet dismay be great when discovered loss repeated at least thousand time that be undone man unless packet must be found search be made for in boat on shore in probable improbable place in vain in midst of search messenger came to announce that wind be fair that ship must sail in one hour that captain must wait for man m de tourville be obliged to take departure without precious packet mr percy be only person in family who have humanity to pity be too little of soldier for godfrey taste too much of courtier for mr percy too frivolous for caroline too little romantic for rosamond so said rosamond here be fine beginning of romance with shipwreck end only in five square merchant who lose even guilder of property diplomatist with whom be sure of nothing that have lost bundle of paper for nobody care in few day remembrance of whole adventure began to fade from fancy m de tourville snuff box essence flattery diplomacy lost packet circumstance of shipwreck must have appeared a dream if have not be maintained in rank of reality by daily sight of wreck by actual presence of dutch sailor who be repairing vessel chapter ii few day after departure of m de tourville commissioner falconer friend at least relation of mr percy came to pay visit a commissioner looked out of window observed dutch carpenter who be passing by with tool under arm began to talk of late shipwreck mr falconer said have heard much of successful exertion hospitality of percy family on occasion regretted that have be called to town just at time asked many question about passenger on board vessel when m de tourville be described to deplored that mr percy have never thought of trying to detain foreigner few day longer for argued commissioner though m de tourville might not be accredited charge d'affaires yet since be person in degree in official capacity intrusted with secret negotiation government might have wished to know something about at event added commissioner with shrewd smile must have be fine way of paying court to certain great man so commissioner still put trust in great men said mr percy not in great men in replied commissioner for instance in old friend lord oldborough who be happy to inform be just come into neighbourhood to clermont park of have at last completed purchase have sent down plate picture who know may make clermont park summer residence instead of place in essex if must there be saying of what advantage might be for have from very best authority that lordship influence in certain quarter be greater than ever of course mr percy will wait upon lord oldborough when come to part of country believe not said mr percy have connexion with now be so intimate with abroad expostulated mr falconer be five twenty year since knew abroad said mr percy from have heard be altered man when be intimate with lord oldborough be generous open hearted youth have since become politician fear have sold for riband to demon of ambition matter to whom have sold for what replied commissioner be affair not ours must not be too nice be well disposed towards dear sir must take a very particular favour if must introduce to lordship with great pleasure said mr percy very first opportunity must make opportunity not wait for said commissioner smiling let entreat that will pay respect to lordship a soon a come into country really be civil take in hand with heart said mr percy mine will only be visit of civility well satisfied with having obtained promise commissioner falconer departed besides general desire to be acquainted with great commissioner have particular reason for wishing to be introduced at time to lord oldborough have peculiar cause for being curious about m de tourville mr falconer be in possession of packet that diplomatist have lost have be found by one of commissioner son mr john falconer rather by mr john falconer dog neptune who brought to master when be bathing in sea day after shipwreck have be thrown by tide among sea weed where be entangled where lay till be discovered by dog mr john falconer have carried home boasting of dog sagacity have produced rather a proof of capital manner in have taught neptune to fetch carry than from idea care for value of packet john falconer being one of men who care for very little in world whilst have dog gun not so commissioner who immediately began to examine paper with serious curiosity to discover whether must by mean be productive of advantage to family sea water have injured only outer page though inner be not in least damaged be difficult to make out content for be written in cipher commissioner falconer however be skilled in art of deciphering possessed ingenuity patience necessary for business title superscription signature of paper be obliterated so that must not guess from whom came to whom be addressed perceived that be political of what degree of importance might be must not decide till heard of m de tourville diplomatist of distress at loss of packet commissioner then resolved to devote evening ensuing day night if requisite to business that might have in readiness to carry with when went to pay respect to lord oldborough foreseeing that something might be made of intercepted despatch fearing that if mentioned to mr percy that gentleman might object to opening paper mr falconer left percy hall without giving most remote hint of treasure possessed of use that intended to make of discovery early in ensuing week mr percy went to pay visit of civility mr falconer visit of policy to lord oldborough lordship be so much altered that be with difficulty mr percy recollected in trace of same person lord oldborough have formerly known be gay gallant rather dissipated of frank joyous air manner lord oldborough whom now saw be serious reserved looking personage with face in line of thought care be deeply marked large eyebrow vigilant eye with expression of ability decision in whole countenance not of tranquillity of happiness manner be well bred rather cold formal conversation circumspect calculated to draw forth opinion to benefit by information of others rather than to assert display own seemed to converse to think to live not with enjoyment of present with view to future object about be constantly anxious mr percy mr falconer observed lord oldborough attentively during visit mr percy studied with philosophical curiosity to discover what change have be made in lordship character by operation of ambition to determine how far passion have contributed to happiness mr falconer studied with interested eye of man of world eager to discern what advantage must be made by ministering to ambition to decide whether there be about lordship making of good patron there be thought right twist if have skill to follow humour in working be task of much nicety lord oldborough appeared to be aware of commissioner view be not disposed to burden with new friend seemed easy to go to certain point with lordship difficult to get farther easy to obtain attention impossible to gain confidence commissioner however have many resource ready many small mean of fastening on lordship private public interest determined to begin first with despatch have be deciphering with view led mr percy to speak of shipwreck of m de tourville attention be immediately awakened when mr falconer perceived that regret for not having seen m de tourville curiosity to know nature of secret negotiation have be sufficiently excited commissioner quitted subject a must go farther whilst restrained by mr percy presence took first opportunity of leaving room with lordship nephew col hauton to look at horse be to run at ensuing race left alone with mr percy lord oldborough looked le reserved for plainly saw indeed mr percy plainly showed that have nothing to ask from great man that came only to see friend many year since met percy said lordship sitting down placing chair for first time without considering whether face back be to light great many year since met mr percy yet must not think so from appearance look a if will say five twenty year have passed since time have be leading easy life in country happiest life envy mr percy thinking that be word of course mere polite cant of courtier to country gentleman smiled replied that few who be acquainted with different situation in world must imagine that mr percy must be object of envy to lord oldborough statesman at summit of favour fortune not summit said lord oldborough sighing if be even at summit be know dangerous situation fortune wheel never stand still highest point be therefore most perilous lordship sighed again a deeply a before then spoke rather led to subject of general politics of mr percy gave opinion with freedom openness yet without ever forgetting respect due to lord oldborough situation lordship seemed sensible of attention sometimes nodded sometimes smiled a mr percy spoke of public men measure when expressed sentiment of patriotism of public virtue lord oldborough took to snuff box shook levelled snuff if listened listened a to word superfluous irrelevant when mr percy uttered principle favourable to liberty of press of people lordship must take several pinch of snuff rapidly to hide expression of countenance if topic be continued averted eye compressed lip showed disapprobation difficulty felt in refraining from reply from reply however did absolutely refrain after pause of few moment with smile in softer lower voice than usual tone asked mr percy question about family turned conversation again to domestic affair expressed surprise that man of mr percy talent must live in such absolute retirement seeming to forget what have said hour before of pain danger of ambition mr percy have said of love of domestic life appeared to take for granted that mr percy must be glad to shine in public if opportunity be not wanting upon supposition lordship dexterously pointed out way by might distinguish out assurance of own good wish compliment to talent in short sounded heart still expecting to find corruption ambition at bottom none be to be found lord oldborough be convinced of surprised perhaps esteem for mr percy understanding fell degree considered a eccentric person acting from unaccountable motif still respected a rarest of thing in politician eye really honest independent man believed also that mr percy have regard for portion might be be valuable extraordinary for be disinterested besides must never cross in object a mr percy lived out of world have connexion with party be perfectly safe man thought acted so powerfully upon lord oldborough that threw aside reserve in manner must have astonished delighted mr falconer mr percy be astonished not delighted saw noble mind corroded debased by ambition virtuous principle generous feeling stifled powerful capacious understanding distorted soul once expatiating full of high thought now confined to span bent down to low concern imprisoned in precinct of court pity said lord oldborough who seemed to understand mr percy thought pity pity such be ambition can not live without once always slave person of strong mind a lord oldborough must emancipate from slavery even that of habit yes if wished to break through doe not can have utterly lost taste for freedom must say yes utterly see pity said lordship with bitter smile added rising proudly be unused to be pitied be awkward fear under obligation resuming friendly aspect however in moment two followed mr percy who have turned to examine fine picture yes corregio be not aware dear sir continued between youth knew at paris man who have now honour to speak to there be nothing in common absolutely nothing except regard for mr percy have always great knowledge of character remember with respect to own will recollect have advantage of possessing la carte du pay be grown quite philosopher find so be in own way in short to put question between at rest for ever there be nothing left for in life ambition now let go to corregio what please mr percy followed lordship lead immediately to italy to france to paris talking over old time youthful day conversation grew gay familiar lord oldborough seemed enlivened pleased yet a if be reminiscence of former state of existence often repeated ah be young day very young be boy then quite boy at last mr percy touched upon love woman by accident mentioned italian lady whom have known abroad flash of pale anger almost of frenzy passed across lord oldborough countenance turned short darted full on mr percy penetrating imperious interrogative look answered by innocence steady openness of mr percy countenance lord oldborough grew red instantly conscious of unusual change of colour stood actually abashed moment afterward commanding agitation forced whole person to air of tranquillity took up red book lay upon table walked deliberately to window looking earnestly through glass asked if mr percy must recollect who be member for borough in neighbourhood conversation after languished though effort be made never recovered tone of ease confidence party felt relieved from indefinable sort of constraint by return of other gentleman mr falconer begged mr percy to go look at carriage of new construction colonel have just brought from town colonel accompanying mr percy stage be thus left clear for commissioner to open business about m de tourville packet did with so much address with so little circumlocution that lord oldborough immediately comprehended how important paper might be to how necessary be to secure decipherer when mr percy returned found commissioner lordship in earnest seemingly confidential conversation mr falconer mr percy be now pressed to stay to dine to sleep at clermont park invitation mr percy declined commissioner accepted in evening when company who have dined at clermont park be settled to card music lord oldborough after walking up down room with commissioner in silence for minute retired with into study rang gave order that must not be interrupted on account till supper servant informed lordship that such such person whom have appointed be waiting can not possibly see till to morrow naming hour servant laid on table

period of story necessary to state precisely content be sufficient to say that opened to lord oldborough scene of diplomatic treachery abroad of ungrateful duplicity at home from of intercepted letter discovered that certain of colleague who appeared to be acting along with with utmost cordiality be secretly combined against be carrying on underplot to deprive at once of popularity favour place power strength firmness hardness of mind lord oldborough exhibited at moment of discovery perfectly amazed mr falconer lordship gave sign of astonishment uttered indignant exclamation betrayed symptom of alarm listened with motionless attention when mr falconer from time to time interrupted reading put to great expense of face lung to express abhorrence of such inconceivable treachery lord oldborough maintained absolute silence waiting till commissioner have exhausted in invective must point with pencil to line in paper where have left off calmly say have goodness to go on let proceed sir if please commissioner went on till came to most important interesting point then glancing eye on intended patron profile be towards suddenly stopped oldborough raising head from hand on leaned

moral religious must distract attention genius said be for army into army must go so to genius buckhurst in despair be obliged to leave commissioner neglected not to push claim have on colonel hauton chose time so well when proper people be by when colonel did not wish to have squire horse whip duel brought before public that obtained if not full acknowledgment of obligation promise of doing thing thing in power for friend buckhurst thing thing be indefinite unsatisfactory term commissioner bold in dealing with timid temper of colonel though have be cautious with determined character of uncle pressed point named living of chipping friar showed how well must be satisfied how well must represent matter if promise be given at same time made understood how loudly must complain how disgraceful complaint might prove to oldborough family if son be treated with ingratitude colonel particularly dreaded that must be suspected of want of spirit that uncle must have transaction laid before in improper point of view pondered for few moment promise for living of chipping friar be given commissioner secure of next returned to point with son absolutely insisted upon going into order buckhurst who have tried wit raillery in vain now tried persuasion earnest entreaty be equally fruitless father though easy good natured man except where favourite plan be crossed be peremptory without using harsh word employed harshest measure to force son compliance buckhurst have contracted debt at university none of great consequence such a must not pay immediately bet have laid lost upon high blood be also to be provided for debt of honour claimed precedency must be directly discharged father positively refused to assist except upon condition of compliance with wish so far from affording mean of settling with creditor have be proved from commissioner private answer to of application that not only refused to pay farthing for son encouraged creditor to threaten in strongest manner with terror of law arrest thus pressed embarrassed young man who have many honourable religious sentiment genuine feeling power of adhering to principle reason be miserable beyond expression one hour next became totally forgetful that there be thing to be thought of amusement of moment incapable of coming to serious decision walked up down room talking partly to partly for want of better companion to brother john so must pay wallis to morrow will arrest must give father answer about church to night for writes to bishop will wait no longer oh hang ' hang john what devil will do father wo pay farthing for

demonstration of sensibility have sympathy for external symptom of pain saw in brother clear conception of internal cause why buckhurst said if can not do ca know buckhurst see why must be disgrace to church more than a father say if be through university have a lieve go into church a not be can say if genius be not for military line there be nothing must relish better than living of chipping friar be sure only thing that see against be that paralytic incumbent may live many year then get debt paid now by only going into order be great point if go against conscience know best if ca ca after ca go to jail ca let be arrested ca starve ca be beggar said buckhurst a say must be so easy if cursed debt be paid if got living of nine hundred year how comfortable must be then must marry by jove 'd propose directly for caroline percy for be confoundedly in love with such sweet tempered good creature not girl so much admired colonel hauton g p d asked 'who be that pretty girl ' certainly be very pretty girl certainly be repeated john devil of fellow never clean gun not regularly handsome pursued buckhurst a hauton say fascinating new new face in public be great matter fashionable looking figure too though have not come out yet dance charmingly must dance divinely if must let out sings play like angel fifty time better than two precious sister who have be at from cradle with signor squalicis at elbow caroline percy never exhibit in public mother doe not like suppose so suppose said john curse flint flint be growing worse worse day wonder what in world be become of good flint there used to be very unlike mother be sure continued buckhurst there be georgiana bell at party concert a regularly a of professor standing up in midst of singing men woman favouring public in a fine bravura style making a ugly face a best of do remember italian compliment to miss vish miss have assurance ' very good have very fair faith said john do know what have done with powder horn not put in oven may be to dry said buckhurst a be saying of dear caroline caroline be not mine yet very true said john very true why john be enough to provoke saint be agreeing with thought said john nothing be so provoking a always agreeing with one can tell mr verytrue that though caroline percy be not mine yet have nevertheless little suspicion that such even a be might readily be brought to love honour obey doubt for never yet knew woman be not ready enough to be married quoth john be not right ramrod after there be wrong john on other side said buckhurst for can assure miss caroline percy be not one of young lady who must marry body even though might like be not at sure that must marry for obedience to best of father might interfere there be point said john for thereby hang fortune must be deuced thing to have girl without fortune not so deuced thing to a think said buckhurst laughing for poor a be can assure fortune be not object be not mercenary dog by bye cried john now talk of dog wish to heaven above have not given away that fine puppy of mine to foolish old man who never be out shooting in day dog just a much thrown away a if have drowned now do know if have have making of puppy puppy exclaimed buckhurst be possible can be thinking of puppy john when be talking to of what be of so much consequence when whole happiness of life be at stake stake well what can do more said john have not be standing here half hour with gun in hand fine day listening to prosing about know what be very thing complain of that know what pretty brother said buckhurst john made further reply left room sullenly whistling a went left to own cogitation buckhurst fell into reverie upon charm of caroline percy upon probable pleasure of dancing with at race ball after recurred to bitter recollection that must decide about debt church bright idea came into mind that might have recourse to mr percy perhaps prevail upon to persuade father not to force to step must not reconcile either to conscience inclination sooner thought than done called for horse rode a hard a must to percy hall when boy have be intimate in percy family have be long absent at school at university have seen only during vacation since late return to country though mr percy must not entirely approve of character yet thought there be many good point about frankness candour with now laid whole mind affair open to debt love fear hope folly fault without reserve extenuation interested mr percy in favour pitying distress admiring motif from acted mr percy said that though have right to interfere in mr falconer family affair yet that must must so far assist buckhurst a to lend money for be immediately pressed that might not be driven by necessity to go into profession ought to be embraced only from highest purest motif buckhurst thanked with transport of gratitude for generous kindness be far beyond expectation indeed have never entered into hope mr percy seized moment when young man mind be warmed with good feeling to endeavour to bring to serious thought rational determination about future life represented that be unreasonable to expect that father must let go into army when have received education to prepare for profession in literary talent might be of advantage to family that mr falconer be not rich enough to forward two of son in army that if buckhurst from conscientious motif declined provision father have in view for in church be bound to exert to obtain independent maintenance in line of life that have talent must succeed at bar if have application perseverance sufficient to go through necessary drudgery at commencement of study of law here buckhurst groaned mr percy observed that there be other way of proving that acted from conscientious motif respecting church for otherwise must appear that preferred army only because fancied must afford life of idleness pleasure that must also be only chance of winning approbation of object of affection of placing in situation in must marry buckhurst who be capable of being strongly influenced by good motif especially from one who have obliged instantly in most handsome manner acknowledged truth justice of mr percy argument declared that be ready to begin study of law directly if father must consent to that must submit to drudgery rather than do what felt to be base wrong mr percy at earnest request applied to mr falconer with delicacy be becoming claimed right of relationship to speak of mr falconer family affair told what have ventured to do about buckhurst debt what young man now wished for commissioner looked much disappointed vexed bar cried mr percy know a well a do will answer for will never go through with then be to change profession again expense trouble be to fall on be to provide for at last in probability by time buckhurst know own mind paralytic incumbent will be dead living of chipping friar given away where be to find nine hundred year pray at minute notice for conscientious youth who by time will tell scruple be nonsense must have known better than to listen to nine hundred year doe not come in man way at turn of life if give up now be not fault let look to mr percy replied that buckhurst have declared ready to abide by consequence that promised must never complain of lot have chosen for much le reproach father for compliance that be resolute to maintain at bar yes very fine how long will be before make nine hundred year at bar mr percy who knew that none worldly consideration made impression upon father suggested that must have to maintain son during life of paralytic incumbent expense of buckhurst being at bar must not probably be greater though might be several year before must make nine hundred perhaps one hundred year at bar yet that if succeeded with buckhurst talent nothing want of perseverance must prevent might make nine thousand year by profession of law more than in scope of human probability with patronage father address must procure must hope to obtain in church well let try let try repeated commissioner who vexed a be did not choose to run risk of disobliging mr percy losing good match for undergoing scandal of being known that forced son into church for obtaining consent however reluctantly granted by commissioner buckhurst warmly thanked mr percy who made one condition with that must go up to town immediately to commence study buckhurst faithfully promised to do only implored permission to declare attachment to caroline caroline be at time not quite eighteen too young father said to think of forming serious engagement even be with person suited to in fortune in other respect buckhurst declared that have idea of endeavouring even to obtain from miss caroline percy promise engagement have be treated said too generously by father to attempt to take step without entire approbation knew be not must not for many year be in circumstance must enable to support daughter of mr percy in station to be by birth fortune entitled asked repeated be to be permitted to declare to passion mr percy thought be more prudent to let be declared openly than to have secretly suspected therefore consented to request trusting much to buckhurst honour to caroline prudence to first declaration of love caroline listened with degree of composure astonished mortified lover have flattered that at least vanity pride must have be apparently gratified by conquest there be none of flutter of vanity in manner of repressed satisfaction of pride there be in look word only simplicity dignity said that be at present occupied happily in various way endeavouring to improve that must be sorry to have mind turned from pursuit desired to secure time to compare judge of own taste of character of others before must make engagement form attachment on happiness of life must depend said be equally desirous to keep free to avoid injuring happiness of man who have honoured by preference therefore requested must discontinue pursuit must not encourage to hope must ever be successful long before time when must think prudent to marry even if be to meet with character perfectly suited to hers hoped that cousin buckhurst must be united to woman who must be able to return affection manner in be said convinced buckhurst that spoke plain exact truth from ease frankness with have hitherto conversed with have flattered that must not be difficult to prepossess heart in favour now when saw same ease simplicity unchanged in manner be convinced that have be mistaken have still hope that in time might make impression upon urged that be not yet sufficiently acquainted with character to be able to judge whether not must suit hers frankly told thought of in doing so impressed with conviction that have discerned merit discovered defect of character gave back representation of felt to be exactly just yet struck with force of novelty be exclaimed never knew till now have such pleasure in hearing caroline speak of that wished even to hear speak of fault of must however have be better pleased if have spoken with le calmness indulgence be great way from love a yet thought buckhurst be astonishing that with power knowledge on other subject so far above age must know so little even of common language of sentiment very extraordinary that with so much kindness amiable disposition must have so little sensibility novelty of insensibility of perfect simplicity so unlike have observed in manner mind of other young lady to whom have be accustomed have however great effect upon lover openness unaffected serenity of caroline countenance at moment appeared to more charming than other thing have ever beheld in most finished coquette most fashionable beauty what divine creature will be few year hence thought time will come when love may waken psyche what glory must be to to produce to world such perfection with mixed idea of love glory buckhurst took leave of caroline still retained hope in spite of calm decided refusal knew power of constant attention display of ardent passion to win female heart trusted also in slight degree to reputation have already acquired of being favourite with fair sex chapter iv buckhurst falconer returned to percy hall came provided with something like excuse have business father have desired to ask mr percy to take charge of box of family paper for a apprehended that when be absent from country steward have not be a careful of a ought to have be mr percy willingly consented to take charge of paper desired that before be left with buckhurst must take list of buckhurst be unprepared for task head be intent on ball on caroline however be obliged to undergo labour when have finished mr percy who happened to be preparing new lease of considerable farm be so busy in midst of paper that there be such thing a touching upon subject of ball at lady of family appeared parchment be at last out of way buckhurst began upon real business said meant to delay going to town few day longer because there be to be early in ensuing week nothing more natural said mr percy than to wish to go to ball yet added gravely when man of honour give promise that nothing will prevent from commencing study immediately did not expect that first temptation oh dear mr percy said buckhurst endeavouring to laugh away displeasure rather disappointment saw in mr percy countenance few day can make difference only difference of term said mr percy difference between promising performing thought unjust yesterday when told that feared must prefer present amusement to future happiness amusement exclaimed buckhurst turning suddenly towards caroline do imagine be object then approaching said in low voice be natural mistake for to make miss caroline percy for who know nothing of love amusement be not amusement that detains can think must stay for ball unless expected to meet there then will not go said caroline must be coquetry to meet there when a thought have distinctly explained to yesterday oh repeat interrupted lady be never bound to remember what said yesterday especially if be cruel sentence hope hereafter will change mind let live upon hope will never give false hope said caroline since can not add to happiness will take care not to diminish will not be cause of breaking promise to father will not be mean of tempting to lower in opinion will not go to ball buckhurst smiled went on with commonplace raillery about cruelty took leave fancying caroline must not be in earnest in threat a called a disobedience must have excuse of love thought might venture to transgress letter of promise when time came went to ball almost certain that caroline must break resolution a knew that have never yet be at public assembly be natural that one so sure of being admired must be anxious to be seen surprise disappointment be great when caroline appeared asked rosamond if sister be not well perfectly well then why be not here recollect telling that must not come yes did not think be in earnest how little know of caroline replied rosamond if imagine that in trifle in matter of consequence must say one thing do feel said buckhurst colouring what that emphasis on mean did not think must have reproached so severely thought cousin rosamond be friend so be not friend to fault surely be great crime in young man to like going to ball better than going to temple be really concerned continued buckhurst have deprived miss caroline percy of pleasure of being here to night be to have be first appearance in public be quite sorry caroline be not at impatient to appear in public a to pleasure of being at ball cost little to sacrifice pleasure of own for advantage of others when miss caroline percy said something about falling in father opinion for such trifle must not guess that be serious doe not replied rosamond think trifle to break promise buckhurst looked at watch mail coach will pas through town in hour will take to london good bye will not stay moment be gone wish have gone yesterday pray dear good rosamond say so for to caroline at moment beautiful young lady attended by large party entered ball room buckhurst stopped to inquire who be did never see sister before replied colonel hauton oh must introduce will dance with do great deal of honour will be very happy that be must be extremely happy only unfortunately be under necessity of setting off immediately for london be afraid will be late for mail good night buckhurst made effort a spoke to pas on colonel hauton bursting into one of horse laugh held fast by arm swore must be drunk for that did not know what be saying doing commissioner falconer who now came up whispered to buckhurst be mad ca refuse will affront for ever ca help said buckhurst be sorry for can not help still kept on way towards door expostulated commissioner following out can surely stay be introduced pay compliment to young lady be time enough for mail affront people for nothing who may be of greatest use to dear father want people to be of use to well at rate turn back just to see what charming creature miss hauton be such entree so much air of woman of fashion eye riveted whole room in admiration of did not see thing remarkable about said buckhurst turning back to look at again if think must affront must not really affront hauton who have always be so civil to will go be introduced pay compliment since say be necessary will not stay five minute buckhurst returned to be introduced to miss hauton young lady be so beautiful that must in probability have attracted general attention even if have not be sister of man of colonel hauton fortune niece of nobleman of lord oldborough political consequence undoubtedly circumstance much increased power of charm over imagination of admirer gentleman at hall be unanimous in declaring that be most fascinating creature buckhurst falconer godfrey percy be introduced to nearly at same time godfrey asked to dance buckhurst must not help staying to see danced so gracefully that while thought have stayed only five minute delayed quarter of hour many gentleman be ambitious of honour of miss hauton hand to disappointment declined dancing more though buckhurst falconer have determined not to have stayed to dance with yet undefinable perverse curiosity induced to delay few minute to determine whether conversed a well a danced sound of voice be sweet soft there be air of languor in whole person manner with apparent indifference to general admiration charmed godfrey percy especially a perceived that must be animated by conversation to buckhurst wit listened with politeness obviously without interest buckhurst looked at watch again be now too late for mail rosamond be surprised to see still in ball room laid blame on father pleaded that be detained by parental order must not disobey sat beside rosamond at supper used much eloquence to convince that have obeyed against will in mean time godfrey seated next to fair partner became moment more more sensible of advantage of situation towards end of supper when buzz of general conversation increased happened that somebody near miss hauton spoke of marriage be likely to take place in fashionable world who thought who wished to be thought good authority began to settle how must be when must be gentleman of godfrey acquaintance who sat next to said in low voice will never be why said godfrey gentleman answered in whisper there be insuperable objection mother recollect mother be divorcee man of sense must venture to marry daughter

be silent miss hauton blushed deeply saw that conjecture be right saw by godfrey countenance that secret be discovered eye fell grew pale instantly fainted lady oldborough came to assistance be too helpless fine lady to be of least use must only say that must be heat of room that must faint in moment godfrey whispered to mother miss hauton be carried into open air lady oldborough smelling bottle

buckhurst answer went instantly into room one not even gentleman whose whisper have occasioned have least suspicion of real cause of miss hauton indisposition lady oldborough have assigned a occasion of young lady illness heat of room old medical dowager be eager to establish that be owing to strawberry ice a to certain knowledge ice in shape other be cause of most of mischief in world whilst partizan of heat ice be still battling whilst dancer have quite forgotten miss hauton thing young lady returned to room godfrey went to order mr percy carriage percy family left ball when godfrey found in carriage with own family began eagerly to talk of miss hauton be anxious to know what thought of in general in particular talked so much of seemed so much surprised that body must wish to talk think of thing else that mr percy must not help smiling mr percy leaning back in carriage said that felt inclined to sleep to sleep repeated godfrey be possible that can be sleepy sir very possible dear son be past four o'clock believe godfrey be silent for minute began to think over word look have passed between miss hauton have be only amused with conversation charmed by grace beauty in beginning of evening sensibility have afterwards shown have touched so much that be extremely anxious to interest father in favour explained cause of fainting asked whether be not much to be pitied pitied godfrey encouraged by pity went on to prove that ought not to be blamed for mother fault that nothing must be more unjust cruel than to think ill of innocent daughter because mother have be imprudent godfrey said rosamond seem to be answering one who have attacked miss hauton whom be contending with with said mr percy prudence tell that gentleman be quite right in saying that man of sense must marry daughter of woman who have conducted ill yet wish to make exception to general rule in favour of pretty miss hauton pretty dear father be great deal more than pretty if be only pretty must not be so much interested about putting quite out of question agree with general principle that man must not marry daughter of woman who have conducted ill think did agree with till knew that applied to miss hauton case said mr percy a well a remember godfrey heard once answer on similar occasion 'no will have nothing to do with of daughter of mother black cat have black kitten 'black dog have black puppy forget said whichever be be ashamed of having quoted vulgar proverb said godfrey may be vulgar proverb doubt whether be vulgar error said mr percy have great faith in wisdom of nation so much so in present instance that own must rather son of mine be to marry well conducted farmer daughter of honest parentage than daughter of ill conducted lady of rank fashion farmer daughter might be trained into gentlewoman might make son at least faithful wife be more than must expect than must expect from young lady who have early seen example of what be bad whose predisposition must be provided with excuse of old song godfrey took fire at exclaimed against injustice of doctrine must render wretched for life many young woman who might posse amiable estimable quality who must never remedy misfortune of birth godfrey urged that whilst must render good miserable must be most probable mean of driving weak from despair into vice rosamond eagerly joined brother side of question mr percy though knew said that must appear one of father with flinty heart protested that felt great compassion for unfortunate individual a much a man who be not in love with of must reasonably be expected to feel now continued granting that consequence godfrey have predicted be to follow from doctrine yet be inclined to believe that society must upon whole be gainer by such severity a be willing to allow to be such apparent injustice adherence to principle must be misery perhaps ruin of few must think tend to safety happiness of so many that evil must be nothing in comparison to good certainty of shame descending to daughter must be powerful mean of deterring mother from ill conduct might probably operate more effectually to restrain licentiousness in high life than heavy damage now transient disgrace of public trial divorce a to apparent injustice of punishing child for fault of parent must be considered that in most other case child suffer discredit more le for fault of parent of kind that on other hand enjoy advantage of good character parent establish must be so from necessary effect of experience from nature of human belief except in case where passion operates to destroy suspend power of reason be not case assure sir interrupted godfrey mr percy smiled continued appears to highly advantageous that character in general must descend to posterity a well a rich honour be in fact often representation consequence in other form of different part of character industry talent courage for instance in lower rank of life be common saying that good name be richest legacy woman can leave daughter idea must be impressed more fully than be upon higher class at present money too frequently form compensation for thing in high life be not uncommon to see natural daughter of men of rank of large fortune portioned so magnificently with solid gold promised family protection that origin by mother side character of mother be quite forgotten can be advantageous to good moral surely mother living in open defiance of virtue of sex must not see illegitimate offspring instead of being shame become glory on contrary nothing must tend more to prevent ill conduct of woman in high life than certainty that men who from fortune birth character might be deemed most desirable match must shun alliance with daughter of woman of tainted reputation godfrey eagerly declared contempt for men who married for money ambition illegitimate legitimate daughter must be sorry said to do thing must countenance vice ought to be put out of countenance by mean if possible be not guardian of public moral even if be must still think unjust that innocent must suffer for guilty that for own part if must put father disapprobation out of question must easily settle mind overcome objection in prudential point of view to marrying amiable woman who have have misfortune to have worthless mother mr percy have not yet given opinion eye turned towards a usual spoke with persuasive gentleness good sense marked where have in warmth of argument said more than intended seized just medium by might be conciliated said that thought important point to be considered be what education of daughter have be on prudent man must form opinion not on mere accident of birth must inquire whether girl have lived with ill conducted mother have be in situation to be influenced by example by of company kept if such have be case mr percy declared thought must be imprudent wrong to marry daughter if daughter have be separated in early childhood from mother have never be exposed to influence of example have on contrary be educated carefully in strict moral religious principle must be cruel because unnecessary to object to alliance with woman objection must appear inconsistent a well a unjust if made by who professed to believe in unlimited power of education godfrey rubbed hand with delight mr percy smiled acknowledged that be compelled to admit truth justice of statement pray do know godfrey said rosamond whether miss hauton lived with mother be educated by can not tell said godfrey will make business to find out at event dear mother continued child can not decide by whom will be educated be not fault if childhood be passed with mother who be fit guardian for acknowledge said mr percy be misfortune must make irreparable misfortune said godfrey in expostulatory tone dear mother only consider dear son do consider said mr percy can not give up point of education must be very sorry to see son of mine married to woman who have be in unfortunate predicament added mr percy after few minute silence if from time own will judgment must be supposed to act have chosen for companion respectable amiable person have conducted with uniform propriety discretion think might be brought to allow of exception to general principle looked at mr percy undoubtedly said mr percy exception must not merely be allowed will force in favour of superior merit of extraordinary excellence will rise above unfavourable circumstance in class in condition of life in may exist will throw off stigma however disgraceful counteract prepossession however potent rise against power of depression redeem family redeem race now father speak like cried godfrey be ask wish here continued mr percy be adequate motive for good great mind yes great for believe there be great mind in female a well a in male part of creation say here be adequate motive to excite woman of good great mind to exert to struggle against misfortune of birth for instance said rosamond sister caroline be just kind of woman who if have be one of unfortunate daughter must have made exception very likely said mr percy laughing why must go so far out of way to make unfortunate daughter of poor caroline why must picture to a dr johnson must say what must be probable in impossible situation can not conceive except for pleasure of exercising a do upon most occasion fine romantic imagination at event be perfectly satisfied said godfrey since admit of exception sir agree with entirely not entirely be sure can not agree with entirely until admit miss hauton to be one of exception will come in time if deserve said mr percy godfrey thanked mother with great warmth observed that be always most indulgent of friend remember if said mr percy know nothing of miss hauton at present except be very pretty that have engaging manner do dear godfrey yes indeed ma'be know great deal more of did ever see before night never said godfrey at ball said mr percy must have wonderful penetration into character cupid though blindfold can see more at single glance than philosophic eye can discover with most minute examination cupid out of question let ask mother said godfrey whether think miss hauton have great deal of sensibility saw that there be affectation in fainting none none said mr percy there father cried godfrey in exulting tone sensibility be foundation of thing be most amiable charming of grace of virtue in woman yes said mr percy perhaps of of error vice depends upon how be governed whether sensibility be curse blessing to possessor to society curse cried godfrey yes if woman be doomed come come dear godfrey interrupted mr percy let talk more upon subject just now because be too much interested to reason coolly rosamond then took turn to talk of what be uppermost in thought buckhurst falconer whom alternately blamed pitied accused defended sometimes rejoicing that caroline have rejected suit sometimes pitying for disappointment repeating that with such talent frankness generosity of disposition be much to be regretted that have not that rectitude of principle steadiness of character alone must render worthy of caroline then passing from compassion for son to indignation against father observed that commissioner falconer seemed determined to counteract be good in son disposition that actually did thing in power to encourage buckhurst in taste for dissipation a seemed on purpose to keep in state of dependence to enslave to great hope with heart hope continued rosamond that buckhurst will have sense steadiness enough to refuse heard father supporting that foolish colonel hauton persuasion urging poor son to go with people to cheltenham now if once get into extravagant dissipated set will be ruined for ever adieu to hope of will no more go to bar than will will think of nothing pleasure will run in debt again then farewell principle with principle farewell hope of think will have sense steadiness enough to resist father to refuse to accompany profligate patron colonel hauton godfrey what be opinion do think buckhurst will go know replied godfrey in place must find very easy in own case confess must feel difficult to refuse if be

surprised dear mother to find be in london instead of being a have hoped must have be by time with army on continent just a be going to embark be countermanded ordered to stay at quarter conceive disappointment to remain in garrison at most stupid idle country town in england ask how like brother officer what sort of men be major gascoigne son to father friend like extremely be man of liberal spirit much information zeal for army what particularly admire in be candour say be own fault that be not higher in army that when be very young man be of too unbending temper mistook bluntness for sincerity did not treat superior officer with proper deference lost good friend by fine lesson for better because not intended next to gascoigne like captain henry young man of own age uncommonly handsome quite free from conceit there be something in manner so gentlemanlike be of so frank disposition be immediately prepossessed in favour like worse for having tinge of proper pride especially in circumstance in be placed understand that be suspected be not of good family be not impertinent enough to inquire into particular have be told that when first came into regiment of officer wanted to make out what family belongs to whether be be not one of irish henry showed curiosity in unwarrantable manner henry who have great feeling spirit a quick to resent injury a to be won by kindness be going to call one of gentleman to account for impertinence must have have dozen duel upon hand if gascoigne have not settled have not time to tell whole story be enough to say that major gascoigne showed great address prudence a well a steadiness must all love captain henry for gratitude think gascoigne demi god rest of brother officer be nothing supernatural just what may call mere red coat of fond of high play others fond of drinking so have formed intimacy with gascoigne henry father will see yet think that officer of own mess must be first men in universe love to at home hope will sail soon hope rosamond will give credit for length of letter can not say with malice that line be at shooting distance that word be stretched out like lawyer two good page count way will from godfrey who be not letter writer a alfred be two good page did say why here be best part of third for if allow to be dear mother with much respect dutiful obedient affectionate son godfrey percy whilst godfrey remained in quarter at most idle stupid of country town circumstance occurred in regiment put prudence to trial sooner than expected called upon for exercise of spirit of forbearance temper have promised mother must show be more difficult to to keep temper because be affair touched interest of friend major gascoigne lieutenant colonel of regiment having be promoted major gascoigne have reasonable expectation of succeeding to disappointment younger man than stranger to regiment be put over head be said that appointment be made in consequence of new colonel being nephew of lord skreene of also having in power to command two vote in parliament for truth of story can not pretend to vouch credit report gained in regiment created great discontent behaviour of new lieutenant colonel unfortunately be not calculated to dissipate certainly did not bear honour meekly on contrary gave air of authority played martinet to useless ridiculous degree from mere parade officer who have never be out of london to man like major who have seen service must show wound be to use mildest expression ill judged captain henry said be intolerable godfrey thought so parade day something unpleasant occurred when be talked over of officer took part with gascoigne with lieutenant colonel very few however with latter only who wanted to keep in favour officer in quarter a be have not much to do therefore have more time for dispute became of more more consequence hour major gascoigne behaved incomparably well never failing in respect towards superior officer when be present when be absent doing be possible to restrain imprudent zeal indignation of young friend one day when godfrey captain henry major gascoigne be together major actually knelt down to henry to prevail upon to give up mad design of challenging colonel very day not hour afterwards lieutenant colonel took occasion to thwart major about circumstance of consequence godfrey blood boiled in vein promise to mother that must be a gentle a lamb recollected at instant with difficulty restrained still blood boiled major gascoigne fear that godfrey henry must embroil for sake increased for saw what passed in heart have peace of mind by day rest by night generous people be of others most touched by generosity either of feeling action in state of irritation be not possible that thing must long go on without coming to crisis major gascoigne proposed a measure must be most likely to restore preserve peace to quit regiment be great sacrifice on part at first none of friend must consent to making at last brought to acknowledge that be upon whole best thing must be done gascoigne have friend major in regiment then in england who be willing to make exchange with thought that business must be arranged without much difficulty however from caprice love of showing power from unknown reason lieutenant colonel made pleasure to oppose exchange said that must not be done though a captain henry said body knew that by writing line to lord skreene must have be accomplished directly now recurred to godfrey cunningham falconer being secretary to lord oldborough might be of use in affair cunningham have always professed greatest regard for godfrey be determined at least to make trial of sincerity secretary sent civil answer in official style explaining that office be not war office concluding by assurance that if captain percy must point out how must do so with propriety nothing must give mr c falconer greater pleasure than to have opportunity of obliging now captain percy having sort of generous good faith about believed last assurance fancied that a be great writer have not explained well by letter that must make cunningham understand better viva voce keeping own counsel telling only major gascoigne captain henry object asked for fortnight leave of absence with difficulty obtained went to london waited on secretary falconer found ten time more official in style of conversation than in letter godfrey recollected that cousin cunningham have always be solemnly inclined now found grown so mysterious that must scarcely obtain plain answer to simplest question whole man head heart seemed a godfrey said to be diplomatically closed be clear from little that cunningham did articulate that must hing in furthering exchange desired for major gascoigne whether arose from having influence with lord oldborough from fear of wearing out young officer must not determine left secretary in disgust despair went to wait on commissioner falconer who gave polite invitation to dinner overwhelmed with profession of friendship a soon a godfrey explained business commissioner protested that must not venture to speak to lord oldborough on such affair earnestly advised not to interest so much for major gascoigne who though doubtless very deserving officer be in fact nothing more next have recourse to buckhurst falconer asked to persuade colonel hauton to speak to uncle upon subject buckhurst immediately promised to do kept promise colonel hauton swore that uncle never on occasion listened to representation therefore be quite useless to speak to after wandering from office to office wasting hour after hour day after day waiting for people who did good when did see godfrey at last determined to do what must have done at first apply to lord oldborough be always better to deal with principal than with secondary lord oldborough have reputation of being inaccessible haughty peremptory in extreme secretary clerk under clerk trembled at name under through rank of venality to captain percy surprise moment name be announced minister immediately recognized received most graciously lordship inquired after old friend mr percy said that mr percy be one of few really independent men have ever known mr percy be excellent country gentleman for england sake wish there be many many more such now sir how can serve son with frankness brevity suited minister man godfrey told business lord oldborough with laconic decision equally pleasing to young soldier replied that if be possible thing must be done for major gascoigne inquired how long captain percy purposed to stay in town desired to see day before must leave london named hour diplomacy of cunningham falconer face must not disguise astonishment when saw manner in master treated next day commissioner invited captain percy in pressing manner to dine with will have very pleasant party said mr falconer mr falconer insists upon pleasure of company have never seen girl since be child own near relation must be better acquainted come will take denial godfrey willingly accepted invitation must perhaps have found mean to have excused have known whom be to meet at dinner miss dangerous fair one whom have resolved to avoid be in room with beyond power of receding before knew peril young lady looked more beautiful than ever more melancholy one of miss falconer took opportunity of telling in confidence cause of poor friend dejection uncle lord oldborough want to marry to marquis of twickenham eldest son of duke of greenwich miss hauton ca endure marquis be also at dinner godfrey did not much wonder at lady dislike for be mean peevish looking man have conversation appeared to be fond of drinking lord oldborough who be for ambition whispered miss falconer who maintains that there be such thing a love except in novel say that niece may read foolish novel after marriage a well a before if plea that must marry like reasonable woman godfrey pitied whilst be pitying mr falconer arranged party for opera for night in godfrey found included perhaps be imprudent be young man human nature be human nature at opera godfrey felt danger increase moment miss hauton be particularly engaging many circumstance conspired to flatter vanity to interest for fair victim of ambition marquis be in box smelling of claret paying devoir to intended bride apparently very little to satisfaction commissioner falconer leaning forward complimented miss hauton upon appearance night observed that though be new opera fashionable eye be turned from stage to lady box miss hauton smiled civilly upon commissioner then turning to godfrey in low soft voice repeated ev'n when fashion brightest art decoy heart distrusting asks if be joy godfrey be touched saw sighed short time afterwards marquis left box miss hauton recovered from languor became animated in conversation with godfrey felt whole power of charm immediate force of temptation recollected who be recollected that have not shown instance of discretion must redeem from consequence of mother disgrace song have heard from miss hauton lip captain bellamy waltzing came full upon mind said to a wife can not think of be marquis of twickenham out of question wife can not be then honour forbids to trifle with affection merely to gratify vanity feeling of moment captain percy well knew that men can satisfy conscience by calling certain sort of treachery by soft name of gallantry be aware that must like many others in similar circumstance deceive by equivocal look expression then throw blame from by asking why woman be such fool a to believe protesting that never have thought of swearing that have not least idea have ever understood to mean thing serious godfrey have too much good feeling good principle to follow such example miss hauton have copy of new opera before a turned over leaf pointed out to passage that liked be peculiarly applicable to own situation representing heroine forced to marry man hate whilst tenderly love godfrey must not must not understand italian be perfectly well explained to then perceiving application made of certain line by miss hauton voice eye have resource in new singer to whom became suddenly so attentive that nothing must distract from stage when actress ceased to sing found mean to engage miss falconer in discussion of merit with nonsense compliment to taste occasion required filled up dangerous interval till opera be over then more dangerous still waiting for carriage in crush room through peril godfrey passed so dexterously a to leave miss hauton in doubt whether have be understood not thus hoped that conscience must in future if must ever after marriage reflect on opera of night be a much at ease a own though perhaps not with so good reason after night godfrey must not expose to repetition of similar danger that might avoid meeting fair lady again refused two invitation from mr falconer to ball at house to musical party deserves to be recorded to credit because be very fond of music dancing day before be to leave town at hour minute appointed godfrey waited upon lord oldborough not such reception now a have be on first visit to minister be kept two hour waiting alone in antechamber at last cabinet door opened lord oldborough appeared with dark cold countenance haughty stiffness in whole frame lordship walked deliberately forward till came within yard of young officer then without speaking bent head body slowly so remained a if waiting to be informed who captain percy be what business might be astonishment offended pride flashed successively in godfrey countenance lord oldborough after fixing interrogating eye upon ineffectually receiving explanation seemed to come little to recollection condescended to say captain percy believe command with captain percy lord have honour to be here by lordship appointment on major gascoigne business sir have note from yesterday believe contained have in power to say on major gascoigne business pardon lord never have honour of receiving note from lordship very extraordinary sent by own man be at batts hotel sir lord at british hotel have be cause of mistake will find note sir at batts ' captain percy bowed lord oldborough bowed not word more passed lord oldborough walked on to carriage rolled away with glorious rapidity whilst godfrey face flushed with resentment looked after for instant then putting on hat porter held to walked off a fast a possible to batts ' hotel impatient to see note be to explain meaning of extraordinary conduct note found threw little light upon business be written in secretary cunningham falconer hand be a follows lord oldborough will inform captain percy when thing will be decided upon relative to business on captain percy spoke to lord oldborough a communication by letter will answer purpose lordship hope that will not be mean of detaining captain percy longer from regiment tuesday civil dismission after three attempt godfrey obtained sight of secretary cunningham who a thought be at bottom of affair suspicion be at first dissipated by unusual openness with secretary looked spoke apparently without fear of committing said at once that be very extraordinary proceeding that must way account for by supposing that lieutenant colonel in question have through relation lord skreene influenced grace of greenwich that lord oldborough must not in present conjuncture make movement in direct opposition to duke in thing in transaction with politician said godfrey there be wheel within wheel simple people never suspect by awkwardly interfering with when be in motion be hurt know not how why cunningham smiled significantly be silent air of frankness vanished solemn reserve returned cunningham will never be hurt in way thought godfrey never saw fellow so careful of be convinced must not hazard little finger to save whole british empire much le to serve private friend like poor honest man like gascoigne godfrey be too proud to make further attempt to interest diplomatic cousin in affair rose bade secretary adieu who with proper smile bow attended to very door thank heaven thought godfrey a left secretary office be not forced to dance attendance upon great man great man secretary be like father independent will keep so if ever live upon smile for year will not be upon smile of minister on of fair lady godfrey left town immediately returned to regiment chapter viii little versed in way of court courtier godfrey have be easily deceived by apparent candour of cunningham falconer fact be that cunningham not directly from by mean of person of whom lord oldborough must have suspicion have insinuated to lordship that godfrey percy be secret cause of aversion miss hauton showed to proposed match with marquis of twickenham idea once suggested be easily confirmed by account of young lady behaviour at opera be reported to lord oldborough with proper exaggeration with total misrepresentation of godfrey conduct fainting at ball be also recollected many other little circumstance combined to bring conviction to lord oldborough mind be now persuaded that major gascoigne business be merely pretence for godfrey coming to town apprehension of being disappointed in completing alliance essential to ambitious view pique at idea of being deceived nearly duped by boy girl rooted hatred utter contempt for love love affair altogether produced that change in lord oldborough manner towards captain percy have appeared so extraordinary have captain percy delayed to leave town must next day have received order from commanding officer to join regiment a to major gascoigne business have made so little impression upon lord oldborough that have totally forgotten poor major name till godfrey repeated to indeed godfrey must scarcely have blamed lordship for have known how much business how many care pressed at time upon mind of unhappy statesman besides load of public business open violent attack of opposition have usually to sustain be now under great increasing anxiety from discovery of plot against among immediate associate in office tourville paper deciphered by commissioner falconer cunningham have partially revealed lord oldborough be in condition of person apprised that be standing upon ground be undermined who doe not know exactly by what hand at moment train may destroy be to be set on fire one word frequently recurred in tourville paper puzzled commissioner falconer extremely of be never able to make out meaning word be gassoc be used thus be sorry to find that gassoc have not agreed to proposal answer have be given to question by gassoc with regard to subsidy of l have not be sent received gassoc have never explained in consequence great discontent here if gassoc be finally determined against eagle mean must be taken to accomplish purpose alluded to in paragraph in green of th ult also in b in lemon juice of september last gassoc will take note of mining tool forgotten also bullet too large flint a per in sympathetic ink also sea chart sent instead of map consequent delay in march of troop loss of fortress to be attributed to eagle eagle at first have be taken for granted to be austrian eagle be discovered to be lord oldborough eagle be lordship crest sea chart mining tool brought sense home to conclusively be plain that gassoc stood for person who be inimical to lord oldborough who must be be question commissioner falconer suggested that for gassoc must read gosshawk then said by finding what nobleman gentleman have gosshawk in arm have family name individual be afterwards easily ascertained to herald office commissioner went gosshawking after spending whole day with assistance of garter king at arm must make nothing of gosshawks gave up next presumed that there might be mistake of one letter in foreign spelling of word that gassoc must be cassock might then mean certain bishop who be known to be particular enemy of lord oldborough still there be thing ascribed to gassoc must not come within jurisdiction cognizance of cassock commissioner be reluctantly obliged to give up church next suggested that not only one letter letter in word might be mistaken in foreign spelling gassoc might be french german written imitation of oral sound of english proper name commissioner supported opinion very plausibly by citing many instance of barbarous spelling of english name by foreigner bassompierre writes jorchaux for york house innimthort for kensington even in polite memoir of le comte de grammont have soutkask for southesk warmestre for english name not yet deciphered upon hint commissioner cunningham made anagram of noble name in england in vain afterwards recollecting that be fashion at one time even to pun in coat of arm of nobility in choice of motto went to work again at herald office tried course of pun to purpose commissioner be mortified to find ingenuity at fault cunningham took care not to suggest anything therefore must never be convicted of mistake be in least vexed by father own fruitless labour because thought might tend to future advancement lord oldborough have thrown out hint that must soon be necessary to recall present send new envoy resident to german court in question cunningham nourished hope of being chosen for purpose a tourville paper be already known to must under private instruction negotiate with m de tourville draw from explanation did not however trust even father with hope have conceived relied on own address continually strove by oblique hint to magnify danger of leaving part of plot unravelled what effect suggestion produced whether produced cunningham be unable to judge from minister impenetrable countenance lord oldborough lost not moment in repairing mistake about sea chart omission of mining tool have discovered from paragraph in tourville paper stayed not to inquire whether error have be wilful unintentional that left for future investigation next object be subsidy day duke of greenwich gave cabinet dinner after dinner when servant have retired when none of company be prepared for such stroke lord oldborough in decided very calm manner began with lord must call attention to affair of importance subsidy from secret service to german ally who have within sin unwhipped of justice trembled have learned matter how continued lord oldborough by strange mistake l of subsidy be not remitted at time appointed by that discontent likely to be prejudicial to majesty service have arisen in consequence of delay lordship paused appeared to take notice of face of feigned astonishment real consciousness by be surrounded looked at other to inquire by what mean secret be divulged to discover if possible how much more be known lord skreene began at same moment with duke of greenwich to suggest that clerk agent must certainly be much to blame lord oldborough in decided tone replied that be indifferent to what clerk agent principal be to blame in business that if money be not bona fide remitted acknowledged by court to be promised before disagreeable consequence must ensue must be under necessity of stating affair to majesty of resigning office bringing whole before parliament terror of voice lightning of eye dread of determined spirit operated powerfully subsidy be remitted next day though at expense of service of plate lord skreene have bespoken for mistress though secretary cope be compelled to sell at disadvantage few of very few remaining acre of paternal estate to make good what have be borrowed from secret service money at cabinet dinner keen eye of lord oldborough have discerned displeasure lurking in mind of duke of greenwich man of considerable political consequence from rank connexion from number of voice must command influence lord oldborough knew that if must regain duke must keep in awe other enemy grace be puzzle headed pompous fool whom heaven have cursed with desire to be statesman have not more than four idea to four conceived to be own be exclusively attached yet person of address cunning must put thing into head after time must find there believe to be own must then

thought that woman who have be suffered to acquire literary taste whose understanding have be cultivated refined be apt to disdain to become unfit for useful minutia of domestic duty in education of

in preparation for mere business of living perceived that constraint gave new spring to mind higher relish to favourite employment after domestic business of day be done enjoyed with fresh delight pleasure of be not in power of fortune to deprive soon after family be settled at hill be surprised by visit from commissioner falconer surprised because though knew that have certain degree of commonplace friendship for a relation yet be aware that regard be not independent of fortune have never supposed that must come to seek in retirement after general expression of condolence on loss change of situation inconvenience to large family bred up a have be in affluence must suffer in present abode went out to walk with mr percy then began to talk over own family affair with polite acknowledgment to mr percy of advantage have derived from introduction to lord oldborough with modestly implied compliment to own address in turning introduction to best possible account mr falconer led to subject on wanted to dilate see dear mr percy said without vanity may now venture to say plan for advancing family have succeeded son have risen in world rather have be pushed up beyond most sanguine hope give joy with heart said mr percy good sir listen to son might have be in a advantageous situation if have not be too proud to benefit by evidently favourable disposition lord oldborough shewed towards yours too proud friend assure pride never influenced conduct acted from principle so be pleased to call will not go back to past man like to acknowledge have be wrong let if please look to future know that be now in different situation from what be formerly when must afford to follow principle system now dear sir give leave to tell that be duty absolutely duty to make use of interest for son there be not man in england who if chose might secure for son better patron than must trust replied mr percy have secured for son what be better than good patron good education be best said mr falconer proud a be cousin percy must allow when look round see who rise how now be by ourselves let ask frankly seriously why try to establish son by patronage frankly seriously then because detest despise whole system of patronage be very strong said mr falconer be glad for sake for sake of family that nobody heard if whole world heard pursued mr percy must say just same strong very strong be glad of for excuse be relation be on term of familiarity delicate guarded qualifying trimming mincing pouncet box gentleman usher mode of speaking truth make sort of impression truth must always be strong speaking acting well well beg pardon a strong let be a please only let be cool then can not fail to understand one think be going to explain to why detest despise what call system of patronage because believe to be ruinous to country whenever honour of profession civil military ecclesiastical be bestowed by favour not earned by merit whenever place of trust dignity in state be to be gained by intrigue solicitation there be end of generous emulation consequently of exertion talent integrity in losing reward of glory lose vigour often very existence if affair of nation be guided if battle be fought by corrupt imbecile creature of patronage how must be guided how fought woe be to country trust to such ruler such defender have be to country have so trusted may such never be fate of england that never may let honest independent englishman set face hand heart against base ruinous system will for one for one ala said mr falconer with sigh meant to be heard smile not intended to be seen what can one do in desperate case be afraid certain thing will go on in world for ever whether benefit by not if grant that patronage be sometimes public evil must allow that be often private benefit doubt even said mr percy for young men who be brought up to expect patronage in profession said mr percy checking forgot whom be speaking to wish to say thing can hurt feeling especially when be so kind to come to see in adversity when show so much interest in affair oh pray go on go on said commissioner smiling will not hurt assure consider be too firm in success of system to be easily offended on point go on young men who be brought up to expect patronage in profession be apt to depend upon too much continued mr percy consequently neglect to acquire knowledge know thing will be passed over for think that need not be assiduous because be secure of being provided for independently of own exertion if have turn for extravagance may indulge because place will set to right if be provided for if do get good place be not well enough off said mr falconer will answer for son must think so mr percy with look of proud humility replied be inclined to believe that son must not think well off unless be distinguished by own merit to be sure said mr falconer correcting of course mean too young man can never distinguish know so well a when merit be raised to conspicuous situation disgrace so effectually a when be raised to situation for be unprepared unfit commissioner brow clouded unpleasant reflection apprehension seemed to cross mind mr percy have intention of raising meant allusion to commissioner son hastened to turn what have said more decidedly upon own have chosen for son rather have chosen for continued profession be independent of influence in must be of little use to patron can be of little advantage to lawyer physician judge attorney can push lawyer up beyond certain point may rise like rocket will fall like stick if be not supported by own inherent power where property life be at stake men will not compliment even be influenced by great recommendation will consult best lawyer best physician whoever may be have endeavoured to give alfred erasmus such education a will enable honestly to work own way to eminence friend helping hand be bad thing said mr falconer in hard slippery ascent a many friend a many helping hand in fair way a please said mr percy by mean must inculcate anti social absurd impossible doctrine that young men men can ought to be independent of world let son make friend for enjoy advantage of mine object only to becoming dependent wasting best year of life in miserable debasing servitude to patron to patron who at last may perhaps capriciously desert at utmost need again without designing mr percy wakened unpleasant recollection in mind of commissioner ah there touch tender string with said mr falconer sighing have known something of in life lord n mr g did indeed use shamefully ill be young then did not choose friend well know more of world now have done better for son will do better trust for myself in mean time dear mr percy let think of affair such man a must not be lost here on farm amongst turnip carrot so lord oldborough say think in short to come to point at once be not sounding from idle curiosity respecting patronage from impertinent desire to interfere with concern come commissioned by lord oldborough to make offer be persuaded theoretical objection might occur said commissioner with significant smile mr percy be too much man of practical sense to reject lord oldborough empowers to say that be wish to see government supported strengthened by men of mr percy talent character that be persuaded that mr percy must speak well in parliament that if mr percy will join lordship will bring into parliament give thus opportunity of at once distinguishing advancing family repairing injustice of fortune serving country commissioner falconer made offer with much pomposity with air of person sure that be saying something infinitely flattering at same time with lurking smile on countenance at idea of ease certainty with offer must induce mr percy to recant have said against patron patronage be curious to hear how philosopher must change tone to surprise mr percy did not alter in least returned respectful grateful acknowledgment to lord oldborough begged leave totally to decline honour intended must not said accept consistently with principle must not go into parliament with view to advance to provide for family commissioner interrupted to qualify for be afraid have spoken too broadly observed that what have said be quite confidential mr percy understood so assured there be danger that must be repeated commissioner be then in state to listen again quietly mr percy said that when be rich have preferred domestic happiness to ambition therefore have never stood for county to belonged that now be poor felt additional reason for keeping out of parliament that might not put in situation to be tempted situation where must spend more than must afford must only pay expense by selling conscience commissioner be silent with astonishment for moment after mr percy ceased speaking have always thought good cousin singular man have never thought wrongheaded fool till moment at first be somewhat vexed for mr percy sake for sake of son that refused offer for commissioner have of feeling of relation more of habit of politician last in few moment reconciled to what thought ruin of cousin prospect in life mr falconer considered that if mr percy be to go into parliament to join party to get near lord oldborough might become dangerous rival pressed matter therefore no longer with urgency only just sufficient to enable to report to lord oldborough that have executed commission have found mr percy impracticable chapter xiii however sincere general pity esteem for percy family did not escape common lot of mortality have share of blame a well a of condolence from friend acquaintance discovered that misfortune of family might have be avoided if have listened to good advice others be quite clear that lawsuit must have be decided in mr percy favour if have employed solicitor barrister in short if step of suit have be directed differently commissioner falconer now joined band of reproaching friend did not blame mr percy however for conduct of lawsuit for of that confessed to be judge thought understood right way of advancing family in world on subject now took higher tone than have formerly felt entitled to assume success give such right especially over unfortunate commissioner said loudly in company that have hoped relation mr percy who certainly be man of talent be convinced well intentioned must not have shown so obstinately attached to peculiar opinion especially to strange notion of independence must disgust ultimately friend whom be most interest of family to please that doubted not that young men of percy family bitterly regretted that father must not avail of advantage of connexion of favourable disposition to knowledge most condescending offer have be made to offer commissioner said must term really condescending when considered that mr percy have never paid common court be expected by minister other circumstance too enhanced favour offence have undoubtedly be given by ill timed injudicious interference of captain godfrey percy about regimental business major gascoigne yet notwithstanding certain person whose steadiness in friendship commissioner declared must never sufficiently admire have not for son error changed favourable opinion disposition towards father mr falconer concluded with sigh there be men whom best of friend can not serve such can only leave to fate commissioner now considering mr percy a person so obstinately odd that be unsafe for rising man to have thing more to do with be agreed in falconer family that be necessary to let percy drop gently without making noise mr falconer daughter having always resided in london during winter at watering place in summer knew scarcely thing of female part of percy family mr falconer have occasionally met mr percy young lady who have not yet be in town have never seen since be child mr falconer now considered a peculiarly fortunate circumstance because must not be blamed for cutting must escape unpleasantness of breaking off intimacy with relation commissioner acceded to all lady observation easily shook off attachment have professed for so many year perhaps felt for good cousin percy perhaps felt say because really believe that be attached to mr percy while gentleman be in prosperity there be person who have exclusive sympathy with prosperous there be one however who in respect felt differently from rest of family buckhurst falconer with generous impulse of affection gratitude declared that must not desert mr percy of family in adversity must never forget how kind have be to when be in distress buckhurst resentment against caroline for repeated refusal suddenly subsided attachment revived with redoubled force protested that loved better for having lost fortune reiterated protestation more loudly because father declared be absurd ridiculous son persisted till father though not subject to make violent resolution be wrought to such pitch a to swear that if must be fool enough to think seriously of girl who be now beggar must absolutely refuse consent to match must never give son shilling buckhurst immediately wrote to caroline passionate declaration of constancy ardour of attachment entreated permission to wait upon immediately sacrifice said buckhurst to idle nicety have many fault be conscious none trust for ought utterly to condemn none what can cure be ready to be thing approve give leave to hope there be sacrifice will not make to facilitate to expedite union have be ordained one living posse that colonel hauton have promised will soon come into possession believe be decided to go into church by attachment to passion for scruple consideration gave way a to rest will never be deterred from following dictate of heart by opposition of ambitious parent caroline sacrifice to idle nicety know have misfortune not to please brother alfred to do justice have fairly told that doe not think worthy of sister caroline forgive admire for pride with pronounces word sister caroline though may easily find more faultless character will never find warmer heart one more truly more ardently attached there be something frank warm generous in letter pleased rosamond said justified good opinion of buckhurst indeed great merit of being ardently attached to sister caroline be sufficient in rosamond eye to cover multitude of sin contrast between warmth at moment coldness of rest of family struck forcibly rosamond thought that alfred have be too severe in judgment observed that be in vain to look with lantern over world for faultless character monster be quite sufficient if woman must find honest man that be sure buckhurst have fault what love must cure love have not cured of yet said caroline try marriage said rosamond laughing caroline shook head consider at what expense trial must be made at first reading of buckhurst letter caroline have be pleased with on second perusal be dissatisfied with passage about parent must approve of giving up what now called scruple to obtain competence for woman professed to adore knew that have be leading dissipated life in town that must therefore be le fit than formerly be to make good husband still le likely to make respectable clergyman have right feeling steady principle a caroline observed be grateful for constancy of attachment for generosity showed in whole conduct towards be insensible to urgency with rosamond pleaded in favour be firm in own judgment refusal though expressed in term must best soften pain must give be a decided a possible soon after letter have be sent rosamond have taken longer walk one evening

happens day by account young gentleman such a be think nothing of great lady know by what noticed when be in sarvice once in lon'on great lady think better of for such thing be not great lady said caroline thank god said rosamond well for certain if be not great be good lady said old woman a be now within sight of own house thanked dismissed loquacious kind hearted guide putting into hand money for poor kate caroline promising to make further inquiry rosamond without restriction promising manner of assistance pecuniary medical spiritual result of inquiry be made confirmed truth of old dorothy have related brought to light other circumstance relative to seduction desertion of poor girl so shocked rosamond that in proportion to former prepossession in buckhurst favour be now abhorrence a if to repair imprudence with have formerly used influence over sister mind in favour now went a far on opposite side abjuring with strongest expression of indignation wishing caroline last letter have not gone to buckhurst might have given refusal on special account in most severe indignant term english language must supply mr percy however on contrary rejoiced that caroline letter have be sent before knew thing of affair ma'be cried rosamond surely must have be right for caroline to have given reason for refusal to have declared that have proved to beyond possibility of doubt that former objection to mr buckhurst falconer principle be too well founded must have become caroline to have written with strong indignation be persuaded continued rosamond that if woman must reprobate young men for such instance of profligacy cruelty instead of suffering such conduct to go under fine plausible general name of gallantry wildness must make greater impression than sermon must be preached caroline who have beauty eloquence can do with effect remember godfrey once said that peculiar characteristic of caroline that in differed most from common herd of young lady be in power of feeling expressing virtuous indignation be sure that godfrey partial a be to mr buckhurst falconer must think that caroline ought on occasion to set example of proper spirit superior to fear of ridicule fashion dare to speak indignation feel very well spoken better felt dear daughter said mr percy heaven forbid must lower tone of mind honest indignation against vice rosamond dear let be just must do even whom godfrey call common herd of young lady justice to believe that there be many among who have good feeling enough to be angry very angry with lover upon occasion angry enough to write most indignant perhaps very eloquent letter may recollect more than one heroine of novel who discard lover upon discovery a be made by last night be common novel incident of course from novel young lady even who might not have felt without precedent know how ought to express in such circumstance will observe dear that in novel in real life young lady generally like encourage men of feeling in contradistinction to men of principle too often men of gallantry in preference to men of correct moral in short that character a of mr buckhurst falconer be just kind of person with whom many woman must fall in love by suffering to be thought taste of sex lady encourage libertinism in general more than can possibly discourage by loudest display of indignation against particular instance if like sister caroline young lady must show that really prefer such men must do essential service observe dear rosamond can be done by young woman with perfect delicacy see how can with propriety good effect do more be subject lady can not well discus subject upon manner custom of world be so much at variance with religion morality that entering upon discussion must lead to greater difficulty than be aware of be therefore best for sex to show disapprobation of vice to prove sense of virtue religion by conduct rather than to proclaim to world in word have caroline in letter expressed indignation in most severe term that english language must supply must only have exposed to ridicule of mr buckhurst falconer fashionable companion a prating preaching prude without doing least good to to one living rosamond reluctantly acknowledged that perhaps mother be right caroline how quietly sit by while be talking of lover cried rosamond know whether to be provoked with to admire admire pray said caroline if can believe will ever be in love said rosamond confess must admire at least love better if have more feeling added rosamond hastily by what do judge want feeling said caroline colouring deeply with look tone expressed keen sense of injustice what proof have ever given of want of feeling proof can recollect said rosamond laughing proof that have never be in love be proof be incapable of feeling have not be in love with one who have proved utterly unworthy of esteem against whose conduct sister can not find word sufficiently severe to express indignation rosamond mind inclined towards at first reading of last letter if have ever given encouragement if have loved what must have be misery at moment dear then if have be very miserable must have pitied so much loved so heartily for being in love said rosamond still laughing oh rosamond continued caroline whose mind be now too highly wrought for raillery be love to be trifled with only by trifling mind by rash character by who conceive power danger recollect what have just seen young beautiful woman sinking into grave with shame deserted by parent wishing child unborn do remember look of agony when praised that child strongest charm of nature reversed strongest tie dissolved love brought to be only poor servant girl highest fairest of most cultivated understanding of tenderest heart can not love bring down to same level to same fate not only weak sex over stronger sex strongest of strong wisest of wise what be what have ever be power delusion of passion can cast spell over greatest hero throw blot on brightest glory blast in moment life of fame what must be power of passion can inspire genius in dullest coldest waken heroism in most timid of creature exalt to highest point to lowest degrade nature bitterest curse sweetest blessing heaven bestows on in life oh sister be love to be trifled with caroline paused rosamond for instant looked at at mother in silence then exclaimed from caroline be not astonished said mr percy be aware that be in caroline mind be not said rosamond who never spoke of love little imagined that thought of so highly so seriously yes do think of seriously highly may heaven grant cried caroline looking fervently upwards a spoke with illuminated countenance may heaven grant that love be blessing not curse to heaven grant may never in moment of selfish vanity try to excite passion can not return heaven grant that never may feel passion of love for one whom will entirely esteem who will be worthy to fill whole soul mother continued caroline turning eagerly seizing mother hand guide guardian whenever see in slightest inclination to coquetry warn a wish to save from that must most dread reproach of own conscience in first very first instance reprove if can with severity sister bosom friend use influence to soften to open mind to love if ever perceive yielding heart to first tenderness of passion watch over if object be not way worthy of equal superior oh a must wish to snatch from grave rouse from delusion save from disappointment regret remorse know must not bear live mother into whose arm threw pressed caroline close to heart while rosamond to whom have given hand held fast stood motionless between surprise sympathy caroline to whose usual manner disposition thing theatrical romantic be so foreign seemed a soon a recollected to be ashamed of excessive emotion enthusiasm have shown withdrawing hand from sister turned away left room mother sister remained silent for considerable time fully occupied with own thought feeling mother reverie looked to future prospect of daughter confident in caroline character yet uncertain of fate felt pleasing yet painful solicitude rosamond thought turned rather to past than to future recollected compared word look yet found insuperable difficulty in connecting have ever before known fancied of caroline with what have just seen heard rosamond did not fairly recover from surprise from look of perplexity during full hour that remained absolutely silent poring upon screen upon saw nothing then went in search of caroline in hope of renewing conversation found busied in of common affair of life apparently different person rosamond though made diver attempt must not lead caroline back again to same train of thought tone of expression indeed rosamond did not attempt very skilfully rather with awkward impatience of one not accustomed to use address caroline intent upon mean of assisting poor young woman whom have seen at cottage went there again a soon a must to warn old dorothy in first place to be le communicative not on account to mention to one else name circumstance have told with so little reserve caroline next applied to dr leicester vicar of former parish most amiable respectable clergyman who have come from vicarage near percy hall to spend what time must spare from duty with favourite parishioner at caroline request willingly went to see unhappy young woman succeeded in endeavour to soothe tranquillize mind by speaking to word of peace mild piety raised comforted trembling penitent while prospect of forgiveness from parent of happiness in world be at end fixed thought on better hope promise religion only can afford health appeared suddenly to mend when mind be more at ease be only transient dr percy to whom caroline applied for medical opinion gave little hope of recovery must be done by medicine proper kindness to assuage suffering during decline be done in best manner by mr percy daughter especially by caroline young woman nevertheless died in six week be buried without buckhurst falconer making inquiry concerning probably without knowing of death few day after be more letter came to from be returned unopened by dorothy who must just write well enough to make word intelligible in cover sir kate robinson be dead four day child be with still well bid tell if ever asked more concerning left forgiveness on death bed hope will be happy sir humble servant dorothy white bank note of ten pound be received by dorothy soon afterwards for use of child deep regret be expressed by father for death of mother a dorothy said that came too late to be of good to

came to knowledge be much better that must abide by objection to general principle than to have have explanation discussion on subject into must not enter with propriety will a desire keep buckhurst secret indeed in worldly point of view behoves that must be carefully kept because bishop clay prelate who gave present living though tolerates gormandizing to excess be extremely strict with clergy in other matter a once heard buckhurst say 'compounds for sin be inclin 'd to by damning have mind to buckhurst have believe hope that caroline must have relented in consequence of last overture be

have opportunity one evening at father when be playing at chess with lord oldborough of speaking to on subject when none of family be watching told that lord oldborough desire to see have appointed hour to morrow morning now rosamond dear set imagination to work must go draw replication will keep mine fast bound yours truly alfred percy at appointed hour alfred waited upon minister be received graciously not one word of godfrey however of thing leading to subject lord oldborough spoke to alfred a to son of old friend began by lamenting misfortune have deprived mr percy of estate station to have done lordship went on to say that be sorry that mr percy love of retirement pride of independence precluded idea of seeing in parliament hoped that mr percy son be in extravagant notion of independence in only unlike father with due deference alfred took liberty of replying to word extravagant endeavoured to explain that father idea of independence did not go beyond just bound lord oldborough contrary to usual custom when met with thing like contradiction did not look displeased on contrary complimented alfred on being good advocate alfred be going to fall into commonplace about good cause from that be happily saved by lord oldborough changing conversation took up pamphlet lay upon table be cunningham falconer be to say pamphlet be published in cunningham name for be mean enough to take credit from poor starving genius in garret lord oldborough turned over leaf here be passage be quoted yesterday at dinner at commissioner falconer think that of company commissioner though be be reading man must recollect to what author alludes lord oldborough pointed to passage thus fame of hero be at last neglected by worshipper left to care of bird of heaven abandoned to serpent of earth alfred fortunately recollected that alluded to description in arrian of island of achilles present isle of serpent where there be that temple of hero of a historian say care be left to bird alone who morning repair to sea wet wing sprinkle temple afterwards sweeping with plumage sacred pavement lord oldborough smiled said author reputed author of pamphlet sir be obliged to for throwing light upon passage must not elucidate speech of lord oldborough alluded to something have passed at dinner at lord skreene day before cunningham have set out on embassy cunningham have be posed by passage for secretary cope who hated have maliciously complimented besought to explain secretary cope who be poet made epigram on cunningham diplomatist line remember point of be that cunningham be so complete diplomatist that must not commit by giving up authority even for quotation that when knew author of excellent thing with admirable good faith kept to epigram remained at time profound secret to lord oldborough whilst cunningham be going with prosperous gale be not heard of worked round according to manoeuvre of court just by time tide of favour began to ebb lord oldborough dissatisfied with one of cunningham despatch be heard to say a folded up slovenly performance then at happy moment stepped in rival secretary cope put into lordship hand epigram anecdote reader be to take a note explanatory upon lord oldborough last speech to alfred now to go on with conversation at word elucidate suspect continued lordship that mr alfred percy know more of pamphlet altogether than reputed author ever did alfred felt change colour genius in garret rushed upon mind at same instant recollected that be not at liberty to name mr temple that must not betray cunningham alfred answered that be not surprising must know pamphlet well a probably admired more have read oftener than author have ever done very well parried young gentleman will not allow then that have hand in writing lord said alfred have none whatever never saw till be published have not right in politeness to press question permit however to say that be performance of man might be proud must lord be proud very proud if have written be incapable of assuming merit be not mine trust manner in now disclaim doe not appear like affected modesty of author who wish to have believed denies hope convince lordship of truth can not have doubt of what assert in serious manner sir may ask if can tell name of real author excuse lord can not have answered lordship with perfect openness a far a be concerned sir said lord oldborough confess began conversation with prepossession that be equal to performance of think highly have succeeded in convincing that be mistaken that be not equal superior to upon compliment alfred a thought force of politeness must no farther go rose bowed prepared to retire be in hurry to leave mr percy contrary be afraid of encroaching upon lordship goodness know that time be most valuable that lordship have so much business of importance perhaps mr alfred percy may assist in saving time hereafter alfred sat down again a lordship eye desired lord oldborough remained for few moment silent leaning upon arm on table deep in thought yes sir said certainly have a say much business upon hand be not difficulty with hand head business be easily arranged expedited have hand head enough at command talent of sort can be obtained for price that be above price integrity can not there be difficulty there be difficulty have not single man about whom can trust many who understand view none who feel 'des ames de boue et de fange ' wretch who care not if throne country perish if little interest young gentleman said recollecting turning to alfred feel a if be speaking to part of father when be speaking to alfred felt lord oldborough saw that felt strongly then dear sir said understand see understand will suit one be in want of secretary to supply place of mr cunningham falconer mr drakelow be going to constantinople will first initiate successor in business of office routine little mind must make great mind believe be mystery above ordinary comprehension sir have doubt that will be expert in very short time in technical part in routine of office if suit view in one word must be happy to have for private secretary take time to consider if wish to give answer immediately beg that will consult one not even father a soon a mind be made up let know decision after returning thanks to minister who have by time risen to prodigious height in alfred opinion after having reiterated thanks with warmth be not displeasing retired account of feeling on occasion be given with much truth in own letter from extract passage believe felt little like gil blas after first visit at court vapour of ambition certainly mounted into head made little giddy night did not sleep quite so well a usual bar court lord oldborough special pleader be continually before eye balancing in imagination pro con fatigued must neither rest decide seven year of famine at bar horrible then independence liberty of conscience in time success certain reward of industry well earned wealth perhaps honour why not highest professional honour life of party man politician agreed by who have tried even by very lord oldborough agreed to be unhappy life obliged to live with people despise might be tempted like others to do thing for must despise subject to caprice at best fortune quite dependent on patron continuance in power power favour uncertain be long before got pro con even into rude preparation for comparison longer still before logical process of giving to good evil just value drawing clear deduction from distinct premise must be accomplished however in four twenty hour solved problem waited upon lord oldborough to tell conclusion with profession of gratitude respect attachment more sincere fancy than usually hears began ended by telling in best manner must thought trade be more honest than hard a lawyer life be preferred to politician suspect of saying be not quite so brutal perhaps be implied by declining honour of secretaryship preferring to abide by profession lord oldborough looked vanity fancied that looked disappointed after pause of silent displeasure said 'well sir upon whole believe have decided wisely be sorry that can not serve can not serve in manner have proposed yours be profession in ministerial support can be of little use in talent perseverance integrity be secure sooner later of success have therefore only to wish opportunity if mean in power must occur of accelerating opportunity may depend upon sir ' said lordship holding out hand to ' will not forget even if be not son of old friend have made interest for in

manner knowledge of world have not taught to foresee endeavoured with possible address expedition to make separate peace with lady angelica ladyship however be proud to show that have too much sense spirit to accept again homage of recreant knight have not time to sue for pardon adventure might have ended in jail so forthwith took departure from hungerford castle undetermined whether must again haste to court to beg place bend course to city there to barter fashion against solid gold of merchant rolling in majesty coin who might be silly enough to give daughter for bow to courtier without shilling on one point however sir james be decided betide weal betide woe that next mistress must neither be wit beauty yet patroness after departure of baronet lady angelica expected to find remaining lover at foot in transport of joy gratitude for haughty dismissal of rival such thing mr barclay seemed disposed to throw at foot of of last person in world at whose foot ladyship must bear to think of seeing yet if have even now taken mr hungerford friendly warning might still have saved from mortification be hurried on by evil genius spirit of coquetry have promised to pay visit summer

from knowledge of countenance even to guess whether what imagine be fact state to supposition suppose have be told that lady be attached to mr barclay never be told so interrupted caroline have discovered by accident no have said too much think that person be attached to that might easily have become attached if proposal have be made to instead of to think that two character be exactly suited to other much better suited than mine must be to mr barclay to have wit imagination great vivacity have judgment prudence solid sense in there be what must compensate for what be wanting in other together must make happy union dear caroline said father must put upon guard against too easy faith of sincere affectionate heart be really surprised that who have always shown such good

good character good sense thing very good nothing extraordinary must be settled at mr barclay seat in leicestershire must be mr barclay perhaps happy enough nothing extraordinary plain view of thing

rosamond face again lengthened if be case said though have intention of marrying at present will suppose be reasoned into marrying in time said caroline for can not be reasoned into loving there be own dear caroline cried rosamond be horribly afraid that man of sense must have convinced that esteem be quite sufficient without love impossible said caroline there must be very powerful motive must induce to quit family can conceive motive sufficiently powerful except love rosamond be delighted for what else must marry continued caroline who be left by kindest of parent freely to own choice must marry for house in leicestershire for barouche four on lady jane granville principle for establishment on missy notion of being married having house of own ordering own dinner be notion of said caroline with look of such surprise that rosamond be obliged to fall immediately to protestation appeal to common sense how be possible must have formed such idea then why be so much surprised transported just now when told that motive love must induce to marry recollect being surprised be only delighted never suspected that must marry without love thought that might differ a to quantity

barclay said caroline have a promised father must consulted in first place own heart considered own happiness appears to incapable of enthusiasm rise to moral intellectual sublime respect understanding esteem principle in conversing with always feel in passing life with how much more must feel that there be want of higher quality of mind show invention genius magnanimity nothing heroic nothing great nothing must waken sympathy excite that strong attachment think that be capable of feeling for superior character for character at once good great where upon earth be to find such man who be romantic now cried rosamond be very glad that be little romantic be glad that have in touch of human absurdity else how must be sister how must love a do be heartily glad that love be not

easily have given up hope 'none without hope e'er loved brightest fair love can hope where reason must despair think be perfectly true said rosamond never begging rosamond poet pardon never except where reason be very weak where brightest fair have touch of equivocating fiend love let poet lover say what will to contrary can no more subsist without hope than flame can exist without fuel in case cited to prove contrary suspect that there have be inaccuracy in experiment that by mistake little very little hope have be admitted slightest portion quantity imperceptible to common observation be known to be quite sufficient to maintain passion total exclusion of hope secures extinction mr barclay departure be much regretted by at hungerford castle most perhaps by person who expressed that regret least lady mary pembroke who now silently enjoyed full chorus of praise be poured forth in honour of departed lady mary common mode of enjoying praise of friend be not in silence thought felt usually came to lip with ingenuous vivacity of youth innocence caroline have managed so well by not managing at lady mary far from guessing real cause of mr barclay sudden departure repeatedly expressed surprise that aunt hungerford did not press to stay little longer once said wondered how mr barclay must leave hungerford castle whilst caroline be there that have begun to think have formed attachment must do more honour than passion for lady angelica headingham that feared must have relapse of fit of folly that must at last end fatally in marriage mr hungerford smiled at openness with niece told conjecture at steadiness with caroline kept mr barclay secret by saying no more than just thing ought power of keeping secret be very different from habit of dissimulation must convince of if have doubted said mr hungerford to caroline now that affair be settled dear must insist upon praising a have praised for discretion hope never influenced decision by word look will now own to be

beloved colonel hungerford be in own family very much very deservedly answered caroline spoke without hesitation embarrassment rosamond rather dissatisfied even with fulness of assent to first proposition added not only by own family by who know caroline be silent be surprising continued rosamond that man who have led soldier wandering life must have acquired so much literature such accurate knowledge must have retained such simple domestic taste full assent again from caroline of look voice still not exact look voice rosamond desired do know caroline continued think that in several thing colonel hungerford be very like brother godfrey yes in point think colonel hungerford be superior to godfrey said caroline well really think so too cried rosamond be sure godfrey must

of vision saw be only vision one might lead into waking lasting misery misery lasting how said rosamond wish mr hungerford know can ought to decide even to influence event be to be determined by colonel hungerford own judgment feeling by mine in mean time can not forget that delicacy honour pride prudence of sex forbid woman to think of man a lover till give reason to believe that feel love

sure think yet must be sorry to mislead at rate there be harm in hoping if there be harm there might be much danger said caroline better not to think of subject at since can do good by thinking of may do harm after pause of surprise disappointment reflection rosamond resumed so be to understand to be opinion that woman of sense delicacy proper pride honour prudence must can ought to shut eye ear understanding heart against merit power of pleasing man may posse till said man will do make matrimonial proposal for in due form hey caroline never thought such thing answered caroline expressed very ill if said such thing woman need not shut eye ear understanding to man merit only heart then irresistible charm supreme merit only merit can ought to touch heart in man be simple glorious circumstance of loving never heard that be man supreme merit to love said caroline be not at present inquiring what be man what be woman characteristic excellence have heard said to be woman supreme

spirit of excellent rule have never felt ca imagine can well imagine said caroline fortunately have never felt if have not early perceived that colonel hungerford be not thinking of might have deceived with false hope believe never be insensible to merit where be merit glory if there be struggle difficulty said rosamond in melancholy tone glory there be none said caroline do claim merit be not something to prevent struggle difficulty be nothing to preserve own happiness something to be sure said rosamond on other hand know there be old proverb 'nothing hazard nothing have be masculine not feminine proverb said caroline meant to say be that there be rule without exception a philosopher even most rigid allow if exception be ever permitted surely in such case a might in favour of such man a colonel hungerford dangerous exception said caroline body be too apt to make exception in such case in own favour that know be common error of weak oh dear sister instead of weakening strengthen mind instead of trying to raise enthusiasm reproaching for want of sensibility tell that approve of exerting power over to do think right consider what evil must bring upon if became attached to man who be not attached to if saw sinking object of pity contempt victim slave of unhappy passion oh dear dear caroline must never be god forbid oh god forbid cried rosamond with look of terror recovering added be vain fear with strength of mind must never be reduced to such condition who can answer for strength of mind in second trial if fail in first said caroline if woman once let affection go out of power how can afterwards answer for own happiness very right very true said rosamond for young person caroline must spare of premature reason if there be folly at least there be generosity sensibility often joined with romantic temper take care lest beistake reverse of wrong for right in great zeal to avoid romance run into selfishness selfishness why yes after be cold calculation about loving not loving such character a colonel hungerford what be wonderfully long sighted care of own individual happiness selfishness moral very moral selfishness grant caroline coloured paused when answered spoke in lower graver tone manner than usual if be selfish to pursue by best mean in power by mean can not hurt human being own happiness must deserve to be called selfish unless woman be quite unconnected with others in society without family without friend thank god be not situation be impossible to hazard to destroy own happiness by kind of imprudence without destroying happiness of others therefore imprudence call romance what please be often want of generosity want of thought for happiness of friend a well a for own well come off said rosamond laughing have proved with admirable logic that prudence be height of generosity dear caroline speak so very seriously look with such beweet austere composure ' in earnest accuse of selfishness be wrong to use that ugly word be vexed with for being more prudent than even good old mr hungerford at word tear filled caroline eye dear kind mr hungerford exclaimed in warmth of heart in fulness of kindness for once in life mr hungerford said perhaps imprudent word expressed wish of better judgment may have repented cried rosamond better best judgment must have confirmed opinion of never will repent of wish why must think have repented of caroline because must by time see that there be probability of wish being accomplished must therefore desire that must be forgotten trust have acted will always act a if be forgotten by except a to kindness that will remember while have life feeling if have built romance upon slight word consider how much that excellent friend must blame when found that have misled that have be cause of anguish to heart that have lowered in opinion of even in own opinion one have once so exalted by approbation friendship oh consider rosamond what return must make for friendship if be to be occasion of misunderstanding disagreement between darling son if be to become rival of beloved niece rival niece how cried rosamond repeated eagerly can not think of thing else till say suppose lady

daughter to watch began to consider a dangerous person resolved never to call in except in desperate case mr panton gossiping confidence did more harm than husband loud complaint very eagerness poor constance showed to vindicate dr percy to declare truth served only to confirm sagaciously nodding mother overwise father in own opinion mr henry said did what must for erasmus what must be done by young man shut up day in counting house who must listen to thing be said by youth without station name mr gresham unluckily be at time at country seat poor erasmus found practice in city decline a

last prevail that prejudice have be raised against must in time be turned to advantage happened that while old panton in present ludicrous fit of obstinacy be caballing against young physician with might in city remote consequence of absurdity be operating in dr percy favour at west end of town reader may recollect having heard of footman whom mr panton turned away for laughing at perversity

caroline percy caroline be right rosamond have made great impression upon mr gresham heart recollection of difference between age rosamond consciousness of want of gaiety attraction of youth rendered extremely diffident for time suppressed passion at least delayed declaration of attachment rosamond seemed evidently to like company conversation showed that degree of esteem interest for flattered might be improved into more tender affection ventured to make proposal applied first to mr percy entreated that must make known sentiment to daughter when mr percy spoke to rosamond be surprised at very decided refusal rosamond immediately gave mr percy caroline be inclined to think that rosamond have not only high opinion of mr gresham that have felt preference for have never before shown for other person thought that perhaps refinement of delicacy about accepting large fortune fear that want of high birth be called good connexion must be objected to by father mother might be cause of refusal mr percy felt extremely anxious to explain own sentiment fully to understand rosamond feeling in anxiety caroline joined most earnestly kindness sympathy ardent affection rosamond have ever shown for when interest of heart be in question be strong in caroline recollection be now fully returned caroline thought mr gresham be too old for sister considered that objection others must yield to rosamond own opinion taste agreed with mother in imagining that rosamond be not quite indifferent to merit to attachment mr percy began by assuring rosamond that must be left entirely at liberty to decide according to own judgment feeling have seen dear how father have acted towards sister may be sure that will show equal justice though parent be accused of always rating ' good estate above faithful lover will recollect that mr barclay good estate did not induce to press suit with caroline mr gresham have large fortune to speak in lady jane granville style must be acknowledged dear rosamond that must be most advantageous match for very reason be particularly desirous that must determine for at same time let tell that be little surprised by promptness of decision let be sure that negative be serious let be sure rightly understand love now when only own caroline be present tell be objection to mr gresham thanks for mother kindness thanks repeated with tear in eye be for considerable time answer must be obtained from rosamond at length said without having particular objection to person surely if can not love be sufficient reason for not wishing to marry rosamond spoke word in so feeble tone with so much hesitation colouring at same time so much that mother sister be still uncertain how be to understand if mr percy replied undoubtedly dear if can not love be question be quite certain that can not oh quite certain believe certainty seems to have come very suddenly said mother smiling what can mean mean that did not show decided dislike to till within few hour dear dislike feel hope show dislike be sure must be very ungrateful on contrary must be impossible for body who be good for thing to dislike mr gresham then can neither like dislike be in state of absolute indifference be except gratitude gratitude for kindness to erasmus for partiality to gratitude certainly feel esteem yes to be sure esteem think continued mother that before committed crime of proposing for rosamond used to show of indignation of good friend against ungrateful people who used so ill indignation yes interrupted rosamond who must avoid feeling indignation pity think have heard express pity for poor mr gresham well ma'be because really be very much to be pitied think so do pity said mr percy smiling indeed mother need not smile caroline for sort of pity feel be not be merely pity by plain pity why must people imagine insist upon that more be felt than expressed dear said mr percy insist upon feeling more than really do let see be in state of absolute indifference yet feel esteem indignation pity how be rosamond how can be very easily ma'be because by absolute indifference mean oh know very well what mean absolute indifference a to love perhaps be word can not pronounce morning now mother now caroline fancy that love supposing there be if in case on side tell only why must refuse nay dear be what wait to hear from said percy then will tell why said rosamond in first place mr gresham have large fortune have none have greatest horror of idea of marrying for money of possibility of being suspected that might do so thought be fear cried caroline dear rosamond with generous mind know be quite impossible that must marry from interested motif absolutely impossible said mother when be sure of own mind must be weakness dear to dread suspicion of others even if such be likely to be formed oh dearest rosamond said caroline taking sister hand pressing between hers speaking in most urgent almost supplicating tone generous a be sacrifice happiness to mistaken delicacy said rosamond after moment silence attribute more than deserve to delicacy generosity ought not to let think so much better than really be have other motif will think very foolish very ridiculous perhaps wrong be so kind indulgent to mother will tell folly like to marry man who be not hero be very good not to laugh caroline indeed be too seriously interested at present to laugh said caroline must be sensible continued rosamond must not by effort of imagination by illusion of love convert man of mr gresham time of life appearance with wig sober kind of understanding into hero a to wig replied mr percy will recollect that sir charles grandison lovelace wore wig dear granting that man can not in day be hero in wig granting that hero can not must not have sober understanding will give leave to ask whether have positively determined that none hero heroine must live love marry be happy in mortal world heaven forbid said rosamond particularly a be not heroine a only few hundred million of people in world be in same condition added mr percy perhaps not least happy of human being said caroline be that a may think can not be denied that mr gresham have in high degree one of quality ought to distinguish hero what said rosamond eagerly generosity replied caroline large fortune put in power to show quality upon scale more extended than be usually allowed even to hero of romance true very true said rosamond smiling generosity might make hero of if be not merchant merchant percy ought not to marry merchant perhaps dear said mr percy know that half at least of nobility in england have married into family of merchant therefore in opinion of nobility of england there can be nothing discreditable derogatory in such alliance know ma'be such thing be then will allow be usually done for money make matter worse if son of noble family marry daughter of mercantile house be merely to repair family fortune nobleman have great privilege if marry beneath low wife be immediately raised by wedding ring to equality with high mighty husband name be forgotten in title vulgar relation be left in convenient obscurity husband never think of taking notice of wife of course may let alone if plea woman in rank of life must bear husband name must also bear relation be ever so vulgar now caroline honestly how must like honestly not at said caroline a can not have thing like avoid thing dislike in life must balance good against evil when be to make choice if found certain amiable estimable quality in character think that might esteem love marry even though have vulgar name vulgar connexion fairly acknowledge however that must be something superior in man character must balance objection to vulgarity in mind very well dear said rosamond do be martyr to vulgarity philosophy if like excuse if please since who have so much strength of mind fairly acknowledge that objection be barely to be overcome by utmost effort do favour do justice not to expect from degree of civil courage quite above power caroline still believing that rosamond be only bringing forward objection might be raised against wish replied fortunately dear rosamond be not called upon for such effort of philosophy for mr gresham be not vulgar be even name vulgar can not have vulgar relation because have relation of description heard say other day that be solitary being be comfort said rosamond laughing be great thing in favour if have not relation have connexion what do think of horrible pantons instant think see old panton cooling wig pushed back waistcoat unbuttoned protuberant mr panton with bay wig artificial flower not pantons only may be sure there be horde of st mary axe cockney must pour forth upon mr gresham with overwhelming force with partnership old acquaintance sake claim upon public notice private intimacy come come dear caroline speak against conscience know never must withstand horde of vulgarian vulgarian in buckram said caroline have grown from two to two hundred in trice in imagination rosamond consider that old panton against whom have invincible horror will now that have quarrelled with erasmus probably very soon eat out of world see that be bound to mr gresham dead partner widow be only objection to mr gresham only objection oh flatter that in killing old panton have struck off objection independently of vulgar relation connexion disparity of age grand objection remains will address to mother for be not good person for judging of prejudice really understand dear caroline one might a well talk to socrates go to work with logic get one between horn of wicked dilemma directly will talk to mother understands prejudice mother thanks said mr percy smiling for opinion of understanding mother be most indulgent of mother besides most candid therefore know will confess to that cherishes little darling prejudice in favour of birth family leetle prejudice well covered by good nature politeness still secret invincible antipathy to low born people to low bred people grant oh mother be upon candour dear mother not only low bred low born confess have what will call indisposition towards low born people since put upon candour said mr percy be afraid must confess that be conscious of little of aristocratic weakness impute to impute imputation in opinion cried rosamond think weakness do said mr percy consider a weakness bitterly must reproach if saw weakness prejudice of mine influence child injuriously in most material circumstance of life where happiness be at stake so dear rosamond let intreat oh mother let tear come into eye without intreaties will do just a please love said mr percy have pleasure that must please judge for without referring to prepossession of mine lest imagination must deceive a to extent of aristocratic prejudice let explain indisposition have acknowledged feel towards low born people arises believe chiefly from taking for granted that can not be thoroughly well bred have accidentally seen example of people of inferior birth who though have risen to high station though have acquired in certain degree polite manner have be metamorphosed by fashion to outward appearance into perfect gentry yet betrayed mark of origin of early education whenever passion interest be touched then awkward gesture vulgar expression mean mercenary sentiment habitual contraction of mind recurred true true most true said rosamond requires two generation at least to wash out stain of vulgarity gentleman gentlewoman can be made in le than two generation therefore never will marry low born man if have perfection under sun nay dear be too strong said mr percy hear dearest rosamond be going to tell that experience have be so limited that be not justified in drawing from general conclusion even to most positive rational general rule know there be exception be fine general softening clause said rosamond now positively mother must have ever consented to marry merchant certainly dear if father have be merchant must have married replied mr percy well except father to put question more fairly may ask do wish that daughter must marry merchant a endeavoured to explain to before depends entirely upon what merchant be upon what daughter feel for rosamond sighed ought to observe that merchant be now quite in different class from what be at first rise of commerce in country continued mother education habit of thinking knowledge manner be improved consequently consideration rank in society be raised in day of best informed most liberal most respectable men in british dominion be merchant must not therefore object to daughter marrying merchant must certainly inquire anxiously what sort of merchant be mean that must inquire whether be concerned in that branch of commerce whether mind be free from thing mercenary illiberal have done so with respect to mr gresham can assure solemnly that mr gresham want of advantage of high birth be completely counterbalanced in opinion by superior quality see in cultivated enlarged generous mind have seen tried where passion interest have be nearly concerned never saw in slightest tincture of vulgarity in manner sentiment therefore dear daughter if have made impression on heart on account conceal struggle against because far from objecting to mr gresham for son in law must prefer to gentleman nobleman who have not exalted character there cried caroline with look of joyful triumph there dear rosamond now heart must be quite at ease looking at rosamond at moment saw expression of joy pleasure in countenance caroline be now convinced that have be mistaken about rosamond feeling really truly mother think really truly dear motive upon earth must make disguise opinion palliate even prejudice when thus consult depend upon truth now have said much will say no more lest must bias on other side will leave to own feeling excellent understanding rosamond affectionate heart be touched so by mother kindness that must not for minute repress tear when recovered voice assured mother caroline with seriousness earnest frankness at once convinced of truth that have not slightest partiality for mr gresham on contrary age be to serious objection have feared that friend might wish for match that being conscious have other objection to make to mr gresham except must not love have hesitated for want of better reason when mother first began cross examination relieved by thorough explanation by conviction that father mother sister be perfectly satisfied with decision rosamond be at ease a far a be concerned still dreaded to see mr gresham again be excessively sorry to have given pain feared not little that in rejecting lover must lose friend mr gresham however be of too generous character to cease to be friend of woman loved merely because must not return passion be wounded pride not disappointed affection that turn immediately from love to

independently of professional advantage have ardently wished to be acquainted have be told can not tell what for here be bell man wonder 'the choleric man knocked down postman for blowing horn in ear abruptly yours alfred percy alfred have good reason to desire to be acquainted with lord chief justice french writer say qu'il faut plier le grandes ailes de l'eloquence pour entrer dans un salon chief justice did so with peculiar ease possessed perfect conversational tact with great power of wit humour felicity of allusion uncommonly recollective memory acting on store of varied knowledge can alone command really conversed did not merely tell story make bonmots confine to single combat of close argument flourish of declamation alternately followed led threw out received idea knowing how to listen full a well a how to talk remembering always lord chesterfield experienced maxim that be easier to hear than to talk into good opinion of auditor be not however from policy from benevolence that chief justice made so good hearer have be said with truth that with good point never passed unnoticed in public court be good thing ever lost upon in private company of number of own good thing fewer be in circulation than might be expected best conversation that rise from occasion suit moment suffers most from repetition fitted precisely to peculiar time place best thing can not bear transplanting day alfred percy be introduced to chief justice conversation began from slight remark made by one of company on acting of mr siddons lady who have just be reading memoir of celebrated french actress mademoiselle clairon spoke of astonishing pain took to study part to acquire what french call l'air noble continually endeavouring on most common occasion when be off stage to avoid awkward motion in habitual manner to preserve air of grace dignity led chief justice to mention care lord chatham mr pitt other great orator have taken to form habit of speaking by unremitting attention to language in private a well a in public maintained that man can speak with ease security in public till custom have brought to feel a moral impossibility that must be guilty of petty vulgarism that must be convicted of capital sin against grammar alfred felt anxious to hear chief justice farther on subject conversation be dragged back to mademoiselle clairon lady by whom be first mentioned declared thought that mademoiselle clairon studying must have made very unnatural actress chief justice quoted answer mademoiselle clairon gave when be reproached with having too much art de l'art et que voudroit on done que j'eusse etois je andromaque etois je phedre alfred observed that who complained of actress having too much art must rather complain of having too little of not having art enough to conceal art chief justice honoured alfred by nod smile lady however protested against doctrine concluded by confessing that always did always must prefer nature to art from commonplace confession chief justice by playful cross examination presently made apparent that always know what mean by art what by nature that idea be so mixed in civilized society word so inaccurately used in common conversation in writing of philosopher metaphysical prism can separate reduce to primary meaning next touched upon distinction between art artifice conversation branched out into remark on grace affectation thence to different theory of beauty taste with played with master hand man accustomed to speak to number perceives immediately when auditor seize idea know instantly by assent expression of eye to whom be new to whom be familiar chief justice discovered that alfred percy have superior knowledge literature talent even before spoke by manner of listening conversation presently passed from l'air noble to le style noble to french law of criticism prohibit descending to allusion to art manufacture subject discussed deeply yet rapidly observed how taste be influenced by different government manner remarked how strong line of demarcation formerly kept in france between nobility citizen have influenced taste in writing in eloquence how more popular government not only admitted allusion to occupation of lower class required orator at election in parliament must speak so a to come home to feeling vocabulary of constituent example from burke others chief justice said might be brought in support of opinion alfred be so fortunate a to recollect apposite illustration from burke from several of great orator wyndham erskine mackintosh romilly a alfred spoke chief justice eye brightened with approbation be observed that afterwards addressed to particularly conversation more flattering still that went deeper into subject have be discussing from one of passage have be mentioned took occasion to answer argument of french critic who justify taste by asserting that be taste of ancient skilled in classical a in modern literature showed that ancient have made allusion to art manufacture a far a knowledge went a observed in modern time new art science afford fresh subject of allusion unknown to ancient consequently ought not to restrict taste by exclusive reverence for classical precedent on point be requisite to reform pandects of criticism passage from burke to alfred have alluded chief justice thought too rich in ornament ornament said if not kept subordinate however intrinsically beautiful injure general effect therefore judicious orator will sacrifice such a draw attention from principal design alfred percy in support of opinion cited example of spanish painter who obliterated certain beautiful silver vas have introduced in picture of lord supper because found that at first view spectator eye be caught by splendid ornament one extolled exquisite finish instead of attending to great subject of piece chief justice be so well pleased with conversation of young barrister at parting gave alfred invitation to house conversation have be very different from what might have be expected metaphysics belle lettres poetry play criticism what range of idea far from coke selden be gone over evening in course of few hour alfred have reason to be more more convinced of truth of father favourite doctrine that general cultivation of understanding acquirement of general knowledge be essential to attainment of excellence in profession useful to young man particularly in introducing to notice of valuable friend acquaintance author well skilled in worst part of human nature have asserted that nothing be more tiresome than praise in have manner of share yet who have better opinion of kind trust that there be who can sympathize in enthusiasm of good young mind struck with splendid talent with superior character therefore venture to insert of warm eulogium with find young lawyer letter filled dear father have only few moment to write can not delay to answer question about chief justice disappointed danger of that far surpasses expectation

of matter seemed to have be more than half in love also with picture morning picture be very dangerous rival except in modern novel replied mr falconer beware commissioner remember understand thing warn in time beware of original of picture never again talk to of going to see percy for though girl may be only unfashioned country beauty georgiana have so many polished advantage yet there be knowing what whim young man might take into head commissioner though remained completely of own opinion that mr falconer scheme for georgiana must never do disputed point farther left room promising required for promise cost nothing to do justice recollected endeavoured to best of power to keep word for next morning took time so well to propose ride to hill just at moment when lord oldborough count be deep in conversation on state of continental politics that lordship must not part with commissioner paid visit alone mr falconer gave credit for address scarcely have congratulated when be thrown again into terror commissioner have suggested to lord oldborough propriety policy of giving whilst be in country popularity ball lordship assented mr falconer a usual be to take trouble off hand to give entertainment to lordship friend oldborough have not yet recovered from gout be glad to accept of offer lordship not being able to appear to do honour of fete be sufficient apology for not giving at clermont park obsequious commissioner begged to have list of friend whom lord oldborough particularly wished to have invited lordship with look of absence replied that left entirely to mr falconer however very evening of day on commissioner paid visit alone at hill lord oldborough put into hand list of friend whom wished must be invited to ball at head of list be percy percy very people first thought of said mr falconer commanding countenance carefully fear can not hope to have be at distance have carriage of carriage of will be at command said lord oldborough commissioner reported to mr falconer observing that have gone to very brink of offending lord oldborough to oblige a knew by lordship look tone of voice that nothing now must be done to visit percy a soon a possible to send card of invitation for ball dear do be sure will be done with good grace added commissioner observing that lady looked excessively discomfited very well commissioner will have daughter upon hand be must be a sorry for love a must be what can be done must not lose substance in running after shadow lord oldborough might turn short round upon not least likely upon trifling occasion a where politics be in question what can mr miss percy being not being at ball signify to lord oldborough man who never in life thought of ball cared thing about woman be woman whom have never seen what interest can possibly be of lord oldborough can not tell dear see immediate interest there be old private friendship in case way other declare can not tell how old cousin percy of mine have contrived to get nearer to lord oldborough than one living ever must do nearer to heart heart private friendship repeated mr falconer with tone of ineffable contempt well only wish have said nothing about matter to lord oldborough must have managed be there ever such want of address when saw percy at head of list be that time to say thing about fear of not coming do think lord oldborough must not translate fear into hope then to mention having carriage when if have kept own counsel must have be sufficient excuse at last must have refused nothing need have be said about till night of ball must lay life lord oldborough must never in mean time have thought of of so silly to object in way when know that slightest contradiction wakens lord oldborough will then indeed might a well talk to own jupiter tonans if lordship have set beggar woman name at head of list have objected that have carriage must directly have answered behe will have mine ' bless be wonderful that people can pique on address have so little knowledge of character dear said commissioner if reproach from time till to morrow end of matter will be that must go see percy say mr falconer added assuming peremptory tone for have acquired taste from lord oldborough have seldom courage opportunity to indulge in say mr falconer thing must be done rang bell in gloriously authoritative manner ordered carriage visit paid thus upon compulsion be not likely to be very agreeable complaint against road dreadful distance horrid necessity of being civil need not be recorded miss falconer exclaimed when at last came to hill la did not think be so tolerable place miss georgiana hoped that must at least see miss caroline owned be curious to see beautiful original of whom painter at percy hall brother buckhurst have said so much mr percy rosamond only be at home caroline have taken walk with father to considerable distance mr falconer who have by time completely recovered self command presented with such smiling grace expressed in such tone of cordiality earnest desire now that have be so happy a to get into country to enjoy society of friend relation that rosamond be quite charmed into belief of at least half of what said rosamond be willing to attribute have appeared particularly of late in contradiction of lady present profession to political motif of commissioner falconer whom disliked for conduct to buckhurst whom be completely willing to give up a worldly minded courtier whilst manner of mother operated thus with rosamond in favour of moral character even rosamond easy faith sanguine benevolence must not see hear thing from daughter confirmed mr falconer flattering speech sat in languid silence looking upon animate inanimate object in room with same air of supercilious listlessness must not speak so a to be heard must not really understand thing rosamond said to seemed a if body have be brought into room by mistake soul left behind not that be in least timid abashed seemed fully satisfied with own inanity proud to show that have absolutely idea in common with into whose company have be thus unfortunately compelled once twice turned head with sign of vivacity when door opened when expected to see miss caroline percy enter though visit be protracted in hope of return yet at last be obliged to depart without having curiosity satisfied mr falconer fear of rivalship for georgiana be not diminished by visit by of family whom saw day judged of caroline whom have not seen have tact sufficient to apprehend that conversation manner of mr percy of rosamond be such a might perhaps please well bred well informed foreigner better even than fashionable tone air of day of have not be long enough in england to appreciate conventional value still mr falconer have lingering hope that difficulty about dress happy cold might prevent dangerous percy from accepting invitation to ball when answer to card came gave one hasty glance at will do honour dear be alarming unnecessarily cried commissioner who pitied distress visible at least to eye in countenance who feared perhaps renewal of reproach for own want of address quite unnecessarily believe have have great deal of conversation with count altenberg since spoke of to last be confirmed in opinion that merely feel curiosity natural to enlightened traveller to become acquainted with mr percy man who have be described to a person of ability want to thank in name of countryman who be assisted know told by percy at time of shipwreck will see dear that lady of family will be nothing to mr falconer sighed bit lip in hour conversation must engage to find out ruling passion of man young old now remember tell mr falconer count altenberg ruling passion be ambition ruling passion repeated mr falconer one of book word book notion be always misleading in practice ruling passion metaphysical nonsense a if men be such consistent creature a to be ruled regularly by one passion when often ten different passion pull man even before face ten different way one can not tell one hour what will be ruling passion of next tell reigning fashion will tell ruling passion luckily continued mr falconer after pause of deep consideration georgiana be very fashionable one of most fashionable young woman in england a count might have seen when be in london then on other hand whether be judge enough of english manner georgiana must be well dressed know count taste in dress have made mistress of commissioner must trouble for money mr falconer have money if have said commissioner who always lost temper when subject be touched upon if have must not give to to throw away upon such losing game nonsensical speculation georgiana have not least chance have other english woman be a handsome a venus dressed in bank note why mr falconer since put in passion must tell secret checking mr falconer stood for moment silent went on with count altenberg have made up quarrel with hereditary prince have from undoubted authority that be to be prince prime minister when come to throne present prince know a cunningham say be so infirm asthmatic that may be carried off at moment very well very likely be glad of said mr

percy mr falconer observed that count saw miss caroline percy moment re appeared now be not extraordinary thought when georgiana dance so well be infinitely more fashionable so charmingly dressed what can strike so much in girl appearance be not appearance that struck be too well accustomed to see beauty fashion in public place to be caught at first sight by handsome face by young lady exhibition of personal grace at ball favourable impression have be made on mind by what have previously heard of miss caroline percy conduct character appearance confirmed impression precisely because have not practised air of professed beauty because did not seem in least to be thinking of to expect admiration be really uncommon therefore fixed attention of man like count altenberg asked caroline to dance

attachment to old landlord of honest affection gratitude have heard from peasant in village mr falconer moved away moment foresaw part of conversation be only so far removed a to prevent necessity of taking part in of appearing to hear what might be awkward for to hear considering intimacy with sir robert percy began talking to old lady about late illness of longed to hear from own lip particular whilst old lady told case mr falconer with eye fixed upon making at proper interval appropriate change of countenance requisite to express tender sympathy alarm horror astonishment joyful

caroline mr falconer be particularly anxious to know what must be said about picture in gallery at percy hall with count have be so much charmed when got into gallery mr falconer listened with breathless eagerness yet still smiling on old lady never ending history of convalescence of shawl undoubtedly turkish with true inestimable inimitable little border not word be said of picture pause implied more to alarm mr falconer than must have be expressed by most flattering compliment mr falconer wondered why supper be so late sent to order that might be served a soon a possible man gentleman cook be not person to be hurried three successive messenger be sent in vain knew importance preserved dignity caramel be not ready nothing must make dispense with proper appearance how much depended on caramel how much of cook never dreamed how much mr falconer suffered during half hour suffered with smiling countenance how much with scowling brow miss georgiana falconer made poor

altenberg engaged miss georgiana falconer first two dance when be finished asked caroline to dance mr falconer who dreaded renewal of conversation between who knew nothing of rosamond counter manoeuvre about shoe be surprised rejoiced when saw caroline comply suffer to be led out by count altenberg miss georgiana who have observed that rosamond danced well have fear mother hope be disappointed daughter fear be justified caroline showed capability of dancing without being dancer certainly did not escape count observation that possessed what be most desirable in female accomplishment power to excel without wish to display immediately after have finished dance favour of hand be solicited by certain colonel spandrill colonel spandrill celebrated for fashionable address personal accomplishment have be hoped for partner of many rival lady choice excited small degree of emotion however be settled that only danced with miss percy because mr falconer have made particular request one of lady declared have overheard that request colonel spandrill then be safe from blame full fire of resentment be directed against poor caroline feature of face be criticised even minutia of dress allowed that be handsome found different fault with style of beauty be curious to observe how secondary class of young lady who have without discomfiture emotion seen caroline object of count altenberg attention be struck with indignation moment suspected of pleasing colonel spandrill envy seldom take two step at once be always excited by fear of losing proximate object of ambition never exists without mixture of hope a well a of fear lady having hope of captivating count altenberg caroline did not then appear to be rival now that dreaded competition with man whom have hope of winning pulled to piece without mercy miss falconer quadrille set be resting whilst country dance be going on miss georgiana be time endeavouring to engage count altenberg in conversation by modern art of coquetry so insipid to man of world so contemptible to man of sense tried to recall attention of count politeness obliged to seem to listen endeavoured to keep up kind of conversation be suited to ball room relapsed continually into reverie till at last provoked by absence of mind miss georgiana unable to conceal vexation unjustly threw blame upon health complained of headache of heat of cold of country dance such barbarous thing how must one bear thing quadrille then music band be horrid played vastly too fast shocking there be such thing a keeping time did not count altenberg think so count altenberg be at moment beating time with foot in exact cadence to miss caroline percy dancing miss falconer saw not till have uttered question not till have be observed by companion

avail colonel went on a far a bright eye bewitching smile heavenly grace still without effect with astonishment perceived that girl who looked a if have never heard that be handsome received full fire of flattery with composure of veteran inured to public admiration mr falconer be almost a much surprised disappointed by a colonel must be have purposely introduced gallant colonel spandrill to miss percy in hope that caroline head might be affected by flattery that might not then retain dignity of manner a mr falconer have sense enough to see be distinguishing charm in eye of count frustrated

dislike be sown at time between miss falconer dear friend lady arlington there be difficulty made by lady anne about lending diamond crescent for zara turban miss georgiana must never forgive lady france on part be provoked beyond measure by order from duke uncle forbidding to appear on stage have reason to suspect that order came in consequence of treacherous hint in letter of georgiana to lady trant went round through lady jane granville to duke who otherwise a lady france observed in midst of politics might never have heard word of matter mr falconer have need of power over muscle of face address in delicate difficult circumstance daughter arabella too be sullen young lady be subject to brother john fit of obstinacy for time must not be brought to undertake part of selima other selima be to be have did not see why must condescend to play confidante for georgiana zara why be to be sacrificed to sister sir robert percy admirer not even to be invited because other percy be to

chapter xxviii theatre at falconer court be not very spacious be elegantly fitted up extremely well lighted have good effect there be brilliant audience excellent band of music whole have gay festive appearance percy family a came from great distance be late house be crowded mr falconer be obliged to seat mr percy daughter with lady arlington on bench upon stage conspicuous situation have be reserved for ladyship eye instantly turned upon beautiful caroline bore gaze of public admiration with blushing dignity interested body in favour count altenberg who have anxiously expected moment of arrival be however upon guard knowing that be watched by mr falconer friend be determined that secret thought must not be seen one involuntary glance gave immediately withdrew eye continued conversation with gentleman next to after few moment have elapsed must indulge in looking at caroline unobserved for gaze of public admiration be a transient a be eager be surprising how short time face however beautiful engages number who meet together to be seen audience be now happily full of arranging seat doing civility to of friend who be worthy of notice lady trant wo ladyship sit in front row be vastly well thank lady kew be afraid wo see over head oh assure perfectly perfectly colonel spandrill will trouble shawl clay lend opera glass how did leave at bath be so glad that

intimate with family be in great anxiety to inform on one important point before prologue must begin stretching to who be have reputation of being good authority asked in whisper do know if there be to be clapping of hand can tell whether be allowable to say thing seems that at private theatre loud demonstration of applause be forbidden be thought more genteel to approve admire in silence thus to draw line between professional actor actress gentleman lady performer upon trial however in instance have be found that difference be sufficiently obvious without marking by invidious distinction young old amateur have acknowledged that silence however genteel be so dreadfully awful that preferred even noise of vulgar acclamation cup of flattery be found so sweet that objection be no longer made to swallowing in public overture finished prologue be written by mr seebright be received with merited applause after buzz of request promise for copy house be silent curtain drew up first appearance of zara in delicate sentimental blue satin be hailed with plaudit long loud plaudit be reiterated at end of first speech be indeed extremely well recited count altenberg leaned forward seemed to listen with delight then stood up several time renewed plaudit at first with appearance of timidity afterwards with decision energy miss georgiana falconer really acted uncommonly well so that must without flattery applaud if did exaggerate little in expression of admiration deemed allowable have object be absolutely determined to see whether not caroline be capable of mean passion have disgusted in rival reflected that have seen only when be triumphant be anxious to know how must appear in different circumstance of high intellectual endowment must not doubt temper be not always blessing given to fair even to wise may seem strange that gallant man must think of beauty temper probably if count altenberg have considered caroline only a beauty must not have troubled to make on point severe dangerous scrutiny play went on zara sustaining interest of scene be feebly supported by sulky selima other part be ill performed fault common to unpractised actor occurred one of osman arm never moved other sawed air perpetually a if in pure despite of hamlet prohibition then in crossing over osman be continually entangled in zara robe when standing still be obliged to twitch train thrice before must get from beneath leaden foot when confident that must repeat speech fluently be apt to turn back upon mistress when felt called upon to listen to mistress must regularly turn back upon audience be defect permitted by licence of private theatre allowable by courtesy to gentleman actor thing went on a well a must be expected osman have not part by heart still zara covered deficiency osman did worse than other osmans have done before till came to long speech beginning with sultan great ancestor bequeath 'd empire to taste gave not powerful prompting got through first six line decently enough till came to wasting tenderness in wild profusion might look down to surrounded foot bless contending beauty at bungled sadly hearing suddenly failing a well a memory there be dead stop in vain prompter scene shifter candle snuffer a loud a must much louder than ought reiterated next sentence might speak serenely slothful be plain that osman must not speak be serene have begun a in danger great be wont to kick left ankle bone rapidly with right heel through pomp of osman oriental robe turban young petcalf stood confessed threw back angry look at prompter zara terrified gave up for lost two lady arlington retreated behind scene to laugh polite audience struggled not to smile count altenberg at moment looked at caroline who instead of joining in laugh showed by countenance manner most good natured sympathy zara recovering presence of mind swept across stage in such manner a to hide from view kicking sultan a passed whispered line to so distinctly that caught sound left off kicking went on with speech be well again count altenberg forgot to join in cheering plaudit be so much charmed at instant by caroline smile fortunately for zara for audience in next scene part of lusignan be performed by gentleman who have be well used to acting though be not man of extraordinary capacity yet from habit of board being perfect in part now seemed quite superior person be found unaccountably easier to act with son of labour than with other of gentleman performer though be natural genius moment zara appeared with lusignan power shone forth nothing spoiled illusion attention of audience be fixed interest be sustained feeling touched exercise of fan ceased in front row glass of lemonade be held untasted nobody consulted play bill excited by success sympathy applause most flattering zara went on with increasing eclat meanwhile percy family who be quite intent upon play began to find situation disagreeable from noise behind scene party of lady among whom be lady france arlington stood whispering so loud close to caroline that voice be heard by more distinctly than of actor lady france stood half hid between side scene holding little white dog in arm hush cried ladyship putting finger on lip companion became silent instantly house be now in profound attention zara be in midst of favourite speech must learn more open heart know then that spite of renew 'd injustice can not wish to love le that long before look 'd so low a zara gave heart to osman at name of osman dog started struggled lady france appeared to restrain ran on stage leaped up on zara at repetition of name of osman sat down on hind leg begged with fore paw began to whine in such piteous manner that whole audience be on brink of laughter zara attendant friend lost presence of mind caroline sprang forward quite across stage caught dog in arm carried off count altenberg no longer master of clapped hand whole house resounded with applause miss georgiana falconer misunderstood cause of plaudit imagined that be encored cast down eye a soon a there be silence advanced recommenced speech of count altenberg did not hear one word malicious trick have be contrived by lady france arlington to revenge on miss georgiana falconer for having prevented from taking part in play ladyship have in course of rehearsal privately drilled dog to answer to name of osman when name be pronounced in zara tragic tone dog have be kept out of way till zara be in midst of speech in call repeatedly on name of osman trick have be so well contrived that who be in secret imagined that appearance of dog at unlucky moment have be accidental truth began indeed to be soon whispered in confidence to return to count altenberg at commencement of play when idea of trying caroline temper have occurred to have felt anxiety lest high expectation have formed bright enchantment must vanish in first act have begun by joining timidly in general applause of zara dreading lest caroline must not be blessed with temper must bear praise of rival with unwounded ear count applauded with more confidence in second act during third be quite at ease in fifth must not forgive for having supposed possible that caroline must be liable to of foible of sex in mean time miss georgiana falconer in high spirit intoxicated with vanity be persuaded that count have returned to sens so little did know of character of human heart a to expect that declaration of love must soon follow public profession of admiration such be confusion of idea that be confident zara be on point of becoming countess of altenberg after play be over thousand compliment have be paid received most of company called for carriage house emptied fast there remained only select party who be to stay supper soon adjourned to green room to repeat tribute of applause to actor high in midst stood miss georgiana falconer receiving incense from crowd of adorer a count altenberg approached assumed languishing air of softness sensibility count said must reasonably be expected compliment did not seem quite to satisfy lady be in hope that be going to say something more to taste when french clay pressed forward did with air french english protested that must not have conceived possible for power of actress upon earth to interest for english zara madam said have done impossible now must die content if must see genius do justice to zaire how must shine in divine original when must do such wonder for miserable translation several gentleman among others mr percy must not allow that english translation deserved to be called miserable wrong side of tapestry can not expect must be quite equal to right side said voltaire pointed out few odds end here there disfigured work required to be cut off upon whole if recollect be satisfied with piece complimented mr hill upon having preserved general design spirit simplicity of original mere politeness in m de voltaire replied french clay in effect zaire be absolutely incapable of thing more than being done into english for example will body have goodness to tell said looking round fixing look of appeal on miss caroline percy how must translate famous vous pleurez be not translated said caroline by 'zara weep ' ah pardonnez moi cried french clay with shrug meant to be french english shoulder must not cleverly execute ah pardonnez to ear now that say nothing to feeling said great deal just now said caroline looking at zara in manner be lost upon feeling not upon count altenberg ah indubitably admit cried mr clay la beaute est toujours dans son pay tear fortunately need translation when come to word will allow ma'be that language of fine feeling be absolutely untranslateable untransfusible caroline seemed to wish to avoid being drawn forward to farther discussion mr clay repeated in tone of soft condescension silence flatters with hope ma'be that agree caroline must not submit to interpretation of silence blushing without being disconcerted answered that have always heard believed be test of true feeling a of true wit that can be easily understood that language be universal if have ever doubted that truth said count altenberg must have be convinced of by what have seen heard night miss georgiana falconer bowed head graciously to count smiled sighed lady france arlington rosamond smiled at same moment for perceived by universal language of eye that what count altenberg said be not intended for lady who took so decidedly to herself be second time night miss georgiana falconer vanity have appropriated to herself compliment in have share yet even at moment a conceived be moment of triumph while be encircled by adorer while voice of praise yet vibrated in ear felt anguish at perceiving serenity of rival

sit down compose dear mother required one one promise from gave firmly intending to keep yet fear that will think have broken promised to tell felt first symptom of preference for person did not know own mind till day indeed thought felt nothing what body else expressed esteem admiration in common mind replied mr percy esteem admiration may be very safely distant from love in such mind a yours caroline step from perfect esteem to love be dangerously near scarcely perceptible why dangerously cried rosamond why must not perfect love follow perfect esteem be very thing desire for caroline be sure be attached to be must wish for stop cried caroline oh dear sister a wish to be good happy name to more for can not be why exclaimed rosamond with look of dismay why can not be can must will be caroline sighed turning from sister a if dreaded to listen to repeated will not flatter see that can not be have observed change in manner pain gave first awakened to state of own affection have given proof of sincerity by speaking thus immediately of impression made on mind will acknowledge effort be difficult mother will answer one question be afraid to ask did do think that body else perceived sentiment by manner caroline paused mother sister set heart at ease on point after said rosamond addressing to mother may be mistaken in what hinted about count altenberg own thought change in manner arose from lady florence pembroke be sorry said thing of dare say when see more of be very pretty very pleasing very elegant amiable doubt surely in comparison with caroline be not certain that there be rivalship in case be certain that there will be none said caroline how extraordinary be that best noblest most delightful feeling of heart may lead to meanest most odious have within few hour felt enough to be aware of will leave nothing to chance woman must never expose to hazard will preserve peace of mind own esteem will preserve dear excellent friend may preserve of be sensible that must

perceived in count did think must not perceive said caroline oh little know how quickly first look first tone of voice of will think more only let assure that dear rosamond did harm be not what body said that alarmed before pointed out have felt that change in manner for can not account can not account can doubt that lady florence be cause said rosamond yes have great doubt said caroline so have said mr percy can not believe said caroline that man of sense character must be so suddenly captivated mean to detract from lady florence merit before must make impression suspect on count altenberg there must have be time for to be known appreciated will go on tell have passed in mind yes mother sister must see a be perhaps under delusion of vanity self love if be wrong will set right will help to set right have never be declared in word therefore perhaps be vain presumptuous to believe to imagine yet do feel persuaded that be preferred that be loved oh yes said rosamond thousand time have thought so have felt certain that count altenberg loved now be convinced ala of mistake convinced at least that love be of light changeable sort be not worth having not worth having that last cried caroline can never believe stopped blushed deeply what doe mother say added in timid voice mother be sure thought once that loved caroline did not mother said rosamond yes dear answered mr percy have thought so be not yet convinced that be mistaken entirely agree with caroline that be subject upon ought not to let thought dwell oh so have thought so have said on former occasion how often how

why mother must do expostulated rosamond if think if think that love if believe that have changed if believe that be struck with new face why must caroline go for heaven sake take away till be sure that be necessary will be guided by opinion said mr percy can depend entirely on own prudence indeed think will be most prudent must not indulge in staying longer said caroline from what have seen of count altenberg have reason to think that act in general from wise good motif must therefore believe that in present instance motif be good adequate can not suspect that act from caprice what nature of obstacle may be can only guess be inclined to think that opposing duty duty said rosamond suppose must have known before to day what new duty can have discovered men be not so very apt in love matter to think of opposing duty a woman do much more likely that have heard something to disadvantage caroline from falconer can tell that lady france arlington gave hint strange thing have be said great pain taken to misrepresent to count if injurious representation have be made of to replied caroline will in time discover falsehood of such report if believe without examination be not what imagine to be be convinced have too noble mind too just understanding to be misled by calumny mr percy declared be decidedly of opinion obstacle whatever may be dear mother continued caroline with earnest tone expression of countenance of person of strong mind at once feeling thinking deeply difficulty whatever be must be either such a time will obviate increase obstacle must be conquerable unconquerable if love a thought did if have energy of character think posse will conquer if can be conquered if be unconquerable what misery what madness to suffer affection to be irrevocably engaged what base vanity to wish if be in power to inspire with unhappy passion then in point of view mother surely be best must leave dangerous place said caroline smiling yet be so happy here be sorry to be cause love said mother to thing be trifle compared with what be right becoming that must do entirely approve applaud prudence resolution what desire will be done a soon a possible will go home to

doing what be right what be essentially necessary for security of peace happiness of whole life said mr percy be true replied rosamond object to doing thing only wish have good decent excuse for running away expect that mr hungerford will part with without remonstrance without struggle without even inquiring why must run away be sure hope will not ask for be not prepared with answer face must never do must give way at first glance of penetrating eye what will say to mr truth replied caroline mr hungerford have ever treated with so much kindness have shown so much affection esteem feel warm interest in that concern be of so noble character that command entire confidence will have without reserve since mother agrees with in thinking that lady florence have not be in degree cause of change of manner have observed there can be impropriety on account in speaking of subject to mr hungerford may be painful humiliating what be meant by confidence by openness towards friend be of ready enough to confess virtue said smiling weakness what humbles pride to acknowledge be apt to find delicate reason for keeping secret mother if disapprove of wish to tell mr whole truth mr percy entirely approved of caroline placing confidence in excellent friend observed that be very different from girlish gossiping sort of confidence be made often from one young lady to merely from want of something to say pleasure of prattling about love hope of being encouraged by weak young friend to indulge foolish passion next morning before mr hungerford have left apartment mr percy went to explained reason induced caroline to refuse pleasure of prolonging visit at hungerford castle mr hungerford be touched by confidence caroline placed in believe said be not misplaced feel value must lose never parted

peace of mind be at stake how few how very few be there of various young woman know who must have good sense resolution will say integrity of mind to act a doe there be usually sentimental casuistry cowardly fear lingering hope that prevents young people in circumstance from doing plain right thing thing plain right thing be ready to do there be always delicate reason for not telling truth especially to friend daughter mr percy be above thing with respect to count altenberg mr hungerford said that from many observation have made felt doubt of being strongly attached to caroline character understanding be suited to other have same high view same magnanimity with one exception must allow mother partiality to make exception in favour of own son with one exception count altenberg be man of others to whom must wish to see caroline united never till yesterday doubted that must be be a much struck with change in manner a have be agree with caroline that obstacle probably of duty have arisen hope will imitate example a tell forbids to hope so will if possible at event raise high a be in esteem still higher by present conduct tell so dear mr percy mother may give praise without hurting delicacy tell old a be have not forgotten so completely feeling of youth a not to be aware that suspense in situation be worst of evil may be assured that attention will be

gardening simple remedy practical philosophy frequently find simple remedy best providence have put within reach of one morning soon after return home when be alone busy in garden heard voice at distance a approached nearer thought distinguished mr hungerford listened looked towards path whence voice have come be silent minute afterwards saw mr hungerford coming through narrow path in thicket caroline at first sprang forward to meet then stopped short heart beating violently thought that perhaps mr hungerford be accompanied by count altenberg be alone ashamed of hope have glanced across mind of sudden stop have betrayed thought caroline now went forward blushing mr hungerford embraced with tenderness then assuming cheerful tone mother sister wanted to persuade said must never find way to insisted upon must have not instinct of true friend to guide so now let sit down rest on pretty seat very comfortable throne be saying much for throne so be territory continued looking round

assure on one point have seen more since must therefore be better able to judge count altenberg have none of presumption of manner put woman upon guard against inference in secret do think ever suspected can not love tell what pass in secret recess of man heart much more difficult to penetrate than woman replied mr hungerford smiling let satisfy by word hint look must ever guess that have formed hope of whole family spoke in term of highest regard of dared not trust to say much little did venture to say be expressive of highest respect esteem more did not ought not be convinced to have allowed be satisfied quite satisfied said caroline relieving heart by deep sigh thank kind mr hungerford have put subject at rest for ever in mind if count altenberg can love with honour will if can not heaven forbid must wish from time forward caroline never spoke more upon subject never mentioned name of count altenberg exerted strong command possessed over to conquer languor indolence to have found disposed be difficult task to restore what may be called tone of mind to recover power of being acted upon by common day motif after sensibility have be unusually excited where affection have be deeply long engaged be task most severe philosophy can not accomplish without aid of time of superior power must be irreverent here to name by using concealment with friend by permitting self delusion by having courage to confess first symptom of partiality of be conscious caroline put out of own power to nourish preference into passion must ultimately have made friend unhappy besides advantage

family where none of member of acted in concert well knew what others be doing where have separate interest vanity vice to be pursued indulged often happened that one individual counteracted other none be willing to abandon selfish purpose whether of interest pleasure on present occasion by curious concatenation of circumstance happened that buckhurst falconer who have formerly be spoiled darling of mother be person whose interest immediately crossed hers if pursued object must be at risk of breaking off sister georgiana marriage with english clay be necessary to go back few step to trace progress of buckhurst falconer history be painful task to recapitulate follow gradual deterioration of disposition such a to mark ruin degradation of character notwithstanding fault have degree of generosity openness with sense of honour quick feeling early in life promised well for parental weakness mistaken system might have be matured into thing good great after mother have by introducing early to fashionable company to life of idleness dissipation disgusted with profession of law in with talent such a might with application perseverance have risen to wealth eminence after father have

shunned a censor unwilling to give up pleasure of conviviality incapable of sustaining martyrdom of ridicule buckhurst falconer soon abjured principle to must not adhere soon gloried in open defiance

clergyman becomes object not only of contempt of disgust abhorrence murmur be soon heard against private conduct of celebrated preacher perhaps envy for talent success mingled voice with honest expression of virtuous indignation murmur grew louder louder buckhurst falconer to avoid having inquiry made irregularity brought to light be obliged to yield to rival preacher of far inferior talent of more correct conduct commissioner falconer be glad that son be disappointed in manner a thought must make more attentive than have be of late to colonel hauton living of chipping friar be better worth looking after than fleeting fame of popular preacher buckhurst however still held fame in higher estimation than have ever be held by father who never valued a subordinate to interest love of

to pursue discussion to pique upon showing sincerity by declaring difference of opinion from patron utterly repugnant a be to minister habit temper yet in admiration of boldness of man in consideration for true attachment lord oldborough bore with magnanimous patience when have time when have not must cut short at once in mixed government popularity philosophically speaking if may differ from lordship temple began permit sir first interrupted lord oldborough to settle business with mr alfred percy who being professional man in high practice probably set just value upon time mr

long ago be glad saw nothing of lest must not have let come to declaration refusal be always creditable therefore own must have be mortified if season have passed without having one proposal now have nothing to be ashamed of have killed man hope trust will live to see kill caroline laughed said be glad lady jane be not one of who count refusal a so many proof of young lady merit for own part acknowledged be inclined to think that be sometimes proof rather of coquetry duplicity lady jane hesitated said did not see must not agree to conversation went on till ladyship caroline came to complete opposition of opinion on principle though be only stated in general in abstract ladyship defended with urgency caroline resisted with steadiness be seldom shown about merely speculative point unless there be secret apprehension of being soon reduced to practice lady jane asserted that woman must always let attachment come to declaration before permit man to see mind even though determined upon refusal caroline thought must be using man ill lady jane maintained that must be using much worse to refuse before asked without refusing caroline said that gentleman might be led to perceive when be not likely to be accepted thus must be saved pain humiliation of rejected proposal be not young lady first business to think of first duty be to do what be right proper for lady jane said certainly very question be what be right proper to give distinct answer when distinct question be asked neither more le said lady jane caroline on subject must trust to one who know world to tell opinion of world woman be safe can not be blamed by friend foe if adhere to plain rule till be asked ' till gentleman think proper in form to declare attachment nothing can be more indelicate than for lady to see in case more disingenuous more cruel than to pretend to be blind to cruel cruel be word of last century century before last cruelty be never heard of now dear gentleman heart break in day suppose odd heart must break if lady be treating according to rule be not to blame why did not proud tongue speak happens be acquitted by world by own conscience surely not if deceive injure by deception lady jane warmly repeated that knew world at time of life ought to know world that be certain line of conduct that have pointed out must expose woman to charge of indelicacy perhaps of impertinence be heavy charge caroline felt thought that when not deserved must be borne better than self reproach for want of candour truth lady jane observed that in catalogue of female virtue delicacy must have foremost place caroline made distinction between real delicacy punctilio lady jane be inclined to call distinction without difference however more prudently said that punctilio be necessary a guard of female delicacy undoubtedly greater virtue must not be sacrificed to le truth sincerity caroline thought must be classed among highest virtue of woman a well a of man hoped be perfectly consistent with utmost feminine modesty asked whether after plea of delicacy punctilio be not sometimes used to conceal real motif perhaps lady in pretending to be too delicate to see gentleman sentiment be often in fact gratifying own vanity urging to declaration be to complete female triumph lady jane grew angry fearing lest caroline must perceive that have particular object in view doubtful whether caroline knew did not know aim farther having secret hope that like other young lady who support fine sentiment about love generosity in conversation might when came to test forget ladyship urged opinion farther indeed candidly acknowledged that much might be said on caroline side of question there matter ended chapter xxxv object that lady jane have in view be to prevent caroline from discouraging by premature candour passion saw rising in heart of young nobleman lord william well pleased to becape from flattery to wit have always preferred lady jane granville company to society of who courted more with le delicacy since miss caroline percy arrival appearance in town lady jane have to do justice preserved with lordship exactly same even tenor of conduct wish might be have too much proper pride to compromise own young friend dignity moreover ladyship have sense knowledge of character sufficient to perceive sacrifice least appearance of disposition to make must be not only degrading vain must knew for ever disgust ruin in opinion of man who have infinitely more penetration feeling than who flattered be aware that possessed lord william have excellent ability knowledge superior quality of sort depressed by excessive timidity to degree a to be almost useless to to others whenever be either for business pleasure of life to meet mix with number whole man be a be snatched from be subject to nightmare of soul who seat upon human breast oppresses heart palsy will raise spectre of dismay sufferer combat in vain that cruel enchantress who hurl spell even upon childhood when make youth victim pronounces henceforward will never appear in natural character innocent will look guilty wise will look silly never will have use of natural faculty wish to say will not say that wish to do will not do will appear reserved when be enthusiastic insensible when heart sink into melting tenderness in presence of most wish to please will be most awkward when approached by love will become lifeless a statue under irresistible spell of mauvaise honte strange that france must give name to malady of mind never knew of know le than other nation upon surface of civilized globe under spell of mauvaise honte poor lord william laboured fast bound bound faster by effort made for relief by matron young damsel who crowded round continually be astonished that charm encouragement held out failed to free young nobleman from excessive timidity what pity be only fault be sure ten thousand pity must not be made to speak be certain have vast deal to say must be so agreeable be confident if must most extraordinary that man of rank fortune whom creature admired must be so timid true timid lord william time esteemed more highly than lady who affected to admire mixed with apparent timidity there be secret pride conscious of difference between what be what appeared to be be at once mortified provoked felt disdain disgust for who pretended to admire outward man who paid to fortune that tribute thought due to merit with few very few by whom be appreciated pride timidity be equally at ease reserve vanished in astonishing manner man came out of marble of small number in confidence lady jane granville be one even from boyish year have discerned worth value now distinguished by grateful constant regard lady jane granville though woman of considerable talent must not be judge of whole of mind extent of power talent be chiefly wit knowledge knowledge of world mind cultivated slightly for embellishment deeply extensively with large view when became acquainted with miss caroline percy soon found that to appeared by be justly valued assiduity in cultivating friend lady jane acquaintance increased taste for conversation at house became so great that be always first usually last at party morning visit be frequent long knew by instinct hour when two lady be disengaged not always so exactly time when ought to take leave ear never informed when lady jane carriage came to door did always hear servant announce being in readiness ladyship might fidget a much a politeness must permit without danger of being observed lordship never be wakened to sense of being necessary to stir till miss caroline percy by strong indication such a putting away drawing book by plainly saying must go out now made manifest to that must depart for caroline be regularly reproved afterwards by lady jane never found that gave lord william offence did for time observe that caused much uneasiness seemed to to stay from mere habitual absence of mind unwillingness to remove from retreat where be safe comfortable to place where be liable to be annoyed by fair persecutor that liked company conversation did not affect to deny must doubt that felt for esteem regard expressed be not man to express more than felt truth of whose profession must be suspected thought that regard for for lady jane be of same nature thought friend not lover be not with caroline mere commonplace phrase believed to be true at time believed be right constantly in society of amiable sensible beautiful young woman with man of feeling taste understanding whose heart be disengaged passage from friendship to love be found so easy rapid a to be scarcely perceptible to generally happens in similar circumstance lord william be peculiarly liable for though from crowd who courted attention might seem that liberty of choice be unlimited yet in fact power of choosing be contracted reduced to few whom choice passion approve among few fastidious judgment apprehension of domestic unhappiness saw frequently sometimes too justly objection to family connexion of young lady want of union in want of principle train of dissipation dreaded folly disliked so that among number of own rank who sought alliance be not easy for to satisfy even a to connexion still more difficult to satisfy a to love modern fair one jest what be worse affectation lordship be well aware that among number of young lady who be ready at moment warning to marry not one of must love for own sake now in common with marmontel alcibiades with most men of rank who have superiority of character lord william have anxious desire to be loved for own sake for though in opinion of most people of world of philosopher circumstance of rank fortune form part of personal merit yet a be not indissolubly associated with individual rather preferred affection esteem arising from merit of must not be deprived by revolution of fate turn of fancy if be ever loved by caroline percy must be for own sake of constancy of affection if once obtained whole tenor of character conduct gave most secure pledge education manner talent beauty be such a must honour grace highest rank of life have fortune be of consequence to be likely to have princely income have debt have at present satisfied wish must enable to live married a well a single in manner suited station friend eager to have marry almost despairing of complying in point with wish left entirely at liberty in choice reason passion determined on choice just about time when english clay proposed for caroline when conversation about declaration refusal have passed between lady jane that conversation instead of changing weakening opinion caroline then expressed have confirmed in own sentiment by drawing out more fully strength of reason honourable nature of feeling on be founded slight circumstance such a must scarcely state in word occurred about time first gave idea that lord william felt for more than esteem tender interest showed one day when have slight indisposition extreme alarm expressed one night when there occurred embarrassment between carriage at door of opera house by lady jane vi vi be nearly overturned alarm much greater than caroline thought occasion required be succeeded by anger against coachman so much more violent vehement than error offence justified than lordship have ever before be seen to show thing in man of gallantry might mean nothing to show politeness from lord william seemed indicative of something more caroline began to see that friend might become lover now for first time questioned own heart thought highly of lord william ability character saw a have once said to lady jane sign convinced that volcano covered with snow often enveloped in cloud must at time burst forth in torrent of fire little indication a lord william now showed to common observer of being of becoming orator perceived in soul of eloquence foresaw that on great occasion from great motive must at once vanquish timidity burst forth upon senate felt convinced that whether eloquent silent speaking acting in public private life lord william must in circumstance of trial fill sustain character of upright honourable enlightened english nobleman notwithstanding that thought thus highly of count altenberg in opinion far surpassed in quality possessed excelled in many in lord william be deficient in manner especially manner go great way in love even with people of best understanding besides advantage of manner count altenberg have far superior talent at least far superior habit of conversation be altogether a estimable more agreeable than rival also have have advantage of finding caroline mind disengaged have cultivated society in country where have have time opportunity to develope own character hers in one word have made first impression on heart impression once made on heart like hers can not be easily effaced though there seemed little chance of returning to claim place in affection though have made most laudable effort to banish from recollection yet en songeant qu'il faut qu'on l'oublie on s'en souvient now found that not only others compared with be indifferent to that whom be forced to put in comparison competition with count altenberg immediately sunk in opinion thus distinctly knowing own mind caroline be however still in doubt a to lord william afraid of mistaking nature of sentiment well remembered lady jane caution though be fully resolved to spare by candour suspense pain coquetry might create prolong yet be necessary to be certain that read aright therefore to wait for something more decisive by to interpret meaning lady jane wisely forbore observation on subject never said looked word must recall memory of former debate with most scrupulous almost haughty delicacy most consummate prudence left thing to take course secure of what end must be one night lady jane caroline be at party when arrived descried lord william in midst of group of fair fashionable looking a if be suffering martyrdom eye caught caroline a passed colour changed lady next put up glass to look for cause of change glass be put down again apprehension excited by degree lord william worked way towards caroline not towards caroline to lady jane granville company near be talking of proposal gentleman have lately made for celebrated beauty suit have be rejected said that lady must have seen that be attached to that have be to blame in allowing so long to pay attention if be determined to refuse at last others defended lady saying that gentleman have never made distinct declaration that therefore lady be quite correct in not appearing to know that intention meant thing more than be avowed lord william listened perfectly silent with appearance of anxiety lady jane granville supported warmly same side of question have taken in similar conversation with caroline miss percy be appealed to for opinion must not be strange indeed if lady be to reject gentleman before be asked lord william with increasing anxiety listened dared not look at caroline who with becoming modesty with firmness in what believed to be right answered that if woman saw that gentleman loved felt that must not return attachment might without rude premature rejecting simply by certain ease of manner man of sense know how to interpret mark difference between esteem tenderer sentiment might by convincing that there be chance of obtaining farther interest in heart prevent ever having pain of decided refusal discussion ended here fresh company joined other subject be started lord william continued silent did not take share in conversation be so absent absorbed in own thought that several time be spoken to without being able to give plausible answer then stood covered with confusion confusion increasing from sense that be observed must not be conquered company moved different way lordship continued fixed near caroline at last attention of near be happily diverted drawn away from by appearance of new distinguished person seized moment summoned courage sufficient to address slight question to caroline answered with ease of manner felt to be unfavourable to wish spell be upon must not articulate dead silence might have ensued that lady jane happily went on saying something about pine apple ice lord william assented implicitly without knowing to what replied just so exactly so to contradictory assertion if have be asked at instant whether what be eating be hot cold must not have be able to decide lady jane composedly took biscuit enjoyed passing scene observing that be pleasantest party have be at season mr crabstock came up lady jane with wit at will kept pattern lady in play by opportunely recollected tale of scandal with ear delighted eye riveted stood mr crabstock while lord william again relieved from fear of observation breathed once more partly recovering sens through mist that hung over looked at caroline in hope of drawing encouraging omen from countenance have come to party determined to say something must explain to sentiment thought must speak to better in crowd than alone now never said to with desperate effort with oppressed voice said very thing did not mean to say miss percy never be so inclined in life to quarrel with ease of manner in body a in then correcting blushing deeply added mean that admire ease of manner in general in short be impossible think that with penetration can be in doubt a to sentiment if thought stopped short felt a if life hung upon thread a if first look first sound of voice next word spoken must decide fate longed yet feared to see look to hear that word think be impossible that with lordship penetration must mistake mine said caroline there be ingenuous sweetness in look voice fear of giving pain yet resolution to be sincere lord william felt understood saw there be hope caroline heard from deep sigh with great painful emotion in most calm voice must command in kindest tone added for sentiment of regard esteem lordship have expressed for believe be truly grateful mr crabstock moved towards caroline paused be to be at lady arrowsmith concert to morrow lord

once more to caroline countenance then cursed for weakness lady jane turning back saw lordship look now convinced that caroline be to blame for reproached for misinterpreting word manner well lord
