hers have not long since made to near relation of mr alfred percy mr clay of clay hall nephew have proposed for mr alfred sister miss caroline percy be really sorry match be not to take place for have heard very high character of young lady in way nephew be rich enough to do without fortune not what must be very acceptable to men especially young men who be now mostly for money instead of for love except in case of very first rate extraordinary beauty therefore making woman prey just a much one a other might be deemed misfortune a great though hardly quite mr buckhurst said a have found great fortune in own particular case involution of meaning in sentence rendering not easy to be comprehended dean stood pretty well only stirring coffee observing that be cold when lady went on to string of interrogatory about miss caroline percy on colour of eye hair size of mouth nose requiring in short complete full length portrait of young lady poor buckhurst set down cup pleading business in study left field open to alfred near sighted glass do never use mr percy said mr dean falconer a thought be eye fixed upon spectacle lay on table no never used thanked be rather far sighted than short

noble house to disown to deprive of liberty to disgrace family member who must manifest will to commit desperate crime desperate folly alfred be by mean disposed to join in praise even of use of lettre de cachet did not think proper time to argue point a saw lord oldborough be under influence of strong passion waited in silence till lordship must explain farther lordship unlocked desk

of negotiation without entering into particular divorce divorce be wish to hear alfred did not know circumstance of marchioness of twickenham marriage peremptory manner in have be insisted upon by uncle otherwise must have felt still greater surprise than now felt at stern unbending character of man possessed a lord oldborough be by opinion that have at time judged acted in best manner possible after event must make doubt justice of own decision must at shake in own estimation alfred soon brought report in one word divorce lord be well thank sir lordship made farther inquiry not even whether there be to be separation alfred be commissioned by duke of greenwich to deliver message like message of god in homer delivered verbatim without comment grace of greenwich trust lord oldborough will believe that notwithstanding unfortunate circumstance dissolved in degree family connexion be farthest possible from grace wish thought to break with lord oldborough a long a private feeling public principle must be rendered by mean compatible lord oldborough smiled in scorn alfred must scarcely command countenance lord oldborough prepared to give grace opportunity knew desired of differing with on principle lordship thought favour power be now sufficiently established to be able to do without duke of greenwich pride prompted to show to grace to world carried with high hand for short time even whilst felt most secure when seemed to bend bow before genius sway many circumstance many person be combining to work downfall of power one of first slight circumstance shook favour be speech have made to gentleman about presentation of deanery to buckhurst falconer have be supposed by many who knew court commissioner falconer paid to lord oldborough that be through lordship interest that preferment be given to son when person taking for granted spoke of to lordship indignantly disclaimed part in transaction be said that added sir know what be due to private regard a man a minister what must be yielded to parliamentary influence never must have advised bestowing ecclesiastical benefice dignity upon one whose conduct be not first recommendation speech made in moment of proud perhaps unguarded indignation be repeated with addition suppression variation comment thing will at court serve purpose of who wish to injure be inconceivable what mischief be done to minister by slight circumstance in first place nobleman high in office family connexion of nobleman who have made exchange of living given promise of deanery to bishop clay be offended beyond redemption because be in wrong then who have done wished to do wrong in similar instance be displeased by reflection by anticipation lord oldborough chiefly be injured by misrepresentation in quarter where be of most consequence to to preserve influence be construed by highest authority into disrespect imperious desire to encroach on favour to control prerogative to subdue mind of sovereign insidious art have long be secretly employed to infuse idea when once jealousy of power be excited trifle confirmed suspicion lord oldborough uncourtier like character be little calculated to dispel popularity now gave umbrage be hinted that wished to make independent minister of people affair of country prospered however under administration there be trouble there be hazard in change be argued that be best to wait at least for reverse of fortune in war symptom of domestic discontent before attempt must be made to displace minister formidable by talent by awe commanding character inspired habit of confidence deference for genius integrity remained to difference for time appeared in consequence of secret decay of favour commissioner falconer timid anxious restless be disposed by circumstance by nature by second nature to vigilance of dependent life accustomed to watch consult daily barometer of court favour soon felt coming storm moment saw prognostic of change trembled considered how must best provide for own safety before hour of danger arrived numerous libel against minister appeared lord oldborough never read commissioner with best spectacle read for well knew believed what sage selden saith though make slight of libel yet may see by how wind set after determining by throwing up of straw way wind set commissioner began with possible skill dexterity to trim boat dexterous trimmer though be prescient of change did yet not foresee from what quarter storm must come count altenberg letter have unveiled completely envoy cunningham falconer treachery a far a related to intrigue abroad other friend detected of manoeuvre with politician at home to whom have endeavoured to pay court by betraying confidence reposed in respecting tourville paper much of mischief cunningham have done great minister still operated unknown to unsuspicious mind sufficient be revealed to determine lord oldborough to dismiss from future hope of favour mr commissioner falconer began one morning moment commissioner entered cabinet mr commissioner falconer in tone instantly dispelled smile at entrance from commissioner countenance in same moment changed whole configurature confidence be withdrawn from son mr cunningham falconer for ever not without good reason a may if be not aware of already see by paper lord oldborough turned away asked secretary for red box a be going to council just a left cabinet looked back said mr falconer must know if be not already apprised of that son cunningham be on road to denmark must be aware that journey be not made by desire by majesty order by official authority consequently be travelling to court of denmark at own expense yours unless can prevail upon grace of greenwich to defray ambassadorial travelling charge can afford to wait for till total change of administration of sir if see symptom to day in council added lordship in tone of bitter irony will give fair notice for fair dealing be what practise said minister left commissioner to digest speech a might repaired to council where found thing apparently a smooth a usual where be received by especially by highest with perfect consideration meantime commissioner falconer be wretched beyond expression wretched in certainty that son that have probably lost irrecoverably one excellent patron before have secured even in case of change premature discovery of cunningham intrigue totally disconcerted overwhelmed in bitterness of heart cursed duplicity have taught encouraged still more by example than by precept cunningham duplicity have more closer fold than own cunningham conceited of diplomatic genius fearful of cautious timidity of father did not trust that father with knowledge of did half of what intended so that commissioner who have thought at bottom of thing now found that too have be cheated by son with false confidence be involved by in consequence of scheme of have never be adviser commissioner falconer knew too well by experience of cumberland others fate of who suffer to be lured on by second hand promise who venture without being publicly acknowledged by employer to undertake diplomatic mission must cunningham whose natural disposition to distrust be greater than father have sold to political tempter without first signing sealing compact have be in possession of cool judgment have be in other than desperate circumstance in be placed secret conscience whispered that recall be in consequence of detection of of intrigue dreaded to appear before haughty irritated minister deceived also by news from england that lord oldborough dismission resignation must not be distant cunningham have ventured upon bold stroke for embassy on lord oldborough return from council commissioner finding from secret informant thing have gone on smoothly being over awed by confident security of minister began to doubt former belief in spite of symptom of change be now inclined to think that none must take place sorrow contrition with next appeared before lord oldborough be therefore truly sincere when found alone once more with lordship earnest be vehemence with disclaimed unworthy son disavowed knowledge of transaction if have seen cause to believe that have part in transaction sir must not be here at moment therefore protestation be superfluous none must be accepted if be necessary very circumstance of son not having trusted father completely saved commissioner for time from utter ruin took breath presently oh weak man doomed never to know how to deal with strong character fancying that intercession might avail for son that pride of lord oldborough might be appeased might be suddenly wrought to forgiveness by tone posture of submission supplication used only by subject to offended majesty actually threw at foot of minister gracious lord pardon for son beseech sir cried lord oldborough endeavouring to stop from kneeling commissioner sunk instantly on knee never will unhappy father rise till son be restored to favour lord sir said lord oldborough have favour for who have sense of honour rise mr falconer let not father degrade for son unavailingly accent look be decisive commissioner rose instead of being gratified patron seemed shocked if not disgusted far from being propitiated by sacrifice of dignity rendered still more averse consolatory omen appearing commissioner withdrew in silence repenting that have abased after day night passed with in horror of indecision must minister weather storm not must mr falconer endeavour to reinstate with lord oldborough secure in time favour with duke of greenwich mr falconer to whom husband groan in middle of night at last betrayed suffering of mind drew from secret of fear meditation advised strongly going over decidedly in time secretly to greenwich faction commissioner knew that must not be done secretly attention of minister be now awake to motion smallest movement towards grace of greenwich must be observed understood on other hand to abide by falling minister be folly especially when have positively withdrawn favour from cunningham who have most to expect from patronage between opposite difficulty notwithstanding urgent excitation of mr falconer poor commissioner must not bring to decide till time for action be past blow came upon for be wholly unprepared there arrived from abroad account of failure of secret expedition general in despatch named colonel john falconer a officer to whose neglect of order principally attributed disappointment appeared that order have be sent to have regiment at certain place at given hour at moment order came colonel john falconer be out on shooting party without leave troop of course on general have relied did not arrive in time other combination failed from neglect of discipline disobedience of order colonel falconer be sent home to be tried by court martial pity sir said lord oldborough a commissioner falconer white a ash read in presence despatch pity sir from soul here be fault of yours fault be mine be one of few fault of nature lord oldborough have ever committed except in instance of falconer family none must name whom lordship have placed in situation for be inadequate unfit of single error have not foreseen consequence be more important more injurious to to public than must have calculated conceived appeared now a if falconer family be doomed to be ruin that public knew in general that john falconer have be promoted by ministerial favour lord oldborough be aware imagined that peculiar circumstance of affair be known only to to commissioner falconer family to astonishment found at critical moment that whole transaction have reached ear of majesty that be soon publicly known commissioner with protestation oath declared that secret have

be informed be laid before majesty lordship have be rightly informed trust hope that majesty at firm assertion in tone with lord oldborough pronounced trust majesty eye changed moved away from lord oldborough when with respectful interrogation of tone added hope majesty must not believe letter to be mine frankly lord said king assertion insinuation of man set of men of rank weight in dominion must by imaginable mean have induced to conceive possible that such letter have be written by lordship not for one moment must belief have be compelled by evidence le strong than lordship handwriting seal own thought knew lordship seal writing now see have be deceived rejoice to see thank majesty can not feel surprise that forgery counterfeit at first view compelled own belief of being genuine

lord oldborough discerned that there be genuine joy at moment majesty be undeceived real anxiety for honour only ostensible manifestation suitable to occasion repeatable recordable still there be nothing of must complain expression if written down repeated must have appeared proper gracious from sovereign to minister for minister to resign at moment from pride pique must have be fatal to

exclamation came from heart good heaven what will become of daughter bell sir robert comprehend quite dear sir perceiving that be not heard by alfred commissioner took up hat departed determining that must inquire farther from sir robert solicitor concerning probable consequence of recovery of deed alfred have sooner finished joyful letter to father than wrote to sir robert percy informing of recovery of deed letting know that be ready to show to whomsoever sir robert must send to house to examine made offer to put end at once to doubt trusted said that when sir robert must be satisfied of existence identity of deed must stop present proceeding for recovery of mesne rent that must without obliging father to have farther recourse to law restore to percy estate to letter answer be received for time at length mr sharpe called on alfred begged to see deed be permitted to examine in alfred presence noted down date name of witness other particular of observed be necessary must inform sir robert before must be satisfied a to identity of conveyance sharpe be particularly close guarded in look word during interview must admit deny that be satisfied went away leaving nothing

without waiting for answer from sir robert letter came from alfred received from solicitor following note sir be directed by sir robert percy to acquaint in reply to yours of th instant that conceiving title to percy estate to be way affected by instrument to allude therein can not withdraw present suit for mesne rent have be already received if proceed in ejectment for recovery of

recovered deed be beyond must have conceived even from effrontery villany consulted mr friend who after considering sharpe letter must not devise what defence intended to make a deed upon most accurate examination appeared duly executed according to provision of statute of fraud upon whole mr friend be of opinion that letter be meant merely to alarm plaintiff to bring to offer consent to compromise in opinion alfred be confirmed next day by interview with sharpe accidental on alfred part designed prepared by solicitor who watched alfred a be coming out of court dogged till parted from gentleman with whom be walking then joining said in voice mr allscrip might have envied for power of setting sense at defiance be happy mr alfred percy to chance to see to day for with view to put end to litigation difficulty have few word to suggest premising act speak now in wise a for sir robert percy with reference to being client a solicitor in cause be understood merely solely a one gentleman to upon honour not bringing forward idea to be taken advantage of hereafter a tending to thing in shape of offer to compromise in legal point of view know sir must not be warranted to hazard for client of consequence hereby declare in degree mean must be so good mr sharpe to state at once what do mean for confess in degree understand why then sir what mean be simply candidly frankly that if must without compromising interest of client a honest man be bound not to do appear to do must wish to put end to litigation between relation though father think enemy must convince to contrary if must allow must point out mean of shortening difference between relation have occasioned so much scandal moreover must devise accommodation might be agreeable to party save vast deal of trouble vexation possession added laughing being nine point of law mr sharpe paused a if hoping that something must now be said by alfred that might direct whether to advance recede alfred only observed that probably end mr sharpe proposed to by speaking be to make understood that desirable end have not yet attained why sir in case one can not venture to make one understood way by inuendoes then good morning to sir can never understand one pardon sir unless be in hurry cried mr sharpe catching alfred by button when so large estate to might eventually succeed be in question be too much man of business to be in one word then for wo detain moment throw open trust to honour do honour put parallel case plaintiff defendant b must if be way advising being b offer to divide whole property claim for mesne rent being wholly given up that offer must be accepted 'd engage upon honour supposing witnessing transaction only just a gentleman impossible sir cried alfred with indignation do take for fool do think must give up half father estate knowing that have right to whole pardon sir only suggested b case one word more sir cried mr sharpe holding alfred who be breaking from for own father interest see thing quite in wrong point of view when talk of few month more le delay of getting possession being there be between depend upon if go to trial will never get possession then sir if think so be betraying interest of client in advising not to let go to trial good god sir be between only pardon sir be between conscience oh if be conscience be at ease when be trying to prevent scandal of litigation between relation therefore just let mention to for private information what know sir robert must not wish to come out before trial tell to sir will not hear cried alfred breaking from walking on very fast faster still sharpe pursued will remember sir at event what have be said be not to go further will not forget will never forget be man of honour sir said alfred sharpe parted from muttering that if lived to day of trial must repent if live till day of judgment will never repent thought alfred now fully convinced that sir robert desired compromise wanted only to secure while in possession portion of property knew law must ultimately force to relinquish alfred persevered in course relieved from alarm into have at first be thrown when learned that opponent intended to make defence alfred felt assured that must never let matter come to trial time passed on still persisted many of brother lawyer be not only doubtful more inclined to despond than to encourage a to event of trial several regretted that have not accepted of mr sharpe offered compromise estate certain father release from difficulty thought too good offer to have be rejected might a sharpe have prophesied have to repent rejection of proposal others observed that though mr alfred percy be certainly young man of great talent have be successful at bar still be young lawyer be bold hazardous not to say rash thing to take upon conduct of suit against such opponent a mr sharpe sir robert percy practised in law hardened in iniquity now driven to desperation mr friend be only man who stood steadily by alfred never wavered in opinion trust to truth justice said did right not to compromise be firm if fail will have consolation will have done man must do to deserve success day of trial approached mr friend have hoped till very late in business that object of adversary be only to intimidate that must never let go to trial now be plain must on what ground again again mr friend alfred perused reperused sir john percy deed examined opinion of counsel of first eminence law right appeared to be clearly on side be not likely that experienced opponent must persist without having strong resource

sixpence examined threw down brief left court people looked at other in astonishment judge ordered that william clerke must be detained that might be prosecuted by crown for perjury old man fell back
