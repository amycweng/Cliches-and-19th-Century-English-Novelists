in device for time although may escape once twice perhaps ninety nine time what doe signifyfor hundredth time come to shame lose character grown bold by frequent success felix became more careless in operation happened that one day met mistress full in passage a be going on one of cook secret errand where be going felix said mistress to washerwoman maam answered with usual effrontery very well said call at bookseller instay must write down direction pomfret said opening housekeeper room door have bit of paper pomfret came with writing paper looked very angry to see that felix be going out

churchill in composed voice dont know maam answered felix so confused that knew not what to say what cried mr pomfret indignation flashing from eye what repeated mistress waiting for reply with calm air of attention still more disconcerted felix for though with angry person might have chance of escape knew that must not invent excuse in such circumstance must stand examination of person in sober sens be struck dumb speak said mr churchill in still lower tone be ready to hear have to say in house everybody will have justice speakbut what stammered felix after in vain attempting to equivocate confessed that be going to take turkey to cousin threw blame upon aunt cook who said have ordered upon expedition cook be now summoned totally denied knowledge of affair with same violence with have lately confounded franklin about beef in basket not entirely however with same success for felix perceiving by mistress eye that be on point of desiring to leave house immediately not being very willing to leave place in have lived so well with butler did not hesitate to confront aunt with assurance equal to own knew how to bring charge home to produced note in own handwriting purport of be to request cousin acceptance of delicate cold turkey to beg must send by return of bearer little of cherry brandy mr churchill coolly wrote upon back of note cook discharge informed felix have further occasion for service upon pleading with many tear franklin did not call crocodile tear that be so young that be under dominion of aunt touched mr pomfret compassion obtained for permission to stay till end of month to give yet chance of redeeming character mr pomfret now seeing how far have be imposed upon resolved for future to be more upon guard with felix felt that have treated franklin with great injustice when accused of malpractice about sirloin of beef good people when be made sensible that have treated anyone with injustice be impatient to have opportunity to rectify mistake mr pomfret be now prepared to see everything franklin did in most favourable point of view especially a next day discovered that be who morning boiled water for tea buttered toastservices for have always thought be indebted to felix besides have rated felixs ability very highly because made up weekly account for unluckily once when franklin be out of way brought bill in hurry to favourite to cast up discovered that did not know how to cast up pound shilling penny be obliged to confess that must wait till franklin came home passing over number of small incident gradually unfolded character of two boy must proceed to more serious affair corkscrew frequently after have finished taking away supper after housekeeper be gone to bed sallied forth to neighbouring alehouse to drink with friend alehouse be kept by cousin of felixs who be so fond of delicate cold turkey who have such choice cherry brandy corkscrew kept key of house door so that must return home whenever thought proper if must by accident be called for by mistress after supper felix knew where to find did not scruple to make of excuse poor franklin have too much integrity to use precaution taken butler be at liberty to indulge favourite passion so increased with indulgence that wage be by mean sufficient to support in way of life day felt le resolution to break through bad habit for day drinking became more necessary to health be ruined with red pimpled bloated face emaciated leg swelled diseased body appeared victim of intoxication in morning when got up hand trembled spirit flagged must hing until have taken draman operation be obliged to repeat several time in course of day a wretched people must who once acquire habit have run up long bill at alehouse frequented landlord who grew urgent for money refused to give further credit one night when corkscrew have drunk enough only to make fretful leaned with elbow surlily upon table began to quarrel with landlord swore that have not of late treated like gentleman to landlord coolly replied that a long a have paid like gentleman have be treated like one be a much a anyone must expect at rate a much a anyone must meet with in world for truth of assertion appealed laughing to party of men who be drinking in room men however took part with corkscrew drawing over to table made sit down with be in high good humour butler soon grew so intimate with in openness of heart soon communicated to not only own affair that knew more than that knew of mistress new friend be by mean uninterested by conversation encouraged a much a possible to talk for have secret view butler be by mean sufficiently sober to discover mr churchill have fine old family plate men belonged to gang of housebreaker before parted with corkscrew engaged to meet again next night intimacy be still more closely cemented one of men actually offered to lend corkscrew three guinea towards payment of debt hinted that if thought proper must easily get whole cleared off upon hint corkscrew became attention till after hesitation on part repeated promise of secrecy on at length disclosed plan to gave to understand that if must assist in letting into mistress house must let have ample share in booty butler who have reputation of being honest man indeed whose integrity have hitherto be proof against everything mistress port turned pale trembled at proposal drank two three bumper to drown thought promised to give answer next day went home more than half intoxicated mind be so full of what have passed that must not help bragging to felix whom found awake at return that must have bill paid off at alehouse whenever pleased dropping besides hint be not lost upon felix in morning felix reminded of thing have said corkscrew alarmed endeavoured to evade question by saying that be not in sens when talked in manner nothing however that must urge made impression upon felix whose recollection on subject be perfectly distinct who have too much cunning too little confidence in companion to be dupe of dissimulation butler knew not what to do when saw that felix be absolutely determined either to betray scheme to become sharer in booty next night came be now to make final decision to determine on breaking off entirely with new acquaintance taking felix with to join in plot debt love of drinking impossibility of indulging without fresh supply of money came into mind at once conquered remaining scruple be said by whose fatal experience give right to be believed that drunkard will sacrifice anything everything sooner than pleasure of habitual intoxication how much easier be never to begin bad custom than to break through when once formed hour of rendezvous came corkscrew went to alehouse where found housebreaker waiting for glass of brandy ready poured out sigheddrankhesitateddrank againheard landlord talk of bill saw money produced must pay in momentdrank againcursed giving hand to villain who be whispering in ear swore that must not help must do a must have required of to give up key of house door that might get made by have left with felix be now obliged to explain new difficulty have arisen felix knew enough to ruin must therefore be won over be very difficult task have strong desire to have worked cravat butler knew enough of to believe that must be sufficient bribe cravat be bought shown to felix thought only thing wanting to make complete fine gentleman to go without especially when have once seen in glass with one tied on in splendid bow appeared impossible even paltry temptation working upon vanity at length prevailed with boy whose integrity have long be corrupted by habit of petty pilfering daily falsehood be agreed that first time mistress sent out on message must carry key of house door to cousin deliver into hand of one of gang who be there in waiting for such be scheme felix night after have be planned went to bed fell fast asleep butler who have not yet stifled voice of conscience felt in silence of night so insupportably miserable that instead of going to rest stole softly into pantry for bottle of mistress wine there drinking glass after glass stayed till became so far intoxicated that though contrived to find way back to bed must by mean undress without power of recollection flung upon bed leaving candle half hanging out of candlestick beside franklin slept in next room to presently awaking thought perceived strong smell of something burning jumped up seeing light under butler door gently opened to astonishment beheld one of bed curtain in flame immediately ran to butler pulled with force to rouse from lethargy came to sens at length be so terrified so helpless that if have not be for franklin whole house must soon inevitably have be on fire felix trembling cowardly knew not what to do be curious to see obeying franklin whose turn now be to command franklin ran upstairs to awaken mr pomfret whose terror of fire be so great that came from room almost out of sens whilst with greatest presence of mind recollected where have seen two large tub of water maid have prepared night before for washing seizing wet linen have be left to soak threw upon flame exerted with so much good sense that fire be presently extinguished everything be now once more safe quiet mr pomfret recovering from fright postponed inquiry till morning rejoiced that mistress have not be awakened whilst corkscrew flattered that must be able to conceal true cause of accident dont tell mr pomfret where found candle when came into room said to franklin if asks know must tell truth replied must repeated felix sneeringly what must be tell tale never told tale of anybody must be very sorry to get anyone into scrape for will not tell lie either for anybody else let call what name will if be to give something that must like said corkscrewsomething that know must like repeated felix nothing can give will do answered franklin steadily so be useless to say more about iti hope will not be questioned in hope be mistaken for first thing mr pomfret did in morning be to come into room to examine deplore burnt curtain whilst corkscrew stood by endeavouring to exculpate by excuse must invent mr pomfret however though sometimes blinded by prejudice be fool be absolutely impossible to make believe that candle have be left on hearth where corkscrew protested have left must have set curtain on fire be at least six foot distant turning short round to franklin desired that must show where found candle when came into room took up candlestick moment housekeeper cast eye upon snatched from hand how did candlestick come here be not candlestick found here last night cried yes indeed be answered franklin be impossible retorted vehemently for left candlestick with own hand last night in hall last thing

with must be glad to know nothing in world oh nothing in world im sure beg pardon maam answered felix in soft tone sneaking off left friend corkscrew to fight own battle secretly resolving to desert in good time if saw danger of alehouse transaction coming to light corkscrew must make very blundering excuse for conscious of guilt turned pale appeared so much more terrified than butler usually appear when detected in lie mr pomfret resolved a said to sift matter to bottom impatiently did wait till clock struck nine mistress bell rang signal for attendance at levee how do find morning maam said undrawing curtain very sleepy indeed answered mistress in drowsy voice think must sleep hour longershut curtain a please maam suppose have better open little of window shutter for past nine just

lanternhes always right mr churchill must not help smiling if have seen maam last night in midst of fireim sure may thank that be not burned alive in bedsand will never forget coming to call poor

unlocked after eleven oclock at night unless by order will take charge of key upon condition will madam do anything order said franklin received key from hand when mr churchill order be made known caused many secret marvellings murmuring corkscrew felix be disconcerted dared not openly avow discontent treated franklin with greatest seeming kindness cordiality everything went on smoothly for three day butler never attempted usual midnight visit to alehouse went to bed in proper time paid particular court to mr pomfret in order to dispel suspicion have never have idea of real fact that felix be joined in plot with house breaker to rob house thought only went out at irregular hour to indulge in passion for drinking thus stood affair night before mr churchill birthday corkscrew by housekeeper mean ventured to present petition that might go to play next day request be granted franklin came into kitchen just when servant have gathered round butler who with great importance be

how to govern fool to attempt to reason with instead of laughing longer at fisher ridiculous superstition be determined to take advantage of affected to be persuaded of wisdom of measure looked at

a stuck to manager to one that barring out must end in woe if not begun precisely a clock must strike nine on wednesday night if begun in lucky moment obedient to lucky leader must end well thought provident thought now struck fisher for even have foresight where favourite passion be concerned pray in barring out will be starved said gipsy not if trust to for food if give money enough silver wont do for so many gold be what must cross hand have gold said fisher dont know what mean by so many im only talking of number one know must take care of first so a fisher thought be possible that

generalled still more vexed to have remarked archer poured forth volley of incoherent exclamation reproach against who be thus so soon discouraged by trifle groping for tinder box asked if anything must be easier than to strike light again light appeared at moment that made tinder box visible shower from above aimed aimed exactly at tinder box drenched with water rendered totally unfit for further service archer in fury dashed to ground now for first time felt what be to be unsuccessful head of party heard in turn murmur of discontented changeable populace recollecting bar bolt ingenious contrivance be more provoked at blaming for one only oversight than be grieved at disaster oh hair be wet cried one dolefully wring then said archer hand cut with broken glass cried glass

in vain to think of reaching to trap door a soon a daylight appeared archer rose softly that might reconnoitre devise method of guarding against new danger luckily there be round hole in top of window shutter admitted sufficient light for to work by remains of soaked feast wet candle broken glass spread over table in middle of room looked rather dismal morning pretty set of fellow have to manage said archer contemplating group of sleeper before be well have somebody to think for now if wantedwhich thank goodness dontbut if did want to call cabinet council to assistance whom must pitch upon not stupid snorer who be dreaming of gipsy if be dreaming of anything continued archer a looked into fisher open mouth next chap be quick enough then be so fond of having everything own way curl pated

listened waited for cousin cousin came at late hour company be obliged to breakfast upon scattered fragment of last night feast that feast have be spread with such imprudent profusion that little now remained to satisfy hungry guest archer who well knew effect apprehension of scarcity must have upon associate did everything must be done by bold countenance reiterated assertion to persuade that

ashamed alone a passed lifted up hand eye with astonishment others whispered huddled mysteriously together a if to avoid leonora walked on head little higher than usual leonora said cecilia timorously a passed oh cecilia who must have thought that have bad heart cecilia turned head aside burst into tear oh indeed have not bad heart cried louisa running up to throwing arm around neck shes very sorry

be so red go dear ill come presently then will keep place for next to must make haste will have to come in when have sat down to supper then will be so stared at so dont stay now cecilia followed louisa with eye till be out of sight be louisa said to herself only one who must stop to pity mr villars told that day must be mine little thought how must end saying word cecilia threw down upon ground arm leaned upon heap of turf have raised in morning in pride gaiety of heart have called throne at instant mr villars came out to enjoy serenity of evening passing by arbour where cecilia lay started cecilia rose hastily who be there said mr villars be madam who be cecilia why what keep here dear where be companion be perhaps one of happiest day of life oh madam said cecilia hardly able to repress tear why dear what be matter cecilia hesitated speak dear know that when ask to tell anything a friend never punish a governess therefore need not be afraid to tell be matter madam be not afraid ashamed asked why be not with companion why madam because have left what dear see that dislike yet dont know why must for take a much pain to please a of master seem satisfied with madam be pleased very morning to give bracelet be sure must not have given to anyone who did not deserve certainly not said mr villars well deserve for applicationfor successful application prize be for most assiduous not for most amiable then if have be for most amiable must not have be for mr villars smilingwhy what do think cecilia be better able to judge than be can determine whether apply to what give to learn whether attend to what desire to do avoid what desire not to do know that like a pupil can not know must like a companion unless be companion therefore must judge of what must do by seeing what others do in same circumstance oh pray dont madam for then must not love yet think must love for hope be a ready to oblige a good natured a yes cecilia dont doubt that must be very good natured to im afraid must not like unless be good tempered too madam by good natured mean good temperedits same thing indeed understand by two very different thing be good natured cecilia for be desirous to oblige serve companionsto gain praise save from blameto give pleasure relieve from pain leonora be good tempered for can bear with foible acknowledge own without disputing about right sometimes yield to who be in wrong in short temper be perfectly good for can bear forbear wish that mine must said cecilia sighing may replied mr villars be not wish alone can improve in anything turn same exertion perseverance have won prize to day to object will meet with same success perhaps not on first second third attempt depend upon that will at last new effort will weaken bad habit strengthen good one must not expect to succeed at once repeat to for habit must be counteracted by habit must be a extravagant in to expect that fault must be destroyed by one punishment be ever so severe a be in roman emperor be reading of few day ago to wish that head of enemy be upon one neck that might cut off at one blow here mr villars took cecilia by hand began to walk home such be nature of cecilias mind that when object be forcibly impressed on imagination caused temporary suspension of reasoning faculty hope be too strong stimulus for spirit when fear did take possession of mind be attended with total debility vanity be now a much mortified a in morning have be elated walked on with mr villars in silence until came under shade of elm tree walk there fixing eye upon mr villars stopped short do think madam said with hesitationdo think madam have bad heart bad heartmy dear why what put into head leonora said that have madam felt ashamed when said so dear how can leonora tell whether heart be good bad however in first place tell what mean by bad heart indeed know what be meant by madam be something everybody hate why do hate because think that will hurt maam believe that who have bad heart take delight in doing mischief that never do anybody good for own end then best definition said mr villars can give of bad heart be that be constant propensity to hurt others to do wrong for sake of doing wrong yes madam be not there be still something else meant something can not expresswhich indeed never distinctly understood of therefore be more afraid well then to begin with what do understand tell cecilia do really think possible to be wicked merely for love of wickedness human being becomes wicked at once man begin by doing wrong because be because think for interest if continue to do so must conquer sense of shame lose love of virtue how can cecilia who feel strong sense of shame eager desire to improve imagine that have bad heart indeed madam never did until everybody told so then began to be frightened about very evening madam when be in passion threw little louisas strawberry away be sure be very sorry for afterwards leonora everybody cried out that have bad heartbut be sure be only in passion very likely when be in passion a call cecilia see that be tempted to do harm to others if feel angry sympathize with perceive motive actuates then say that have bad heart daresay however when passion be over when recollect be very sorry for what have done said be not yes indeed madamvery sorry then make sorry of use to cecilia fix steadily in thought a hope to be good happy that if suffer to yield to passion upon occasion anger consequence will become familiar to mind in same proportion sense of shame will be weakened till what began with doing from sudden impulse will end with doing from habit choice then must indeed according to definition have bad heart oh madam hopei be sure never will indeed cecilia do indeed believe that never will on contrary think that have very good disposition what be of infinitely more consequence to active desire of improvement show that have a much perseverance a have candour will not despair of becoming everything must wish here cecilias countenance brightened ran up step in almost a high spirit a ran down in morning good night to cecilia said mr villars a be crossing hall good night to madam said cecilia ran upstairs to bed must not go to sleep lay awake reflecting upon event of preceding day forming resolution for future at same time that have resolved resolved without effect wished to give mind more powerful motive ambition knew to be most powerful incentive have not said to herself already won prize of application can not same application procure much higher prize mr villars said that if prize have be promised to most amiable must not have be given to perhaps must not yesterday perhaps might not to morrow be reason must despair of ever deserving in consequence of reasoning cecilia formed design of proposing to companion that must give prize first of ensuing month st of june to most amiable mr villars applauded scheme companion adopted with greatest alacrity let prize said be bracelet of own hair instantly shining scissors be produced contributed lock of hair formed most beautiful gradation of colour from palest auburn to brightest black who be to have honour of plaiting be now question caroline begged that might a must plait very neatly said cecilia however be equally sure that must do much better dispute must have inevitably ensued if cecilia recollecting just a colour rose to scarlet have not yieldedyielded with very good grace indeed a well a must be expected for first time for be habit confers ease without ease even in moral action there can be grace bracelet be plaited in neatest manner by caroline finished round edge with silver twist on be worked in smallest silver letter motto to most amiable moment be completed everybody begged to try on fastened with little silver clasp a be made large enough for eldest girl be too large for youngest of bitterly complained unanimously entreated that might be cut to fit how foolish exclaimed cecilia dont perceive that if of win have nothing to do to put clip little further from edge if get cant make larger very true said need not to have called foolish cecilia be by such hasty unguarded expression a that cecilia offended slight difference in manner make very material one in effect cecilia lost more love by general petulance than must gain by greatest particular exertion how far succeeded in curing herself of defecthow far became deserving of bracelet to whom bracelet be givenwill be told in history of first of june first of june be now arrived young competitor be in state of most anxious suspense leonora cecilia continued to be foremost candidate quarrel have never be finally adjusted different pretension now retarded thought of reconciliation cecilia though be capable of acknowledging of fault in public before companion must not humble in private to leonora leonora be equal be inferior submission be much easier to vain mind where appears to be voluntary than when be necessary tribute to justice candour so strongly did cecilia feel truth that even delayed making apology coming to explanation with leonora until success must once more give palm if win bracelet to day said to herself will solicit return of leonoras friendship will be more valuable to than even bracelet at time asked in such manner surely can not refuse to animated with hope of double triumph cecilia canvassed with most zealous activity by constant attention exertion have considerably abated violence of temper changed course of habit power of pleasing be now excited instead of ability to excel if talent appeared le brilliant character be acknowledged to be more amiable so great influence upon manner conduct have object of ambition cecilia be now if possible more than ever desirous of
