on various defect absurdity of mr luttridge wig on topic mr hervey displayed much wit gallantry satire with so happy effect belinda when took leave be precisely of aunt opinion that be most uncommonly pleasant young man clarence hervey might have be more than pleasant young man if have not be smitten with desire of being thought superior in thing of being most admired person in company have be early flattered with idea that be man of genius imagined that a such be entitled to be imprudent wild eccentric affected singularity in order to establish claim to genius have considerable literary talent by be distinguished at oxford be so dreadfully afraid of passing for pedant when came into company of idle ignorant pretended to disdain specie of knowledge chameleon character seemed to vary in different light according to different situation in happened to be placed must be thing to men to woman be supposed to be favourite with fair sex of various excellency defect there be none on valued so much a on gallantry be not profligate have strong sense of honour quick feeling of humanity be so easily led rather so easily excited by companion companion be now of such sort that be probable must soon become vicious a to connexion with lady delacour must have started with horror at idea of disturbing peace of family in family said there be peace to disturb be vain of having seen by world that be distinguished by lady of wit fashion did not think incumbent on to be more scrupulous more attentive to appearance than ladyship by lord delacour jealousy be sometimes provoked sometimes amused sometimes flattered be constantly of ladyship party in public private consequently saw belinda almost day day saw with increasing admiration of beauty with increasing dread of being taken in to marry niece of catch match maker name by mr stanhope be known amongst men of acquaintance young lady who have misfortune to be conducted by artful dame be always supposed to be partner in speculation though name may not appear in firm if have not be prejudiced by character of aunt mr hervey must have thought belinda undesigning unaffected girl now suspected of artifice in word look motion even when felt most charmed by power of pleasing be most inclined to despise for what thought such premature proficiency in scientific coquetry have not sufficient resolution to keep beyond sphere of attraction frequently when found within cursed folly drew back with sudden terror manner towards be so variable inconsistent that knew not how to interpret language sometimes fancied that with eloquence of eye said adore belinda at other time imagined that guarded silence meant to warn that be so entangled by lady delacour that must not extricate from snare whenever last idea struck excited in most edifying manner indignation against coquetry in general against ladyship in particular became wonderfully clear sighted to impropriety of ladyship conduct belinda newly acquired moral sense be so much shocked that actually wrote full statement of observation scruple to aunt stanhope concluding by request that might not remain under protection of lady of whose character must not approve whose intimacy might perhaps be injurious to reputation if not to principle mr stanhope answered belinda letter in very guarded style rebuked niece severely for imprudence in mentioning name in such manner in letter sent by common post assured that reputation be in danger that hoped niece of hers must set up for prude character more suspected by men of world than even of coquette that person alluded to be perfectly fit chaperon for young lady to appear with in public a long a be visited by first people in town a to thing in private conduct of person a to private brouillieries between lord belinda must observe on dangerous topic profound silence in letter conversation that a long a lady continued under protection of husband world might whisper must not speak out that a to belinda own principle must be utterly inexcusable if after education have received must be hurt by bad example that must not be too cautious in management of man of character that must have serious cause for jealousy in quarter apprehended a marriage there must not be object there be such difference of age that permanent influence must probably be obtained by lady that most certain method for miss portman to expose to ridicule of one of party to total neglect of other must be to betray anxiety jealousy that in short if be fool enough to lose own heart there must be little chance of being wise enough to win that of who be evidently man of gallantry rather than of sentiment who be known to play card well to have good luck whenever heart be trump belinda fear of lady delacour a dangerous rival be much quieted by artful insinuation of mr stanhope with respect to age c in proportion a fear subsided blamed for having written too harshly of ladyship conduct idea that whilst appeared a lady delacour friend ought not to propagate story to disadvantage operated powerfully upon belinda mind reproached for having told even aunt what have seen in private thought that have be guilty of treachery wrote again immediately to mr stanhope to conjure to burn last letter to forget if possible content to believe that not syllable of similar nature must ever more be heard from be just concluding with word hope dear aunt will consider a error of judgment not of heart when lady delacour burst into room exclaiming in tone of gaiety tragedy comedy belinda masquerade dress be come how

not least guess of what be really passing in ladyship heart implicitly believed expression of complete indifference to lord jealousy be last feeling miss portman must have attributed to lady delacour because unfortunately be not sufficiently aware that jealousy can exist without love idea of lord delacour a object of attachment of coronet a object of ambition of friend death a object of joy be so foreign to belinda innocent mind that be scarcely possible must decipher lady delacour thought ladyship affected to be in remarkable good spirit morning declared that have never felt so well since

produced so much uneasiness that lord delacour have always treated with politeness good nature that such thought view a have be attributed to be convinced have never entered lordship mind that hearing of publicity of report have however much affected lady d have therefore said belinda thought prudent to quit ladyship to accept of invitation from lady anne percival to oakly park hope dear aunt that will not be displeased by leaving town without seeing sir philip baddely again meeting must indeed answer purpose a be entirely out of power to return partiality of character temper manner know enough to be convinced that union must tend only to make miserable after what have seen nothing can ever tempt to marry from of common view of interest ambition on subject belinda though declared own sentiment with firm sincerity touched a slightly a must because anxiously wished to avoid appearance of braving opinion of aunt to whom be under obligation be tempted to pas over in silence that part of mr stanhope letter related to clarence hervey upon reflection determined to conquer repugnance to speak of to make perfect sincerity steady rule of conduct therefore acknowledged to aunt that of

there be too little languor in eye too much colour in cheek confessed that be graceful motion be not quite slow enough to please be somewhat singular that lady delacour faithful friend harriot freke must be cause of mr vincent first fixing favourable attention on miss portman have black servant of name of juba who be extremely attached to have known juba from boy have brought over with when first came to england because poor fellow begged so earnestly to go with young massa juba have lived with ever since accompanied wherever went whilst be at harrowgate mr vincent lodged in same house with mr

curricle into coach house in triumph mr freke who heard saw whole transaction from window said swore that must make juba repent of what called insolence threat be loud enough to reach ear looked up in astonishment to hear such voice from woman instant afterwards began to sing very gaily a jumped into curricle to turn cushion then danced up down by spring a if rejoicing in victory second third time mr freke repeated threat confirming by oath then violently shut down window disappeared mr vincent to whom juba with much simplicity expressed aversion of man woman who lived in house with laughed at odd manner in black imitated voice gesture thought more of matter time afterward however juba spirit forsook be never heard to sing to whistle scarcely ever spoke even to master who be much surprised by sudden change from gaiety loquacity to melancholy taciturnity nothing must draw from poor fellow explanation of cause of alteration in humour though seemed excessively grateful for concern master showed about health kindness amusement must restore to wonted cheerfulness mr vincent knew that be passionately fond of music having heard once express wish for tambourine gave one juba never played upon spirit seemed day to grow worse worse melancholy lasted during whole time that remained at harrowgate from first day of arrival at oakly park began to mend after have be there week be heard to sing whistle talk a used to do master congratulated upon recovery one evening master asked to go back to harrowgate for tambourine a little charles percival wished to hear play upon simple request have wonderful effect upon poor juba began to tremble from head to foot eye became fixed stood motionless after time suddenly clasped hand fell upon knee exclaimed oh massa juba die if juba go back juba die wiped away drop stood upon forehead will go if massa bid will die mr vincent began to imagine that poor fellow be out of sens assured with greatest kindness that must almost a soon hazard own life a of faithful affectionate servant pressed to explain what possible danger dreaded from returning to harrowgate juba be silent a if afraid to speak fear to speak to said mr vincent will defend if anybody have injured if dread that body will injure trust to will protect ah massa can die if go back can say word more put finger upon lip shook head mr vincent knew that juba be excessively superstitious convinced that if mind be not already deranged must certainly become so be secret terror thus to prey upon imagination assumed very grave countenance assured that must be extremely displeased if persisted in foolish obstinate silence overcome by juba burst into tear answered den will tell conversation passed before miss portman charles percival who be walking in park with mr vincent at time met juba asked to go for tambourine when came to word will tell made sign that wished to tell to master alone belinda little boy walked on to leave at liberty to speak then though with sort of reluctant horror told that figure of old woman in flame have appeared to in bedchamber at harrowgate night that be sure be one of obeah woman of own country who have pursued to europe to revenge having once when be child trampled upon egg shell contained of poison extreme absurdity of story made mr vincent burst out laughing humanity next instant made serious for poor victim of superstitious terror after having revealed what according to belief of country be death to mention fell senseless on ground when came to calmly said that knew must now die for obeah woman never forgave that talked of secret with deep groan added that wished might die before night that might not see again be in vain to attempt to reason out of idea that have actually seen apparition account of be that first appeared to in coach house one night when went thither in dark that never afterwards went to coach house in dark that same figure of old woman in flame appeared at foot of bed night whilst stayed at harrowgate that be then persuaded must never let escape from power till have killed that since have left harrowgate however have not tormented for have never seen be in hope that have forgiven now be sure of vengeance for having spoken of mr vincent knew astonishing power belief in specie of sorcery have over mind of jamaica negro pine actually die away from moment fancy under

much attention sympathy to beginning of poor fellow story moment that heard of flaming apparition recollected having seen head drawn in phosphorus one of child have exhibited for amusement occurred to that perhaps imprudent ill natured person might have terrified ignorant negro by similar mean when mentioned to mr vincent recollected threat have be thrown out by mr freke day that juba have taken possession of disputed coach house from character of lady belinda judged that must be likely to play trick to call a usual fun frolic miss portman suggested that one of child must show phosphorus must draw ludicrous figure with in presence be done have effect that expected juba familiarized by degree with object of secret horror convinced that obeah woman be exercising over sorcery recovered health spirit gratitude to miss portman who be immediate cause of cure be a simple touching a be lively sincere be circumstance first turned mr vincent attention towards belinda upon examining room in negro used to sleep at harrowgate strong smell of phosphorus be perceived part of paper be burnt on very spot where have always seen figure so that be now perfectly convinced that trick have be purposely played to frighten in revenge for having kept possession of coach house mr freke when found detected gloried in jest told story a good joke wherever went triumphing in notion that be who have driven

that ever be drawn yes said belinda how much more interesting picture be to from knowing that be not fancy piece that happiness be real not imaginary that be natural expression of affection in countenance of mother that child who crowd round be what seem to be pride pleasure of life there can not exclaimed mr vincent with enthusiasm be more delightful picture oh miss portman be possible that must not feel what can paint so well be possible sir said belinda that must suspect of such wretched hypocrisy a to affect to admire what be incapable of feeling misunderstand totally misunderstand hypocrisy there be not woman upon earth whom believe to be so far above hypocrisy affectation imagined feared a spoke last word be in confusion hastily turned over print in portfolio lay upon table belinda eye be caught by engraving of lady delacour in character of comic muse mr vincent did not know intimacy have subsisted between ladyship miss portman sighed from recollection of

fortunate have seen one one equally worthy of esteem admiration love mr vincent voice faltered in pronouncing word love yet belinda prepossessed by idea that be attached to creole lady simply answered without looking up from drawing be indeed very fortunate peculiarly fortunate be west indian lady west indian lady interrupted mr vincent surely miss portman can not imagine that be at instant thinking of west indian lady belinda looked up with air of surprise charming miss portman continued have learnt to admire european beauty european excellence have acquired new idea of female character idea feeling that must henceforward render exquisitely happy exquisitely miserable miss portman have be too often called charming to be much startled delighted by sound word must have passed by unnoticed there be something so impassioned in mr vincent manner that must no longer mistake for common gallantry be in evident confusion now for first time idea of mr vincent a lover came into mind next instant accused of vanity dreaded that must read thought exquisitely miserable said in tone of raillery must not suppose from what have seen of mr vincent that thing must make exquisitely miserable then know character know heart be in power to make exquisitely miserable mine be not cold hackneyed phrase of gallantry fervid language of passion cried seizing hand at instant one of child came in with flower to belinda glad of interruption hastily put up drawing left room observing that must scarcely have time to dress before dinner however a soon a found alone forgot how late be though sat down before glass to dress made progress in business continued for time motionless endeavouring to recollect to understand have passed result of reflection be conviction that partiality for clarence hervey be greater than ever have till moment suspected have told aunt stanhope thought that idea of mr hervey have influence in refusal of sir philip baddely have said that affection be entirely at own command then why do feel alarm at discovery of mr vincent view why do compare with one whom thought have forgotten yet how be to judge of character how can form estimate of what be amiable of what will make happy miserable by comparison be to blame for perceiving superiority be to blame if one person be more agreeable seem to be more agreeable than be to blame if can not love mr vincent before belinda have answered question to satisfaction dinner bell rang there happened to dine day at mr percival gentleman who have just arrived from lisbon conversation turned upon sailor practice of stilling wave over bar of lisbon by throwing oil upon water charles percival curiosity be excited by conversation wished to see experiment in evening father indulged wish child be delighted at sight little charles insisted upon belinda following to particular spot where be well convinced that must see better than where else in world take care cried lady anne will lead friend into river charles boy paused soon afterwards asked father several question about swimming drowning bringing people to life after have be drowned remember papa said that mr hervey who be almost drowned in serpentine river in london belinda coloured at hearing unexpectedly name of person of whom be at instant thinking child continued liked that mr hervey very much liked from first day saw what number of entertaining thing told at dinner used to call good natured gentleman like very much wish be here minute did ever see miss portman oh yes must have seen for be who carried helena gold fish to mother used often to be at lady delacour be not yes dear often did not like very much simple question threw belinda into inexpressible confusion fortunately crimson on face be seen only by lady anne percival to belinda great satisfaction mr vincent forbore evening attempt to renew conversation of morning endeavoured to mix with usual animation gaiety in family society embarrassment be much lessened when heard next day at breakfast that be gone to harrowgate lady anne percival took notice that be morning unusually sprightly after breakfast a be passing through hall to take walk in park one of little boy stopped to look at musical instrument hung up against wall what be mamma be not guitar be dear be called banjore be african instrument of negro be particularly fond mr vincent mentioned other day to miss portman believe expressed curiosity to see one went to work immediately to make banjore find poor fellow dare say that be very sorry to go to harrowgate to leave african guitar half finished especially a be intended for offering to miss portman be most grateful affectionate creature ever saw why mamma said charles percival be mr vincent gone away be sorry be gone hope will soon come back in mean time must run water carnation sorrow for friend mr vincent departure doe not seem to affect spirit much said lady anne people who expect sentiment from child of six year old will be disappointed will probably teach affectation surely be much better to let natural affection have time to expand if tear rosebud open spoil flower belinda smiled at parable of rosebud said might be applied to men woman a well a to child yet upon reflection said lady anne heart have nothing in common with rosebud nonsensical allusion pas off very prettily in conversation mean when converse with partial friend must reason ill conduct worse if be to trust implicitly to poetical analogy affection continued lady anne arise from circumstance totally independent of will be very thing meant to say interrupted belinda eagerly be excited by agreeable useful quality that discover in thing in person undoubtedly said belinda by fancy discover said lady anne belinda be silent after pause said that be certainly very dangerous especially for woman to trust to fancy in bestowing affection yet said lady anne be danger to be much exposed in society men have in power to assume appearance of thing be amiable estimable woman have scarcely opportunity of detecting counterfeit without ithuriel spear how can distinguish good from evil said belinda be common place complaint know ready excuse that silly young woman plead when make mistake for friend reproach for too often reproach complaint be common place precisely because be general just replied lady anne in slight frivolous intercourse fashionable belle usually have with fashionable beau who call lover be surprising that can discover thing of other real character indeed seldom do probably be cause why there be so many unsuitable unhappy marriage woman who have opportunity of seeing lover in private society in domestic life have infinite advantage for if have sense have sincerity real character of may perhaps be developed true said belinda who now suspected that lady anne alluded to mr vincent in such situation woman must readily be able to decide whether man who addressed must suit taste not so must be inexcusable if from vanity coquetry disguised real sentiment will miss portman who can not by one to whom be known be suspected of vanity coquetry permit to speak to with freedom of friend belinda touched by kindness of lady anne manner pressed hand exclaimed yes dear lady anne speak to with freedom can not do greater favour thought of mind secret feeling of heart will be concealed from imagine that wish to encroach upon generous openness of temper said lady anne tell when go too far will be silent one who like miss portman have lived in world have seen variety of character probably have have variety of admirer must have formed determinate idea of sort of companion must make happy if be to marry unless said lady anne have formed resolution against marriage have formed such resolution said belinda indeed since have seen happiness mr percival enjoy in own family have be much more disposed to think that union that union such a yours must increase happiness at same time aversion to idea of marrying from interest convenience from motif esteem love be increased almost to horror o lady anne there be nothing must not do to please friend to whom be under obligation except sacrificing peace of mind integrity happiness of life by lady anne in gentle tone assured that be last person in world who must press to union must make unhappy perceive that mr vincent have spoken to of what passed between yesterday perceive that be friend forget be also yours if fear undue influence from of relation in favour of mr vincent large fortune c let proposal remain secret between ourselves till can decide from farther acquaintance with whether will be in power to return affection fear dear lady anne cried belinda that be not in power to return affection may ask objection be not sufficient objection that be persuaded can not love for may be mistaken in persuasion remember what said little while ago about fancy spontaneous affection doe mr vincent appear to defective in of quality think essential to happiness mr percival have known from time be man can answer for integrity good temper be not first point must consider ought to be be sure believe be of understanding will say nothing because have have full opportunity of judging of from conversation mr vincent appears to have good understanding said belinda then to what do object be there thing disgusting to in person manner be very handsome be well bred manner be unaffected said belinda accuse of caprice altogether doe not suit taste can not think sufficient not to feel disgust for husband though believe be fashionable doctrine be not mine assure said lady anne be not one of who think beafest to begin with little aversion since acknowledge that mr vincent posse essential good quality entitle to esteem be satisfied gradually acquire knowledge of good quality of who endeavour to please if be really amiable person become agreeable to by degree when become accustomed to accustomed said belinda smiling one doe grow accustomed even to disagreeable thing certainly at rate dear lady anne doubt one might grow accustomed to caliban belief in reconciling power of custom doe not go quite so far said lady anne doe not extend to caliban even to hero of la belle la bete do believe that in mind so well regulated a yours esteem may certainly in time be improved into love will tell mr vincent so dear dear lady anne must not indeed must not have too good opinion of mind be not so well regulated be much weaker much sillier than imagine than can conceive said belinda lady anne soothed with most affectionate expression concluded with saying mr vincent have promised not to return from harrowgate to torment with address if be absolutely determined against be of too generous perhaps too proud temper to persecute with vain solicitation however mr percival may wish that must obtain such wife will have common uncommon sense good nature to allow friend to be happy own way be very good too good be then to be cause of banishing mr vincent from friend from oakly park will not do what be most prudent to avoid charming miss portman said lady anne smiling if must not love be at least advice gave when consulted yesterday evening will not sign writ of banishment lightly nothing assurance that heart be engaged can be sufficient cause for despair nothing else must in eye justify dear belinda from charge of caprice can give such assurance hope believe said belinda in great confusion yet must not for world deceive have right to sincerity paused lady anne said with smile perhaps can spare trouble of telling in word what blush told at least made suspect yesterday evening when be standing by river side when little charles asked yes remember saw look at undesignedly believe undesignedly be sure be afraid must think truth more than truth truth will hear rest will leave to judgment to kindness belinda gave full account of acquaintance with clarence hervey of variation in manner towards of excellent conduct with respect to lady delacour of by by spoke at large be more concise when touched upon state of own heart voice almost failed when came to history of lock of beautiful hair windsor incognita picture of virginia concluded by expressing conviction of propriety of forgetting man who be in probability attached to declared to be resolution to banish from thought lady anne said that nothing must be more prudent praiseworthy than forming such resolution except keeping lady anne have high opinion of mr hervey have doubt from belinda account from own observation on mr hervey from slight circumstance have accidentally come to mr percival knowledge that be a belinda suspected attached to person wished therefore to confirm miss portman in belief to turn thought towards one who beside being deserving of esteem love felt for most sincere affection did not however press subject farther at time contented with requesting that belinda must take three day usual time given for deliberation in fairy tale before must decide against mr vincent next day went to look at porter lodge mr percival have just built be inhabited by old man woman who have for many year be industrious tenant who in old age have be reduced to poverty not by imprudence by misfortune lady anne be pleased to see comfortably settled in new habitation whilst belinda be talking to old couple grand daughter pretty looking girl of about eighteen came in with basket of egg in hand well lucy said lady anne have overcome dislike to james girl reddened smiled looked at grand mother who answered for

especially when be so old a to have forgot little ever knew about such thing have best right in world to speak about such thing grand daughter have best reason in world to listen to said lady anne because in spite of cross of fortune have be excellent happy wife at least ever since can remember ever since can remember be more offence to ladyship said old man striking crutch against ground ever since can remember have made happiest man in whole world in whole parish a body know best of cried with degree of enthusiasm lighted up aged countenance animated feeble voice yet said honest dame if have followed fancy taken up with first love must not have ' be with lucy have sort of fancy since lady so good a to let speak have sort of fancy for idle young man very luckily for took into head to fall in love with young woman then have leisure enough left to think of grandfather who be not so much to taste like at first when found out goodness cleverness joined to all great tenderness for thought better of lucy a who know may do though there will not be word said on part to press for poor jackson thinking better be cause why have be so happy ever since be so still in old age ah lucy

anne good morning to farewell lucy be pretty necklace be very becoming to fare ye well hurried out of cottage with belinda apprehensive that talkative old dame might weaken effect of good sense experience by farther profusion of word one must think said belinda with ingenuous smile that lesson upon danger of fancy be intended for at rate may turn to own advantage happy who can turn experience of others to own advantage said lady anne must be more valuable privilege than power of turning thing be touched to gold walked on in silence for few minute then miss portman pursuing train of own thought unconscious that have not explained to lady anne abruptly exclaimed if must be entangled so a not to be able to retract if must not be in power to love at last will think coquette jilt perhaps will have reason to complain of if waste time trifle with affection then be not better must avoid by decided refusal possibility of injury to mr vincent of blame to myself there be danger of mr vincent misunderstanding misrepresenting risk that run be by voluntary choice be sure that if after farther acquaintance with find impossible to return affection will not consider a ill used by

of external circumstance woman be too often reduced to dilemma must marry man doe not love must be blamed by world must sacrifice portion of reputation whole of happiness world be indeed often too curious too rash in affair said lady anne young woman be not in respect allowed sufficient time for freedom of deliberation see a mr percival once said 'the drawn sword of tyrant custom suspended over head by single hair yet notwithstanding be so well aware of danger ladyship must expose to said belinda yes for think chance of happiness in instance overbalances risk said lady anne a can not alter common law of custom a can not render world le gossiping le censorious must not expect always to avoid censure can do be never to deserve must be absurd to enslave to opinion of idle ignorant to

urchin will make prize remember in one of raphael picture cupid creeping into armour of conqueror of world be sufficiently aware said belinda smiling of power of cupid of wile must not brave malice will fly from be so cowardly to fly surely prudence not courage be virtue of sex seriously dear lady delacour entreat not to use influence over mind lest must lessen happiness though can not alter determination moved by earnest manner in belinda uttered word lady delacour rallied more did longer oppose resolution of returning immediately to oakly park may remind said miss portman though be seldom either politic polite to remind people of promise may remind of something like promise made to accompany to mr percival must have behave so brutally to poor lord delacour a to run away from in

delacour have once tasted pleasure of domestic life must not easily return to dissipation have followed from habit into have first be driven by mixture of vanity despair connexion have imprudently formed with number of fashionable extravagant thoughtless woman must insensibly be broken off by measure for lady delacour who be already weary of company must be so much struck with difference between insipid conversation animated interesting society in lady anne percival family that must afterwards think not only burdensome intolerable lord delacour intimacy with lord studley be one of chief inducement to intemperance injured almost equally constitution understanding for week past have abstained from excess belinda be well aware that when immediate motive of humanity to lady delacour ceased to act upon must probably return to former habit if continued to visit former associate be therefore of importance to break at once connexion with lord studley to place in situation where might form new habit where dormant talent might be roused to exertion be convinced that understanding be not so much below par a have once be taught to think perceived also that since reconciliation lady delacour be anxious to make appear to advantage whenever said thing be worth hearing looked at belinda with triumph whenever happened to make mistake in conversation showed involuntary sign of uneasiness passed off with easy wit by generally knew how to make worse appear better reason miss portman knew that mr percival possessed happy talent of drawing out ability of with whom conversed that did not value men merely for erudition science literature be capable of estimating potential a well a actual range of mind of generosity must not doubt be persuaded that must take possible mean good nature joined to good sense must suggest to raise lord delacour in lady esteem to make union happy be indissoluble reflection passed with utmost rapidity in belinda mind result

sensibility capable of enthusiasm of passion delicacy of sentiment firmness of rational constancy be not wonderful that mr hervey with such high expectation must not immediately find gratified disappointed in first search did not however relinquish design at length by accident discovered thought that discovered object formed expressly for purpose one fine evening in autumn a be riding through new forest charmed with picturesque beauty of place turned out of beaten road struck into fresh track pursued with increasing delight till setting sun reminded that be necessary to postpone

sent woman from village returned more that night simplicity sensibility perhaps more than be aware beauty have pleased touched extremely idea of attaching perfectly pure disinterested unpractised heart be delightful to imagination cultivation of understanding thought must be easy pleasing task difficulty vanished before sanguine hope sensibility said to be parent of great talent great virtue evidently posse natural feeling in uncommon degree will be developed with skill patience delicacy will deserve before claim reward next day returned to cottage accompanied by elderly lady mr ormond same lady who afterward to marriott prejudiced eye have appeared more like dragon than thing else who to simple unsuspicious girl seemed like what really be truly good natured benevolent woman consented most readily to put under protection of mr ormond provided mr smith must give leave there be difficulty in persuading mr smith that be for advantage mr smith who be plain farmer wife told that knew of rachel history that knew be little have heard only hint at odd time from old woman agreed perfectly with what mr hervey have already heard old gentlewoman said mr smith a believe must call by right have lived in forest there where found many year earned subsistence by tending bee making rose water be good soul very particular especially about grand daughter considering thing one can not blame for often told must never put rachel to boarding school approved seeing have fortune be ruin of girl to mind to be bred above mean a be of mother sir then must never teach rachel to write for fear must take to scrawling nonsense of love letter a mother did before now sir approved too for much mind about book learning even thought must have be a well if girl have not learnt to read that did learn be always fond of be sure be more plague than use too to grandmother for be a particular about book that girl be to read a about rest went farther than sir for never must let girl speak to man not man ever entered door of house so told told true enough there thought be quite wrong for seeing girl must time other speak to men where be use of not learning to do properly lord ma'be continued mr smith addressing to mr ormond lord ma'be though be sin to be remembering so much of particularity of dead must say there never be old lady who have more scrupulosities than deceased verily thought one day must have gone into fit about picture of man rachel lit upon by accident a if picture have sense to hurt body now if have be one of naked picture there might have be delicacy in dislike to be such thing very proper picture picture ma'be of young sea officer in full uniform quite proper ma'be be mother left with have always in own room girl saw be mightily taken with being first thing of kind have ever lit upon old lady come in took on till verily thought be crazed lord really must not laugh checked when poor old soul eye filled with tear made know be thinking of daughter be dead when thought on cause of particularity about rachel must not laugh more at strangeness promised good lady day in case of death to take care of grand daughter thought in own mind that in time to come if one of boy must take fancy to must make objection because be always good modest behaved girl be sure must make good wife though too delicate for hard country work a plea god to send madam good gentleman to take charge of off hand be content must be so will sell thing here for honestly bring to madam for poor rachel there be nothing that rachel be anxious to carry away with little bullfinch of be very fond one one circumstance about rachel stopped current of clarence hervey imagination consequently be excessively disagreeable to name name of rachel must not endure thought so unsuited to that must scarcely believe belonged to consequently resolved to change a soon a possible first time that beheld be struck with idea that resembled description of virginia in m de st pierre celebrated romance by name always called from hour that quitted cottage mr ormond lady whom have engaged to take care of virginia be widow mother of gentleman who have be tutor at college son died left in such narrow circumstance that be obliged to apply to friend for pecuniary assistance mr hervey have be liberal in contribution from childhood have known worth attachment to be blended with most profound respect be not woman of superior ability of much information excellent temper gentle disposition won affection though have not talent to excite admiration mr hervey have perfect confidence in integrity believed that must exactly comply with direction thought that want of literature ingenuity must easily be supplied by own care instruction took house for fair pupil at windsor exacted solemn promise that must neither receive pay visit virginia be thus secluded from intercourse with world saw one mr ormond clarence hervey mr moreton elderly clergyman whom mr hervey engaged to attend sunday to read prayer for at home virginia never expressed slightest curiosity to see other person thing beyond wall of garden belonged to house in lived present retirement be not greater than to have long be accustomed consequently did not feel seclusion from world a restraint with circumstance be altered in situation seemed to be dazzled charmed object of convenience luxury be new to looked upon with indifference with thing reminded of former way of life of grandmother cottage be delighted one day mr hervey asked whether must like better to return to cottage to remain where be trembled for answer innocently replied must like best to go back to cottage if must go with must rather stay here with than live there without clarence be touched flattered by artless answer for time discovered day fresh indication a thought of virtue ability in charming pupil indifference to object of show ornament appeared to indisputable proof of magnanimity of superiority of unprejudiced mind what difference thought between child of nature frivolous sophisticated slave of art to try prove simplicity of taste purity of mind once presented to pair of diamond earring moss rosebud asked to take whichever liked best eagerly snatched rose cry oh put in mind of cottage how sweet smell placed in bosom then looking at diamond said be pretty sparkling thing what be of what use be looked with more curiosity admiration at manner in earring shut opened than at diamond clarence be charmed with when mr ormond told that thing be to hang in ear laughed said how how can make hang have never observed that wear earring said mr ormond ay yours be not like let look never saw how fastened let look oh have hole in ear have none in mine mr ormond told that hole must easily be made in ear by running steel pin through shrunk back defending ear with one hand pushing diamond from with other exclaiming oh unless added changing tone turning to clarence unless wish if bid will clarence be scarcely master of at instant be with utmost difficulty that must reply to with dispassionate calmness became situation hers yet there be more of ignorance timidity perhaps than of sound sense philosophy in virginia indifference to diamond did not consider a ornament must confer distinction upon possessor because be ignorant of value affixed to by society isolated in world have excitement to love of finery competition mean of comparison opportunity of display diamond be consequently a useless to a guinea be to robinson crusoe on desert island must not justly be said that be free from avarice because set value on gold that be free from vanity because rejected diamond reflection must not possibly have escaped man of clarence hervey ability have not be engaged in defence of favourite system of education if pupil have not be quite so handsome virginia absolute ignorance of world frequently gave air of originality to most trivial observation made appear at once interesting entertaining idea of happiness be confined to life have led during childhood a have accidentally lived in beautiful situation in new forest appeared to have instinctive taste for beauty of nature for what call picturesque taste mr hervey perceived whenever showed print drawing be fresh source of delight self complacency to be amiable estimable in virginia have double charm from secret sense of penetration in having discovered appreciated treasure affection of innocent girl have object mr ormond be strong perhaps in proportion a be concentrated artless familiarity of manner unsuspicious confidence amounting almost to credulity have irresistible power over mr hervey mind felt a appeal at once to tenderness generosity treated with utmost delicacy oath be never absent from mind felt proudly convinced that if have not be bound by such solemn engagement temptation must have made deceive betray confiding innocence conscious that view be honourable anticipating generous pleasure must have in showing superiority to mercenary consideration worldly prejudice in choice of wife indulged with specie of pride increasing attachment to virginia be not sensible of rapid progress of passion till be suddenly awakened by few simple observation of mr ormond be virginia birthday tell be seventeen to day seventeen be only seventeen cried clarence with mixture of surprise disappointment in countenance only seventeen why be child still quite child said mr ormond so much better so much worse think said clarence be sure be only seventeen must be mistaken must be eighteen at least god forbid god forbid why mr ormond because know have year more before may be very satisfactory prospect to said mr hervey smiling to surely said mr ormond for suppose must be glad that wife must at least know common thing body know a to said clarence must be glad that wife be ignorant of what body know nothing be so tiresome to man of taste ability a what body know be rather desirous to have wife who have uncommon than common understanding must choose must not said mr ormond hesitating with air of great deference that wife must know how to write to be sure replied clarence colouring doe not virginia know how to write how must said mr ormond be fault of hers poor girl be never taught know be grandmother notion that must not learn to write lest must write love letter promised that must be taught to write trusted to mr ormond have be here only two month time be sure have done thing in power when person come to be sixteen seventeen be up hill work will teach cried clarence be sure may be taught thing by said mr ormond smiling not by have doubt of capacity surely be judge of capacity especially of capacity of love be grown very fond of virginia be charming open hearted simple affectionate creature rather think be from indolence that doe not learn not from want of ability indolence arises from want of excitement said clarence if have proper motif must conquer indolence why dare say if be to tell that must never have letter from mr hervey till be able to write answer must learn to write very expeditiously thought must not be proper motive because forbade to tell future view indeed must be highly imprudent on account a well a hers to give hint of kind because might change mind before be old enough for to think of seriously then must not know what to do with after entertaining hope of becoming wife must be miserable be sure with affectionate tender heart of hers if be to leave now that know nothing of matter be safe a must be though clarence hervey did not at time foresee great probability of changing mind yet felt good sense justice of mr ormond suggestion be alarmed to perceive that mind have be so intoxicated a to suffer such obvious reflection to escape attention mr ormond woman whom have be accustomed to consider a far inferior in capacity now felt be superior to in prudence merely because be undisturbed by passion resolved to master own mind to consider that be not mistress wife wanted in virginia that wife without capacity without literature must never be companion suited to let beauty sensibility be ever so exquisite captivating happiness of life of hers be at stake motive of prudence delicacy called upon to command affection be however still sanguine in expectation from virginia understanding from own power of developing capacity made several attempt with greatest skill patience fair pupil though did not by mean equal hope astonished mr ormond by comparatively rapid progress always believed that must make thing pleased said be tutor who can work miracle with virginia see miracle replied clarence be conscious of such power must be sorry to posse such influence until be sure that must be for mutual happiness mr hervey then conjured mr ormond by attachment to to pupil never to give virginia most distant idea that have intention of making wife promised to do be in power to keep secret must not help observing that have already be betrayed a plainly a look must speak by mr hervey clarence in vain endeavoured to exculpate from charge mr ormond brought to recollection so many instance of indiscretion that be substantiated even in own judgment be amazed to find that time have put so much constraint upon inclination have nevertheless so obviously betrayed surprise however be at time unmixed with painful regret did not foresee probability that must change mind notwithstanding mr ormond assured that virginia sensibility have increased be persuaded that be mistaken that pupil heart imagination be yet untouched innocent openness with expressed affection for confirmed said in opinion to do justice clarence have none of presumption too often characterizes men who have be successful a be called with fair sex acquaintance with woman have increased persuasion that be difficult to excite genuine love in heart with respect to be upon subject astonishingly incredulous be scarcely possible to convince that be beloved mr ormond piqued upon subject determined to ascertain more decisively pupil sentiment dear said one day to virginia who be feeding bullfinch do believe be fonder of bird than of thing in world fonder of be sure than of oh can not think so said virginia with affectionate smile well fonder than be of mr hervey will allow at least indeed cried eagerly how can think so foolish so childish so ungrateful a to prefer little worthless bird to bullfinch began to sing so loud at instant that enthusiastic speech be stopped pretty bird said a perched upon hand love very much if mr hervey be to ask to wish must open window let fly yes bid fly away far from for ever perhaps doe wish doe did tell so cried looking earnestly in mr ormond face a moved towards window mr ormond put hand upon sash a virginia be going to throw up gently gently love whither be imagination carrying thought something by look said virginia blushing thought something dear virginia said mr ormond smiling what did think what must think can not mean must rather not at present tell look so grave will tell time other if can not guess virginia be silent stood abashed be sure sweet girl said mr ormond mean by thing said to confuse blame be very natural that must be grateful to mr hervey that must admire to certain degree love virginia looked up delighted yet with hesitation in manner be indeed said mr ormond one of first of human being such even have always thought be sure like better dear for sensibility said kissing virginia a spoke only must take care of tenderness might go too far how so said virginia returning caress with fondness can love mr hervey too much not be sure be so good so very good be afraid that love enough said sighing love enough when be absent not when be present when be near feel sort of fear mixed with love wish to please very much must not quite like must show love for a do a did just now dear must not be proper that must be quite right not to wish be be afraid that be sign of not liking a much a ought ah poor child love full a much a ought do think so be glad of said virginia with look of such confiding simplicity that friend be touched to heart do think so love said mr ormond hope will never be sorry for either be not proper that must say more upon subject now where be drawing where be writing dear must get forward with thing a fast a can be way to please mr hervey can tell confirmed by conversation in own opinion mr ormond be satisfied from delicacy to pupil did not repeat have passed to mr hervey resolving to wait till proper moment be too young too childish for to think of marrying yet for year two thought be better to repress sensibility till education be more finished by time mr hervey will find out mistake in mean time must not help thinking that be blind for continued steady in belief of virginia indifference to dissipate own mind to give time for development of hers now according to resolution left pupil to care of mr ormond mixed a much a possible in gay fashionable company be at period that renewed acquaintance with lady delacour whom have seen admired before went abroad found that gallantry on famous day of battle between turkey pig be still remembered with gratitude by ladyship received with marked courtesy soon became constant visitor at house wit entertained eloquence charmed followed admired gallanted without scruple for considered merely a coquette who preferred glory of conquest to security of reputation with woman thought must amuse without danger where appeared foremost in public train of ladyship admirer soon discovered however that talent be far superior to what be necessary for playing part of fine lady visit became more more agreeable to be glad to feel that by dividing attention passion for virginia insensibly diminished a said to became more reasonable in conversing with lady delacour faculty be always called into full play in talking to virginia understanding be passive perceived that large proportion of intellectual power of knowledge be absolutely useless to in company did not raise either in love esteem simplicity naivete however sometimes relieved after have be fatigued by extravagant gaiety glare of ladyship manner reflected that coquetry amused in acquaintance must be odious in wife perfect innocence of virginia promised security to domestic happiness did not change view though be le eager for period of accomplishment can not expect thing be desirable said to more brilliant character than virginia must excite admiration must not command confidence be whilst mind be in situation that became acquainted with belinda at first idea of having be educated by match making mr stanhope prejudiced against a have opportunity of observing conduct prepossession be conquered when have secured esteem must no longer resist power over heart in comparison with belinda virginia appeared to insipid though innocent child one found be equal other inferior one saw must be companion friend to for life other must merely be pupil plaything belinda have cultivated taste active understanding knowledge of literature power habit of conducting virginia be ignorant indolent have few idea wish to extend knowledge be so entirely unacquainted with world that be absolutely impossible must conduct with discretion must be combined result of reasoning experience mr hervey have felt gratuitous confidence in virginia innocence on belinda prudence have opportunity of seeing tried gradually learned to feel different higher specie of reliance be neither in power to bestow to refuse virtue of virginia sprang from sentiment of belinda from reason clarence whilst made comparison became day more wisely more fondly attached to belinda at length became desirous to change nature of connexion with virginia to appear to only in light of friend benefactor thought of giving suitable fortune of leaving under care of mr ormond till method of establishing in world must occur unfortunately just at time when mr hervey formed plan before be communicated to mr ormond difficulty arose prevented from putting into execution whilst have be engaged in gay world at lady delacour pupil have necessarily be left much to management of mr ormond lady with best possible intention have not that reach of mind variety of resource necessary to direct exquisite sensibility ardent imagination of virginia solitude in lived added to difficulty of task without companion to interest social affection without real object to occupy sens understanding virginia mind be either perfectly indolent exalted by romantic view visionary idea of happiness a have never seen thing of society notion be drawn from book severe restriction grandmother have early laid upon choice of seemed to have awakened curiosity to have increased appetite for book be insatiable reading indeed be now almost only pleasure for mr ormond conversation be seldom entertaining virginia have longer occupation filled portion of day at cottage mr hervey have cautioned mr ormond against putting common novel into hand made objection to romance thought breathed spirit favourable to female virtue exalted respect for chastity inspired enthusiastic admiration of honour generosity truth noble quality dignify human nature virginia devoured romance with greatest eagerness mr ormond who found prey to ennui when fancy be not amused indulged taste yet strongly suspected that contributed to increase passion for only man who must in imagination represent hero one night virginia found in mr ormond room volume of st pierre paul virginia knew that own name have be taken from romance mr hervey have picture painted in character circumstance strongly excited curiosity to read book mr ormond must not refuse to let have for though be not ancient romance did not exactly come under description of common novel mr hervey be not at hand to give advice virginia sat down instantly to volume never stirred from spot till have nearly finished what be that strike fancy so much what be considering so deeply love said mr ormond observing that seemed lost in thought let see dear continued offering to take hook hung from hand virginia started from reverie held volume fast will not let read along with said mr ormond wo let share pleasure be not pleasure that felt believe said virginia must rather must not see just that particular part be reading yet if desire added resigning book reluctantly what can make so much afraid of sweet girl be not afraid of of said virginia sighing mr ormond read following passage thought of paul friendship more pure than water of fountain stronger than united palm sweeter than perfume of flower image in night in solitude gave double force to passion nourished

that have added with sigh can not be daughter for be only thirteen girl if be now living must be nearly eighteen age name circumstance confirmed mr hervey in belief that stranger be father of virginia be disappointed provoked by having missed opportunity of seeing speaking to occurred to clarence that gentleman might probably visit foundling hospital thither immediately went to make inquiry be told that person such a described have be there about month before have compared face of oldest girl with little picture of child that gave money to several of girl that did not know name thing more about mr hervey now inserted proper advertisement in paper without producing effect at last recollecting what mr moreton told of stranger love of picture determined to put portrait of virginia into

faithfully comply with request to be at somerset house regularly morning a soon a exhibition opened that must stay there till closed watch whether of spectator be particularly struck with portrait of virginia if person must ask question respecting picture be to let mr hervey know immediately to give inquirer address now happened that very day when lady delacour belinda be at exhibition painter

of seeing mr hartley be by reaching portsmouth a soon a possible be cause of taking leave of belinda in such abrupt manner painful indeed be feeling at moment great difficulty felt in parting with without giving explanation of conduct must have appeared to capricious mysterious be aware that have explicitly avowed to lady delacour admiration of miss portman that in thousand instance have betrayed passion yet of love dared not trust to think whilst affair be in doubtful state have be true faint hope that change in virginia situation might produce alteration in sentiment resolved to decide own conduct by manner in must behave if father must be found must become heiress to considerable fortune new view might then open to imagination world fashionable world in glory must be before beauty fortune must attract variety of admirer clarence thought that perhaps partiality for might become le exclusive when have more opportunity of choice if love arose merely from circumstance with circumstance must change if be only disease of imagination induced by seclusion from society might be cured by mixing with world then must be at liberty to follow dictate of own heart declare attachment to belinda if must find that change of situation made alteration in virginia sentiment if happiness must absolutely depend upon realization of hope have imprudently excited felt that must be bound to by law of justice honour law passion must tempt to break full of idea hurried to portsmouth in pursuit of virginia father first question asked upon arrival there may easily be guessed have west india fleet sailed sail to morrow morning be answer hastened instantly to make inquiry for mr hartley such person must be found such gentleman be to be heard of where hartley be sure be name

mind of pupil mr ormond be naturally of affectionate disposition timid temper have become excessively fond of virginia anxiety be more than in proportion to love sometimes balanced even overbalanced regard respect for clarence hervey when spoke of attachment to belinda of doubt respecting virginia must no longer restrain emotion oh indeed mr hervey said be time for reasoning doubting man in sens man who be not wilfully blind must doubt being distractedly fond of be sorry for said clarence why oh why mr hervey recollect time when be impatience to call yours when thought most charming creature

that be in mr vincent place idea be so delightful that soul be entranced for few minute virginia thing related to vanished from remembrance be whilst be in state lady delacour a reader may recollect invited into lord dressing room to tell content of packet have not then reached hand request suddenly recalled to sens felt that be not at moment able to trust to ladyship penetration therefore referred to letter for explanation dreaded to make in person escaped from belinda presence resolving never more to expose to such danger what effect packet produced on lady delacour mind on belinda

in mind sense of necessity of sacrifice that be bound to make passion be naturally impetuous have by persevering effort brought under subjection of reason power over be now to be put to severe trial a be going to town met lord delacour who be riding in park be extremely intent upon own thought be anxious to pas unnoticed in former time must have be most feasible thing imaginable for lord delacour used to detest sight of clarence hervey whom considered a successor of colonel lawless in lady favour opinion feeling have be entirely changed by perusal of letter be perfumed with ottar of rose even perfume have from association become agreeable to now accosted clarence with warmth cordiality in manner that at other moment must have pleased a much a surprised clarence be not in humour to enter into conversation seem to be in haste mr hervey said lordship observing impatience a know good nature will make scruple to detain quarter of hour a spoke turned horse rode with clarence who looked a if wished that lordship have be more scrupulous that have not such reputation for good nature will not refuse quarter of hour be sure continued lord delacour when hear that by favouring with attention may perhaps materially serve old rather young friend of yours one whom once fancied be particular favourite mean miss belinda portman at name of belinda portman clarence hervey became attention assured lordship that be in haste difficulty now be to moderate eagerness of curiosity can take turn two in park a well a where said lordship nobody will overhear sooner know what have to say better certainly said clarence most malevolent person upon earth must not have tired poor clarence patience more than good natured lord delacour contrived to do with best intention possible by habitual circumlocution descanted at length upon difficulty a world go of meeting with confidential friend whom be prudent to trust in affair demand delicacy honour address men of talent be often observed devoid of integrity men of integrity devoid of talent when have obtained hervey assent to proposition next paid sundry handsome long winded compliment then complimented for having just thought of mr hervey a fittest person must apply to then congratulated upon good luck in meeting with very man be just thinking of at last after clarence have returned thanks for kindness have given assent to lordship truism substance of business came out lord delacour informed mr hervey that have be lately commissioned by lady delacour to discover what attraction drew mr vincent so constantly to mr luttridge here be going to explain who mr vincent be clarence assured that knew perfectly well that have be ward of mr percival that be west indian of large fortune c lover of miss portman be most material part of story to continued lord delacour for otherwise know mr vincent must be no more to than other gentleman in point of view mean a lover of belinda portman may say not quite unlikely to be husband be highly interesting to lady delacour to to a miss portman well wisher doubtless doubtless be mr hervey must reply now must know continued lordship that lady delacour have for woman uncommon share of penetration can put thing together in wonderful way in short have come to lady delacour knowledge that before miss portman be at oakly park last summer after left autumn mr vincent be constant visitor at mr luttridge whilst at harrowgate used to play high though unknown to percivals of course at billiards with mr luttridge man confess disliked always even when carried election for matter be not from enmity speak now be very well known that luttridge have small fortune yet life a if have large one young men who like high play be sure to be well received at house now hope mr vincent be not well received on footing since lady delacour have be such good friend continued lordship have dropped connexion with luttridges so can not go there moreover wish to be tempted to lose more thousand to lady never play be not likely to be tempted to now so will oblige lady delacour if will go to luttridge to night be always charmed to see will easily discover how land lie mr vincent be certainly very agreeable open hearted young man if game god forbid that miss portman must ever be wife god forbid said clarence hervey man resumed lord delacour must in opinion be very superior indeed who be deserving of belinda portman oh mr hervey can not know merit a do be one thing sir to see fine girl in ball room quite to live in house with for month to see a have seen belinda portman in day life a one may call then be one can judge of real temper manner character never woman have so sweet temper such charming manner such fair open generous decided yet gentle character a miss portman lordship speaks con amore said clarence speak mr hervey from bottom of soul cried lord delacour pulling in horse stopping short must be unfeeling ungrateful brute if be not sensible of obligation yes obligation lady delacour have received from belinda portman why sir have be peacemaker between will not talk of now let think of affair if mr vincent once get into mr luttridge cursed set there be knowing where will end speak from own experience for really never be fond of high play yet when got into set must not withstand lost by hundred thousand so will before be aware of doubt mr luttridge will look upon a dupe make such always be between ourselves suspected that did not lose last thousand to fairly now hervey know whole do try save mr vincent for belinda portman sake clarence hervey shook hand with lord delacour with sentiment of real gratitude affection assured that confidence be not misplaced lordship little suspected that have be soliciting to save rival clarence love be not of selfish sort moment that be deprived of hope sink into indifference be converted into hatred belinda must not be in midst of bitterest regret be supported by consciousness of own honour generosity felt noble specie of delight in prospect of promoting happiness of woman upon whom fondest affection have be fixed rejoiced to feel that have sufficient magnanimity to save rival from ruin be even determined to make rival friend notwithstanding prepossession clearly perceived mr vincent felt against jealousy will be extinguished moment know real situation said clarence to will be convinced have soul incapable of envy if suspect love for belinda will respect strength of mind with can command passion take for granted that mr vincent must posse heart understanding such a must desire in friend must never be what be to belinda full of generous sentiment clarence waited with impatience for hour when might present at mr luttridge went there so early in evening that found drawing room quite empty company who have be invited to dine have not yet left dining room servant have just set card table lighted candle mr hervey desired that nobody must be disturbed by coming so early fortunately mr luttridge be detained minute by lady newland lingering glass of madeira in mean time clarence executed design from former observation from hint lord delacour have let fall suspected that there be sometimes in house not only high play foul play recollected that once when played there at billiards have perceived that table be not perfectly horizontal occurred to that perhaps e o table might be so contrived a to put fortune of who played at in power of proprietor clarence have sufficient ingenuity to invent method by might be done have infallible mean in possession of detecting fraud e o table be in apartment adjoining to drawing room found way to discovered beyond possibility of doubt that be constructed for purpose of fraud first impulse be to tell immediately to mr vincent to put on guard upon reflection determined to keep discovery to till be satisfied whether gentleman have have not passion for play if have thought clarence be of utmost consequence to miss portman that must early in life receive shock may leave indelible impression upon mind to save few hour of remorse will not give up power of doing most essential service will let go on if be so inclined to very verge of ruin despair will let feel horror of gamester fate before tell have mean to save mr luttridge must when call upon refund whatever may lose will not brave public shame can not stand public prosecution scarcely have clarence arranged scheme when heard voice of lady who be coming up stair mr luttridge made appearance accompanied by very pretty modish affected young lady miss annabella luttridge niece little coquettish air be lost upon clarence hervey whose eye be intently fixed upon door watching for entrance of mr vincent be one of dinner party came up soon after lady seemed prepared for sight of mr hervey to whom bowed with cold haughty air then addressed to miss annabella luttridge who showed most obvious desire to attract attention from passed evening mr hervey be led to suspect notwithstanding reason made apparently improbable that fair annabella be secret cause of mr vincent frequent visit at aunt be natural that clarence must be disposed to opinion from circumstance of own situation during three hour that stayed at mr luttridge mr vincent never joined of party at play just a be going away heard one say how come vincent that have be idle night question revived mr hervey suspicion uncertain what report must make to lord delacour resolved to defer making till have opportunity of judging when mr hervey asked how be possible that pupil of mr percival must become gamester forgot that mr vincent have not be educated by guardian that have lived in west indie till be eighteen that have only be under care of mr percival for few year after habit character be in great measure formed taste for gambling have acquired whilst be child a be then confined to trifle have be passed over a thing of consequence boyish folly must never grow up with father used to see day after day playing with eagerness at game of chance with negro with son of neighbouring planter yet be never alarmed be too intent upon making fortune for family to consider how must spend did not foresee that boyish fault might be mean of son losing in few hour wealth have be many year amassing when young vincent came over to england mr percival have not immediate opportunity of discovering particular foible in ward perceived that in mind there be that presumptuous belief in special good fortune naturally lead to love of gambling instead of lecturing guardian appealed to understanding took opportunity of showing ruinous effect of high play in real life young vincent be touched a thought convinced emotion be stronger than conviction feeling be always more powerful than reason detestation of selfish character of gamester be felt expressed with enthusiasm eloquence indignation rose afterwards at slightest hint that might ever in future be tempted to become what abhorred unfortunately disdained prudence a factitious virtue of inferior mind thought that feeling of man of honour be to be guide in first last appeal for conduct through life a man a gentleman proudly professed to trust to sublime instinct of good heart guardian doubt of infallibility even of existence of moral instinct wounded mr vincent pride instead of alarming understanding be rather eager than averse to expose to danger that might prove superiority to temptation how different be feeling in different situation yet often a have be repeated how difficult be to impress truth upon inexperienced sanguine mind whilst young vincent be immediately under guardian eye at oakly park safety from vice appeared to inglorious be impatient to sally forth into world confident rather of innate than acquired virtue when first became acquainted with mr luttridge at harrowgate knew that be professed gambler despised character yet without reflecting on danger perhaps for pleasure of convincing mr percival that be superior to continued visit for time be passive spectator billiards however be game of address not chance there be billiard table at oakly park a well a at mr luttridge have played with guardian why then must not play with mr luttridge did play skill be admired betted bet be successful did not call gaming for bet be not to great amount be only playing at billiards mr percival be delayed in town week longer than usual knew nothing of manner in young friend spent time a soon a mr vincent heard of arrival at oakly park left half finished game at billiards fortunately for charm of belinda made forget for month that thing a billiard table existed have happened at mr luttridge passed from mind a dream whilst heart be agitated by new passion must scarcely believe that have ever be interested by other feeling be surprised when accidentally recollected eagerness with used to amuse in mr luttridge company be certain that be passed for ever precisely because be under dominion of one strong passion thought must never be under dominion of thus persisting in disdain of reason a moral guide mr vincent thought acted suffered a man of feeling scarcely have belinda left oakly park for one week when ennui consequent to violent passion became insupportable to console for absence flew to billiard table emotion of kind other be become necessary to said that not to feel be not to live soon suspense anxiety hope fear perpetual vicissitude of gamester life seemed to almost a delightful a of lover deceived by appearance mr luttridge thought that affection for belinda be might be conquered hope of obtaining fortune for niece annabella revived a mr vincent must not endure mr freke abstained at friend particular desire from appearing at house whilst be there mr luttridge interested much in own favour by representing indignation at harriot conduct to be such that have occasioned total breach in friendship mr freke sudden departure from harrowgate confirmed probability of quarrel yet two lady be secretly leagued together in design of breaking off mr vincent match with belinda against whom mr freke have vowed revenge anonymous letter hoped must work purpose produced however effect totally unexpected upon generous mind did not guess writer indignation against such base accusation burst forth with violence astounded luttridge love for belinda appeared ten time more enthusiastic than before moment be accused felt defender a well a lover be dispossessed of evil spirit of gambling a if by miracle billiard table mr luttridge miss annabella vanished from view breathed nothing love must ask permission must wait for none from belinda declared that instant must set out in search of must tear that infamous letter to atom in presence must show how impossible suspicion be to nature first violence of hurricane mr luttridge must not stand thought not of opposing whilst horse curricle be getting ready took affectionate leave of dog juba protested so much that annabella must not know how to live without poor juba mr vincent who be excessively fond of dog must not help sympathizing in sorrow reasoning just a well a wished extended belief in affection for animal to friendship if not love for master must not grant mr luttridge earnest supplication to leave dog behind under protection promised laid hand upon heart when promised that juba must wait upon mr luttridge a soon a went to town appointment being made miss annabella permitted to be somewhat consoled must be injustice to omit that did must be done by cambric handkerchief to evince delicate sensibility in parting scene mr luttridge also deserves share of praise for manner in reproved niece for giving way to feeling for address with wished to heaven poor annabella have calm philosophic temper of miss portman be understood most uncommon example a mr vincent drove toward london reflected upon last word must not help thinking that if belinda have more fault must be more amiable thought be however driven from mind scarcely left trace behind when once more saw conversed with dignity sincerity kindness showed evening that put anonymous letter into hand charmed touched real feeling enthusiasm conspired to make believe that whole happiness depended on smile confession made to of former attachment to clarence hervey a raised in vincent mind strong emotion of jealousy increased passion a much a piqued pride appeared in new highly interesting light when discovered that coldness of manner have attributed to want of sensibility arose probably from excess that heart must have be preoccupied be more tolerable to than belief of settled indifference be so intent upon delightful variety in love for belinda that be not till have received reproachful note from mr luttridge to remind of promised visit with juba that must prevail upon to leave twickenham even for few hour lady delacour hatred fear of juba accidentally mentioned to miss annabella appeared to to aunt most extraordinary thing upon earth when be contrasted with excessive fondness seemed to indeed unaccountable from pure consideration for ladyship nerve mr luttridge petitioned vincent to leave dog with helena might not be in such imminent danger from animal monstrous jaw petition be granted a petitioner foresaw juba became to most useful auxiliary juba master called daily to see sometimes when came in morning mr luttridge be not at home so that visit be repeated in evening evening in london be what in other place be called night mr luttridge night must not be passed without deep play sight of e o table at first shocked mr vincent thought of mr percival turned away from to active social disposition be extremely irksome to stand idle uninterested where be busy eager in one common pursuit to generous temper seemed ungentlemanlike to stand by silent censor of rest of company when considered of how little importance few hundred even thousand must be to man of large fortune must not help feeling that be sordid selfish avaricious to dread possible loss thus social spirit courage generosity conspired to carry man of feeling to gaming table once there ruin be inevitable mr luttridge whilst held doom in power hesitated only whether must be more interest to marry to niece to content with fortune passion for belinda saw have be by mean other increased in spite of anonymous letter gave little hope of annabella succeeding even with assistance of juba delicate sensibility so aunt careless of niece disappointment determined that mr vincent must be victim sensible that must not give time for reflection hurried on till in course of few evening spent at e o table lost not only thousand ten of thousand one lucky night assured must set to right run must not always be against fortune must change in favour if tried with sufficient perseverance horror agony of mind endured at sudden ruin seemed impending over recollection of belinda of mr percival almost drove to distraction retreated from e o table one night swearing that never must hazard guinea ruin be not yet complete have thousand yet to lose mr luttridge must not thus relinquish prey persuaded to try fortune once more now suffered to regain courage by winning back of own money mind be relieved from sense of immediate danger rejoiced to be saved from humiliation of confessing loss to mr percival belinda next day saw with unusual pleasure be very morning clarence hervey paid visit imprudence of lady delacour joined perhaps to own consciousness that have secret fault ought to lower in esteem of mistress made misinterpret thing passed jealousy be excited in most sudden violent manner flew from lady delacour to mr luttridge be soothed flattered by apparent kindness with be received by annabella aunt after dinner when one of servant whispered to mr luttridge who sat next to that mr clarence hervey be above stair gave start that fair annabella lap did not escape part of bumper of wine be going to drink to health in confusion apology accident occasioned mr luttridge have time to consider what might be cause of start combined suspicion so quickly judiciously that guessed truth that feared to be seen at e o table by person who might find for interest to tell truth to belinda portman mr vincent said in low voice have terrible headache be fit for nothing be not up to e o to night so must wait for revenge till to morrow mr vincent be heartily glad to be relieved from engagement endeavoured to escape clarence suspicion by devoting whole time evening to annabella not in least apprehensive that mr hervey must return next night mr vincent be at e o table at usual hour for be excessively anxious to regain what have lost not so much for sake of money must afford to lose lest defalcation in fortune must lead mr percival to knowledge of mean have occasioned must not endure after high vaunt to see humbled by rash confidence in secretly vowed that if must reinstate by one night good luck must for ever quit society of gambler few month before time must have scorned idea of concealing part of conduct one of action from best friend mr percival pride now reconciled to meanness of concealment here acuteness of feeling be to own mind excuse for dissimulation so fallacious be moral instinct unenlightened uncontrolled by reason religion mr vincent be disappointed in hope of regaining what have lost be not fortunate night mr luttridge prognostic have vainly taught to expect played on however with impetuosity of natural temper judgment forsook scarcely knew what said did in course of few hour be worked up to pitch of insanity that in one desperate moment betted nearly that be worth in world lost stood like one stupified hum of voice scarcely reached ear saw figure moving before did not distinguish who what be supper be announced room emptied fast whilst remained motionless leaning on e o table be roused by mr luttridge saying a
