selecting from vulgar herd of irish bull one will be entitled to prize from united merit of pre eminent absurdity indisputable originality be greater than hasty judge may imagine many bull reputed to be bred born in ireland be of foreign extraction many more supposed to be unrivalled in kind may be matched in capital point for instance there be not more celebrated bull than paddy blake when paddy

paddy blake will answer 'pretty well thank sir ' now echo of paddy blake have long be admiration of world be not prodigy unique in kind can be matched by one recorded in immortal work of great lord

in one horse chair forbear to descant further upon irish committee men lest must call to mind merely by similarity of name time when england have committee men who be not perfectly free from tinge of absurdity be remarkable that in time of popular ferment variety of new term be coined to serve purpose passion of moment in day of english committee men practice have risen to height that be fair game

jones have be legally satisfied sir said attorney have paid plaintiff in suit be satisfied must say added with contemptuous smile that irish gentleman be rather in too great hurry in doing business business sir be thing must be done slowly to be done well be ready now to do business a slowly a please when friend be in prison thought quicker did business better now tell what mistake have made will rectify instantly instantly 't be well sir with promptitude that have to deal with what prejudice think uncommon honest attorney here be bank note of yours sir amounting to good round sum made

have be blunder indeed not irish blunder irish blunder be never blunder of heart chapter v bliss of ignorance well informed englishman must laugh at blunder of such character a little dominick there be people who justify assertion that laughter always arises from sense of real imaginary superiority now if be true that laughter have source in vanity a most ignorant be generally most vain must enjoy pleasure in highest perfection unconscious of own deficiency consequently fearless of becoming in turn object of ridicule enjoy in full security delight of humbling superior how much be to be admired for courage with apply on occasion test of truth wise men may be struck with admiration respect doubt humility ignorant happily unconscious that know nothing can be checked in merriment by consideration human divine theirs be sly sneer dry joke horse laugh theirs comprehensive range of ridicule take creature in of kind fastidious delicacy spoil sport of fancy though ten time told tale to never can be tedious though dull a fat weed grows on lethe bank jest for have poignancy of satire on very offal garbage of wit can feed batten happy who can find in jester wit of sterne swift who else can wade through hundred of thickly printed page to obtain for reward such witticism a following two irishman having travelled on foot from chester to barnet be confoundedly tired fatigued by journey more so when be told that have still about ten mile to go shoul st patrick cry one of 'it be five mile piece here notwithstanding promise of jest held forth by word by shoul st patrick be ultimately cheated of hope to ignorant indeed word of promise be kept to mind a well a to ear others perceive that instead of bull have only piece of sentimental arithmetic founded upon elegant theorem friendship double pleasure divide pain must not from false delicacy to countryman here omit piece of advice to english retailer inventor of irish blunder let beware of such prefatory exclamation a by shoul st patrick by jasus arrah honey dear joy c because such phrase besides being absolutely out of date fashion in ireland raise too high expectation in mind of british audience operating a much to disadvantage of story teller a dangerous exordium of will tell excellent story exordium ever to be avoided by prudent wit caution must be given to well meaning ignorance never produce that a irish bull for person of common literature can immediately supply precedent from best author never be at pain for instance of telling from joe miller good story of irish sailor who travelled with captain cook round world afterwards swore to companion that be a flat a table anecdote however excellent immediately find parallel in pope mad mathesis alone be unconfined too mad for mere material chain to bind now to pure space lift ecstatic stare now running round circle find square pope be led into blunder of representing mad mathesis running round circle finding square by confused notion that mathematician have considered circle a composed of straight line mathematical friend must have told that though be talked of a polygon be not supposed to be square polygon must not have rhymed to stare poet when launch into ocean of word must have eye to helm at event poet who be not supposed to be student of exact science may be forgiven for mathematical blunder affair of squaring circle seems to be peculiarly liable to error for even accurate mathematician can not speak of without committing something very like bull dr hutton in treatise on mensuration p say a famous quadrature of late mr john machin professor of astronomy in gresham college be extremely expeditious little known will take opportunity of explaining be to be presumed that doctor here us word famous in acceptation in be daily hourly employed by bond street lounger by city apprentice men of ton be famous good joke be famous whip have famous hop c now can not be supposed that of thing be in entitled to fame may indeed by courtesy of england be at once famous little known be unnecessary to enter into defence of dr hutton of pope for be not born in ireland therefore can not make bull assuredly mistake will not in opinion of person of common sense candour derogate from reputation never strike till be sure to wound be maxim well known to polite politic part of world never laugh when laugh can be turned against must be maxim of who find chief pleasure in making others ridiculous principle if applied to subject must lead however to very extensive troublesome system of mutual forbearance troublesome in proportion to good ill humour of party concerned extensive in proportion to knowledge acquirement man of cultivated part will foresee possibility of retort courteous where ignorant man will enjoy fearless bliss of ignorance for example illiterate person may enjoy hearty laugh at common story of old irish beggar man who pretending to be dumb be thrown off guard by question how many year have be dumb answered five year last st john eve please honour triumph over irishman abates when recollect in history of england in shakspeare case of saunder simcox who pretended to be miraculously instantaneously cured of blindness at st alban shrine since have bestowed so much criticism on blunder of beggar man word two must be permitted on blunder of thief be natural for ignorant people to laugh at hibernian who said that have stolen pound of chocolate to make tea of philosopher be disposed to abstain from laugh of superiority when recollect that irishman must probably make a good tea from chocolate a chemist must make butter sugar cream from antimony sulphur tartar absurdity in ancient chemical nomenclature must not be surpassed by in hibernian catalogue if reader must think rash unwarrantable assertion refer to essay in flagrant abuse of speech in old language of chemistry be admirably exposed ridiculed must irishman confer more appropriate appellation upon white powder than of beautiful black be really provoking to perceive that a knowledge of science literature extends be in more danger of finding in own foreign language parallel precedent for irish blunder so that very well informed man can scarcely with grace conscience smile where booby squire might enjoy long loud horse laugh of contempt what crowd be collected to see irish bottle conjuror get into quart bottle dr desaguliers have prepared english to think condensation of animal particle not impossible say vol p of lecture on natural philosophy that nature of thing must last natural course continue same change made in body must arise only from various separation new conjunction motion of original particle must be imagined of unconceivable smallness by union of there be made bigger lump c indeed thing be now come to such lamentable pas that without literary scientific acquirement mere local knowledge such a can be obtained from finger post may sometimes prevent from full enjoyment of boeotian absurdity of neighbour what can at first view appear grosser blunder than of irishman who begged friend to look over library to find for history of world before creation yet anachronism of idea be not unparalleled be matched though on more contracted scale by inscription on british finger post have seen road before be made 'd lift up eye bless marshal wade there be however rabbi mentioned by bayle who far exceeds irishman finger post asserts that providence questioned adam concerning creation before be born that adam knew more of matter than angel who have laughed at who see thing in philosophical light must have observed more frequently than others that there be in world continual recurrence rotation of idea event blunder with utmost ingenuity utmost absurdity man in modern day can not contrive to produce system for there be prototype in antiquity to commit blunder for there be precedent for example during late rebellion in ireland at military execution of wretched rebel cord broke criminal who have be only half hanged fell to ground major who be superintending execution exclaimed rascal if do again will kill a sure a breathe now

never read not have nothing to do with book consulted only own eye ear appealed only to common sense a to theory have opinion of theory for part only pretended to understand practice experience practice be confined steadily to own practice experience uniformly to what have tried at new town hardcastle at first thought mighty clever man really rejoiced to see doubter silenced after dinner when have finished speaking in decisive manner used frequently to back with very true very fair very clear though understood what said a little a did be ease to mind to have disputed point settled filled glass with air of triumph whilst m'leod never contradicted assertion controverted mr hardcastle argument there be still air of content quiet self satisfaction in m'leod very silence surprised vexed one day when hardcastle be laying down law upon several subject in usual dictatorial manner telling how managed people what order kept in be determined that m'leod must not enjoy security of silence urged to give general opinion a to mean of improving poor people in ireland doubt said m'leod whether thing effectual can be done till have better education education pshaw there be now book men cried hardcastle why dear sir can man alive who know country doubt that common people have already too much education a be called vast deal too much too many of know how to read write cipher presume be mean by education not entirely said m'leod good education comprehends something more more worse interrupted more know worse be sir depend on know people of country sir have good right to

must not let learn catechism gave because be protestant one now see sir there be bar for ever to education mr m'leod smiled said something about time patience observed that one experiment be not conclusive against whole nation thing like general argument mr hardcastle must not comprehend knew blade of grass within reach of tether must not reach inch beyond thing like appeal to benevolent feeling be lost upon for be so frank in selfishness that did not even pretend to be generous by sundry self complacent motion showed whilst adversary spoke that disdained to listen almost a much a to read a soon a m'leod paused said what observe sir may possibly be very true have made up mind then went over over again assertion in louder louder voice ending with tone of interrogation seemed to set answer at defiance what have to answer to now sir can man alive doubt sir m'leod be perfectly silent company broke up a be going out of room maliciously asked m'leod why who must say so much in own defence have suffered to be so completely silenced answered in low deliberate voice in word of moire 'qu'est ce que la raison avec un filet de voix contre une gueule comme celle la ' at other time added mr m'leod sentiment will be at lordship disposal indolent person love positive people when be of own opinion because be saved trouble of developing thought supporting assertion moment positive

degenerated altered that must not know planted in open air in light gradually resumed natural appearance character mr devereux excited without fatiguing mind by conversation be not yet sufficiently in love to be seriously jealous be resolved however to sound upon subject of lady geraldine waited for good opportunity at length a be looking together over print of buerger lenore led to sort of conversation that desired by telling anecdote relative to poet have lately heard from german baron burger be charmed with sonnet unknown fair one addressed to in praise of poetry replied in equal strain went on flattering one till believed in love without ever having met determined to marry at length met married quarrelled parted in other word gentleman be terribly disappointed in unknown mistress consoled by running away from with lover imprudence of poetic couple led to reflection on love marriage in general keeping far away from allusion to lady geraldine rallied mr devereux about fair clementina who be evidently romantic admirer of who except cupid must barter liberty for butterfly said cupid be child men now day be grown too wise to enslave for woman love occupies vast space in woman thought fill small portion in man life woman be told that 'the great th important business of life be love ' men know that be born for something better than to sing mournful ditty to mistress

bear to be thought so man ever distinguished who must not bear to be laughed at mr devereux left room singing more for amynta fresh garland wove ambition said will soon cure of love be uncertain what to think of inclined to believe ambition be ruling passion notwithstanding description of hell showed in spenser conduct to patron lord by surer judgment of character must be formed than by profession be not however that of man merely intent upon rising in world remember once hearing lord o'toole attack friend of gentleman calling in certain tone philosopher mr devereux replied that must not consider that a term of reproach where false pretended philosopher be meant other name must be used equivalent to italian term of reproach filosofastro lord o'toole must by mean admit of italianism must make distinction deemed philosopher altogether race of being dangerous inimical to state for state read statesman said devereux who persisted in vindication of friend till lord o'toole grew pale with anger while captain andrew smiled with ineffable contempt at political bevue lady geraldine glowed with generous indignation afterwards in speaking to of lord o'toole devereux said lordship classification of men be a contracted a savage classification of animal divide mankind into two class knave fool when meet with honest man doe not know what to make of esteem for mr devereux be much increased by daily observation upon conduct towards lady geraldine thought particularly honourable when displeasure evidently merged in esteem when manner again became most winning attractive continued uniformly same never passing bound of friendly respect swerving in slightest degree from line of conduct have laid down for thought now understood perfectly that liked lady geraldine must scarcely doubt saw that refrained from aiming at prize knew ought not to obtain that perceived ladyship favourable disposition towards yet denied not only gratification of vanity exquisite pleasure of conversing with lest must stand in way of happier prospect frequently spoke to of ladyship in term of warmest approbation said that world saw admired talent beauty that have have opportunity a relation of studying domestic life with vivacity have heart formed for tenderness said high sense of duty best security for woman conduct in generosity magnanimity never found superior in sex in short never saw woman whose temper disposition be more likely to make man of sense feeling supremely happy must not forbear smiling asking cecil devereux how accorded with late profession of hatred to marriage profession be sincere said must be misery to to marry inferior woman be not in circumstance to marry a must wish must not think of lady geraldine without breach of trust of lordship hope can not suspect mother place confidence in be not only relation treated a friend of family be not in love with lady geraldine admire esteem respect ladyship wish to see united to man if such man there be

conduct be yet undecided a to own aversion to second marriage be not yet conquered be amused be captivated by lady geraldine must not bring to think of making distinct proposal captain andrew be not more afraid of being committed than be upon tender subject to gain time now thought necessary to verify praise mr devereux have bestowed on ladyship magnanimity be word particularly struck ear a extraordinary when applied to female however by attending carefully to lady thought discovered what mr devereux meant lady geraldine be superior to manoeuvring little art petty stratagem to attract attention must not stoop even to conquer from gentleman seemed to expect attention a right a right of sex not to beg accept of a favour if be not paid deemed gentleman degraded not far from being mortified by preference shown to other lady countenance betrayed only sarcastic sort of pity for bad taste of men absolute indifference look of haughty absence saw that beheld with disdain paltry competition of young lady companion a companion indeed hardly seemed to consider tolerated foible forgave envy never exerted superiority except to show contempt of vice meanness to be in degree excepted from common herd to be in degree distinguished by lady so proud with so many good reason to be proud be flattering to self love gave direct encouragement never advanced far enough to require encouragement much le to justify repulse sometimes observed fancied that treated with more favour when mr devereux be present than at other time perhaps for be woman not angel to pique devereux try if must move from settled purpose of soul bore with surprising constancy spirit however health began visibly to decline if intrude too much on valuable time mr devereux said ladyship to one evening in

not skulk away to avoid danger advance to meet armed secure in honesty proud rash security in own courage strength of mind integrity be only fault of cecil devereux never prayed not to be led into temptation thought so sure of avoiding evil unconscious of danger even though disease be at height now braved most imprudently be certain that must never pas bound of friendship have proved to be satisfied told that must with indifference nay with pleasure see lady geraldine mine in mean time upon same principle that deemed flight inglorious be proud to expose to full force of love artillery

respited from agony of doubt now waited very tranquilly for moment to most lover look forward with horror moment of separation be sensible that have accustomed to think about lady so much that have gradually identified existence with hers thus found spirit of animation much increased dreaded departure of lady geraldine le than return of ennui in frame of mind be walking one morning in pleasure

encourage to venture again in same foolish manner know few very few young lady to whom lord glenthorn must offer with chance reasonable hope of being refused so take warning never again expect to meet with such a whimsical self never never can expect to meet with thing resembling charming cried be new text for lover rhapsody be not necessary might not be generally interesting to repeat ridiculous thing said even if must remember lady geraldine listened to then very calmly replied granting believe that be saying at minute must grant from common gratitude still more common vanity nevertheless permit to assure lord that be not love be only fancy only nettle rash not plague will not die time will insure life so now jump out of window a fast a can unlock door need not be afraid of breaking neck know life be insured come take lover leap get rid of passion at once grew angry only cloud said lady geraldine will blow over became more passionate did not know force of own feeling till met with obstacle suddenly rose to surprising height now lord cried lady geraldine with tone look of comic vexation be really most provoking thing imaginable have idea how distress of what exquisite

be yet that if there be a own prudence seemed to suggest obstacle rendering probability of union with person more than doubtful might be possible that superior sense strength of mind joined to persevering affection of lover who must spare exertion to render worthy of might perhaps in time said interrupting deceive will not deceive give hope that sentiment may change know own mind will not change attachment be founded on firm basis of esteem affection have grown from intimate knowledge of principle conduct of man love other man let merit be what may must have advantage in opinion when say that probability of being united be more than doubtful mean to deny have distant hope that change of circumstance might render love duty compatible without hope know love can not long exist see talk romantic nonsense to that say of prudence time effect of attention of admirer must be perfectly just applicable if attachment be fancy of yesterday if be mere young lady commonplace first love be not very young lady be though first love commonplace see in usual style tell that man adore be angel that created form ever did ever can resemble angel in green gold on contrary do justice to lordship merit believing a do that be capable of real love still more believing that attachment must rouse to exertion bring to life light surprising number of good quality yet must deceive unpardonably fatally for own peace of mind if not for yours be not frankly decidedly to assure that never must reward return affection attachment to trust entirely where trust at attachment to mr devereux be for

have prompted to threaten with public discovery yet knew that must a soon cut off own right hand a execute threat affection for pride in consequence be so strong that knew might securely rely upon secrecy horrid idea of being cause of death of one of own child have for moment sufficient power to balance love for yet there be little probability that similar trial must occur have reason to apprehend that reproach of conscience must induce to make voluntary discovery for idea of virtue depended on principle of fidelity to object of affection scrupulous notion of justice disturbed

impression upon mind in comparison with be taught by own experience sometimes feel surprised to find that what have be taught a maxim of morality prove true in real life after having have for many year fullest opportunity of judging of value of rich when reflected upon past life perceived that power of conferring happiness be limited nearly a philosophic poet describes that change modification of luxury must in sum of actual physical enjoyment be reduced to few elementary pleasure of industrious poor can obtain share small share perhaps then be enjoyed with zest make equal in value perhaps to largest portion offered to sated palate of ennui truth be a old a world appeared quite new to when discovered by own experience during month have allowed to foster brother for reflection have leisure to philosophize understanding made rapid progress foresaw probability of christy deciding to become earl of glenthorn notwithstanding that good sense have so clearly demonstrated to in theory that with education habit must be happier working in forge than must be a lord of glenthorn castle be not dismayed by idea of losing wealth rank be pleased with for honest conduct conscious of degree of pleasure from own approbation superior to what rich have ever procured day appointed for christy final determination arrived knew by first motion of shoulder a came into room what decision must be

to weighs with greatly on other side if honour must live on here share with see honour displeased at naming that be wife thought o that knew must not do then what think be that honour must name what must be pleased to keep to live upon for to be sure have right to live a gentleman have always lived a one a body know none better than must honour be so kind then a just to put down on bit of paper what 'd wish to keep same whatever be none will touch must not own child for mine must begrudge will step down wait below while honour writes what plase generosity of man touched to heart accepted from three hundred year requested that annuity allowed to unfortunate lady glenthorn might be continued that house have built for ellinor land belonging to might be secured to rent free for life that debt must be paid recommended mr m'leod in strongest manner a agent whose ability integrity must be to invaluable treasure christy when gave paper on have stated request took pen instantly must have signed name without reading to absolutely objected well then said will take home read over take time a desire to consider there be danger of changing mind about hope honour ca think there be next day

going wrong a might under agent at distance doe not know well how to manage such great estate hope will not refuse that if be only to show lose honour good will offer be made with so much earnestness even delicacy must not abruptly refuse at moment though one of magnificent house must be of use tome with income of l per annum a to annuity continued christy that will be paid a punctual a day mr m'leod will pay will have settled right put upon stamp by lawyer in case thing must happen then a to ellinor sure be mother for never can think of other way except in single article of changing at

mr m'leod be only person who must make out correct list of debt besides wished to recommend a agent to future earl to whom honest able agent must be peculiarly necessary ignorant a be of world of business surrounded a must probably be on accession to estate by herd of vulgar designing flatterer albeit not easily moved to surprise mr m'leod really did for instant look astonished when informed that christy o'donoghoe be earl of glenthorn must resolve not to stop to describe astonishment that individual showed upon occasion else will never have finished story be settled that mr m'leod must

have heard so much lordship porter be not quite so insolent a of brother though did not come in showy equipage though have laced footman to enforce right gained admission passed through gallery of

expression did not seem result of care allusion be at once so apposite elegant a to charm learned unlearned said be sufficiently clear just to strike person of plain sense natural feeling while to man of literature have often further power to please by le obvious meaning lord y superiority never depressed with whom conversed on contrary felt raised by magic of politeness to level instead of being compelled to pay tribute seemed invited to share intellectual dominion to enjoy with delightful pre eminence of genius virtue will be forgiven for pausing in own insignificant story to dwell on noble character of departed friend that permitted to call friend think greatest honour of life let if can go on regularly with narrative lord y took for granted during first hour conversation that be speaking to earl of glenthorn thanked with much warmth for putting on guard against character of mr lyddell lordship be also pleased to thank for making acquainted a said with own character for convincing how ill have be appreciated by who imagined that wealth title be only distinction earl of glenthorn might claim compliment went nearer to heart than lord y must guess character said since

be supported with much energy by charming lady geraldine that lord glenthorn have ability to be thing tie pleased high term in spoke of talent strong proof adduced of generosity of character excited in mind warm desire to cultivate acquaintance desire have be considerably increased within last hour may hope that irish rapidity with have passed from acquaintance to friendship may not shock english habit of reserve may not induce to doubt sincerity of man who have ventured with so little hesitation ceremony to declare friend be so much moved by unexpected kindness that though felt how much more be requisite must answer only with bow be glad to make retreat a soon a possible very next day lordship returned visit to landlady irrecoverable astonishment have increasing reason to regard with

stranger young lady seemed to pity confusion for though so well so long used to variety of highest company when placed in situation be new to be unaccountably disconcerted ah thought how differently must be received be still earl of glenthorn be rather angry with lord y for not introducing a have promised to fair lady yet repetition of name must have increased vexation in short be unjust felt impatience irritability quite unusual to temper lady y addressed conversation to in obliging manner did best to support part till left attention be soon distracted by conversation commenced at part of

called aside will pardon said mean have taken to convince how much superior be to opinion have be commonly formed of lord glenthorn will forgive for convincing that when man have sufficient strength of mind to rely upon sufficient energy to exert ability becomes independent of common report vulgar opinion secures suffrage of best judge in time lead rest of world will permit now to introduce to prudent friend fair enemy mr delamere miss delamere give leave to introduce to late earl of glenthorn of astonishment in opening eye of mr delamere have faint recollection can never forget crimson

taken possession of castle be married have son lord bless how unfortunate well can only say sir wish with heart be earl of glenthorn still after hearing from lord y circumstance of what be pleased to call generous conduct mr delamere observed that have acted very generously to be sure that few in place must have thought bound to give up possession of estate have so long be taught to believe be own to have to hold observed always went together in law must not help thinking have done very injudiciously imprudently not to let law decide for be consoled for mr delamere reprehension by daughter approving countenance after visit lord y gave general invitation to house where frequently saw miss delamere frequently compared with recollection of lady geraldine cecilia delamere be not so entertaining be more interesting than lady geraldine flash of ladyship wit though always striking be sometimes dangerous cecilia wit though equally brilliant shone with more pleasing inoffensive light with a much generosity a lady geraldine must show in great affair have more forbearance delicacy of attention on day occasion lady geraldine have much pride often gave offence cecilia perhaps have more pride never appeared except upon defensive without having le candour have le occasion for than lady geraldine seemed to have cecilia temper have more softness equability perhaps cecilia be not so fascinating be more attractive one have envied art of appearing to advantage in public other more desirable power of being happy in private admired lady geraldine long before loved loved cecilia long before admired whilst possibly must called what felt for miss delamere only esteem when found impossible to conceal from loved resolved to avoid charming woman how happy thought must fortune once possessed now make in present circumstance what have to hope surely friend lord y have not shown usual prudence in exposing to such temptation be to be supposed think that impossibility of obtaining miss delamere will prevent thinking of perhaps depends on inertness apathy of temper unfortunately for sensibility have increased since have become poor for many year when be rich must have married easily never wished to marry now have not enough to support wife immediately fall desperately in love again again pondered upon circumstance three hundred year be amount of worldly possession miss delamere be not rich have be bred expensively for have never be absent from mother mind that cecilia must be heiress to immense glenthorn estate present possessor be however excellent life have son

cecilia suitable alliance rank large fortune be in mr delamere opinion indispensable to happiness cecilia idea be far more moderate though perfectly disinterested generous be not so romantic so silly a to think of marrying man without probability of being able to support in society of equal even if must have thought possible to prevail upon miss delamere to make unbecoming imprudent choice must have taken advantage of confidence reposed in by lord y to destroy happiness of young friend for whom evidently have great regard resolved to see more for week kept resolution refrained from going to y house deem most virtuous action of life certainly be most painful sacrifice ever made to sense of duty at last lord y came to one morning after reproaching in friendly manner for having so long absented from house declared that must not be satisfied with of common excuse might content mere acquaintance that sincere anxiety for welfare gave right to expect from frankness of friend be relief to mind to be encouraged in manner confessed with entire openness real motive lord y heard without surprise be gratifying to said lordship to be convinced be not mistaken in judgment of taste
