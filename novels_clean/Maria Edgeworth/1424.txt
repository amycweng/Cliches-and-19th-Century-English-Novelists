admired others with artless enthusiasm dont think troubled much about complication of feeling liked people to make repartee to invent machine to pay bill to do duty in commonplace cheerfully stoical fashion then maria edgeworth certainly did not belong to modern school sipping emetic goblet to give flavour to daily event to still more alarming spreading clique of degeneres who insist upon administering such dos to others to relieve tedium of road of life perhaps in time scarcely do justice to miss edgeworths extraordinary cleverness brightness of apprehension there be more fun than humour in work be day of good rollicking joke laughter detail change so quickly that be almost impossible to grasp entirely aim intention of whole set of people just little different from ourselves in
