always for such little child a must take care did not catch be walking in street fowler be maid name added there be knowing what might do with in enlightened day in present improved state of education may appear incredible that nursery maid must be so wicked a to relate child of six year old so foolish a to credit such tale be speaking of what happened many year ago nursery maid child believe be very different now from what be then in further proof of progress of human knowledge reason may recollect that many of very story of jew now hold too preposterous for infant nursery maid to credit be

moment became slave victim shudder when look back to suffered during eighteen month be under tyranny night moment candle left room lay in indescribable agony of terror head under bed clothes knee drawn up in cold perspiration saw face around grinning glaring receding advancing turning at last into same face of jew with long beard terrible eye bag in fancied be mangled limb of child opened to receive fell upon bed lay heavy on breast so must neither stir scream in short be one continued nightmare there be refreshing sleep for till hour when candle returned tyrant protectress a thought came to bed in due course suffered in turn for must not long endure state instead of submitting passively lying speechless with terror moment left room at night began to roar scream till brought mother house up to bedside what must be matter with child faithful to promise never betrayed secret of prison house nothing must be learned from be frightened must not go to sleep indeed trembling condition convulsed countenance sufficiently proved mother who be passionately fond of became alarmed for health ordered that fowler must stay in room with night till must be quite fast asleep so fowler sat beside bed night singing caressing cajoling hushing conjuring to sleep when in about hour time flattered that conjuration have succeeded when relaxing muscle gave hope that might withdraw arm

upright in bed eye wide open voice ready for roar so be compelled instantly to return to replace candle full in view to sit down close beside bed with arm once more thrown over be forced again to repeat that jew bag must not come there cursing in heart recommenced deceitful song be seldom released in le than two hour in vain now tried by day to chase away terror of night to undo own work be beyond power in vain confessed that threat be only to frighten into being good boy in vain told that be too old now to believe such nonsense in vain told that simon be only old clothes man that cry be only old clothes old clothes mimicked to take off terror terror be in power of association be beyond skill to dissolve in vain explained to that bag held only old shoe yellow petticoat in vain now offered to let see with own eye imagination be by time proof against ocular demonstration one morning early took down stair into housekeeper room where simon bag be admitted emptied bag in presence

heaven know natural rest be gone besides must not even get cup of tea in evening stir out for mouthful of fresh air now be night to sing master harrington to sleep be poetical justice that who have begun by terrifying in order to get to bed out of way must end by being forced to suffer restraint to cure of terror fowler did not understand relish poetical justice kind of justice besides have heard that lady de brantefield be in want of nursery maid for little lady anne mowbray who be year younger than master harrington fowler humbly represented to mother that thought master harrington be really growing too stout too much of man confessed quite above beyond management comprehension for never pretended to thing care of young child have not arrived at year of discretion understood to be

nervous sensibility of have before be vain be glad that past must be past forgotten yet painful reminiscence must come over mind whenever heard saw word jew about time first became fond of reading never saw word in page of book happened to open without immediately stopping to read passage here must observe that not only in old story book where jew be a sure to be wicked a bad fairy bad genius allegorical personification of devil vice in old emblem mystery morality c in almost work of fiction found represented a hateful being nay even in modern tale of very late year since have come to man estate have met with book by author professing candour toleration book written expressly for rising generation called if mistake not moral tale for young people even in wherever jew be introduced find that be invariably represented a being of mean avaricious unprincipled treacherous character even peculiarity of person error of foreign dialect pronunciation be mimicked caricatured a if to render object of perpetual derision detestation be far from wishing to insinuate such be serious intention of author trust will in future benefit by hint simply state effect similar representation in story book read when be child produced on mind certainly acted most powerfully injuriously strengthening erroneous association of idea have accidentally formed confirming childish prejudice by what then thought indisputable authority of printed book about time also began to attend to conversation to conversation of gentleman a well a of lady listened with sort of personal interest curiosity whenever jew happened to be mentioned recollect hearing father talk with horror of young gentleman who have be dealing with jew asked what meant be answered 't be something very like dealing with devil dear who give child witty instead of rational answer know how dearly often make poor child pay for jest father added be certain that when man once go to jew soon go to devil so harrington boy charge at

hebrew nation be explained must have be full a useful to rather more just to be little concern of father with practical skill in management of mind with short sighted view a to permanent benefit without idea of philosophic moral cultivation next undertook to cure of fear have contributed to create took opportunity of pointing out how poor how helpless how wretched be how be abused continually insulted daily mocked by lowest of servant least of child in street very name by word of reproach be jew actual jew being expression for avarice hard heartedness fraud of fraud be told innumerable story in short jew be represented to a lowest meanest vilest of mankind conversion of fear into contempt be partially effected in mind partially say for conversion be not complete two sentiment existed together by experienced eye must easily be detected seen even one through other now whoever know thing of passion who be there who doe not must be aware how readily fear contempt run into kindred feeling of hatred be about time just before went to school that something relative to famous jew bill became subject of vehement discussion at father table father be not only member of parliament man of consequence with party have usually be staunch friend of government upon one occasion when first came into parliament nine ten year before time of be now writing in think have voted against ministry upon very bill for naturalization of jew in england government liberally desired that must be naturalized there be popular cry against father on one occasion thought voice of people be right after bill have be carried half through be given up by ministry opposition to proving so violent father be great stickler for parliamentary consistency moreover be of obstinate temper ten

prepossession fault of israel lyon be not of specie expected to find in jew perhaps be aware that hebrew nation be in general supposed to be too careful might therefore be little vain of own

on very subject from have fancied must have shrunk instead of looking for excuse for miss montenero indisposition at once named real cause have be said deeply affected by representation of shylock detestable jew whom genius of greatest poet that ever wrote talent of one of greatest actor who have ever appeared have conspired to render object of public execration recently arrived in london continued mr montenero have not have personal opportunity of judging of actor talent englishman can have felt more strongly than have power of shakspeare genius to touch rend human heart mr montenero spoke english with foreign accent something of foreign idiom idea feeling forced way regardless of grammatical precision thought foreign accent agreeable to englishman what accent that conveys praise of shakspeare can fail to be agreeable most certain method by foreigner introduce at once to good will good opinion of englishman be by thus doing homage to national object of idolatry perceived that mr montenero be not mere compliment spoke with real feeling in instance resumed poor jew have felt shakspeare power to cost too severely considering circumstance rather unjustly be aware considering circumstance did not precisely understand endeavoured a well a must to make general apology for shakspeare severity by adverting to time when wrote prejudice then prevailed true said a dramatic poet be business acknowledge to take advantage of popular prejudice a power a mean of dramatic pathos effect yet will acknowledge that jew must feel peculiarly hard that truth of story on poet founded plot must have be completely sacrificed to fiction so that character be not only misrepresented reversed did not know to what mr montenero meant to allude however endeavoured to pas off with slight bow of

in view settled immediately that be tribe of issys cecys hennys queeneys be vulgar rich to whom mr montenero alluded warmly expressed indignation against who must have be so brutal a to make miss

want of consideration for feeling of others little want of liberality even so must not bear thought miss montenero must have be on first arrival in england thrown among person who might give false idea of english dislike to country there be danger of sort replied have be disposed to judge so rashly uncharitably humane polite attention met with last night from gentleman who be utter stranger to who must only know that be foreigner in want of assistance must have be to at once conviction reproof bowed delighted with mr montenero with hope believe continued that berenice be not disposed to form uncharitable judgment of individual nation especially not of english of whom have from history literature with be not wholly unacquainted conceived highest idea bowed again though not quite so much delighted with general compliment to nation a by peculiar to myself expressed hope that english must justify favourable prepossession that on farther acquaintance with different society in london mr miss montenero must find that among higher class in country there be want of liberality of opinion certainly want of delicacy of sentiment manner want of attention to feeling of who be of different persuasion from just at moment mother entered room advancing towards mr montenero said with gracious smile need not introduce to other dear harrington for be sure have pleasure of seeing mr clive from

that there be pleasure in honour polite inquiry followed concerning miss montenero indisposition then after ineffectual effort to resume ease cordiality of manner mother leaned back languidly on sofa endeavoured to account for cloud settled on brow by adverting to sleepless night have passed to fear of impending headache assuring mr montenero at same time that society conversation be always of

kindest of master to can wonder now mr harrington do blame jacob that must not look upon lord with pleased eye smile when saw again did not blame jacob liked for warmth of feeling for master when be little composed however represented that affection pity might have raised indignation too strongly might have made impute to lord mowbray greater share than really have in misfortune lord mowbray be very young officer at time too young to be trusted with command of men in such difficult circumstance lordship have be exceedingly blamable in giving even in jest nickname have prejudiced soldier against innocent individual must not conceive that have serious design to injure must a observed possibly foresee fatal consequence afterwards ensued a to excess of soldier for want of discipline be answerable jacob must recollect distress to soldier have be previously reduced general prejudice against who be supposed to be cause of scarcity lord mowbray might be mistaken like others a to permitting outrage directing against individual jew whom disliked told jacob be impossible for to believe why did not jew merchant state complaint to general who have a jacob allowed punished soldier who have be convicted of committing outrage if lord mowbray have be complained of by mr manessa court martial must have be held if charge have be substantiated title of colonel lord must have availed nothing must have be broke jacob said poor master who be ruined in despair thought not of court martial perhaps have legal proof perhaps dreaded with reason popular prejudice in garrison dared not being jew appear against christian officer how might have be jacob said did not know knew be that master be very ill that returned to england soon afterwards still argued if lord mowbray have not be brought to court martial if have be known among brother officer that have be guilty of such unofficer like conduct british officer must have kept company with be therefore convinced that jacob must

to bring mother with turned conversation a quickly a must to mr israel lyon observed by what mr montenero said that from information have received from mr lyon from jacob be thoroughly aware of early prejudice antipathy to jew observed to daughter that mr harrington have double merit in present liberality since have conquered what be so difficult scarcely possible completely to conquer early prepossession fostered perhaps by opinion of many who must have have great influence on mind through compliment thought saw in mr montenero still more in timid countenance of daughter fear might relapse that early prepossession be so difficult scarcely possible completely to conquer might recur promised must soon convince be mistaken if have formed such notion be flattered by fear a implied that have inspired interest went on with picture not being connoisseur though fond of art be relieved pleased to find mr montenero have none of jargon of connoisseurship while observation impressed with high idea of taste judgment gave confidence in own be delighted to find understood must naturally truly agree with said that untutored preference be what ought to be according to right rule of art science in short be proud to find that taste be in general same a daughter what pleased far more than mr montenero taste be liberality enlargement of mind saw in opinion sentiment there be in philosophic calmness moderation reason seemed to have worked against great natural sensibility perhaps susceptibility till calm have become unvarying temper of mind fancied also that perceived constant care in to cultivate same temper in daughter to fortify against extreme sensibility to opinion of others diffidence of herself to a recollected have formerly adverted after having admired of murillo picture came to one unpractised a be in judging of painting immediately perceived to be inferior be quite right said mr montenero be inferior to murillo sudden sense of inferiority absolutely

away exclaimed castillo be more soon castillo be more from moment pined away shortly afterwards died not from envy continued mr montenero no be man of mild amiable temper incapable of envy fell victim to excessive sensibility dangerous though not common vice of character weakness not vice hope heard miss montenero say in low voice father answered with sigh that however can not be called virtue incapacitates from exercise of independent virtue a find not only depresses genius may extinguish life mr montenero then turned to with composure went on speaking of picture ever since knew be to see

tasteless lawyer niggardly devotee hesitated to pay artist price observing that cano by own account have be only twenty five day about counsellor sat down with stupid self sufficiency to calculate at hundred pistoles divided by twenty five day artist must be paid at higher rate than be for exercise of talent talk to of talent exclaimed enraged artist have be fifty year learning to make statue in twenty five day a spoke cano dashed statue to piece on pavement of academy affrighted counsellor fled from house with utmost precipitation concluding that man who be bold enough to destroy saint must have very little remorse in destroying lawyer happily for cano story did not reach ear of inquisition said mr montenero must have be burnt alive mr montenero then pointed out exquisite piece by artist spoke with enthusiasm of genius perceived emotion of must not guess cause in countenance of daughter seemed touched by what father said about painter picture mr montenero concluded panegyric on cano genius by saying besides being great genius be told that be very religious few peculiarity excepted very charitable be very charitable be sure said miss montenero looking at father smiling be not sure

agree romantic imagination enthusiastic manner of expressing be often in contrast with worldly comic mode of seeing talking hurt sometimes feeling by raillery pulled down too suddenly from flight of imagination by flash of wit showed perhaps too clearly danger of fall from high sublime to deep absurd after be satisfied that miss montenero preferred style in general be content that must enjoy dear wit gay rhetoric even little at expense morning went to westminster abbey own be provoked with for pointing out to observation at moment when imagination be struck with sense of sublimity at sight of

recollecting must not to before daughter describe jew who have committed deed without name with much embarrassment said that be nothing of consequence be something must not explain left to mowbray superior presence of mind better address to account for went on with berenice whenever imagination be warmed verse poured in upon memory often without much apparent connexion with what went before recollected at moment passage in akenside pleasure of imagination describing early delight imagination take in horror child closing round village matron who suspends infant audience with tale breathing astonishment recited recollected of evil spirit of deathbed call of who robb 'd widow devour 'd orphan portion of unquiet soul ris'n from grave to ease heavy guilt of deed in life conceal 'd

of hell be sure must have be most ridiculous figure saw mowbray on brink of laughter mr montenero looked so grave that fixed attention suddenly stopped be talking of 'the pleasure of imagination said berenice to father mr harrington be great admirer of akenside be replied mr montenero coldly with look of absence dear can have pleasure of imagination time here be reality worthy of present attention then drew daughter arm within followed time be pointing out to pattern of spanish instrument of torture with politic majesty queen elizabeth frightened subject into courage sufficient to repel invader

have very confused recollection many thing conspired to distract attention whether be that disappointment at not seeing berenice indisposed to be pleased whether chanting be not day at synagogue a fine a usual certainly did not answer expectation however pleasing might be to other ear to mine be discordant be afraid that mr montenero must perceive saw that observed from time to time attentively thought wanted to discover whether there be within remains of old antipathy upon subject knew be peculiarly susceptible under apprehension did utmost to suppress feeling constraint became mentally

reading english remarkably well daughter glance at flatterer expressed indignation suddenly extinguished by contempt detected baffled did not well know how by woman whom considered a so much inferior in ability address lord mowbray found often difficult to conceal real feeling of resentment then be that began to hate who knew countenance too well to be deceived by utmost command of face saw evil turn of eye saw look from time to time absolutely alarmed look of hatred malice vengeance suddenly changed to smile submission softness of demeanour though extremely vain possessed with opinion that woman must resist yet with understanding experience in gallantry must not conceive possible that after sign token have seen must persist in hope of succeeding be certainly aware that be preferred knew to be natural that jealousy anger must increase with fear doubt of success yet there be something incomprehensible in manner before mr montenero now adopted towards appeared at once to yield palm to

expected word take away when be taken away be gone who a obehane said must too soon wish unheard what be dying to hear drew daughter chair close to placed so a to save blush began story by relating o'tara have told be sudden death shocking mademoiselle repeated several time dora recovered from shock from word shocking felt delight of dora being no longer sacrifice after general thanksgiving

mademoiselle inquired whether be most french english ormond whether be going to be married to question o'tara pleaded ignorance except with respect to sport of field have very little curiosity intelligence ray of hope again darted across mind of corny from knowledge of world thought very probable that young officer in french brigade must be well contented to be heir to brother fortune without encumbering with irish wife taken from obscure part of country corny therefore eagerly inquired from o'tara what became of white connal property o'tara answered that common cry of country be that white connal profitable farm be leasehold property upon own life poor corny hope be thus frustrated have nothing left to do for day to pity harry ormond to bear with curiosity impatience of mademoiselle with froward sullenness of dora till intelligence must arrive respecting new claimant to destined hand chapter xiv few day afterwards sheelah bursting into dora room exclaimed miss dora miss dora for love of god be coming be coming down avenue powdering along black connal flaming away with one in gold hat big galloping after gold over be entirely oh what will become of master harry

what handsome uniform said miss o'faley very proper looking man said sheelah well who 'd have thought black connal if be must ever have turned out so fine presence of man to look at very cavalier indeed to go out to walk without waiting to see said dora oh will engage be that dear father of yours hoisted out hoisted out well aunt do sometimes speak oddest english do think strange that must be so very much at ease look at hear wonder what be saying harry ormond give bonnet sheelah behind quick aunt let go out of garden door meet out walking by accident be best way long to see how somebody will look very good now look life spirit perfectly charming look that manner will engage will fall in love with have better not can tell unless have particular pleasure in being refused said dora with toss of head neck at same time glance at looking glass a passed quickly out of room dora aunt walked out accidentally met gentleman in walk a m de connal approached gave full leisure to form opinion a to personal appearance have air of foreign officer easy fashionable upon uncommonly good term with conscious with vulgar consciousness of possessing fine figure good face be air of french coxcomb who in unconstrained delight be rather proud to display than anxious to conceal perfect self satisfaction interrupting conversation only when came within few pace of lady advanced with air of happy confidence parisian gallantry begging that mr obehane must do honour pleasure to present after bow said nothing to dora addressed conversation entirely to aunt walking beside mademoiselle approaching attempting to speak to dora did not advert to in least seemed scarcely to know be present quite disconcerted young lady whole plan of proceeding opportunity be afforded of showing disdain withdrew arm from aunt though mademoiselle held a fast a must dora withdrew resolutely falling back step two took harry ormond arm walked with talking with a much unconcern a loudly a must to mark indifference whether talked be silent walked on with harry ormond stayed behind whispered laughed aloud seemed to make impression alteration whatever in monsieur de connal went on conversing with mademoiselle with father alternately in french english in english spoke with native irish accent seemed to have be preserved from childhood though brogue be strong yet there be vulgar expression spoke good english generally with somewhat of french idiom whether be from habit affectation be not easy to decide seemed a if person who be speaking thought in french translated into english a went on peculiarity of manner accent for there be french mixed with irish fixed attention besides dora be really curious to hear what be saying for be very entertaining mademoiselle be in rapture while talked of paris versailles various people of consequence fashion at court dauphiness be then just married de connal have seen ftes firework beautiful dauphiness in answering question of mademoiselle about colour of hair for first time showed that have taken notice of dora nearly colour think of young lady hair a well a one can judge powder prevents possibility of judging accurately dora be vexed to see that be considered merely a young lady exerted to take part in conversation mr connal never joined in conversation with with most scrupulous deference stopped short in middle of sentence if began to speak stood aside shrinking into with utmost care if be to pas held bough of shrub out of way continued conversation with mademoiselle time when came in from walk same sort of thing went on really be very extraordinary thought seems a if be spell bound obliged by notion of politeness to let pas incognita mademoiselle be so fully engaged chattering away that did not perceive dora mortification le notice connal took of more dora wished to attract attention not that desired to please only longed to have pleasure of refusing for purpose offer must be made be not at clear that offer must be made when lady went to dress before dinner mademoiselle while be presiding at dora toilette expressed how much be delighted with m de connal asked what niece thought of dora replied that indeed did not trouble to think of at that thought monstrous coxcomb that wondered what must bring so prodigiously fine gentleman to black island ask own sense what brought here ask own looking glass what will keep here said miss o'faley can tell think very handsome already when see dress really doe honour did not seem a if have even seen more than of tree in wood chair in room chair oh now fish for complimens will not tell how like think if be mise la franoise to la belle comtesse de barnac be not very extraordinary absolutely never spoke to said dora very strange manner of paying court mademoiselle assured dora that be owing to m de connal french habit young lady in paris passing for nothing scarcely ever appearing in society till be married gentleman have intercourse with must be considered a breach of respect due to young lady mother to address much conversation to know dear dore marriage be make up by father mother friend young people never speak never know nothing at about one till contract be sign in fact young lady be little round what call cipher have value in socit at till figure of de husband come to give value have notion of being cipher said dora be not french young lady monsieur de connal ah dear dore consider what be de french wife ah then come great glory then reign over heart be in full libert to dress to go to come to do what like with own carriage own box at de opera listen well will draw out for from m de connal dora languidly sullenly begged aunt must not give trouble have curiosity nevertheless asked several question about la comtesse de barnac time saying did not in least care what thought said of drew from aunt syllable that m de connal have uttered be secretly mortified surprised to find have said so little must not dress to mind to day protesting did not care how looked resigned into aunt hand whatever might think must take care to show at dinner that young lady in country be not cipher at dinner however a before dora preconcerted air of disdain determination to show that be somebody gave way did not know how before m de connal easy assurance polite indifference knowledge of world talent for conversation with variety of subject have flowing in from part of world gave advantage with there be possibility of contending talked carved life gaiety fashion spoke of battle of prince play opera wine woman cardinal religion politics poetry turkey stuffed with truffle paris for ever dash on at thing hit miss sure of applause of mademoiselle a thought secure of admiration of whole company of native from le beau pre at foot of table to boy who waited who did not wait opposite to who stood entranced with wonder at m de connal said that did even to fashion in stowed truss of salad into mouth with fork talked through dora what did think thought be very much mortified that there be room for to say so little question now be not what thought of m de connal what thought of after beginning with various little mock defence averting of head twist of neck of shoulder hip compound motion resolvable into mauvaise honte pride a dinner proceeded monsieur de connal success be undoubted silently gave up resolution not to admire before first course be over connal perceived that have eye before second be over thought will have ear by time come to dessert will be in fair way for heart though seemed to have talked without design except to amuse company in general yet in have said there have be prospective view to object chose mean well in mademoiselle found at once happy dupe confederate without previous concert raised vision of parisian glory be to prepare young lady imagination for french lover french husband m de connal be well aware that matter who touched heart if must pique vanity after dinner when lady retired old mr connal began to enter upon question of intended union between family ormond left room corny suppressed deep sigh m de connal took early opportunity of declaring that there be truth in report of going to be married in england confessed that thing have be in question must speak with delicacy family connexion did not suit have strong prejudice owned in favour of ancient family irish family have always wished to marry irish woman for reason have avoided opportunity might have occurred of connecting perhaps advantageously in france be really ambitious of honour of alliance with obehanes nothing must be more fortunate for than friendship have subsisted between father mr obehane promise relinquish oh that assured mr obehane be quite impossible provided young lady must not make decided objection must abide by decision must not possibly think of pressing suit if there must appear repugnance in case must be infinitely mortified must be absolutely in despair must know how to submit cost what must must think a man of honour be part to sacrifice wish to what young lady might conceive to be for happiness added profusion of compliment on young lady charm with declaration of effect have already produced on heart be said with sort of nonchalance corny did not at like mademoiselle who be summoned to corny private council gave a opinion that m de connal be already quite in love quite a much a french husband ever be be glad that brother in law be bound by promise to gentleman who must really be proper husband for niece mademoiselle in short saw thing couleur de rose urged that since m de connal have come to ireland for express purpose of forwarding present suit ought to be invited to stay at corny castle that might endeavour to make acceptable to dora to corny acceded left mademoiselle to make invitation for said understood french politeness that better than did invitation be made accepted with due expression of infinite delight well dear harry ormond said first moment have opportunity of speaking to harry in private what do think of man what miss obehane think of be question said harry with embarrassment be true be too hard to ask will tell think between ourselves black connal be better than white inasmuch a puppy be better than brute will see what dora will say think soon aunt be over head ear already woman be mighty apt to be taken one way other with bit of coxcomb vanity vanity still know suspect dora have heart from hope have right to heart will say no more till see way heart turn settle after little trembling variation when point steady will know how to steer course have scheme in head wo mention to harry because might end in disappointment so go off to bed to sleep if can have have hard day to go through poor honourable harry poor honourable harry have many hard day to go through have now to see how dora mind be gradually worked upon not by new passion for mr connal never inspired endeavoured to inspire passion by own aunt vanity mademoiselle with constant importunity assailed though dora saw that aunt only wish be to settle in paris to live in fine hotel though dora be persuaded that for aunt must without scruple sacrifice happiness that of harry ormond yet be so dazzled by splendid representation of parisian life a not to see very distinctly what object have in view connal flattery too though have scarcely pretence to tone of truth passion yet contrasting with previous indifference gratified be sensible that be not attached to a harry ormond be flattered that must quite turn head in time tried power of charming for purpose at first chiefly with intention of exciting harry jealousy forcing to break honourable resolution harry continued first object for little time soon idea of piquing be merely excuse for coquetry imagined that must recede advance with new admirer just a thought proper be mistaken have now to deal with man practised in game might let appear to win not for nothing must let win single move yet seemed to play so carelessly a not in least to alarm put on guard bystander began to guess how game must terminate be game in whole happiness of dora life be at stake to say nothing of own ormond must not look on without anxiety notwithstanding outwardly calm appearance without strong conflicting emotion if said to be convinced that man must make happy think must be happy more saw of connal le thought likely to make dora happy unless indeed vanity must quite extinguish sensibility then monsieur de connal must be just husband to suit connal be exactly what appeared to be gay young officer who have made own way up in world petit matre who have really lived in good company at paris have made agreeable to woman of rank fortune might perhaps a said with figure fashion connexion have made fortune in paris by marriage have have time to look about sudden run of ill fortune at play have obliged to quit paris for season be necessary to make fortune by marriage in england ireland a expeditiously a possible in situation dora with own aunt property be a considered offer not to be rashly slighted yet be very eager about matter if failed here must succeed elsewhere real indifference gave advantage with dora man of feeling must perhaps never have obtained never have kept father though believed in mutable nature of woman yet must scarcely think that daughter dora be of nature must scarcely conceive that passion for harry ormond that passion have short time before certainly affected spirit put in fear for health must have be conquered by coxcomb who cared very

shock health have received at time of husband death account interested ormond exceedingly for young widow there be something peculiarly engaging in pensive softness modesty of manner appeared free from affectation far from making display of feeling seemed a much a possible to repress to endeavour to be cheerful that might not damp gaiety of others natural disposition lady norton said be very sprightly however passive subdued might appear at present be of high independent spirit must on great occasion think act for better better trait suited ormond character more more own observation confirmed high opinion praise of friend tended to inspire ormond be particularly pleased with indulgent manner in lady millicent spoke of own sex be free from propensity to detraction have so disgusted in last love even of by whom a have be hinted to have be hardly treated spoke with gentleness candour recollecting miss lardner assertion that lady annaly have used lady millicent barbarously purposely mentioned lady annaly to hear what must say lady annaly said be most respectable woman have prejudice who be there have not be unfortunate for that have be prepossessed against be one of nearest connexion by marriage one to whom might have looked in difficulty distress one of few person whose assistance interference must willingly have accepted must even have stooped to ask

principle reason be for sensibility enthusiasm enthusiasm in particular with there be virtue without acting from hope of making others happy from view of utility be acting merely from low selfish motif point of virtue be so high that ordinary mortal might well console by perceiving impossibility of ever reaching exalted to cloud managed matter a pleased there made charming confusion when condescended to return to earth attempted to define not to define definition be death to imagination to describe notion be nearly unintelligible declared however that understood perfectly well ormond deceived by eloquence of be passionate admirer thought that understood when only felt idea of virtue be carried to such extreme that touched opposite vice in truth there be nothing to prevent for line between right wrong line must be strongly marked be effaced so delicately have sentiment shaded off boundary female metaphysics character of exalted imagination sensitive softness be not quite so cheap common year ago a have lately become consequence to practically lead be not then fully foreseen understood at time man experienced in female character who have knowledge of world even supposing have skill in metaphysics must easily have seen to what tends where usually terminates such man must never have thought of marrying lady millicent ormond be inexperienced whole matter manner be new to be struck with delicacy sensibility of fair sophist with be ingenious plausible in doctrine instead of being alarmed by dangerous tendency must be observed in justice to lady millicent that be perfectly sincere if may use expression of good faith in absurdity did not use sentimental sophistry a have since be too often employed by many to veil from criminality of passion to mask deformity of vice there be perhaps more immediate hazard of erring from ignorance rashness there be also in youth innocence chance that might instinctively start back moment must see precipice one evening sir ulick be talking of lord chesterfield letter book at time much in vogue good sense virtue of england soon cast into disrepute in spite of charm of wit style in spite of many sparkling valuable

when went into company with who happened to know nothing of connexion with sir ulick obehane then heard spoken of in very different manner be quite astonished dismayed by general abuse a thought be poured upon well man of ability excites envy man who take part in politics especially in time when party run high must expect to be abused must bear friend must learn to bear for such be reflection with ormond at first comforted a far a party abuse went be quite satisfactory even fact what be told a fact be so altered by manner of seeing by opposite party that without meaning to traduce calumniate ormond entrenched in total disbelief cool assertion of disbelief of variety of anecdote continually heard discreditable to sir ulick still expected that when went into other company met with men of sir ulick own party must obtain proof of falsehood of story by might be able not only to contradict to confute people however only smiled told that have better inquire farther if expected to find sir ulick immaculate character who liked best laughed off notorious instance of public defection of principle of private jobbing a good joke proof of knowledge of world address frankness being not bit of hypocrite even who professed to like best to be least scrupulous with regard to public virtue still spoke with sort of facetious contempt of sir ulick a thorough going friend of power be a hack of administration a man who knew well enough what be about ormond be continually either surprised hurt by insinuation concurrent testimony of number who have interest to serve prejudice to gratify operated upon by degree so a to enforce conviction be still more painful harry became so sore irritable upon subject that be now day in danger of entangling in quarrel in defence of guardian several time master of house prevented brought to reason by representing that person who talked of sir ulick be quite ignorant of connexion with spoke only according to general opinion to best of

always known in time with regard to character therefore independently of other motif moral religious be more prudent to trust to time truth for defence than to sword pistol know be impatient to hear what be report to disadvantage from whom have have from annalys heard in england through various circuitous channel of female correspondent in ireland a far a can trace think that originated with old friend miss black first account lady annaly heard of after went to england be that be living most dissolute life in black island with king corny who be described to be profligate rebel companion ex communicated catholic priest king priest prince harry getting drunk together regularly night of life next account lady annaly received month afterwards in reply to inquiry have made from agent be that be impossible to know thing for certain of mr harry ormond a always kept in black island report be that have lately seduced girl of name of peggy sheridan respectable gardener daughter who be going to

when out shooting with mr ormond to whom considerable landed property large legacy in money be to body surprise found to be left in will produced family did not think fit to dispute there be strange circumstance told concerning wake burial tending to prove that harry ormond have lost feeling hint be further given that have renounced protestant religion have turned catholic for sake of absolution many time during perusal of extravagant tissue of falsehood ormond laid down resumed paper unable to refrain from exclamation of rage contempt sometimes almost laughing at absurdity of slander after thought who can mind common report yet dr cambray say that excited prejudice against in mind of lady annaly with woman must have thought impossible must believe capable of such crime of whom have once good opinion in whose fate said be interested took dr cambray letter again read on found that lady annaly have not credited report a to atrocious accusation have so far operated a to excite doubt suspicion in of circumstance there be sufficient truth to colour falsehood for example with regard to peggy sheridan dora truth have be plausibly mixed with story of peggy sheridan lady annaly have suspicion might be true ladyship who have seen moriarty generous conduct to ormond be indignant at ingratitude be woman prompt to feel strong indignation against be base when indignation be excited be sometimes incapable of hearing what be said on other side of question daughter florence of calmer temper cooler judgment usually acted a moderator on occasion must not believe that harry ormond have be guilty of fault be so opposite to have seen in disposition violence not treachery be fault why if there be nothing wrong lady annaly urged why did not write to a have requested must when plan for future life be decided have told that son might probably be able to assist why must not write one line ormond have heard that son be ill that mind be so absorbed with anxiety that must not at first venture to intrude upon with selfish concern be first best reason afterwards to be sure when heard that son be better might have written wrote at time sad scrawl of hand be so little used to letter writing that be ashamed to write then be too late after so long silence c foolish a reason be have a have said before acted upon young hero have perhaps in a important circumstance prevented many young men from writing to friend able willing to serve be rather fortunate for ormond that slander did not stop at first plausible falsehood when more atrocious charge came against miss annaly who have never deserted cause declared absolute disbelief discussion went on between mother kept alive interest about young man be likely to have be forgotten during anxiety in son illness fresh report have brought to recollection frequently when friend dr cambray be appointed to living of castle hermitage evidence perfectly reinstated harry in lady annaly good opinion a if to make amends for injustice have done by believing part of evil report be now anxious to see again few day after dr cambray wrote ormond received very polite gratifying letter from lady annaly requesting that a annaly

what mind really felt if just observation be made in miss annaly company stroke of genius countenance instantly kindled into light life if noble sentiment be expressed if generous action be related then soul within illumined countenance with ray divine when once ormond have seen eye returned in hope of seeing again have indescribable interest pleasure in studying countenance seemed so true index to noble cultivated mind to heart of delicate not morbid sensibility manner understanding have be formed improved beyond what must have be expected from few opportunity of improvement have till lately

resolute manly character that be peculiarly engaging to woman during first visit at annaly pleased much be so much pleased with individual of family with manner conversation affection for other altogether with mode of living that declared to dr cambray never have be so happy in whole existence be remarkable fact however that spoke much more of lady annaly sir herbert than of miss annaly have

however fine polish might take even when gay world at castle hermitage be new to amused enchanted a be at first with brilliant society must not have be content happy without friend at vicar dale to whom once at least in four twenty hour found necessary to open heart may then judge how happy now felt in returning to annaly after sort of moral constraint have endured in company of marcus obehane may guess what expansion of heart took place family union domestic happiness saw at annaly certainly struck at time more forcibly from contrast with what have just seen at castle hermitage effect of contrast however be transient be powerful a dramatic resource in real life be of permanent consequence there be here charm operates with a great certainty with power secure of increasing instead of diminishing from habit charm of domestic politeness in day manner of mother son daughter towards other a well a towards guest ormond saw felt irresistibly saw most delicate attention combined with entire sincerity perfect ease constant respect result of early habit of good breeding acting upon feeling of genuine affection external polish ormond now admired be very different from varnish often be hastily applied to hide imperfection polish be of substance to be obtained only by long use once acquired lasting for ever not only beautiful serviceable preserving from injury of time from danger

opposite interest one to save other to destroy in state of thing cause of complaint perpetually occurred ormond who be present when accuser accused appealed to landlord sometimes a lord of manor sometimes a magistrate have frequent opportunity of seeing sir herbert principle temper put to test liked to compare different mode in king corny guardian sir herbert annaly managed thing sir herbert governed neither by threat punishment abuse tyranny yet did govern by promise bribery favour protection like sir ulick cajoled bullied held a principle a marcus did that people must be kept down that people must be deceived treated a slave subject to will a dupe object on to exercise wit cunning treated a reasonable being a fellow creature whom wished to improve that might make happy spoke sense to mixed that sense with wit humour in proportion necessary to make palatable to irishman in generosity there be resemblance between temper of sir herbert of corny to ormond surprise at first to disappointment sir herbert valued justice more than generosity ormond heart on point be often with king corny when head be forced to be with sir herbert by degree head heart came together became

albemarle a read letter sir herbert after asking ormond three time whether be not acquainted with general albemarle obtained for answer that really did not know in truth ormond did not know thing at moment sir herbert surprised imagining that ormond have not yet heard be going to repeat question look from mother stopped sudden light struck lady annaly mother be remarkably quick sighted upon

after mr m'crule healing wound inflicted pouring into festering heart balm of christian charity be beloved revered by parishioner mr m'crule be soon detected universally avoided enraged attacked by

having be assured that religion must not be tampered with allowed encouraged flock to send child to same seminary mr m'crule be affected to be much alarmed scandalized at seeing catholic protestant child mixing so much together knew that opinion be divided among family in neighbourhood upon propriety of mixture mr m'crule thought fine opportunity of making of consequence by stirring up matter into party question bright idea have occurred to just about time ormond brought over little tommy from black island during ormond absence upon tour sheelah moriarty have regularly sent boy to village school exhorting to mind book figure that might surprise mr ormond with larning when must come back tommy with excitation being quick clever little fellow soon got to head of class kept there won

visited school for pleasure of finding fault wondered to see little tommy who be catholic carrying away prize from others thought duty to inquire farther about a soon a discovered that came from black

fearing hoping to heaven prophesying canvassing collecting opinion vote a for matter of life death hinted that knew that greatest interest be making to get in year catholic child there be knowing if went on what consequence might be in short ireland must be ruined if little tommy must prove successful candidate mr m'crule did not find difficult to stir up prejudice passion of several lady whose

remonstrating on cruelty of leaving in utter darkness calling blindness assuring mr m'crule that have not slightest conception of what danger emergency to alluded might be what little tommy must have to do with lady condescended in compliance with mr m'greggor twitch behind to stay recommence statement must not forbear smiling even more than lady annaly have done when be made to understand that emergency crisis meant nothing child being admitted not admitted into charity school while ormond be incapable of speaking in reply with becoming seriousness florence who saw condition have kindness to draw off mr m'crule attention by asking to partake of excellent goose pie just then made entrance promised for time to suspend discussion to unite party in one common sympathy when florence saw that consomm to delicately helped be not thrown away upon mr m'crule that union of goose turkey in christmas dainty be much admired by good lady attempted playfully to pas to reflection on happy effect might to taste result from union in party matter too serious matter to be jested with even with glass of barsac at lip mr m'crule stopped to say so to sigh per favour of barsac however florence ventured to try what little raillery might do be possible that if mr m'greggor chorus of young lady must be made to laugh mr m'crule might be brought to see whole thing in le gloomy point of view might perhaps be just in time made sensible of ridicule to must expose by persisting in sounding so pompously false alarm can there really be so much danger said florence in letting little child protestant catholic come together to same school sit on same bench learn same alphabet from same hornbook oh dear miss annaly cried mr m'crule do wonder to hear treat matter so lightly from whom confess did expect better principle beit on same bench easily said dear young lady consider that error of popery since there be catholic in room suppose may say error of popery be wonderfully

of rational social being operates not by contracting benumbing feeling faculty by expanding ennobling inspiring not with stoic indifference to pain pleasure of humanity with pious submission to will of heaven to order orderer of universe chapter xxvi though sir ulick obehane contrived to laugh on most occasion where other people must have wept though have pretty well case hardened heart yet be shocked by first news of death of sir herbert annaly knew man must die said so must sooner later for manner of death sir ulick must not help feeling secret pang felt conscious of having encouraged at

de connal be on green paper with border of cupid rose store of sentimental device in corner turn of phrase style a far a ormond must judge be quite french aiming evidently at being perfectly parisian yet be letter so flattering to vanity of man a might well incline to excuse vanity of woman besides a sir ulick obehane observed after making due deduction for french sentiment there remains enough to satisfy honest english heart that lady really desire to see ormond now in midst of parisian prosperity have grace to wish to show kindness to father adopted son to companion friend of childhood sir
