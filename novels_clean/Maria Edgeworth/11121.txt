companion be perhaps one of happiest day of life o madam said cecilia hardly able to repress tear why dear what be matter cecilia hesitated speak dear know that when ask to tell thing a friend never punish a governess therefore need not be afraid to tell be matter madam be not afraid ashamed asked why be not with companion why madam because have left what dear see that dislike yet know why must for take a much pain to please a of master seem satisfied with ma'be be pleased very morning to give bracelet be sure must not have given to one who did not deserve certainly not did deserve for application for successful application prize be for most assiduous not for most amiable then if have be for most amiable must not have be for mr villars smiling why what do think cecilia be better able to judge than be can determine whether apply to what give to learn whether attend to what desire to do avoid what desire not to do know that like a pupil can not know must like a companion unless be companion therefore must judge of what must do by seeing what others do in same circumstance o pray ma'be for then must not love yet think must love for hope be a ready to oblige a good natured a yes cecilia doubt that must be very good natured to be afraid must not like unless be good tempered too ma'be by good natured mean good tempered be same thing indeed understand by two very different thing be good natured cecilia for be desirous to oblige serve companion to gain praise save from blame to give pleasure to relieve from pain leonora be good tempered for can bear with foible acknowledge own without disputing about right sometimes yield to who be in wrong in short temper be perfectly good for can bear forbear wish that mine must said cecilia sighing may replied mr villars be not wish alone can improve in thing turn same exertion perseverance have won prize to day to object will meet with same success perhaps not on first second third attempt depend upon that will at last new effort will weaken bad habit strengthen good one must not expect to succeed at once repeat to for habit must be counteracted by habit must be a extravagant in to expect that fault must be destroyed by one punishment be ever so severe a be in roman emperor be reading of few day ago to wish that head of enemy be upon one neck that might cut off by one blow here mr villars took cecilia by hand began to walk home such be nature of cecilia mind that when object be forcibly impressed on imagination caused temporary suspension of reasoning faculty hope be too strong stimulus for spirit when fear did take possession of mind be attended with total debility vanity be now a much mortified a in morning have be elated walked on with mr villars in silence until came under shade of elm tree walk then fixing eye upon mr villars stopped short do think madam said with hesitation do think madam have bad heart bad heart dear why what put into head leonora said that have ma'be felt ashamed when said so dear how can leonora tell whether heart be good bad however in first place tell what mean by bad heart indeed know what be meant by ma'be be something body hate why do hate because think that will hurt ma'be believe that who have bad heart take delight in doing mischief that never do body good for own end then best definition can give of bad heart be that be constant propensity to hurt others to do wrong for sake of doing wrong yes ma'be be not there be still something else meant something can not express indeed never distinctly understood of therefore be more afraid well then to begin with what do understand tell cecilia do really think possible to be wicked merely for love of wickedness human being becomes wicked at once man begin by doing wrong because be because think be for interest if continue to do so must conquer sense of shame lose love of virtue how can cecilia who feel strong sense of shame eager desire to improve imagine that have bad heart indeed madam never did until body told so then began to be frightened about very evening ma'be when be in passion threw little louisa strawberry away be sure be very sorry for afterwards leonora body cried out that have bad heart be sure be only in passion very likely when be in passion a call cecilia see that be tempted to do harm to others if feel angry sympathize with perceive motive actuates then say that have bad heart dare say however when passion be over when recollect be very sorry for what have done said be not yes indeed madam very sorry then make sorrow of use to cecilia fix steadily in thought a hope to be good happy that if suffer to yield to passion upon trifling occasion anger consequence will become familiar to mind in same proportion sense of shame will be weakened till what began with doing from sudden impulse will end with doing from habit choice then must indeed according to definition have bad heart oh madam hope be sure never will indeed cecilia do indeed believe that never will on contrary think that have very good disposition what be of infinitely more consequence to active desire of improvement show that have a much perseverance a have candour will not despair of becoming thing must wish here cecilia countenance brightened ran up step in almost a high spirit a ran down in morning good night to cecilia said mr villars a be crossing hall good night to madam said cecilia ran up stair to bed must not go to sleep lay awake reflecting upon event of preceding day forming resolution for future at same time considering that have resolved resolved without effect wished to give mind more powerful motive ambition knew to be most powerful incentive have not said to herself already won prize of application can not same application procure much higher prize mr villars said that if prize have be promised to most amiable must not have be given to perhaps must not yesterday perhaps might not to morrow be reason must despair of ever deserving in consequence of reasoning cecilia formed design of proposing to companion that must give prize first of ensuing month first of june to most amiable mr villars applauded scheme companion adopted with greatest alacrity let prize said be bracelet of own hair instantly shining scissors be procured contributed lock of hair formed most beautiful gradation of colour from palest auburn to brightest black who be to have honour of plaiting be now question caroline begged that might a must plait very neatly said cecilia however be equally sure that must do much better dispute must inevitably have ensued if cecilia recollecting just a colour rose to scarlet have not yielded yielded with very good grace indeed a well a must be expected for first time for be habit confers ease without ease even in moral action there can be grace bracelet be plaited in neatest manner by caroline finished round edge with silver twist on be worked in smallest silver letter motto to most amiable moment be completed body begged to try on fastened with little silver clasp a be made large enough for eldest girl be too large for youngest of bitterly complained unanimously entreated that might be cut to fit how foolish exclaimed cecilia perceive that if win have nothing to do to put clasp little further from edge if get ca make larger very true said need not to have called foolish cecilia be by such hasty unguarded expression a that cecilia offended slight difference in manner make very material one in effect cecilia lost more love by general petulance than must gain by greatest particular exertion how far succeeded in curing herself of defect how far became deserving of bracelet to whom bracelet be given will be told in history of first of june continuation of bracelet first of june be now arrived young competitor be in state of most anxious suspense leonora cecilia continued to be foremost candidate quarrel have never be finally adjusted different pretension now retarded thought of reconciliation cecilia though be capable of acknowledging of fault in public before companion must not humble in private to leonora leonora be equal be inferior submission be much easier to vain mind where appears to be voluntary than when be necessary tribute to justice candour so strongly did cecilia feel truth that even delayed making apology coming to explanation with leonora until success must once more give palm if win bracelet to day said to herself will solicit return of leonora friendship will be more valuable to than even bracelet at time asked in such manner surely can not refuse to animated with hope of double triumph cecilia canvassed with most zealous activity by constant attention exertion have considerably abated violence of temper changed course of habit power of pleasing be now excited instead of ability to excel if talent appeared le brilliant character be acknowledged to be more amiable so great influence upon manner conduct have object of ambition cecilia be now if possible more than ever desirous of doing what be right have not yet acquired sufficient fear of doing wrong be fundamental error of mind arose in great measure from early education mother died when be very young though father have supplied place in best kindest manner have insensibly infused into daughter mind portion of enterprising independent spirit justly deemed essential to character of brother brother be year older than cecilia have always be favourite companion of youth what father precept inculcated example enforced even cecilia virtue consequently became such a be more estimable in man than desirable in female small object small error have be taught to disregard a trifle impatient disposition be perpetually leading into more material fault yet candour in confessing have be suffered to believe be sufficient reparation atonement leonora on contrary who have be educated by mother in manner more suited to sex have character virtue more peculiar to female judgment have be early cultivated good sense employed in regulation of conduct have be habituated to restraint a woman be to expect in life early accustomed to yield compliance in seemed natural graceful yet notwithstanding gentleness of temper be in reality more independent than cecilia have more reliance upon own judgment more satisfaction in own approbation though far from insensible to praise be not liable to be misled by indiscriminate love of admiration uniform kindness of manner consistency equality of character have fixed esteem passive love of companion by passive love mean that specie of affection make unwilling to offend rather than anxious to oblige be more habit than emotion of mind for cecilia companion felt active love for be active in showing love to active love arises spontaneously in mind after feeling particular instance of kindness without reflection on past conduct general character exceeds merit of object be connected with feeling of generosity rather than with sense of justice without determining specie of love be more flattering to others can easily decide be most agreeable feeling to own mind give heart more credit for being generous than for being just feel more self complacency when give love voluntarily than when yield a tribute can not withhold though cecilia companion might not know in theory proved in practice for loved in much higher proportion to merit than loved leonora of young judge be to signify choice by putting red white shell into vase prepared for purpose cecilia colour be red leonora white in morning nothing be to

care of louisa leonora want of exertion to overcome disagreeable feeling of sensibility often deprived of presence of mind prevented being so constantly useful a cecilia cecilia on contrary often made too much noise bustle with officious assistance be too anxious to invent amusement procure comfort for louisa without perceiving that illness take away power of enjoying a be sitting in window in morning exerting to entertain louisa heard voice of old pedlar who often used to come to house down stair ran immediately to ask mr villars permission to bring into hall mr villars consented away

impatiently ran by without seeming to mind of companion almost wished to turn back let who be tempted to do wrong by hope of future gratification prospect of certain concealment impunity remember that unless be totally depraved bear in own heart monitor who will prevent enjoying what have ill obtained in vain cecilia ran to rest of companion to display present in hope that applause of others must restore own self complacency in vain saw flora pas in due pomp from hand to hand viewing with other in extolling beauty of gift generosity of giver cecilia be still displeased with with even with
