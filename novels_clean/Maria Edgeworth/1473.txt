took liberty of stopping pointing to wreck of mr berryl curricle now standing in yard began statement of friend grievance appeal to common justice conscience unknowing nature of man with whom have to deal imagined must be irresistible mr mordicai stood without moving muscle of dark wooden face indeed in face there appeared to be muscle none must move so that though have what be generally called handsome feature there be together something unnatural shocking in countenance when at last eye turned lip opened seemed to be done by machinery not by will of living creature from impulse of rational soul lord colambre be so much struck with strange physiognomy that actually forgot much have to say of spring wheel be matter whatever have said must have come to same thing mordicai must have answered a now did beir be partner made bargain not hold bound by for be sleeping partner only not empowered to act in way of business have mr berryl bargained with must have told that must have

waiting to know sum of friend misfortune fat jolly falstaff looking personage came into yard accosted mordicai with degree of familiarity from gentleman appeared to lord colambre to be almost impossible 'how be mordicai good fellow cried speaking with strong irish accent 'who be ' whispered lord colambre to foreman who be examining curricle terence o'fay sir there must be entire new wheel

'as soon a possible sir terence ' sir terence in tone of jocose wheedling expostulation entreated to have carriage finished out of hand now mordy precious let have by birthday come dine with o ' monday at hibernian hotel there be rare one will ' mordicai accepted invitation promised faithfully that suicide must be finished by birthday sir terence shook hand upon promise after telling good story made one of workman in yard irishman grin with delight walked off mordicai first waiting till knight be out of hearing called aloud 'you grinning rascal mind at peril let that there carriage be touched d see till further order one of mr mordicai clerk with huge long feathered pen behind ear observed that mr mordicai be right in caution for to best of comprehension sir terence o'fay principal too be over head ear in debt mordicai coolly answered that be well aware of that estate must afford to dip further that for part be under apprehension knew how to look sharp to bite before be bit that knew sir terence principal be leagued together to give creditor go by clever a be at work trusted be match 'will be so good sir to finish making out estimate for ' interrupted lord colambre 'immediately sir sixty nine pound four perch let see mr mordicai ask ask paddy about sir terence ' said foreman pointing back over shoulder to irish workman who be at moment pretending to be wondrous hard at work however when mr mordicai defied to tell anything did not know paddy parting with untasted bit of tobacco began recounted of sir terence o'fay exploit in evading dun replevying cattle fighting sheriff bribing sub managing cant tricking custodees in language so strange with countenance gesture so full of enjoyment of jest that whilst mordicai stood for moment aghast with astonishment lord colambre must not help laughing partly at partly with countryman yard be in roar of laughter though did not understand half of what heard risible muscle be acted upon mechanically maliciously merely by sound of irish brogue mordicai waiting till laugh be over dryly observed that 'the law be executed in guess sort of way in england from what be in ireland therefore for part desired nothing better than to set wit fairly against such shark that there be pleasure in doing up debtor none creditor must know moment sir if will have moment patience sir if please ' said slow foreman to lord colambre ' must go down pound once more then will let have ' `` ll tell what smithfield continued mr mordicai coming close beside foreman speaking very low with voice trembling with

be lord colambre thought told be friend of mr berryl see incompatibility of assertion sir ' replied lord colambre taking from bewildered foreman unresisting hand account have be so long furnishing 'give leave lord ' said mordicai ' beg pardon lord perhaps can compromise business for friend mr berryl since be lordship friend perhaps can contrive to compromise split difference ' to compromise split difference mordicai thought be favourite phrase approved hibernian mode of doing business must conciliate young irish nobleman dissipate proud tempest have gathered now swelled in breast sir cried lord colambre holding firm paper want favour from will accept of none for friend for ' 'favour lord must not presume to offer must wish if will allow to do friend justice ' lord colambre recollecting that have right in pride to ding away friend money let mr mordicai look at account impetuous temper in few moment recovered by good sense considered that a person be utterly unknown to mr mordicai offence must have be intended to perhaps in what have be said of father debt distress there might be more truth than be aware of prudently therefore controlling feeling commanding suffered mr mordicai to show into parlour to settle friend business in few minute account be reduced to reasonable form in consideration of partner having made bargain by mr mordicai felt influenced in honour

terence feared that if lord colambre be abruptly told whole sum total of debt must never be persuaded to join in selling mortgaging so much of patrimony a must be necessary for payment sir terence thought that young man ignorant probably of business unsuspicious of state of father affair might be brought by proper management to measure desired lord clonbrony wavered between temptation to throw upon generosity of son immediate convenience of borrowing sum of money from agent to relieve present embarrassment 'nothing can be settled repeated 'till colambre be of age so doe not signify talking
