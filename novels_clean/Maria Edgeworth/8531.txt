lady cecilia not that suspected be necessary merely by way of prevention threw in little douceurs of flattery on general part repeated sundry pretty compliment really kind thing have said to of helen always pleased helen at moment must never make what be told said of quite agree with what said to indeed said so very little that absolute discrepancy must be detected between word spoken word reported to have be said still look did not agree with opinion cordiality implied one morning lady cecilia told that general wished that must ride out with must come indeed must try pretty zelica wish of thing told so last night general chancing to come in a spoke lady cecilia appealed to with look almost called upon to enforce request only said that if miss stanley must do honour must certainly be

helen looked at cecilia asked whether have told be not little belle que la vrit lady cecilia blushing slightly poured out rapid protestation that have ever repeated to helen of general saying be perfect truth will not swear to word because in first place be not pretty to swear next because can never recollect anybody word own five minute after have be said partly by playfulness partly by

inviting to taste particular wine thought must like willingly accepted praised though assuredly did not know in least what manner of taste have general now exerted to occupy guardsman in conversation about promotion drew observation from helen yet not slightest indication of having seen heard understood appeared in countenance not least curiosity interest about colonel d'aubigny of one point helen

grace cooled saw that must be mistaken came to just conclusion of old poet that one sink at once to depth of ill ingratitude consider a depth of ill opine therefore that stronger feeling than friendship now operates to detain granville beauclerc in case forgive for own sake with young man must say for sake of society of public good for will end in public life hope present object be worthy of whoever may be have anything more to tell yes must say that when by change in political world lord davenant be again in power have learned if not to be le ambitious at least to show le d who knew

wish lady davenant paused after minute of reflection said confess however have not reason to be quite satisfied with a mother did not attend sufficiently to cecilia early education engrossed with politics left too much to governess at one period to very bad one have done can to remedy have done more perhaps much fear that early neglect can never be completely repaired be however married to man of sense when go to russia will think with satisfaction leave with after expressing how deeply have be interested in that have heard how grateful felt for confidence reposed in helen said must not help wishing that cecilia knew have be just told of lady davenant history if cecilia must know tenderness of mother heart how much le must fear how much more must love must answer purpose replied lady davenant there be person with intrinsic difference of character who explain a will can never understand one beyond certain point nature art forbid spectacle can furnish will remedy certain defect of vision cecilia see a much a can ever see of character see in best light whole of hers so helen dear take advice of scotch proverb proverb be vulgar because usually contain common sense well alone be really very good little friend added keep personal narrative for own use chapter ix be late before reached home helen dressed a fast a possible for general punctual habit required that must assemble in drawing room five minute at least before dinner be coming down private turret staircase led from family apartment to great hall when just at turn in most awkward way possible met gentleman stranger where never stranger have be seen by before running up full speed so that have barely space time to clear out of other way pardon be begged of course manner voice of stranger be particularly gentlemanlike servant followed with portmanteau inquiring into room mr beauclerc be to go mr beauclerc when helen got to drawing room found that not even general be there thought must have time to run up great staircase to lady davenant room tell mr beauclerc be come dear lady davenant mr beauclerc be there made retreat a quickly a possible quantity have be said about awkward way in have thus accidentally met made feel much embarrassed when be regularly introduced at beginning of dinner helen fancied that there be unusual silence constraint perhaps might be so perhaps people be really hungry perhaps mr beauclerc have not yet satisfied general lady davenant however towards end of dinner at dessert be certainly entertaining lady cecilia appeared particularly amused by account be giving of little french piece have seen just before left london called le premiere amour helen might have be amused too that lady cecilia called upon to listen mr beauclerc turning eye upon saw fancied that be put out in story though went on with perfect good breeding yet be evidently with diminished spirit a soon a politeness permitted at close of story to relieve turned to aide de camp on other side devoted seemed to devote to exclusive attention be always tiresome to now more than ever went on when once set going about horse dog while have mortification of hearing almost immediately after seceding that mr beauclerc recovered life spirit of tone be in full delightful enjoyment of conversation with lady cecilia something very entertaining caught ear now then with eye fixed in necessary direction be impossible to make out through aid de camp never ending tediousness thought sitting after dinner never must terminate though be in fact rather shorter than usual a soon a reached drawing room lady cecilia asked mother what be cause of granville delay in town why have come to day after have written be impossible lady davenant answered that have 'trampled a lord chatham did impossibility be not physical impossibility seems be sure hope continued cecilia that none of beltravers set have thing to do with delay yet from word two general let fall be almost sure that have lady blanche be afraid there stopped if be only money difficulty with lord beltravers resumed might be easily settled for beauclerc be rich enough yes said lady davenant rashly generous uncommon fault in day when young men be in general selfishly prudent selfishly extravagant hope said cecilia hope lady blanche forrester will not there paused consulted mother countenance mother answered that beauclerc have not spoken to of lady blanche after putting hope fear question conjecture into possible form direction lady cecilia be satisfied that mother knew more than be great comfort when mr beauclerc reappeared helen be glad that be settled at embroidery frame at furthest end of room a there apart from world felt safe from cause for embarrassment there continued happy till one came to raise light of lamp over head be mr beauclerc a looked up gave foolish little start of surprise then confusion returning with thanks scarce audible eye be instantly fixed on vine leaf be embroidering asked how must by lamplight distinguish blue from green simple not very alarming question did not hear word rightly thinking asked whether wished for screen answered thank lady cecilia laughed covering want of hearing by beauclerc want of sight explained see granville silk card be written upon 'blue ' there can be mistake mr beauclerc made few more laudable attempt at conversation with miss stanley still imagining that be forced must not in return say anything what seemed forced unnatural a unlike usual self a possible lady cecilia tried to relieve must have done better to have let alone for beauclerc be not of french wit opinion that la modestie n'est bonne qu ' quinze an to appeared only graceful timidity helen retired earlier than one else when thought over foolish awkwardness felt a much ashamed a if mr beauclerc have actually heard lady cecilia have said about have seen thought understood reason of confusion at last when lady cecilia came into room before went to bed began with be sure be going to scold deserve be so provoked with worst of be that think will ever get over be afraid will be just a foolish again tomorrow must find in heart to scold to death said lady cecilia be vexed then hesitating studying helen countenance seemed doubtful how to proceed be playing with helen curiosity be really herself perplexed made two three beginning little inconsistent with other mamma be always right with 'coming event really truly 'cast shadow before ' do believe have fatal gift coming ill to know ill said helen what ill be coming after however may not be ill said lady cecilia may be for best yet be shockingly disappointed though declare never formed oh dear cecilia do tell at once what be mean mean that granville beauclerc like men of genius have acted like greatest fool what have done be absolutely must look upon in future a married man helen be delighted cecilia must form farther scheme on account felt relieved from awkwardness dearest helen be well at event cried cecilia seeing cleared countenance comfort be at ease if have caused one uncomfortable evening be sure be consoled for by reflection that mother be right a usual wrong helen continued earnestly remember that be not to be known remember must not breathe least hint of what have told to mamma general something more than astonishment appeared in helen countenance be possible that mr beauclerc doe not tell doe not trust guardian friend a mother said helen will tell will tell not yet perhaps not till be not to see fiance have for reason agreed to be separated for time know exactly surely body may choose own opportunity for telling own secret in fact helen lady understand made point with that nothing must be said of yet to one told to indeed did not tell found out must not deny charged to keep secret must not have told to body living to after said about felt be necessary thought be bound in short thought must set thing to right put at ease at once then with more earnestness again pressed upon helen promise of secrecy especially towards lady davenant helen submitted cecilia embraced affectionately left room quite tired quite happy helen be in bed asleep in few minute not slightest suspicion crossed mind that friend have be telling be not perfectly true to more practised le confiding person perplexity of lady cecilia preface contradiction inconsistency might have suggested doubt be general confidence in friend truth have never yet be seriously shaken lady davenant have always thought prejudiced on point too severe if there have be in early childhood bad habit of inaccuracy in cecilia helen thought long since cured so perhaps be till formed friendship abroad with one who have respect for truth of helen knew nothing in fact till now lady cecilia aberration have be always trifling almost imperceptible error such a only mother strictness miss clarendon scrupulosity must detect must cecilia have ventured upon decided important false assertion except for kind purpose never in life have told falsehood to injure human creature one must foresee might by possibility do harm to living being here be friend very dear friend in awkward embarrassment brought into by mean by little innocent stretching of truth must at once fancied set to right moment idea came into head upon spur of occasion resolved to execute directly be settled between drawing room door dressing room when thus executed successfully with happy sophistry justified to herself after said to though be not absolutely true be ben trovato be a near truth perhaps a possible beauclerc best friend really feared that be falling in love with lady in question be very likely too likely might end in marrying lady blanche forrester on account way be for best that helen must consider a married man must restore helen by one magical stroke to herself release from wretched state in must neither please be pleased a far a good effect upon helen be concerned lady cecilia plan be judicious succeeded admirably wonderful how few word spoken single idea taken out of put into mind can make such difference not only in mental feeling in whole bodily appearance in actual power of perception use of sens when helen entered breakfast room next morning looked moved felt quite different creature from what have be preceding day have recovered use of understanding must hear see quite distinctly first thing saw be that nobody be thinking particularly about now for first time actually saw mr beauclerc have before looked at without seeing really did not know what sort of looking person be except that be like gentleman of have sort of intuitive perception a cuvier must tell from first sight of single bone what animal be what be habit to what class belonged so person early used to good company can by first gesture first general manner of being passive active tell whether stranger even scarcely seen be be not gentleman at beginning of breakfast mr beauclerc have perfect english quiet of look manner with somewhat of high bred air of indifference to sublunary thing yet saying doing be proper for present company yet be done said like one in dream performed like somnambulist correctly from habit unconsciously awakened from reverie moment general clarendon came in asked eagerly general how far be to old forest be first word pronounced like one wide awake must ride there morning be absolutely necessary general replied that did not see necessity when do sir cried beauclerc natural vivacity of young man breaking through conventional manner next moment with humble look hoped that general must accompany look of proud humility vanished from countenance next instant because general demurred beauclerc added will not oblige so far then must go by general seeming to go on with own thought not to be moved by ward impatience talked of review be to be put off at length found that must accompany beauclerc then delighted thanked warmly what be object of essential visit to old forest may ask said lady davenant to see dilapidated house said general to save whole family from ruin cried beauclerc to restore man of first rate talent to place in society pshaw said general why contemptuous exclamation dear general said beauclerc have told again tell thing be impossible said general so hear say sir replied ward till be convinced hold to project what be project granville said lady davenant will explain to when be alone said beauclerc beg pardon be not aware that there be mystery said lady davenant mystery said beauclerc only about lending money to friend to will not consent said general why not sir said beauclerc throwing back head with air of defiance in countenance there be a looked at guardian quick mutable succession of feeling in striking contrast with fixity of general appearance have given reason beauclerc said general be unnecessary to repeat what have said will do good good general when tell that if lend beltravers money to put place in repair to put in state that sister must live in must no longer be banished man useless absentee wanderer abroad must come settle at old forest re establish fortune respectability of family above save own character happiness oh dear general general clarendon evidently moved by ward benevolent enthusiasm paused said that there be many recollection made rather painful to to revisit old forest still must do for beauclerc since nothing seeing place must convince of impracticability of scheme have not be at old forest continued general since be boy since be deserted by owner sadly changed will find in former time forresters be respectable good old english family till second wife pretty silly took fancy for figuring in london where of course be nobody then to make somebody forced husband to stand for county contested election bribery petition election ruinous expense then that beltravers title coming to be to live up to beyond income old story over head shoulder in debt then new story that must go abroad for economy economy cant of who have not courage to retrench at home said lady davenant must said live abroad be so cheap continued general so cheap to leave house to go to ruin cheap education too so good what doe come to cheap provision be for family in many case said lord davenant wife son daughter satan be thy own not in case cried beauclerc can not mean hope can answer for one daughter at least said lady davenant mad de st cimon whom saw abroad at florence know cecilia with whom must not let form acquaintance ladyship be quite right said general beauclerc must not say quite wrong looked suffering know nothing of son pursued lady davenant do said beauclerc be friend thought have be very distressed man that young beltravers said aid de camp if be must not prevent being friend sir said beauclerc of course said aid de camp only asked be man of genius feeling continued beauclerc turning to lady davenant never heard mention lord beltravers before how long have be friend said lady davenant beauclerc hesitated general without hesitation answered three week one day count friendship by day week said beauclerc dear beauclerc said general well must be for if must condescend to such common sense measure rose from breakfast table a spoke rang bell to order horse be prejudiced against beltravers general will think better of be sure when know will think worse of when know suspect replied general suspect since only suspect said beauclerc english condemn on suspicion unheard unseen not unheard said general have heard enough of from report of enemy said beauclerc usually form judgment replied general from report of friend enemy have not honour of knowing of lord beltravers enemy enemy of lord beltravers exclaimed lady davenant what right a to enemy a if be great man person of whom nobody ever heard setting up to have enemy now day candidate for fame must be celebrated set up enemy a must equipage on credit then by easy process of logic make out syllogism thus great man have enemy therefore man who have enemy must be great hey beauclerc beauclerc vouchsafed only faint absent smile turning to guardian asked since lord beltravers be not to be allowed honour of enemy benefit of pleading prejudice on did general form judgment from own word stay judgment dear general cried beauclerc word repeated by whom repeated by one heard from by be not aware have ever met when where beauclerc started forward on chair listened eagerly for answer pity said lady davenant speaking to herself pity 'with such quick affection kindling into flame ' must burn to waste when where repeated beauclerc with eye fixed on guardian soul in eye soberly slowly guardian answered categorically when did meet lord beltravers short time before father death where at lady grace bland at lady grace bland where must not possibly appear to advantage well go on sir one moment pardon beauclerc have curiosity a well a may ask why lord beltravers must not possibly have appeared to advantage at lady grace bland because know can not endure have heard speaking of quote what johnson somebody say of clariss ' prating preaching frail creature good said general said of own aunt aunt can not mean that lady grace be aunt cried beauclerc be mother sister replied general therefore be conceive aunt be so cried beauclerc people must tell truth sometimes even of own relation must know best therefore conclude that what beltravers said of lady grace be true bravo well jumped to conclusion granville a usual said lady davenant go on general tell have heard from precious lord can have better than what beauclerc own witness give in evidence better think in same line said general lordship have merit of consistency at table servant of course present stranger heard lord beltravers begin by cursing england inhabit 'but country ' remonstrated aunt abjured england have country said liberal man ever have have relation what nature gave without consent have right to disclaim think argued can swear to word with concluded bey father be idiot mother brute sister may go to devil own way such bad taste said aid de camp lady davenant smiled at unspeakable astonishment in helen face when have lived one season in world dear child power of surprise will be worn out even to who have seen world said aide de camp who have seen world a strike really be such extraordinary bad taste such ordinary bad taste a strike said lady davenant base imitation imitation be always confession of poverty want of original genius then there be degree among race of imitator choose original well come near tolerably here seems equally bad clumsy birmingham counterfeit think so beauclerc counterfeit fall make noise there be worst of for protg whose great ambition be sure be to make noise in world however may spare remonstrance for be quite aware that must never let drop friend never never cried beauclerc then dear granville take up man lord beltravers for depend upon will never do if have made bold stroke for reputation like great original sported deed without name to work upon wonder loving imagination of credulous english public one might have thought something of cowardly negative sin not honouring father mother so commonplace too neutral tint effect quite failure one can not even stare know granville object of strange speech be merely to make fool stare to be wonder of london world for single day be great ambition of ephemeral fame hunter 'insects that shine buzz fly blow in setting sun ' beauclerc pushed away tea cup half across table exclaiming how unjust to class among tribe detests despises a much a can lady davenant for one unfortunate speech not quite fair general not quite philosophical lady davenant to decide on man character from specimen of single speech be like judging of house from sample of single brick time know how beltravers came to make speech know how be a well a if have be present better better cried lady cecilia lady gentleman may laugh resumed beauclerc seriously maintain better how better than general who be present heard saw whole said lady cecilia yes better for saw only effect know cause appeal to lady davenant from lady davenant sarcastic to lady davenant philosophic appeal may not man who discovers cause say know more than who merely see effect may say know more at event replied lady davenant now for discovery of cause metaphysical sir have done cried general turning to leave breakfast room when beauclerc go to metaphysics give up give up dear general cried lady cecilia stir till have heard what will come next for be sure will be something delightfully absurd beauclerc bowed feared must not justify ladyship good opinion for have nothing delightfully absurd to say adding that cause of friend appearing like brute be that feared to be hypocrite among hypocrite lord beltravers be in company with set who be striving with might of dissimulation to appear better than be a always doe strove to make appear worse than really be unnecessary must think said lady davenant impossible must think said general impossible know be to change opinion general of one said beauclerc for own part be glad of said lady cecilia rising advise granville to rest content with general opinion of yourself say more said beauclerc one can not be content to think only of one self always say more say more

of sad scrape once at own expense can never forget have never met since left eton till about three week ago in town when found in great difficulty persecuted too by party must not turn back on must rather be shot immediate necessity for being shot dear granville hope said lady davenant if be indeed will never say word against lord beltravers will leave to to find out character to time to show will be quite satisfied that throw away money if be only money be in question be lord beltravers what may let say 'or let do be one to ' provided that doe not marry to sister have not thought of cried beauclerc if have do conceive lady davenant that man on earth must dispose of in marriage at pleasure hope not said lady davenant be assured not own will own heart alone must decide that matter horse

right just in conclusion if wrong there be setting right for not only must not must not go back over ground must not give in word explanation of process of reasoning be enough for that be right that be while beauclerc who cared not for man opinion be always so ingeniously wrong must show step of reasoning so plausibly that be pity must be quite out of right road at last general hated metaphysics because considered a taking flight beyond reach of discipline a well a of common sense continually asked of what use be while lady davenant answered to invigorate embellish understanding 'this turning soul inward on concentrate force fit for strongest boldest flight in such pursuit whether take whether lose game chase be certainly of service ' possibly general said must not dispute point with lady davenant losing chase however invigorating be one in never wished to engage a to rest altogether hated discussion doubt questioning have made up fagot of opinion must not let one be drawn out for

strongly attached to own undeviating rule of right be upon one occasion about peremptorily to interpose not only with remonstrance a friend with authority a guardian occurred when beauclerc be with at florence when general love for lady cecilia intimacy with mother commenced lady davenant being much interested for young beauclerc begged that patient might be left to that guardian must refrain from interference be agreed to more readily by general a thought feeling be then more agreeably engrossed beauclerc found in lady davenant very friend wanted wished for most ardently one whose mind must not blench at moral danger must never shrink from truth in shape calm self possessed must examine whether be indeed truth only phantom assuming form besides there be in lady davenant towards beauclerc

from prejudice to be justified to be indulged by getting rid of restraint of principle have there be danger of sort with young men who profess ultra liberal be usually case must have joined in guardian apprehension in fact beauclerc instead of being le philosophe sans le savoir be le bon enfant sans le savoir for while questioned rule of right in principle while be held in abeyance good

beauclerc about dean stanley how helen be heiress heiress having determined to give up fortune to pay uncle debt there be guardian too in case who must not consent in short parallelism of circumstance

constantly among young people at clarendon park made want of spirit more disagreeable to herself more obvious more observed by others lady katrine rallied unmercifully not suspecting truth ladyship presumed that miss stanley repented of having before be asked said instead of yes to mr churchill ever since departure have evidently worn willow lady cecilia be excessively vexed by ill natured raillery conscious that have be cause of annoyance to helen of much more serious evil to zeal tenderness of affection now increased be shown upon little occasion involuntarily in manner continually irritated cousin katrine jealousy helen have be used to live only with by whom be beloved be not at prepared for sort of warfare lady katrine carried on perpetual sneer innuendo bitter sarcasm helen did not resent felt arrow ill aimed weak must not penetrate far be not with point wounded by venom wherever touched worked inward mischief often to escape from one false imputation exposed to more

through quadrille said to one standing by miss stanley danced charmingly to taste in such lady like manner be glad to see in good spirit again colour be raised observed that looked remarkably well yes lady katrine answered remarkably well black be so becoming to sort of complexion doubt be reason miss stanley wear so much longer than be customary for uncle short long mourning be to be sure just according to fashion feeling a say for part hate long mourning so like ostentation of sentiment did at rate must be consistent never must dance in black pope know have such good cut at sort of thing do recollect line bear about mockery of woe to midnight dance public show ' lady castlefort took miss stanley aside after dance be over to whisper to so good naturedly how shockingly severe katrine have be faithfully repeating word that sister have said so cruel to talk of bearing about mockery of woe sweet little lamb let distress so helen withdrawing from false caress of lady castlefort assured that must not be hurt by thing lady katrine must say a so little understood real feeling at moment spirit rose against injustice felt a much superior to such petty malice a even lady davenant must have desired have resolved to continue in mourning for longest period in be worn for parent because in truth uncle have be parent to morning after lady katrine cruel remark cecilia begged that helen must oblige by laying aside black let be on birthday lady cecilia birth day be to be celebrated ensuing week well for day certainly will helen said only for day must not satisfy cecilia helen saw that lady katrine observation have made serious impression dreading to become subject of daily observation perhaps altercation yielded mourning be thrown aside then thing wore must be new lady

cecilia taste in dress be exquisite first general principle be admirable whatever buy let be best of kind be always cheapest in end second maxim be never have anything from such such people from such such place naming who be at moment accredited by fashion of course make pay high for name of thing must be name be said lady cecilia doe hat bonnet whatever be come from reigning fashionable authority then be right be quite right can put down objection objector with magic of name need think more about dress have trouble while poor creature who go toiling rummaging in cheap shop what come of total exhaustion disgrace yesterday now dear helen recollect when lady katrine after dinner asked little miss isdall where bought that pretty hat poor girl be quite out of countenance beally did not know only knew be very cheap ' saw that nobody must endure hat afterwards so cheap a might be be money to intent purpose absolutely thrown away for did not answer purpose helen laughing observed that if

mere matter of opinion association of idea so forth when will learn to reason a mamma say make despair of thus half in jest half in earnest with truth falsehood sense nonsense prettily blended together lady cecilia prevailed in overpowering helen better judgment obtained hasty submission in economy a in moral false principle be far more dangerous than one single error one false principle a to laying out money be worse than bad bargain can be made because lead to bad bargain innumerable be settled that helen wanted must be purchased not only from who sold best good from certain very expensive house of fashionably high name in london next point lady cecilia insisted upon be that helen dress must always be same a own know used to be so dear helen when be child let be so now there be such difference now said helen can not afford difference oh talk of difference let there be none ever between not afford nonsense dear expense will be nothing in day get material of dress

must not resist thought that must not refuse without vexing cecilia from sort of sentimental belief that be doing cecilia real kindness that be what cecilia called sisterly act yielded to what knew be unsuited to circumstance to what be quite contrary to better judgment often so happens that friend doubly guard one obvious point of weakness while exists undiscovered by unknown to ourselves lady davenant have warned helen against danger of indecision coquetry with lover danger of extravagance in dress have not foreseen into how much expense one weak compliance must lead helen must not calculate have fancied that at least till went to town must not want anything expensive be great mistake formerly in england a still in other country england marked difference be made in style of dress in country in town formerly overdressing in country be reprobated a quite vulgar now even person of birth fashion be guilty of want of taste sense display almost a much expensive dress in country a in town happened that among succession of company at clarendon park summer there came invited from royal party in neighbourhood certain wealthy lady by called golconda by others duchess of baubleshire be passionately fond of dress eclipsed rival in magnificence variety of ornament at imminent peril of being robbed brought to country carried about everywhere with amazing number of jewel

unanimously that nobody must change dress at dinner time golconda appeared in splendid necklace displayed over riding dress when be reproached with having broken through general agreement not to dress replied that really have put thing on in greatest hurry without knowing well what be just to oblige little page who have brought three set of jewel for choice have chosen most undressed of three merely because must not disappoint poor little fellow one saw affectation folly above vulgarity of display who be most envious be most eager to comfort by ridicule never be golconda out of hearing lady katrine be ready with instance of absurd vanity if fortune have blessed with such jewel lady katrine said trusted must have worn with better grace did not appear that taste for bauble be diminished by ridicule thrown upon contrary be plain that laugher be only envious envious because must not be envied lady cecilia who have envy in nature who be really generous entered not into vain competition on contrary refrained from wearing of jewel because helen have none besides simplicity be really best taste general said so be well thought well done for time there be little lurking love

to present of more value helen scrupled to receive yet oft to refuse never once offend be not so easily done a said especially with lady cecilia be so urgent so caressing have so many plausible reason suitable to occasion on general birthday lady cecilia naturally wished to wear first gift to pair of beautiful pearl bracelet then helen must have same helen thought that roman pearl must do quite a well for have seen such excellent imitation that eye must detect difference eye very likely still own conscience dear replied lady cecilia if people ask whether be real what must say know there be

word have helen said must ponder well continued cecilia make out list of worthy concordatum party helen much advised consulting lady davenant first lady cecilia feared mother might be too proud to consent to advance on own part helen still feared that bringing together such discordant people must never succeed lady cecilia always happy in paying with word answerable to wish replied that discord well managed often produced finest harmony only point feared be that must not gain first step that must not be able to prevail upon general to let give invitation in truth required persuasive word more persuasive look to accomplish preliminary to bring general clarendon to invite permit to be invited to clarendon park person whom knew little liked not at all a lady cecilia pleaded urged that must soon be over whole will be over in three day only three day visit for mamma be sure clarendon will do anything for for papa own cecilia general smiled note be written invitation be accepted when once general clarendon have consented be resolutely polite in reception of to unwelcome guest manner be not false be only properly polite not tending to deceive one who understood token of conventional good breeding however required considerable power over to keep line of demarcation correctly with one person in particular to whom have strong political aversion mr harley very name be abhorrent to general clarendon who usually designated a genius cecilia that favourite of mother while to lady davenant mr harley be only person from whose presence anticipated pleasure who must make rest of party to endurable helen though apprehensive of what might be ultimate result of congress yet must not help rejoicing that must now have opportunity of seeing of who be usually considered high a human veneration can look be easy after one know who be who to determine that must have found out characteristic quality talent in countenance lady cecilia however must not tell helen name of celebrated unknown who be assembled when went into drawing room before dinner endeavoured to guess from conversation different character of speaker only few sentence be uttered signifying nothing snuff box be presented pinch taken inclination made with becoming reciprocity physiognomy of snuff box helen must not interpret though lavater asserts thing in nature even cup of tea have physiognomy dinner be announced company paired off seemingly not standing on order of going yet especially a be stranger secretly mindful of honour moved on in precedence just found in place due at dinner table helen did not seem likely to obtain more insight into character of great personage in dining room than have done in drawing room for often happens that when most celebrated even most intellectual person be brought together expressly for purpose of conversation then doe not flow sink to silence end at last in stagnation of utter stupidity seems oppressed with weight of own reputation in pride of high celebrity shyness real affected of high rank fear to commit by single word people of opposite party when thrown together can not at once change whole habit of mind without effort refrain from abuse of opposite in be accustomed to indulge when have to now subject seems laboured for in pedantry of party spirit partisan will speak in slang cant of own craft knowledge be not only at one entrance at entrance quite shut out even literature grows perilous so that to be safe must be dumb lady cecilia clarendon be little aware of what undertook when called together heterogeneous assembly of uncongenials dissimilars round dinner table after have in vain made what effort must well skilled in throwing ball of conversation have thrown again again without rebound from side felt that be flat that silence stupidity be absolutely invincible helen must scarcely believe when tried afterwards to recollect that have literally day during whole of first course heard only following sentence came out at long interval between couple of question answer observation acquiescence have shower yes think so very fine weather have have only too hot quite new building at marblemore be getting on lord know did not come way whom have now at dunstanbury be next question then in reply came slowly list of fashionable name sir john died worth million say yes martyr to gout have lady rachel done

assistance of several of brother artiste of present day redeem country from one half of abb gregoire reproach abb have said that england must be finest country in world that want two essential sunshine cook good good very voice from different side of table pronounced there be silence again at dessert however after servant have withdrawn most people began to talk little to next neighbour by helen profited not for pair spoke low who be beside on hand be not disposed to talk be seated between sir benjamin bearcroft mr harley sir benjamin man of law mr harley man of genius eminent in kind of law seemed to have nothing in law of be very full in sir benjamin economy of human life be wholesome rule practised invariably to let understanding sleep in company that might waken in court for repose needed not what great men have professed so much to like pillow of woman mind helen did not much regret silence of great legal authority be very sorry that man of genius did not talk did not expect to speak to wished to hear converse with others something be matter with from moment sat down to dinner helen saw seemed discomfited first put hand across eye then pressed forehead feared have bad headache hand went next to ear with shrinking excruciating gesture must be earache thought helen presently jaw be pinched together toothache perhaps at last detected disturbing cause opposite to mr harley beside lady davenant sat person whom must not endure one in first place of opposite party be nothing man who be in mr harley opinion disgrace to party what must bring here have have several battle in public have never before met in private society aversion of mr harley seemed to increase inversely a square of distance helen must not see in object adequate cause for antipathy gentleman looked civil smiling rather mean quite insignificant really be a insignificant a appeared not of consequence in point of view be not high in office ambassador charg d'affaires not certain that be attach even be said to have ear of somebody be reputed to be secretly employed in diplomatic transaction of equivocal character disclaimed used by superior courted by timid inferior whom have persuaded of great influence somewhere lady cecilia have be assured from good authority that be one who ought to be propitiated on father account now when perceived what sort of creature be sorely did repent that have be invited mother by whom sat seemed quite oppressed nauseated so ended dinner a lady cecilia passed general in going out of room looked contrition acknowledgment that be perfectly right in prophecy that must never do chapter ix be rather worse when lady be by of party be personally stranger to lady davenant have heard of sufficiently most have formed formidable false opinion of helen be quite astonished at awe ladyship inspired in stranger lady davenant appearance manner at moment be not indeed calculated to dispel dread be unusually distant haughty from mistaken sort of moral pride aware that of person now before have in various way by own husband mean power to serve to injure lord davenant disdained to propitiate by slightest condescension how person in england in london must be stranger to lady davenant be to foreign lady who be present matter of inexpressible surprise must not understand how wife of person high in political life of opposite of same party must often be personally stranger to other foreigner be on first coming to england apt to imagine that who act together in public life must be of same private society while on contrary often happens that lady especially of same party be in different grade of fashion moving in different orbit number of different circle orbit in london be indeed astonishing to stranger manner in though touching at tangent keep own path attracted repelled mutually influential be to who have not seen studied planisphere absolutely incomprehensible a pondered on difficulty ambassadress foreigner a be unused to silence spoke not one spoke nought be heard cup on saucer spoon in cup buzzing of fly in window in midst of awful calm be that lady bearcroft blurted out with loud voice amazing entertaining be so many clever people got together too for what be worth while to have seen lady masham face at moment lady bearcroft saw fearing mortal struck with comic of look of lady masham burst into laughter uncontrolled contrast of dignity gravity in lady davenant only made laugh more till out of room at last ran lady masham while of course never betrayed slightest idea that must by possibility have be object of lady bearcroft mirth lady davenant how did take to daughter infinite relief quite quietly looked rather amused than displeased bore with lady bearcroft altogether better than must have be expected because considered only a person unfortunately out of place in society without fault of own dragged up from below to height of situation for nature have never intended art education have ever prepared whose fault deficiency be thus brought into flash of day at once before malice of party fastidiousness of fashion know not to distinguish between manque d'esprit manque d'usage not so lady davenant made liberal philosophic allowance for even fault of manner be most glaring further suspected that lady bearcroft purposely exaggerated own vulgarity partly for diversion partly to make people stare partly to prevent seeing what be habitual what involuntary by hiding bound of reality of lady masham have not most distant conception on contrary be now prepared to tell variety of odd anecdote of lady bearcroft have seen said extraordinary person before have never met in society delighted be unexpectedly to find here quite treat such character be indeed seldom met with at certain height in atmosphere of society such be peculiarly justly lady masham delight for relieved at same time fed sense of superiority insufficient to person be fair privileged safe game lady masham began a doe reviewer determined to be especially severe with bit of praise really very handsome lady bearcroft must have be yes a say lady cecilia be not out of blow yet certainly only too full blown rather for taste fortunately not for sir benjamin married know long ago for beauty be very correct person always be do repeat strangest thing say so very odd tell such curious story too of thing doe lady masham then detailed variety of anecdote related chiefly to lady bearcroft household care never must with haste despatch then came story of cheap magnificence extraordinary toilette expedient own continued lady masham always thought description heard must be exaggerated one be compelled to acknowledge that there be here in reality terrible want of tact poor sir benjamin quite pity must so see though not of first water yet still must feel when see lady bearcroft with other people have feeling though nobody must guess from look show too be told sadly annoyed be sometimes by malapropoisms one day at one end of table at other ladyship in loud voice called out to beir benjamin sir benjamin be wedding day ' poor man did not hear called out again louder beir benjamin dear day fifteen year ago be married ' dear ' answered dear how can possibly help now pleased with success of anecdote raised general smile lady masham vouched for perfect correctness have from one who heard from person who be actually present at time happened lady davenant have not least doubt of correctness of story believed name of party be different have heard year ago of person often happens a observed to who make notoriously ridiculous a to who become famous for wit that good thing in kind be attributed to though one may have claim to witticism other may not be responsible for absurdity for have reputation required lady masham politeness to look pleased candour to be quite happy to be set right a to last anecdote many have heard of lady bearcroft be really incredible yet one must almost believe anything of while be yet speaking lady bearcroft returned malicious enemy leaning back in chair a if in expectation of piece beginning waited for puppet to play be played off time lady cecilia be not at ease well aware what mother must feel have felt while lady masham be going on with gossip talk have stood between ladyship lady davenant a lady masham did not speak much above breath cecilia have for time flattered that laudable endeavour to intercept sound to prevent sense from reaching mother ear have succeeded especially a have made a many exclamation a must of really indeed how extraordinary say so a pronounced might have excited curiosity of commonplace people knew must in mother mind deaden desire to listen however lady masham have raised voice from time to time have stretched neck of snow beyond lady cecilia intercepting drapery so a actually to claim lady davenant attention consequence daughter heard felt heard tap tap tap of ivory folding knife upon table well interpreting knew even before saw mother countenance that lady masham have undone herself what be of much more consequence have destroyed chance of accomplishing reconciliation with mamma projected coalition be to have be of such ultimate advantage to papa notwithstanding lady bearcroft want of knowledge of great world have considerable knowledge of human nature stood wonderfully in stead have notion of being made sport of for lgantes with lady masham plausibility of persiflage never obtained end never elicited anything really absurd by attempt to draw out out must not be drawn after unconquerable silence semblance of dead stupidity lady bearcroft suddenly showed sign of life however at once began to talk to helen of people why because have taken in own phrase monstrous fancy to miss stanley be not

mean whist party be made lady cecilia took care that sir benjamin must win while lost with best grace possible by conciliating manner good management in dividing to govern party be arranged to general satisfaction mr harley antipathy attach settled at ecart with lady masham who found quite well mannered pleasant person lady cecilia explained to mr harley that be fault mistake entirely that person have be invited mr harley be now again happy in conversation with lady davenant beside whom found place on sofa after helen have done duty at harp piano forte cecilia relieved whispered that might now go to mother sofa rest be happy mamma work be in puzzle helen must go set to right dear lady davenant welcomed with smile made room for on sofa made over to tambour frame now that helen saw heard mr harley in natural state must scarcely believe that be same person who have sat beside at dinner animated delightful be now what particularly liked in there be display nothing in churchill style whenever one came near seemed to wish to hear speak mr harley not only gave fair play helped in play helen observed that possessed art have often remarked in lord davenant peculiar to good natured genius art of drawing something good out of body sometimes more than knew have in till be brought out even from lord masham insipid soulless though be a courtier lord in waiting must be something be extracted lord masham universally believed to have nothing in be evening surprisingly entertaining gave lady davenant description of what have be so fortunate a to see first public dinner of king of france on restoration served according to ci devant ceremonial in etiquette of louis fourteenth time lord masham represented in lively manner marquis de dreux in antiquarian glory going through whole

nothing received timely relief by new turn given to conversation in be not thought called upon to take share question indeed appeared to irrelevant retiring to card table left discussion to abler question be why bow to nef at led to discussion upon advantage of ceremonial in preserving respect for order reverence for authority then came inquiry into abuse of real good be observed that sign of time must always be consulted must guide in thing how far be next to be considered agreed on principle that 'order be heaven first law ' yet there be in application strong shade of difference between who took part in conversation on one side be thought that overturning tabouret at court of france have be signal for overthrow of throne while on other hand be suggested that rigid adherence to form unsuited to temper of time only exasperates that reliance on form be implicit be apt to lead prince counsellor to depend too much on strength of fence existing only in imagination be powerless when fashion change in court quite surrounded enveloped by old form light of day can not penetrate to interior of palace eye long kept in obscurity be weakened so light can not be borne when suddenly break

general quoted punctuality be virtue of prince mr harley with usual impatience of genius must have ridiculed so antiquated notion to lady cecilia surprise even took part of punctuality in very edifying manner distinguished from mere ceremonial etiquette ceremonial of german court where lose time at breakfast at dinner at supper at court in antechamber on stair everywhere punctuality be thought habit worthy to be ranked with virtue by effect upon mind power demand give of self control raising in daily hourly sense of duty of something ought must be done one of best habit human creature can have for own sake sake of with whom live to king courtier more particularly because give idea of stability of duration to aged because give sort of belief that life will last for ever

mother how happy be how comfortable be card table be really necessary of life not even music be more universally useful mr harley said doubt then arose between lady davenant argument upon comparative power in modern society of music card mr harley took side of music lady davenant inclined to think card in day day be not over yet have have wider range of influence nothing like happy board of green

leave trace behind began now to be very impatient for beauclerc appearance always sanguine a rapid in conclusion a be precipitate in action felt doubt no anxiety a to future for though refrained from questioning helen a to sentiment for beauclerc be pretty well satisfied on subject helen be particularly grateful to lady cecilia for forbearance being almost ashamed to own even to herself how exceedingly happy felt now that be no longer wrong in to love dishonourable in to wish to be loved be surprised to find how completely idea of beauclerc be connected with interwoven through thought pursuit sentiment have certainly be constantly in company for several month whole summer must scarcely believe that during time must have become so necessary to happiness while with still increasing

year since woman be now so highly cultivated political subject be at present of so much importance of such high interest to human creature who live together in society can hardly expect helen a rational being can go through world a now be without forming opinion on point of public importance can not conceive satisfy with common namby pamby little missy phrase 'ladies have nothing to do with politics helen blushed for be conscious that wrong right namby pamby little missy not have hitherto satisfied very comfortably with such thought depend upon helen resumed lady davenant that when be married love for man of superior ability of superior character must elevate mind to sympathy with pursuit with subject claim attention helen felt that must become strongly interested in subject in man loved be interested still observed that have not ability information like lady davenant must justify in attempting to follow example besides helen be sure that even if have must not suit taste besides in truth did not think well suited to woman stopped when came to last thought what kindness respect suppressed be clearly understood by penetrating friend fixing eye upon helen said with smile candour nobleness of character rising above little irritation of temper agree with dear helen in say be to begin life over again conduct must in respect be different of public danger private personal inconvenience may result from woman becoming politician a better express meaning interfering with public affair one can be more aware than be interfering observe say for must mark keep line between

window rang bell for lady davenant own woman sent page for lady cecilia in few moment lady cecilia elliott came neither be a much alarmed a helen have expected must be have seen lady davenant under similar attack knew what remedy to apply elliott be remarkably composed steady person now went on doing be necessary without speaking word paroxysm lasted longer than usual a lady cecilia observed though continued assurance to helen that be nervous only nerve began evidently to be alarmed at length symptom of returning animation appeared then cecilia retired beckoning to helen to follow into next room have better leave mamma to elliott will be happier if think know nothing of matter then recollecting that helen have be in room when attack came on added must go back for mamma will remember that be present take a little notice however a possible of what have happened cecilia said that mother when be abroad have be subject to such seizure at interval in former time before be born believe

once quite vexed with for barely suggesting idea there cried cecilia hear voice go to helen followed lady cecilia suggestion took a little notice a possible of what have happened elliott disappeared a entered page be waiting at door to helen satisfaction lady davenant did not admit not yet tell will ring when want said door closed lady davenant turning to helen said whether live die be point of consequence to friend who love there be question helen of far more importance to trust to question be whether continue to live a have lived honoured respected live die dishonoured despised eye glanced towards letter have be reading poor child continued lady davenant looking at helen agitated countenance poor child will not keep in suspense then told helen that be suspected of having revealed secret of state have be confided to husband be supposed truly supposed that lord davenant have told to beyond political importance disclosure involved charge of baseness in having betrayed confidence having suffered copy of letter from illustrious personage to be handed about read by several people lord davenant a yet know nothing of effect upon be what most dread can not show continued opening again letter have just received because concern others a well a be at event under obligation can never be forgotten to person who gave timely notice must no otherwise have reached person to whom be thus obliged be one helen whom like whom cecilia particularly dislike miss clarendon manner of doing service be characteristic begin beiss clarendon be aware that lady davenant have liking for that will not prevent miss clarendon from doing what think act of justice towards noble character falsely attacked ' lady davenant read more have not better wait till be stronger dear lady davenant said helen seeing prepare to write be once said gloriously well replied lady davenant that duty of life be more than life so think while wrote helen thought of what have just heard ventured to interrupt lady davenant to ask if have formed idea of mean by secret must have be betrayed copy of letter obtained yes have suspicion of one person diplomatist to whom mr harley have shown mortal antipathy recollected that last morning congress have sat in lord davenant cabinet have left writing desk there letter be in thought that have locked desk when have left room certainly be fast when returned

like mr mapletofft lord davenant secretary manner please said have perfect confidence in integrity helen felt admired generous candour suspicion be not of diplomatist alone thought of one who might perhaps have be employed by carlos page many circumstance recollected put together now strengthened suspicion wondered have not occurred to lady davenant thought must that did not choose to mention have often heard lady davenant particular friend complain that be extremely disagreeable to to have boy constantly in room might be conversation there be page before behind screen always within hearing lady davenant said that a carlos be portuguese have never be in england till have brought over few month before must not understand english well enough to comprehend what be going on be doubted especially by helen who have watched countenance have represented doubt reason for to lady davenant be not convinced be one of few point on must justly be reproached with adhering to fancy instead of listening to reason more carlos be attacked more adhered to in fact be not so much because be favourite a because be proteg be completely dependent upon protection have brought to england have saved from mother profligate camp follower have freed from most miserable condition possible have raised to easy happy confidential life to generous having conferred obligation be in tie hard to sever noble minded people believe in fidelity never doubt of gratitude throw own soul into oblige think feel for a in situation must think feel lady davenant considered injustice to doubt attachment of boy cruelty deemed to suspect causelessly of being most base of human creature young defenceless orphan helen have more than once offended by attempting to stop lady davenant from speaking imprudently before carlos be afraid even at moment to irritate by giving utterance to doubt determined therefore to keep to herself till have positive ground for suspicion resolved to watch boy very carefully presently having finished letter lady davenant rang for helen eye be upon carlos moment entered thought did not escape observation be wrong helen said lady davenant a lighted taper to seal letter if be not right said helen keeping eye upon boy changing countenance be too suspicious observe be not right at instant in thinking that countenance be bad lady davenant must not see that countenance change in extraordinary manner in spite of effort to keep steady cause that of complain said going on sealing letter deliberately in court of public justice in private equity word equity pronounced with austere emphasis how often be change of countenance misinterpreted sensibility of innocence can not bear to be suspected be often mistaken for confusion worse confounded of guilt helen observed that a lady davenant spoke spoke in favour boy countenance cleared up that vacillating expression of fear consciousness of having something within unwhipt of justice completely disappeared whole air be now bold open towards helen almost air of defiance what do think be cause of change in countenance observe do not asked helen yes cause be a plain a change see suspect though do seeing helen that have at least one friend in world who will do justice orphan boy take courage wish must be a good a be dearest lady davenant said helen can not help still feeling saying doubt now observe while speak will turn eye away that terrible look may not confound say know that suspect do how doe know how said lady davenant by universal language of eye not only by universal language think said helen suspect understands word say helen without ever looking up from bunch of seal be rubbing bright slowly very distinctly added think that can speak read write english change in countenance of carlos appeared notwithstanding effort to hold feature in same position instead of placid composure there be now grim rigidity give great seal with coat of arm on said lady davenant dropping wax on letter watching boy eye a spoke without looking towards seal have described never stirred helen began to fear be unjust suspicious again doubt at least of disposition occurred a be passing through lady davenant dressing room with when be going down to dinner page following helen caught figure in mirror saw that be making horrible grimace at behind back dark countenance expressing extreme hatred revenge helen touched lady davenant arm before eye must be directed to glass carlos perceiving that be observed pretended to be suddenly seized with cramp in foot obliged to make frightful contortion helen be shocked by artfulness succeeded with lady davenant be in vain to say more about to so helen let pas when mentioned afterwards to lady cecilia said be sorry for sake helen that happened depend upon revengeful little portuguese gnome will work mischief time other helen did not think of indeed must not imagine mean by must possibly work woe face be so horrible that came again again before eye be more more determined to watch carlos constantly be one of public day at clarendon park on there be good deal of company many of neighbouring gentry be to be at dinner when lady davenant appeared inquiry concerning health be made by daughter by general allusion to having be unwell seemed quite recovered helen observed that particularly exerted that manner be more gracious than usual to

exclaimed meanness corruption ingratitude too favour forgotten to see to feel be common fate of who have lived life have lived of be not so inconsistent a to complain be hard that own character integrity of whole life must avail nothing yet added after moment pause of reflection to how few can character be really known woman can not like men make character known by public action have right to complain if lord davenant honour be to be paused thought seeming too painful for utterance completed arrangement of paper a pressed down lid of writing box heard closing sound of lock said now may sleep in peace put out lamp went to bed room carrying with two three book intended to read after must be in bed for though talked of sleeping be plain thought must not helen prevailed upon to let

emotion be much mistaken have not strong feeling strong imagination can affirm from own experience that be perfectly natural lady davenant rapidly mentioned instance of sort recollected seeing anxiety of helen look added be afraid that be feverish wish to rest then go on reading to helen read on till lady davenant declared must not let sit up longer only before go dear child look here at what have

figure with head head dress perfect profile of old woman with turned up chin appeared at first helen must not see at last caught be struck with same sort of curious effect of chance resemblance coincidence painter leonardo da vinci in particular have observed in moss stain on old stone observed lady davenant struck to night helen perhaps because be little feverish struck in new point of view moral not picturesque if such be effect of chance of coincidence how cautious must be in deciding from appearance pronouncing from circumstantial evidence upon guilt of evil design in human creature

say more pendule striking at instant two o'clock stopped abruptly kissed helen sent away helen gathered together carried away with book that lady davenant might not be tempted to look at more a have several piled on one arm have taper in hand be somewhat encumbered though managed to open bed room door to shut again without letting of book fall crossed little ante room between bed chamber dressing room safely yet a be opening dressing room door taking too much too little care of part of pyramid of book down came whole pile with noise in stillness of night sounded tremendous be afraid must

leaned on be surprised to hear click of lock closing sound be so peculiar must not be mistaken besides thought have felt lid give way under pressure there be key left in lock perfectly recollected very sound of click when lady davenant shut lid down before leaving room night stood looking at lock considering how must be a remained perfectly still heard thought heard one breathing near holding in own breath listened cautiously looked round without stirring from place where stood one of window curtain moved so at least thought yes certainly there be living thing behind might be lady davenant great dog looking again at bottom of curtain saw human foot page carlos be instant suspicion vengeful face came before vision of stiletto did not well know what trembled over yet have presence of mind enough to recollect that must not seem to take notice while moved about book on table gave look saw that foot be not withdrawn knew be safe still have not be perceived that have seen now what be to do go up to curtain draw back face boy did not dare yet be only boy might be man not page better go call somebody tell lady davenant must go through antechamber pas close to curtain to open door be thought of one moment went on holding up light to book shelf a if in quest of book kept coasting along to gain door be afraid when be to pas window curtain of touching of stumbling over foot got past without touching stumbling opened door whisked through be done too quickly must not help shut bolted door ran across ante chamber to lady davenant bed room entered softly aware of danger to of sudden alarm lady davenant be not asleep be not alarmed be effective in moment first asked did lock door after yes bolted be well of said who do think be knew what other thought returned through ante chamber

gallery be unlocked simple thing appeared that helen in confusion have thought only of fastening door into ante chamber also opened on gallery have totally forgotten to lock that from dressing room into gallery by have be in room have escaped without difficulty lady davenant rather inclined to believe that one have be there that be helen imagination helen persisted that have seen what have seen heard what have heard went into gallery silence creature visible door at end of gallery locked outside after fruitless search retired lady davenant to own room helen to hers full of shame regret that have not have courage to open curtain at right moment nothing must stir belief however in evidence of sens boy must have be there must be still concealed somewhere in gallery in of room opening into of be unoccupied be locked up a lady davenant have told when have proposed searching one two tried found fastened stood at own door after having put down candle on table still giving lingering look out when through darkness in gallery at further end saw ray of light on floor seemed to come from under door of room unoccupied mr mapletofft room have gone to town with lord davenant helen went on tiptoe very softly along gallery almost to door when suddenly opened page stood before lamp in hand shining full on face on hers started then be motionless for one second recovering instantly shot

commanding carlos to open door immediately must not open make answer servant came general ordered one to go round to window of room lest boy must escape way be too late have escaped when door be forced one of window be found open carlos be not in room must have swung down from height by mean of tree be near window lamp be still burning paper half burnt smouldering on table there be sufficient remains to tell what have be lady davenant saw in handwriting of carlos copy of letter taken from desk one half unburnt cover of packet have be making up showed by direction to whom be to have be sent there be few line in boy own writing within side addressed to employer revealed whole employer be a lady davenant have suspected diplomatist duplicate bramah key be found under table recollected that have month ago missed duplicate key of desk supposed have dropped from watch ring while out walking recollected further that carlos have with great zeal assisted in search for through shrubbery walk proof of boy artifice long premeditated treachery accumulating upon lady davenant shocked so much that must not think of anything else be possible be in human nature exclaimed such falsehood such art such ingratitude a fixed eye upon writing scarcely yet dry repeated be writing see yet can scarcely believe who taught to write guided that little hand to make first letter that ever formed be in human nature must not have conceived be dreadful to be so convinced lower one confidence in one fellow creature be worst of sighed deeply then turning to helen said let think more of to night can do more be in pursuit of hope may never never see more chapter xiii people value friend most for active service for passive kindness be won by tender expression convinced by solid proof of regard others of yet nobler kind of sort be lady davenant be apt to be best pleased most touched by proof that own character have be thoroughly understood that have justly appreciated good quality of friend more than by kindness sympathy helen have ever before shown her be now pleased touched by respect for feeling in affair of page helen never having at moment of detection afterwards by word look indulged in self triumph of see how right be implies see how wrong be on contrary gave what comfort honestly must by showing that knew from what humane motif generous feeling lady davenant have persisted in supporting boy to last a to little wretch appeared more search be made for in direction be not to be found helen thought be well that lady davenant must be spared pain of seeing hearing more about whole mystery be now solved difficulty for lady davenant in fair way to be ended have felt instinctive aversion to fawning tone of diplomatist whom have suspected of caballing against lord davenant secretly be now proved that have be base beyond what must have conceived possible have be in confederacy with boy whom have corrupted purchasing from copy of private letter bribing to betray benefactress copy of letter from illustrious personage have be thus obtained proof now brought home to guilty person deprived at once of future mean of injuring lord davenant completely in power must be ready to ensure silence at price instead of caballing further low intriguer must now be compelled to return from whence came too happy to be permitted to retreat from situation quit england without being brought to public disgrace notice of report have be in private circulation against lady davenant having yet appeared in public print be possible to prevent mischief even mention of name in such affair must have occasioned be necessary however that letter must be written immediately to different person whom private report have reached helen daughter trembled for health in consequence of extreme hurry fatigue repeated favourite maxim better to wear out than to rust out accomplished be to be done lord davenant wrote in triumph that be settled difficulty removed be to set out for russia

believe helen looked at helen believed chapter xv helen slept more night when alone in stillness of long hour went over over again have passed what cecilia have said what have at first thought afterwards felt persuasion by have be wrought upon on contrary reason by ought to be decided backward forward mind vibrated painful vacillation must not be stilled what be going to do to tell falsehood can not be right in circumstance yet be cecilia own way of palliating fault that mother so fear in that mother trusted to to guard against now already even before lady davenant have left be going to assist cecilia in deceiving husband on very dangerous point colonel d'aubigny lady davenant foreboding having already be so far accomplished struck helen fearfully warning voice in dead silence of night sounded look be upon so strongly that for instant hid head to get rid of image what can do own life be at stake le motive must move ought must will decide yet if lady davenant be to know in last hour have to pas with last ever may have with will deceive be not deceit only prudence necessary prudence what physician must order what even humanity requires be satisfied be quite right quite will go to sleep may be strong calm do well in morning after have be too cowardly frightening about nothing too scrupulous for what be have promised only to receive letter a if be not to say that be mine will not ask cecilia think will not ask how can tell if must what can do must then answer that be mine indeed be same thing for must lead to believe a much by receiving in silence will be telling acting absolute falsehood can that ever be right back came to same point in vain cheek settled on pillow thought must sleep then with closed eye considered how general must look speak not speak what will think of when see picture letter for must open packet will not read be too honourable know what be in there can be nothing however nonsense cecilia say yet even so love letter must know be clandestine correspondence heard once express such contempt for clandestine affair who be so nice so strict about woman conduct how will sink in esteem well be so that concern only be for own sake too to save happiness cecilia dear cecilia oh can bear will be pride to to bear for be grateful gratitude will not be only in word now when be put to trial can do something for friend yes will let consequence be what may yet beauclerc that thought be at bottom of heart fear almost certainty that way other way in must think of must lead to difficulty with beauclerc fear be mere selfishness thought to counteract came generous grateful long cherished romantic love of sacrifice belief that be capable of self devotion for friend loved upon strength of idea fixed at last quieted soothed to repose worn out with reasoning trying to reason in vain at last in spite of morning light dawning upon through unclosed shutter in soft sort of enthusiastic vision fading away fell asleep slept long

must soon be over lady davenant must be safe then must bear rest next hoped that perturbation extraordinary emotion in must not be observed in hurry of departure must be thought natural at parting with lady davenant so then come at turn to little deceit thought must must sighed be sad thing for ma'be lady davenant going away said maid helen sighed again very sad indeed suddenly thought darted into mind that whole danger might be avoided hope came that general might not open packet before lady davenant departure in case cecilia must not expect that must abide by promise a be only conditional have be made really on mother account cecilia have said that if once mother be safe out of house must then must very next day tell whole to husband helen sprang from under hand of maid a

beauclerc declared that though helen have entered into explanation be perfectly satisfied general answered be glad be satisfied beauclerc perceived that general be not in spite of that have just be saying to provoked disgusted theory of own mind if not quite false be still little at variance with practice guardian opinion swayed powerfully whenever believed that be not designed to influence when

increased hour lady cecilia be disturbed even by perfect confidence happiness of beauclerc manner towards helen must not fear that have guessed truth seemed a if everything happened tended to confirm in suspicion for whenever mind be strongly interested on subject something alluding to seems wonderfully yet accidentally to occur in everything that read hear in common conversation so now happened thing be continually said by person wholly unconcerned seemed to bear upon secret lady cecilia frequently felt with pang of confusion shame remorse though beauclerc did not watch play spy upon

intended event asking for good bishop sanction a guardian regretting that must not perform ceremony have received from lady davenant few line written just before sailed warm with enthusiasm of ardent heart full of expectation that helen lot must be one of happiest world must afford seemed indeed to smile upon prospect only cloud dimmed sunshine be cecilia insincerity feeling that general thought acting unhandsomely unwisely towards ward consoled with thought that must not judge of what did not know that did not deserve displeasure that granville be satisfied if be why must not general clarendon be so too much more serious however be pain felt on cecilia account reproached with betraying trust lady davenant have reposed in dreadful prophecy seemed now accomplishing cecilia natural

contrary be at present subject to under cloud of distrust saw in bad light thing occurred same appearance in wife must have attributed to sensibility of true feeling interpreted in helen a consciousness of falsehood proof of cowardly duplicity went back at once to original prejudice against when a first thought have be forced upon in preference to own sister have be afterwards convinced that have be perfectly free from double dealing yet now slid back again a people of character often do to first opinion thought so at first find a usually do that first thought be right what have be adverse feeling be now considered a prescient judgment did not go upstairs quicker for thought calmly coolly when reached lady cecilia dressing room knocked at door with precaution necessary to prevent from being alarmed told what have happened have better not go down dear cecilia beg will not miss stanley have own maid assistance can be wanted dear be not fit for desire will not go down lady cecilia must not listen must not be detained escaped from husband ran down to helen excessively alarmed be well might be knowing to be cause not certain in way how might end found little

moving about felt a if too near wished away wanted air must not say what wished must have moved limb must not obey will at last when have with effort half raised head sunk back again before must distinguish person in room shock of cold water on forehead revived then coming clearly to power of perception saw cecilia bending over still must not speak yet understood distinctly saw affectionate anxiety too in little maid rose countenance felt that loved rose that must not endure felicie who have now come in be making exclamation advising various remedy of when offered helen declined be not merely that felicie talking tone of voice superabundant action be too much for that helen have at moment sort of intuitive perception of insincerity of exaggeration in dreamy state hovering between life death in people be on coming out of swoon seems a if there be need for firm hold of reality sens understanding join in struggle become most acute in perception of what be natural what be unnatural true false in expression feeling of by stander lady cecilia understood look dismissed felicie with smelling bottle rose though not ordered away judiciously retired a soon a saw that service be of further use that there be something upon young lady mind for hartshorn sal volatile must be of avail cecilia must have kissed forehead helen made slight withdrawing motion turned away face next

resistance powerful reaction under disappointment grief must ill make allowance for feebler health spirit perhaps feebler character for great misfortune have great sympathy must not enter into detail of lesser sorrow especially of sentimental kind be apt to class altogether under head sorrow of lord plumcake expression have sovereignly taken fancy aunt did not relish quite understand mr pennant be indeed a complete contrast to niece in point a nature habit joined must produce be naturally of most exquisitely sympathetic mimosa sensibility shrinking expanding to touch of others joy woe instead of having by long use worn out have preserved wonderfully fresh in advanced year notwithstanding contrast seemingly incompatible difference between aunt niece foundation of character being good sound true lived on together well loved other dearly have seldom differed so much on point a in present case a to treatment of patient guest scarcely day passed in did not come to mutual remonstrance sometimes when be by be not pleasant to a may be imagined yet perhaps even little altercation annoyance though tried helen temper grieved heart at moment be of use to upon whole by drawing out of

though have commanded never to attempt to see again have not be able to command own mind since mr churchill be so much better expect that will soon be pronounced out of danger expect that mr beauclerc will come over come here be at foot expect nothing said helen in faltering voice then added resolutely can not foresee what mr beauclerc may do of be assured miss clarendon that until stand a once
