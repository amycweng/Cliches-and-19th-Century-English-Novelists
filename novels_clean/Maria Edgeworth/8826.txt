importance ca see there said forester suddenly rousing observing that dr campbell daughter miss flora campbell be standing behind have not better sit down in chair want because can see over head sit down archibald smiled at forester simplicity in paying awkward compliment to young lady who have according to mode of estimating least pretension to notice of one present flora campbell be rich beautiful have happy mixture in manner of scottish sprightliness english reserve have eager desire to improve whilst nice sense of propriety taught never to intrude upon general notice to recede from conversation with air of counterfeit humility forester admired ability because imagined that be only person who have ever discovered a to manner never observed even whilst ridiculed politeness be anxious to find out what thought polite after have told that knew concerning fossil a be produced from cabinet be far from ignorant at length perceived that knew full a much of natural history a did be surprised that young lady must know so much must not be conceited flora however soon sunk many degree in opinion for after cabinet of mineralogy be shut of company talked of ball be to be given in few day flora with innocent gaiety said to forester have learnt to dance scotch reel since came to scotland cried forester with contempt do think height of human perfection to dance scotch reel then fine young laird mr archibald mackenzie will suit much better than will forester returned to arm chair desert island key be unfortunate that forester retired from company in such abrupt displeasure at flora campbell question for have borne idea of scotch reel more like philosopher must have heard of something interesting relative to intended ball if thing relative to ball must be interesting to be charity ball for benefit of mistress of very charity school to little girl with bruised hand belonged do know said henry to forester when returned home have great hope will be able to get justice done to poor child hope tyrannical schoolmistress may yet be punished lady with whom drank tea yesterday be one of patroness of charity school footnote there be charity school of description in edinburgh can not therefore be mistaken for private satire lady patroness cried forester need not expect justice from lady patroness depend upon especially at ball head will be full of feather such thing

forester see what be to be brought up in lap of luxury why be not at tired must walk dozen mile further without being in least fatigued henry thought very good thing to be able to walk number of mile without being fatigued did not consider a highest perfection of human nature in friend present mood nothing le must content forester went on to demonstrate to weary henry that fortitude courage manly virtue be inseparably connected with pedestrian indefatigability henry with good natured presence of mind perhaps friend must have called mean address diverted hero rising indignation by proposing that must go look at large brewery be in way home with forester must thought be entertained brewery fortunately turned course of forester thought instead of quarrelling with friend for being tired condescended to postpone further debate forester have from childhood habit of twirling key whenever be thinking intently key have be produced have be twirling upon accustomed thumb during argument upon address be still in forester hand when went into brewery a looked listened key be essential to power of attending at length a stopped to view large brewing vat key unluckily slipped from thumb

sycophant flowerpot eager to prove that be not sycophant forester when returned home with friend henry took possible occasion to contradict with even more than customary rigidity nay went further still to vindicate sincerity flora campbell have never entirely recovered hero esteem since have unwittingly expressed love for scotch reel be happily unconscious of crime have committed be wholly intent upon pleasing father mother brother henry have constant flow of good spirit charming domestic talent of making trifle source of amusement to herself others be sprightly without being frivolous

take down word when must again be heard distinctly resumed a follows be not surprised at testimony of admiration burst from warm heart of majesty subject be only surprised that heart must be found in dominion on whom such magnanimity must make impression be shocked be grieved when find such heart in person of count laniska can be believed that in course of one short month after generous pardon that young nobleman proved basest of traitor traitor to king who be friend benefactor daring no longer openly to attack attempted secretly to wound fame of sovereign of know what degree of liberty even licence frederick great permit to specie of satirical wit with populace delight to ridicule ruler at instant there be various anonymous pasquinade on garden gate at sans souci must have provoked resentment fatal resentment of other monarch upon earth can not be doubted that author of thing must easily be discovered if king condescended to make inquiry concerning can not be doubted that king have power to punish offender yet remain untouched perhaps unknown sovereign be not capable of feeling petty emotion of vulgar spleen resentment must not be insensible to treacherous ingratitude of one whom imagined to have be attached to by tie of kindness of duty that count laniska must choose instant when king be showing unusual favour to make favour instrument of base malice be scarcely credible yet prussian incredible a sound to be true here be proof here be witness mr warendorff at instant uncovered prussian vase then pointed to jew to master of porcelain manufactory who stood

be stiff eye moved with incessant celerity from side to side seemed uneasy at not being able to see what be passing behind there be certain firmness in attitude voice trembled when attempted to speak circumstance prepossessed laniska friend against jew moment appeared be justly observed that having misfortune to be jew be sufficient to prejudice many of populace against even before word uttered

nothing truth made following answer to question put to by mr warendorff mr warendorff did ever see vase before solomon yes mr warendorff where when tell know about to gentleman of jury solomon first time saw that vase be in gallery of painting at king palace of sans souci to best of recollection be on night of first day of month about ten o'clock perhaps might be eleven wish to be exact can not be certain a to hour precisely mr warendorff exact hour be not of consequence proceed tell how came to see vase take time to speak be in hurry truth will appear sooner later solomon majesty put vase into hand commanded to pack up with other china be going to send a present to gentleman at paris be something of judge of china being used to selling small piece of up down town country so be struck with first sight of beautiful vase looked at very carefully wiped away with handkerchief dust have settled on white figure here be very handkerchief wiped vase over when came to rub bottom stopped to read verse on character of frederick great having read rubbed white letter quite clean ground on be written be blue found that of blue colour came off upon handkerchief surprised good deal upon examining further perceived that colour came off only in one spot of about inch long inch broad king be at time standing with back to looking at new picture have just be hung up in gallery hearing make exclamation abraham ' believe be that said majesty turned round 'what be matter with solomon look wondrous wise ' majesty be pleased to say 'why do call on father abraham at time of day do expect that will help to pack up that china hey solomon friend have power to answer question for by time to utter astonishment have discovered that on spot where have rubbed off blue paint there be word written word be tyrant 'on character of frederick great tyrant ' said to myself 'what can mean ' king snatched vase from hand read what have read saw paint have be rubbed off upon handkerchief without saying one word left gallery be know about matter jew bowed to court mr warendorff told that having closed evidence might depart albert rose to desire that judge must order to remain in court a purposed to examine according to english term to cross examine further at proper time judge ordered jew to remain in court next witness called on part of crown be master of porcelain manufactory of berlin to whom mr put following question q have seen verse be inscribed on foot of vase answer yes have q do recollect what word be written over verse answer do word be character of frederick great tyrant q do know by whom word verse be written answer believe that be written by count augustus laniska q how do know why do believe answer be present when sophia mansfeld woman by whom vase be designed told count that did not know how to write that must be obliged to if must write inscription on vase at time have not be put into furnace be in what call biscuit count laniska took proper tool said that must write inscription a desired saw writing on bottom of vase for minute heard afterward call to one of workman desire that must put vase into furnace workman accordingly carried into next room to furnace a believe q did see inscription on vase after be taken out of furnace be word then on answer did not see vase immediately upon being taken out of furnace saw about hour afterward at time read inscription word 'tyrant be not then visible on vase place where now appears be blue carried along with others to king palace at sans souci night of first day of month majesty sent for showed word tyrant on vase have never seen there till then must not have be written after china be baked must have be written whilst biscuit be soft must have be covered over with blue paint after vase be taken out of furnace believe word be written by count laniska because saw nobody else write upon vase because word exactly resembles handwriting of rest of inscription because upon former occasion heard count make use of very word in speaking of frederick great here master of porcelain manufactory finished speaking be going with mr warendorff permission to retire albert signified intention to cross examine also judge commanded that must remain in court two next witness who be produced examined be workman who carried vase to furnace man whose business be to put biscuit into furnace neither of witness must write read workman deposed that carried prussian vase a be desired to furnace that one touched on way thither man whose business be to put biscuit into furnace swore that put along with several other vas into furnace that attended fire that one touched of till be baked taken out by here evidence for prosecution closed mr warendorff observed that must forbear to expatiate further upon conduct of prisoner that have be ordered by sovereign to speak of with possible moderation that earnestly hoped defence must be made for count laniska might be satisfactory that mode of trial have be granted to by king be sufficient proof of clemency of majesty of earnest desire to allow prisoner possible mean of re establishing character in eye of public albert now rose count laniska who have appeared unmoved during mr warendorff oration changed countenance moment albert rose in defence countess laniska leaned forward over rail of gallery in breathless anxiety there be sound heard in whole gallery except jingling of chain of king sword with be playing will not attempt gentleman said albert to move sympathy by pathetic description of own feeling a man a advocate mine may be be wish duty to repress have need of calm possession of understanding will be necessary to convince yours of innocence of friend to convince be object if be in power must upon present occasion disdain to persuade must think equally incompatible with own honour that of count laniska with sentiment refrain prussian from eulogium upon magnanimity of king praise from traitor from advocate of traitor must be unworthy of great monarch of generous people if prisoner before will be proved to be traitor will doubtless have opportunity of expressing by action better than can by word gratitude to sovereign for having allowed public trial by equal men who be able to discern to assert truth can not have escaped observation that positive evidence have yet be produced against prisoner one have yet be heard to swear that saw count laniska write word tyrant upon vase first witness solomon jew have informed of what sens must not leave room to doubt that word be actually engraved upon porcelain further have told that be covered over with blue paint rubbed off with handkerchief may be true wisdom of solomon united to of baron warendorff have failed to point out to certain connexion between blue paint handkerchief supposed guilt of count laniska master of porcelain manufactory came next apprehended that a being more respectable witness than jew be reserved for to supply link in chain of evidence respectable witness simply swore that heard woman say must not write read that asked count laniska to write inscription upon vase for in consequence of request count wrote something upon vase doe not pretend to know what belief that word tyrant must have be one of word then written by count because saw one else write on vase because hand writing of word resembles rest of inscription because count in hearing have upon former occasion made use of same expression in speaking of king recapitulate evidence to show that be in part positive that rest upon circumstance in order to demonstrate to that word in question must not have be written by person laniska two witness be produced workman who carried vase to furnace who put into fire one have positively sworn that person touched vase on way to furnace other a positively swears that one meddled with vase after be put into furnace be granted that word must not have be engraved after biscuit be baked witness however have not sworn asserted that there be interval of time between receiving vase putting into fire what became of during interval how long did last will witness swear that one touched during interval be question will put to presently hope have established first assertion that have positive evidence of prisoner guilt well know gentleman where positive evidence of supposed fact can not be produced judgment must be decided by balance of probability be for reason that study of probability power of comparing have in late celebrated essay be called science of judge to judge of friend probability of supposed guilt have be stated weigh compare with will produce in favour of innocence education character understanding be in favour count laniska must be much below common standard of human virtue capacity if without assignable motive must have committed action at once so base so absurd a of be accused temper be naturally habitually open impetuous even to extreme imprudence instance of imprudence of manner in be pardoned by king have be stated to be probable that same man must be ingenuous mean be probable that generosity with be treated made impression upon heart heart must upon supposition be selfish unfeeling look up gentleman towards gallery look at anxious mother eager friend must laniska fate excite such anxiety if be selfish unfeeling impossible suppose destitute of generous sentiment can not imagine count laniska to be fool have be lately reminded that be early distinguished for ability by monarch whose penetration can not doubt be high in favour of sovereign just entering upon life military life hope of distinction resting entirely upon good opinion of general king fair expectation sacrifice for what for pleasure must be pleasure for folly of writing single word unless count laniska be supposed to have be possessed with insane desire of writing word tyrant how can account for writing upon vase did wish to convey to france idea frederick great be tyrant man of common sense must surely have found at least safer method of doing so than by engraving a opinion upon vase knew be to pas through hand of sovereign whom purposed thus treacherously to insult extreme improbability that man in situation with character habit capacity of count laniska must have acted in manner amount in judgment almost to moral impossibility knew nothing more gentleman of cause when first offered to defend laniska at hazard of liberty be not merely from enthusiasm of friendship made offer be from sober conviction of understanding founded upon accurate calculation of moral probability footnote voltaire essai sur le probabilits en fait de justice have be good fortune gentleman in course of inquiry have since made to obtain further confirmation of opinion without attempting of specie of oratory may be necessary to cover falsehood must encumber instead of adorning truth will now in simplest manner in power lay evidence before

perhaps must have borne howard be brought to ground beg pardon promise never to interfere between fag more said holloway standing over triumphant ask pardon never said fallen hero will fight again in same cause whenever please ca have better struggled to rise several boy have by time gathered round combatant many admired fortitude spirit of vanquished though be extremely difficult to boy if not to men to sympathize with beaten body called out that howard have have enough for night though be willing to have renewed battle adversary be withheld by omnipotence of public opinion a to cause of combat few inquired into merit many more be content with seeing fray with hearing vaguely that began about howard having interfered with holloway fag in impertinent manner howard face be so much disfigured clothes be so much stained with blood that did not wish to present deplorable spectacle before aunt besides man like to be seen especially by woman immediately after have be beaten therefore went directly to bed a soon a got home desired that one of companion who boarded at mr howard must if aunt inquired for at supper tell that have be beaten in boxing match hoped to be more

do with take at word said howard second battle began a delight in field of battle hope to excel like homer in describing variety of wound will content with relating that after five pitched battle in oliver champion received bruise of shape size of shade of black blue green yellow unconquered spirit still maintained justice of cause with a firm voice a at first challenged constantly victorious antagonist to sixth combat thought have learned by time said successful pugilist that augustus holloway be not to be conquered by one of woman breed to taunt howard made reply whether urged to superior exertion whether dear bought experience of five preceding day have taught caution experience only can teach can not determine to surprise of spectator to lively joy of oliver redoubted holloway be brought after obstinate struggle fairly to ground body sympathized with generous victor who immediately assisted fallen adversary to rise offered hand in token of reconciliation augustus holloway stunned by fall more by defeat returned from field of battle a fast a crowd must let who stopped continually with impertinent astonishment curiosity for though boasted unconquerable hero have pretty evidently received black eye not one person must believe without looking close in face many must not trust information of own sens pressed to hear news confirmed by reluctant lip of unfortunate augustus in meantime little oliver fag no longer exulting in liberty clapped joyful hand sang capered round deliverer now said fixing grateful affectionate eye upon howard will suffer more for if will

attention continually upon lady augusta be delighted to see that waited for elderly lady who at breakfast have said so much in favour of dignity of manner mr mountague did not at moment consider that elderly lady be lord george aunt that attention paid to by lady augusta might possibly proceed from motif of policy not from choice young men of open temper generous disposition be easily deceived by coquette because can not stoop to invent meanness of artifice a mr mountague walked down to river lady augusta contrived to entertain so completely that helen temple never once came into mind though have sense enough to perceive danger have not sufficient courage to avoid sometimes requires courage to fly from danger from agreeable tte tte be roused however by voice of mlle panache who in

passion wonder where miladi augusta thought be wid time said be coming see at end of grove with mr mountague have walked fast oh ca never walk so fast a tink be a young a be dashwood assented at same time pondering upon consequence of attachment saw rising in mr mountague mind for lady augusta if man of sense be to gain influence over dashwood feared that hope must be destroyed resolved to use power over mademoiselle to prejudice by mean to prejudice pupil against gentleman mademoiselle having begun by taking for apothicaire be circumstance much in favour of dashwood view because felt pledged to justify at least to persist in opinion that did not look like un homme comme il faut in mean time mr mountague be walking slowly towards with lady augusta who found necessary to walk a slowly a possible because of heat have be reflecting very soberly upon ladyship late blush according to interpretation said a plainly a blush must say that most refined sense delicacy must dictate yet such be upon occasion inconsistency of human mind that by mean felt sure that lady have blushed at colour be perhaps shade higher than usual then be hot weather have be walking doubt however mr mountague thought proper to suppress reality of blush once thoroughly established in imagination formed foundation of several ingenious theory of moral sentiment truly logical deduction passionate admirer of grace beauty must not help wishing that might find lady augusta temper understanding equal to personal accomplishment when be very anxious to discover perfection in character generally succeed fancy that succeed mr mountague quickly discovered many amiable interesting quality in fair lady though perceived defect excused to with most philosophic ingenuity affectation judicious locke observes have always laudable aim of pleasing upon principle mr mountague must not reasonably think of with severity from desire of pleasing argued proceeds not only be amiable much of what be most estimable in female sex desire lead to affectation coquetry to folly vice only when be extended to unworthy object moment woman wish to please becomes discriminative moment feel attachment to man superior to vulgar herd not only cease to be coquette exerts to excel in thing that approves from versatility of manner have happy power of adapting to taste of becoming that most sanguine wish must desire proof of discriminative taste first symptom of salutary attachment to man superior to vulgar herd mr mountague thought discerned very plainly in lady augusta did ever forget that be eighteen be
