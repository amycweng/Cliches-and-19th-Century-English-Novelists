of have passed between afterwards openness on part have softened heart of mr hill who be really inclined to be good natured provided people must allow that have more penetration than one else in hereford be moreover good deal piqued alarmed by idea that perfumer daughter might rival outshine own whilst have thought sure of mr o'neill attachment to phbe have looked higher especially a be persuaded by perfumer lady to think that irishman must not be bad match now began to suspect that perfumer lady have changed opinion of irishman since did not object to own jenny leading up ball at mr o'neill thought passed rapidly in mother mind with fear of losing admirer for phbe value of admirer suddenly rose in estimation thus at auction if lot be going to be knocked down to lady who be only

jenny brown need not come with hypocritical condoling face to more after running speech glibly off mr hill without waiting to hear syllable from poor phbe trotted off in search of consort be not however quite so easy task a wife expected to bring mr hill round to opinion be slow in declaring of opinion when once have said thing there be little chance of altering notion on occasion mr hill be doubly bound to prejudice against unlucky irishman for have mentioned with great solemnity at club frequented grand affair of hole under foundation of cathedral suspicion that there be design to blow up several of club have laughed at idea others who supposed that mr o'neill be roman catholic who have confused notion that roman catholic must be very wicked dangerous being thought that there might be great deal in verger suggestion observed that very watchful eye ought to be kept upon irish glover who have come to settle at hereford nobody knew why who seemed to have money at command nobody knew how news of ball sounded to mr hill prejudiced imagination like news of conspiracy ay ay thought irishman be cunning enough will be too many for want to throw good sober folk of hereford off guard by feasting dancing carousing take so to perpetrate evil design when be least suspected will be prepared for fool a take plain englishman to be warrant in consequence of most shrewd cogitation verger silenced wife with peremptory nod when came to persuade to let put on limerick glove go to ball to ball will not go charge not to put on limerick glove a value blessing said mr hill please to tell so mr hill trust to judgment discretion in thing mr hill strange work may be in hereford yet will say more must go consult with knowing men who be of opinion sallied forth mr hill be left in state only who be troubled with disease of excessive curiosity can rightly comprehend compassionate hied back to phbe to whom announced father answer then went gossiping to female acquaintance in hereford to tell that knew that did not know to endeavour to find out secret where there be none to be found there be trial of temper in condition lady in high low life must endure with better grace than phbe whilst mr mr hill be busied abroad there came to see phbe one of widow smith child with artless expression of gratitude to phbe little girl mixed praise of o'neill who said have be constant friend of mother have given money week since fire happened mammy love dearly for being so good natured continued child have be good to other people a well a to to whom said phbe to poor man who have lodged for few day past next door to replied child know name rightly be irishman go out haymaking in daytime along with number of others knew mr o'neill in own country told great deal about goodness a child finished word phbe took out of drawer clothes have made for poor woman child gave to little girl happened that limerick glove have be thrown into drawer phbe favourable sentiment of giver of glove be revived by what have just heard by confession mr hill have made that have reason vague suspicious for thinking ill of laid glove perfectly smooth strewed over whilst little girl went on talking of mr o'neill leaf of rose have worn on sunday mr hill be time in deep conference with prudent men of hereford who be of own opinion about perilous hole under cathedral ominous circumstance of ball be also considered great expense at irish glover lived giving away glove be sure sign be not under necessity to sell consequently proof though pretended to be glover be something wrong in disguise upon putting thing together be resolved by over wise politician that best thing must be done for hereford only possible mean of preventing immediate destruction of cathedral must be to take mr o'neill into custody upon recollection however be perceived that there be legal ground on must be attacked at length after consulting attorney devised what thought admirable mode of proceeding irish hero have not that punctuality english tradesman usually observe in payment of bill have preceding year run up long bill with grocer in hereford a have not at christmas cash in hand to pay have given note payable six month after date grocer at mr hill request made over note to be determined that money must be demanded a be now due that if be not paid directly o'neill must be that night arrested how mr hill made discovery of debt to grocer agree with former notion that irish glover have always money at command can not well conceive anger prejudice will swallow down grossest contradiction without difficulty when mr hill clerk went to demand payment of note o'neill head be full of ball be to give that evening be much surprised at unexpected appearance of note have not ready money by to pay after swearing good deal at clerk complaining of ungenerous ungentleman like behaviour in grocer tanner told clerk to be gone not to be bothering at unseasonable time that must not have money then did not deserve to have at language conduct be rather new to english clerk mercantile ear can not wonder that must seem to a said to master more language of madman than man of business want of punctuality in money transaction mode of treating contract a matter of favour affection might not have damned fame of hero in own country where such conduct be ala too common be now in kingdom where manner custom be so directly opposite that must meet with allowance for national fault must be well for countryman if be made even by few mortification somewhat sensible of important
