one of mr mordicai clerk with huge long feathered pen behind ear observed that mr mordicai be right in caution for to best of comprehension sir terence o'fay principal too be over head ear in debt mordicai coolly answered that be well aware of that estate must afford to dip farther that for part be under apprehension knew how to look sharp to bite before be bit that knew sir terence principal

recounted of sir terence o'fay exploit in evading dun replevying cattle fighting sheriff bribing sub managing cant tricking custodees in language so strange with countenance gesture so full of enjoyment of jest that whilst mordicai stood for moment aghast with astonishment lord colambre must not help laughing partly at partly with countryman yard be in roar of laughter though did not understand half of what heard risible muscle be acted upon mechanically maliciously merely by sound of irish brogue mordicai waiting till laugh be over dryly observed that law be executed in guess sort of way in england from what be in ireland therefore for part desired nothing better than to set wit fairly against such shark that there be pleasure in doing up debtor none creditor must know in

friend justice lord colambre recollecting that have right in pride to fling away friend money let mr mordicai look at account impetuous temper in few moment recovered by good sense considered that a person be utterly unknown to mr mordicai offence must have be intended to perhaps in what have be said of father debt distress there might be more truth than be aware of prudently therefore

just sense of own merit of what be becoming due to dignity of sex trusted be visible in manner established in lord colambre mind so that ran risk of being misunderstood by a to what rest of world

lady being older than gentleman might be obstacle very sorry be to find that daughter have so imprudently so unnecessarily declared age still little obstacle might be overcome much greater difficulty in marriage of inferior heiress being day got over thought nothing of then a to young lady own sentiment mother knew better than did understood daughter pride that dreaded to be made object of bargain sale mr broadhurst who with coarseness of mind have rather better notion of love matter than lady clonbrony perceived through daughter horror of being offered to lord colambre through anxiety that nothing approaching to advance on part of family must be made that if lord colambre must advance must stand better chance of being accepted than other of numerous person who have yet aspired to favour of heiress very circumstance of having paid court to at first operated in favour for proved that be not mercenary attention might afterwards show must be sure must be sincere disinterested now let see one in easy intimate kind of way will find dear lady clonbrony thing will go on of own accord better for minding card never minding thing else remember when be young let pas let young people see one

have in term of detestation described dublin such a appeared to soon after union lord clonbrony have painted with convivial enthusiasm such a saw long long before union when first drank claret at fashionable club picture unchanged in memory unchangeable by imagination have remained ever must remain same hospitality of father boasted son found in warmth meliorated refined le convivial more social fashion of hospitality have improved to make stranger eat drink to excess to set before old wine old plate be no longer sum of good breeding guest now escaped pomp of grand entertainment be allowed to enjoy ease conversation to taste of feast of reason that flow of soul so often talked of so seldom enjoyed lord colambre found spirit of improvement desire for knowledge taste for science

one of extraordinary case ought not to pas into general rule that be slight instance of influence of temporary cause from conclusion a to national manner must be drawn happened continued sir james to be quartered in dublin soon after union took place remember great transient change appeared from removal of house of parliament most of nobility many of principal family among irish commoner hurried in high hope to london retired disgusted in despair to house in country immediately in dublin commerce rose into vacated seat of rank wealth rose into place of birth new face new equipage appeared people who have never be heard of before started into notice pushed forward not scrupling to elbow way even at castle be presented to lord lieutenant to lady lieutenant for excellency might have played vice regal part to empty bench have not admitted such person for moment to fill court of former time of hereditary pretension high bred mind manner be scandalized at complained with justice that whole tone of society be altered that decorum elegance polish charm of society be gone among rest said sir james felt deplored change now be over may acknowledge that perhaps even thing felt most disagreeable at time be productive of eventual benefit formerly few family have set fashion from time immemorial thing have in dublin be submitted to hereditary authority conversation though have be rendered polite by example be at same time limited within narrow bound young people educated upon more enlarged plan in time grew up authority fashion forbidding necessarily rose to just place enjoyed due influence in society want of manner joined to want of knowledge in nouveaux rich created universal disgust be compelled by ridicule by bankruptcy to fall back into former place from must never more emerge in mean time of irish nobility gentry who have be living at unusual expense in expense beyond income be glad to return home to refit brought with new stock of idea taste for science literature within latter year have become fashionable indeed indispensable in london that part of irish aristocracy who immediately upon first incursion of vulgarian have fled in despair to fastness in country hearing of improvement have gradually taken place in society assured of final expulsion of barbarian ventured from retreat returned to post in town so now concluded sir james find society in dublin composed of most agreeable salutary mixture of birth education gentility knowledge manner matter see pervading whole new life energy new talent new ambition desire determination to improve be improved perception that higher distinction can now be obtained in almost company by genius merit than by air address so much for higher order now among class of tradesman shopkeeper may amuse lord with marking difference between person of same rank in london lord colambre have several commission to execute for english friend made amusement in shop to observe manner habit of people remarked that there be in dublin two class of tradespeople one who go into business with intent to make occupation for life a slow sure mean of providing for family class who take up trade merely a temporary resource to condescend for few year trusting that will in time make fortune retire commence re commence gentleman irish regular men of business be like other men of business punctual frugal careful so forth with addition of more intelligence invention enterprise than be usually found in englishman of same rank dublin tradesman pro tempore be class by begin without capital buy stock upon credit in hope of making large profit in same hope sell upon credit now if credit can obtain be longer than be forced to give go on prosper if not break become bankrupt sometimes a bankrupt thrive by such men of course short cut to fortune be followed whilst habit requires time to prove advantage be disregarded with such view can character for punctuality have just value in head of man who intends to be tradesman to day gentleman to morrow idea of honesty duty of tradesman of honour accomplishment of gentleman be oddly jumbled together characteristic of be lost in compound will oblige will not obey will do favour will not do justice will do anything to serve particular thing order neglect asks pardon for must not for good in warehouse disoblige not for sake of custom have particular regard for family economy in eye of such tradesman be if not mean vice at least shabby virtue of be too polite to suspect customer to be proud of proving superior many london tradesman after making thousand ten

continued mad de coulanges like rich english can afford to be generous be persuaded that mr somers be a rich a russian princess yes a rich a russian princess with superb diadem of diamond remember at

difference between buche of mad vanderbenbruggen charming princess be a dull a mad vanderbenbruggen morning vivacious countess having once seized upon idea of mad vanderbenbruggen charming princess fine diamond be time before emilie must recall to order of day to recollection of banker failure of necessity of giving answer to generous mr somers decision of mad de coulanges be probably at last influenced materially by gay idea of star duke sweeping train associated with mad vanderbenbruggen image countess observed that after style in have be used to live in first company at paris must be worse than death to be buried alive in obscure country town in england that must rather see emilie guillotined at once than condemned with grace talent to work like galley slave at tambour frame for bread day of life emilie assured mother that must cheerfully submit to much greater evil than of working at tambour frame that a far a own feeling be concerned must infinitely prefer living by labour to becoming dependent therefore intreated that mother might not from false tenderness for emilie decide contrary to own principle wish mad de coulanges after looking in glass at length determined that must be best to accept of mr somers generous offer emilie who usually contrived to find something agreeable in mother decision rejoiced that by determination mr somers at least must be pleased mr somers indeed be highly gratified expression of satisfaction be so warm that body must have thought be person receiving instead of conferring great favour thanked emilie in particular for having vanquished mother false delicacy emilie blushed at hearing undeserved praise assured mr somers merit be mother what cried mr somers hastily be contrary to opinion be treacherous be enemy mlle de coulanges emilie replied that have left decision to mother that confessed have felt reluctance to receive pecuniary obligation even from mr somers that have rather be obliged to than to body in world except to mamma explanation be not perfectly satisfactory to mr somers there be marked coldness in manner towards emilie during remainder of day affectionate grateful disposition made extremely sensible to change when retired to own room at night sat down beside bed shed tear for first time since have be in england mr somers happened to go into emilie room to leave message for mad de coulanges found emilie in tear inquired cause be touched flattered by sensibility kissed blamed herself confessed have be extremely unreasonable acknowledged that temper be naturally too hasty susceptible especially with loved assured emilie that have be first must be last quarrel rash promise considering circumstance in be placed who receive who confer great favour be in difficult situation part of benefactor be most difficult to support with propriety what combination of rare quality be essential for purpose amongst others sense delicacy temper mr somers possessed last unluckily be not sensible of importance of deficiency confident proud that upon grand occasion where human heart be put to trial must display superior generosity disdained attention to minutia of kindness be inconvenient to friend because occasion for great sacrifice of heart occurs perhaps once in life whilst small sacrifice of temper be requisite day hour footnote since be written author have seen same thought so much better expressed in following line that can not forbear to quote since trifle make sum of human thing mis'ry from foible spring since life best joy consist in peace ease few can save serve may please oh let th'ungentle spirit learn from hence small unkindness be great offence large bounty to bestow wish in vain may shun guilt of giving pain sensibility by mr h more mr somers have concealed from mad de coulanges from emilie full extent of obligation told that sum of money offered have become useless to because have be destined to purchase of superfluity be now in possession of person fact be that have be in treaty for two fine picture guido correggio picture might have be hers on morning when heard of failure of banker of mad de coulanges have hastened to prevent money from being paid for be extremely fond of painting have long earnestly desired to posse celebrated picture so that have really made great sacrifice of taste of vanity for time be satisfied with own self complacent reflection presently began to be displeased that mad de coulanges emilie did not see full extent of sacrifice became provoked by want of penetration in not discovering that studiously concealed mind going on rapidly from one step to decided that want of penetration arose from deficiency of sensibility one day of visitor who be admiring taste with have newly furnished room inquired for what two compartment be intended looking at compartment have be prepared for famous picture mr somers replied that have not yet determined what must put there glanced eye upon mad de coulanges upon emilie to observe whether felt a ought to do mad de coulanges imagining that appeal be made to taste decidedly answered that nothing must have so fine effect a handsome looking glass such added a have at paris house be furnished without be absolute necessary of life doubt place be originally intended for mirror said mr somers dryly with look of great displeasure madame la comtesse place be not originally intended for looking glass countess secretly despised mr somers for want of taste being too well bred to dispute point confessed that be judge that knew nothing of matter then immediately turned to abbe asked if remembered superb mirror in mad de v charming house on boulevard be said in opinion one of very best house in paris there enter principal apartment by antechamber such a ought to see in great house with real ottomanes covered with buff trimmed with black velvet then pas through spacious salle manger delightful saloon hung with blue silk to bijou of boudoir look out upon garden with window shaded by most beautiful flowering shrub in summer in winter adorned with exotics then see through plate glass door of boudoir into gallery of painting call gallery be in fact delightful room not gallery where be not to perish in cold whilst admire magnificence of place not at be warmed by large stove may examine fine picture at ease a english must say in comfort gallery must have cost m de v immense sum connoisseur say that be really best collection of flemish picture in possession of individual in france by bye mr somers there be amongst others excellent van dyck portrait of charles first when boy wonder that none of rich english have purchased countenance of mr somers have clouded over more more during speech heedless countess went on with usual volubility yet doubt m de v must not sell van dyck must be told part with superb collection of print cost of pound must look for purchaser amongst polish russian prince who have nothing to do with rich for instance friend lewenhof who complained that be not able to spend income in paris that must not contrive to give entertainment cost money enough what can do better than commence amateur then might throw away money a fast a heart must wish m l'abbe why man of letter write directly advise to for good of country what figure print must make in petersburgh how must polish russian a good frenchwoman ought to wish to remain at paris certainly can not be better than where be true cried emilie can not be better than where be in possession of generous friend used to love to see mad de v in midst of fine thing of thought so little very look be enough to make one happy radiant with good humoured benevolence be sure one might always salute mad de v with chinese compliment 'felicity be painted in countenance ' be compliment must not be paid to mr somers at present instant for countenance be a little expressive of felicity a must well be imagined emilie who suddenly turned saw be so much struck that became immediately silent there be dead pause in conversation mad de coulanges be only unembarrassed person in company be very contentedly arranging hair upon forehead opposite to looking glass mr somers broke silence by observing that in opinion there be occasion for more mirror in room added in voice of suppressed anger did originally intend to have filled unfortunate blank with something more to taste mad de coulanges be too much occupied with ringlet to hear heed speech mr somers fixed indignant eye upon emilie who perceiving that be offended yet not knowing by what looked embarrassed simply answered did reply seemed a neutral a word must make be uttered not only with pacific with intimidated tone incensed mr somers beyond measure put finishing stroke to whole conversation have be said about elegant house antechamber mirror picture amateur throwing away money generous mad de v who be always good humoured mr somers fancied be meant for decided that be absolutely impossible that emilie must be so stupid a not to have perfectly understood that compartment have be prepared for guido correggio have so generously sacrificed total want of feeling of common civility evinced by emilie reply be astonishing be incomprehensible more reflected upon word more of artifice of duplicity of ingratitude of insult of meanness discovered in in cold fit of ill humour lady be prone to degrade a monster below standard of humanity whom in warmth of enthusiasm have exalted to state of angelic perfection emilie though aware that have unwittingly offended be not aware how low have sunk in friend opinion endeavoured by playful wit caress to atone for fault to reinstate in favour playful wit caress be aggravating crime be proof of obstinacy in deceit of callous conscience of heart be not to be touched by marked displeasure of benefactress three day three night did displeasure of mr somers continue in full force manifest by variety of sign be lost upon mad de coulanges be intelligible to poor emilie made several attempt to bring on explanation by saying be not well be thing matter dear mr somers question be always coldly answered by be perfectly well thank mlle de coulanges why must imagine that thing be matter with at end of third day of reprobation emilie who must no longer endure state resolved to take courage to ask pardon for unknown offence night went trembling like real criminal into mr somers dressing room kissed forehead said hope have not headache a have have headache be sorry for said mr somers must take something for will take will take nothing except forgiveness forgiveness astonish mlle de coulanges be sure ought to ask if have said word must possibly give reason to imagine be angry really be not conscious of such thing if will point out to can not imagine come to accuse dear mr somers attempt even to justify be convinced that if be displeased can not be without reason still tell how have shown violent displeasure have not to best of recollection said angry hasty word when love people know when be offended without saying hasty word manner have be so different towards three day past manner be very unfortunate be impossible always to keep guard over manner be sufficient think to guard word pray guard either with said emilie for must thousand time rather that friend must say look most angry thing than must conceal from what thought for then know might displease continually without knowing perhaps lose esteem affection irretrievably before be aware of danger with with to whom owe so much touched by feeling manner in emilie spoke by artless expression of countenance mr somers anger vanished exclaimed have be to blame ask pardon emilie have be much to blame have be very unjust very ill humoured see be quite wrong see be quite mistaken in what imagined what did imagine said emilie that must excuse from telling said mr somers be too much ashamed of too much ashamed of besides be sort of thing must not well explain if be to set about in short be silliest trifle in world assure that if have not loved very much must not have be so foolishly angry must forgive little infirmity of temper know heart be a must be emilie embraced mr somers affectionately in joy at reconciliation in delight felt at being relieved from uneasiness have suffered for three day loved friend better for quarrel quite forgot pain in pleasure of reconciliation thought that even if mr somers have be in wrong candour with acknowledged more than made amends for error must forgive little infirmity of temper know heart be a must be emilie repeated word said to herself forgive yes surely must be most ungrateful of human being if did otherwise without being most ungrateful of human being emilie however found very difficult to keep resolution almost day felt apprehension certainty of having offended benefactress cause by gave offence be sometimes so trifling a to elude notice so mysterious that must not be discovered so various anomalous that even when be told in what manner have displeased must not form rule draw inference for future conduct sometimes offended by differing sometimes by agreeing in taste opinion with mr somers sometimes perceived that be thought positive at other time too complying word look even silence passive silence be sufficient to affront susceptible lady then must go on with string of deduction rather of imagination to prove that there must be something wrong in emilie disposition must insist upon that knew better what be passing what must pas in mind than emilie must know nothing provoked mr somers more than want of success in of active attempt to make others happy be continually angry with emilie for not being sufficiently pleased grateful for thing have not vanity to suspect be intended for gratification be not calculated to contribute to amusement humility difference of taste be always considered a affectation perversity one day mr somers be angry with emilie because did not thank for inviting celebrated singer to concert emilie have idea that singer be invited on account of nothing must convince mr somers day be excessively displeased because emilie be not so much entertained a have expected to be at installation of knight of garter mad de coulanges expressed wish to see ceremony of installation though hate such thing took prodigious pain to procure ticket to have well placed indeed be very sensible of dear madam may be so dear did not look a if be seemed tired to death said be sleepy ten time repeated 'ah qu'il fait chaud ' be what be used to what have experienced life more pain person take to please oblige le can succeed le gratitude be to expect emilie reproached resolved that upon next similar trial must not complain of being sleepy tired that must take particular care not to say ah qu'il fait chaud short time afterwards be in crowded assembly at house of friend of mr somers rout specie of entertainment of have not seen example in own country appeared to rather barbarous mode of amusement to meet in vast crowd to squeeze to be squeezed without possibility of enjoying rational conversation emilie be fatigued almost fainting from heat bore with smiling countenance heroic gaiety for night be determined not to displease mr somers on return home be rather surprised disappointed to find lady in fit of extreme ill wanted to get away two hour ago cried must not understand of hint mlle de coulanges when asked whether did not find very hot persisted in saying 'not in least not in least mr somers be more angry upon occasion because recollected having formerly reproached emilie at installation for complaining of heat persuaded that be instance of perversity in emilie temper sly method of revenging for past nothing must be more improbable from girl of frank forgiving sweet disposition one must have be so ready to say so a mr somers in mood moment that be irritated judged without common sense never from general observation always from particular instance be in vain that emilie disclaimed motif attributed to be obliged to wait return of friend reason in mean time to bear reproach did with infinite patience unfortunately patience soon became source of fresh evil because emilie be so gentle so ready to acknowledge to believe to be in wrong mr somers became convinced that be in right in complaint fancied that have great merit in passing over so many defect in one whom have so much obliged who professed so much gratitude between fit of ill humour must however waken to full sense of emilie goodness must treat with particular kindness a if to make amends for past then if emilie must not immediately resume that easy gay familiarity of manner used to have before experience have taught fear of offending mr somers grew angry again decided that emilie have not sufficient elevation of soul to understand character to forgive little infirmity of best of friend when be under influence of suspicion thing emilie said looked be confirmation strong mr somers be apt in conversation to throw out general reflection be meant to apply to particular person to speak with one meaning obvious to company to be understood only by individual whom wished to reproach art have often successfully practised upon emilie for reason suspected that emilie tried upon then utmost ingenuity be employed to torture word into strange meaning must misinterpret plainest expression attribute to double mysterious signification one evening emilie have be reading new novel merit of be eagerly discussed by company said that heroine be fool others that be mad woman that be not either that acted a if be party asserted that be thing be great good that be impossible to paint in truer colour passion of love mr somers declared herself of opinion emilie who happened not to be present when declaration be made on coming into room joining in conversation gave diametrically opposite judgment said that author have painted enthusiasm with heroine yielded to passion instead of violence of passion to yielded french abbe to whom emilie made observation repeated triumphantly to mr somers who immediately changed colour replied in constrained voice certainly be very apposite remark vastly well expressed give mlle de coulanges infinite credit for emilie who knew inflection of mr somers voice turn of countenance perceived that word of praise be accompanied with strong feeling of displeasure be much embarrassed especially a friend fixed eye upon whilst blushed made blush ten time more be afraid that company who be silent must take notice of distress therefore went on talking very fast about novel though scarcely knowing what said made sundry blunder in name character be eagerly corrected by astonished mad de coulanges who must not conceive how body must forget dramatis persona of novel of day mr somers time preserved silence a if dared not trust to speak compressed lip showed sufficiently constraint under laboured whilst body else went on talking helping to refreshment servant be handing about mr somers continued leaning on mantel piece in deep reverie pulling bracelet round round upon wrist till be roused by mad de coulanges who appealed for judgment upon new method of preparing orange c'est la corbeille tenez cried holding by slender handle of orange peel tenez c'est la corbeille mr somers with forced smile admired orange basket said that for part hand be not sufficiently dexterous to imitate fashion said can only do like king of prussia other people squeeze orange throw peel away by bye how absurd be of voltaire to be angry with king of prussia for witty just apologue just repeated emilie just reiterated mr somers in harsh voice surely think so for part like king better for avowing principle world act a did though few avow said emilie in low voice believe in reality of gratitude apparently cried mad de coulanges who be still busy with orange apparently madame be disciple of rochefoucault allows of principle love in case will have a bitter quarrel with a have with mon cher abbe for rochefoucault be man detest rather detest maxim duke say be most amiable man of day only conceive that man must ascribe virtue to self love vanity perhaps said abbe be merely vanity that made say so wished to write witty satirical book will lay wager did not think a ill of human nature a speaks of must hardly speak think too ill of said mr somers if judged of human nature by such speech a of king of prussia about friend orange said emilie in timid voice must not be doing poor human nature injustice to judge of by such word a be convinced with m l'abbe that men for sake of appearing witty speak more malevolently than feel perhaps be case with king of prussia mlle de coulanges think then said mr somers that be quite allowable for sake of appearing witty to speak malevolently dear madam dear mr somers cried emilie quite misunderstood pardon thought be justifying king of prussia continued mr somers well see how can be done without allowing what many people do in practice though not in theory that be right becoming prudent to sacrifice friend for bon mot angry emphasis pointed manner in mr somers spoke word terrified completely abashed emilie who saw that something more be meant than met ear in confusion ran over variety of thought must not recollect thing that have ever said merited name of bon mot malevolent bon mot surely what said about foolish novel can not have offended mr somers how be possible can not be so childish a to be angry with merely for differing with in opinion what said might be bad criticism must not be malevolent referred only to heroine of novel perhaps author may be friend of hers person who be in distress whom have generously taken under protection why did not think of before be wrong to give opinion so decidedly then opinion be of so little consequence assuredly can neither do good harm to author when mr somers considers will be pacified when be once cool again will feel must not mean to say thing ill natured moment mr somers saw that emilie be sensible of displeasure exerted to assume during remainder of evening extraordinary appearance of gaiety good humour body shared smile kindness except unfortunate object of indignation behaved towards mlle de coulanges with most punctilious politeness cruel language of eye be sufficiently expressive of real feeling emilie bore with infirmity of temper with resolute patience expected that fit must last only till must ask for explanation followed mr somers a be usual custom upon such occasion to room at night in order to assert innocence mr somers walked into room in reverie without perceiving that be followed by emilie threw into chair gave deep sigh what be matter dear friend emilie began on hearing sound of voice mr somers started up with sudden anger then constraining said pardon mlle de coulanges if tell really be tired to night body mind wish to have rest for if possible must be so very obliging a to pull bell for masham wish very good night hope mad de coulanges will have as milk at proper hour to morrow have given particular order for purpose kindness to mamma dear mr somers said emilie have be invariable spare beseech mlle de coulanges grateful speech really be not prepared to hear with temper to night be so good a to ring bell will give leave to ring if insist upon said emilie gently withholding tassel of bell if must grant five minute one minute might perhaps save sleepless night mr somers incapable of longer commanding passion made reply snatched bell rope rang violently emilie let go tassel withdrew heard mr somers say to herself a left room be too much too much really too much hypocrisy can not endure thing word hurt emilie more than thing mr somers have ever said own indignation be roused be upon point of returning to vindicate gratitude if not prudence conquered resentment recollected promise to bear with temper of benefactress recollected mr somers kindness to mother quietly retired to room determining to wait till morning for more favourable opportunity to speak after passing restless night dreaming common dream of falling down precipice uncommon circumstance of dragging mr somers after by bell rope wakened to confused painful remembrance of have passed preceding evening be anxious to obtain admittance to mr somers a soon a be dressed masham informed that lady have given particular order that must not be disturbed when mr somers made appearance late at breakfast there be same forced good humour in countenance towards company in general same punctilious politeness towards emilie have before appeared studiously avoided opportunity of explaining attempt of emilie towards reconciliation either by submissive gentleness friendly familiarity be disregarded noticed with cold disdain yet be visible only to for body else observed that mr somers be in remarkably good spirit in most actively obliging humour imaginable after breakfast proposed arranged various party of pleasure went with mad de coulanges to pay several visit large company dined with at night went to concert in midst of apparent amusement emilie be made a unhappy a marked yet mysterious displeasure of benefactress must render person of real sensibility a did not wish to expose to second repulse forbore to follow mr somers to room at night sent note by mr masham have done said something to offend dear mr somers if knew how much pain have felt from displeasure be sure must explain to what can be be possible that differing in opinion from about heroine of novel can have offended perhaps author of book be friend of yours under protection be assured that if be case did not in least suspect at time made criticism perhaps be to alluded when said that king of prussia be not only person who must not hesitate to sacrifice friend for bon mot what injustice do by idea will not here say one word about gratitude affection lest must again reproach with hypocrisy thing else be able to bear pray write if will not speak to emilie when emilie be just falling asleep masham came into room with note in hand mademoiselle be sorry to waken mistress thought must not sleep unless read note to night emilie started up in bed read following note of four page yes will write because be ashamed to speak to dear emilie beg pardon for pulling bell cord so violently from hand last night must have thought quite ill bred still more reproach for what said about hypocracy have certainly sweetest gentlest temper imaginable must to heaven have strength of feeling absolutely run away with be doom of person of great sensibility to be unreasonable unhappy often ala to involve in misery for whom have most enthusiastic affection see dear emilie price must pay for being friend have strength of mind joined to feeling heart will bear with defect dissimulation be not one of in spite of effort find be impossible ever to conceal from of even most unreasonable fancy note be so characteristically frank artless have opened eye to own folly must show that when be in sens do justice deserve to be treated with perfect openness therefore however humiliating explanation will confess to real cause of displeasure when spoke of heroine of foolish novel what said be so applicable to part of own history character must not help suspecting have heard fact from person with whom spent hour lately be much hurt by alluding to in severe public manner will ask how must conceive to be capable of such unprovoked malevolence answer be can not tell ' can only say such be effect of unfortunate susceptibility of heart to speak more candidly of temper confess can not in particular alter nature blame a much a blame be a angry a please a can gentle friend at last must pity forgive now that affair be off mind can sleep in peace so hope will dear emilie good night if friend never quarrelled must never taste joy of reconciliation believe ever sincere affectionate somers one tasted joy of reconciliation more than emilie after reiterated experience be inclined to believe that can not balance evil of quarrelling mr somers be one of who confess fault never mend who expect for gratuitous candour more applause than others must claim for real merit of reformation so far did lady carry admiration of own candour that be actually upon point of quarrelling with emilie again next morning because did not seem sufficiently sensible of magnanimity with have confessed to be ill tempered few specimen be sufficient to give idea of lady power of tormenting to form adequate notion of effect upon emilie spirit must conceive same sort of provocation to be repeated day for several month petty torment incessantly repeated exhaust most determined patience time mad de coulanges went on very smoothly with mr somers for have not emilie sensibility notwithstanding great quickness hundred thing might pas did pas before eye without seeing examined farther than surface provided that there be not deficiency of little attention to have be accustomed never occurred to that friend must be more le pleased did not understand study physiognomy smile of lip be to always sufficient token of approbation whether be merely conventional whether came from heart never troubled to inquire provided that saw at dinner usual couverts that have sufficient number of people to converse with rather to talk to be satisfied that thing be right variation in mr somers temper be unmarked by went under general head vapeurs noirs specie of ignorance confidence produced best effect for a mr somers must not without passing obvious bound of politeness make mad de coulanges sensible of displeasure a have utmost respect for countess opinion of good breeding be to certain degree compelled to command temper mad de coulanges often without knowing tried terribly by differing from in taste judgment by supporting own side of question with enthusiastic volubility of french language sometimes english french music be compared sometimes english french painter time theatre be mentioned mad de coulanges pronounced eulogium on favourite french actor triumphed over comparison between elegance of french grossierete of english taste for comedy good heaven said fashionable comedy must be too absurd to make lowest of audience at boulevard laugh have excluded sentiment wit what have in place character out of drawing out of nature grotesque figure

lately attacked with much ability pretension of english to exclusive possession of humour footnote il est tres difficile de se faire une idee nette de ce que le anglais entendent par ce mot on tente plusieurs fois sans succes d'en donner une definition precise congreve qui assurement mi beaucoup d'humour dans s comedy dit que c'est une maniere singuliere et inevitable de faire ou de dire quelque chose qui est naturelle et propre un homme seul et qui distingue s discours et s action de discours et de action de tout autre cette definition que nous traduisons litteralement n'est pa lumineuse elle conviendrait egalement la maniere dont alexandre parle et agit dans plutarque et celle dont sancho parle et agit dans cervantes ii y apparence que l'humour est comme l'esprit et que ceux qui en ont le ne savent pa trop bien ce que c'est nous croyons que ce genre de plaisanterie consiste surtout dans de idees ou de tournures originales qui tiennent au caractere qu ' l'esprit et qui semblent echapper celui qui le produit l'homme d'humour est un plaisant serieux qui dit de choses plaisantes sans avoir l'air de vouloir etre plaisant au reste une scene de vanbrugh ou une satire de swift feront mieux sentir ce que c'est que toutes le definition du monde quant la pretention de quelques anglais sur la possession exclusive de l'humour nous pensons que si ce qu'ils entendent par ce mot est un genre de plaisanterie qu'on ne trouve ni dans aristophane dans plaute et dans lucien chez lea anciens ni dans l'arioste le berni le pulci et tant d'autres chez le italiens ni dans cervantes chez le espagnols ni dans rabener chez le allemands ni dans le pantagruel la satire menippee le roman comique le comedy de moliere de dufreny de regnard etc nous ne savons pa ce que c'est et nous ne
