be of whose faculty desire for acquiring knowledge be so far superior to of average man that have taken a be to place apart to be tempted of devil perhaps though none le fact bore witness to certain nobility of type so be more strange that when next speaker having finished in calculated chaos of word govind dissipated editor who have yawned tacit approval of dilaram dancer rose to denounce trivial iniquity in ruling race middle school english cheap abuse be received with just same desultory applause seemed to chris listening impatiently a if faculty of criticism have be lost in abuse a

political national social aspect of modern india ' must be held responsible for englishman listening must of course have challenged fact denied conclusion chris did gave unqualified assent to many many point yet when listened to assertion that 'the cup of political evil be so full burden of social inequality so intolerable tyranny of custom stand out so red foul that militant uprising have become essential to national salvation armed resistance only hope of amendment ' wondered with certain shame how many of million of india must find personal grievance in social equality political evil

western lore ' to 'duty trumpet call ' to 'england dear home of virtue sweet nurse to liberty ' to 'india cry woe secured rather more hearty meed of applause than anything else possibly because

with sex law of nature yet of beauty of garden who must doubt within fringe of blossoming tree wide aqueduct like shining cross lay edged by mosaicked marble causeway be raised above in turn edged by perfect wilderness of flower wider cross composed of flower mosaic water be set in dense thicket of orange pomegranate in late afternoon sunshine seemed concentrated in cross great shaft of yellow light streamed down limb seeming to darken rest in centre where limb met group of fountain sent fine feather into air through sparkle gold marble of summer house gleamed amid sentinel of cypress at far end of garden there be cloying sweetness in air flight of jewelled parrot flew screaming from one screen of flowering tree to other a if even winged creature a be must not escape thraldom of high wall hidden by leaf blossom that sense of prisonment prisonment of pleasure lay heavy on lesley a paused half unconsciously before tiny latticed retreat daintiest little retreat in world just at opposite end of shining cross from gilt summer house rose out of water made of marble fretwork with domed top looked like lace veil moulded into form of singing bird cage latticed seclusion be only connected with causeway on side of by foot wide ledge of mosaic lesley having be in garden before knew purpose retreat have served in past involuntary pause beside prolonged in half disdainful wonder for have be sanctuary here have be refuge even from pleasure of garden hither if woman high low chose to appeal for redress majesty have be bound to come listen leaving majesty manhood behind at least be idea retreat be more suggestive of beauty gaining in power by seclusion lesley lip curled with more disdain a looked at finnikin filagree cage expression however changed to curiosity a realised that one be sitting inside crossed ledge of mosaic swiftly stooping under laced edge of low arch went in be not beauty that found be wrinkled anxious faced old woman who rose in salaam then literally

more le dirty more le ragged in poor mohammedan quarter yet there be something refined in worn face blurred with recent tear looked into hers apprehensively a owner rose to salaam again leaving small roll of paper bound with coloured silk upon marble floor lesley be puzzled for instant then flashed upon that must be belated petitioner for justice in old style who have heard probably that lord sahib be in garden such roll of paper without silken tie however be often thrust into carriage when sir george be in so hunted round sparse vocabulary finally fell back on first phrase most newcomer to india learn namely 'kya mankta ' what do want be admirable beginning though unfortunately sympathetic curiosity of seldom becomes impersonal to speaker produced salaam flood of polished speech that lesley retired to english incontinently 'be for lord sahib ' asked hurriedly picking up roll pointing with to distant summer house title produced fourth salaam lesley with relief stooped under fretted arch again began to retrace step towards others sir george knew have be doubtful if business must allow to put in appearance at entertainment at one must be sure to know what message ought to be sent back to petitioner who a lesley left bird cage settled down in again to wait with great precision bead one please ' said lady arbuthnot after have undone quaint little tasselled silk cord be fastened with loop button round roll of paper order be such easy matter to obey so far a conventional fidwe yih hai ' be request of petitioner went little group of administrator who responded to request be fluent enough after came complaint of character more than one suggestion that only regular native reader must be expected to decipher such writing that must be best to hand document over to office must be sure to make something of remark made lesley who be listening wonder whether accuracy of something be to be considered at grace arbuthnot however listening also let curious smile come to face smile gave unusual tenderness 'where be mr raymond said suddenly 'going did say will one call back please ' appeared ready for drive home in rather violent blazer once more there be that unfailing challenge in polite tell be wanted lady arbuthnot ' 'yes to read ' replied holding out hieroglyphic in life of beauty grace have possibly never looked more beautiful more graceful jack raymond

unreasonable elemental jealousy felt inclined then there to turn back leave to do task alone did not want what be lesley drummond doing there in garden whose suggestiveness seemed to stifle yes to stifle because must not escape from lesley drummond who in mind eye saw vision of alighting from omnibus at corner of bond street on wet day picking way over greasy blister mark of many foot on pavement heedless of infinite suggestion in shop window to have tea at lady club with intimate friend solve problem of life by hard fast individualism tempered by sloppy socialism solve a if be possible to solve anything in condition above to solve greatest problem in world for woman a drank tea on table littered with literature of chiffon culture whose page proclaimed that woman aim be to

loop button round wrist in order to keep safe took off now handed to without word passed to auntie khojee whose withered face settled into self satisfaction a leant forward detaining hand till bracelet be safely looped on brown wrist then word came fast flood of jack raymond listened patiently fine though filagree of marble be that shut off from garden interrupted light so that figure showed dimly to other scent of garden drifted in unchecked mixed with faint scent of heliotrope from grace arbuthnot dress there be something breathless disturbing to sens lesley felt in

nothing seemed to claim not even work for be sunday morning after act of communion hope of companionship anywhere seemed strangely enough further from than ever so stood idly watching worshipper pas in out of arched entry to temple court leaving world coming back to with businesslike face until saw ram nath approaching sight made pull together swiftly 'the very man want ' said ram nath in english with such elaborate lack of surprise at chris costume that latter felt instantly that be known have be discussed in shark lane will wait moment will walk er back with ' hesitancy showed that something else be known also chris felt faint resentment come to lessen forlornness a waited while ram nath disappeared towards temple reappeared again wiping hand daintily with hemstitched pocket handkerchief 'we of world explained a tucked arm english fashion into chris davenant 'have to keep in touch with priest disagree know hold wrong be driven to acquiesce in much think untrue in order to keep hold on mass what other hold have ignorance if deny wisdom ' forlornness deepened again round poor chris here be swami argument upside down be wanted to see about ' asked resignedly feeling that must not go on with subject 'about afternoon ' began ram nath chris stared blankly what be possible companion continued have forgotten that afternoon be to see realisation of long cherished project of founding anglo vernacular college came back to chris then hastened to deny what have really be case whereupon ram nath went on mollified at last moment seemed one have remembered that lady arbuthnot who have kindly consented to lay stone ought to be presented with bouquet hafiz ahmad have claimed honour for wife thereby raising so much jealousy in shark lane that ram nath thought only solution of difficulty be to intrust giving to mr chris a wife of vice president of managing committee chris heard so described with sense of absolute bewilderment only of course might not perhaps be convenient now chris came back to sudden perception of other meaning behe will be very glad ' said quickly will tell when go home ' be done in moment chris felt dream to be madder than ever a realised that afternoon occupation must be standing in frock coat simpering while viva presented bouquet how prettily must do how beautifully must be dressed then in evening in evening must swami come ask for answer meanwhile ram nath be full of relief must settle difficulty really most serious one since nothing must mar harmony of memorable occasion must be singularly appropriate too because in order to ensure large attendance have be arranged to hold extraordinary chapter of 'national guild for encouraging comradeship ' to most of english official wife belonged in fact be to be memorable occasion one must fully justify popular lieutenant governor in for nonce waving rule against sunday ceremonial in order to allow employee to be present having here cut in on line of speech have prepared for

must come to thing have reached river step by time paused making ram nath pause also to look down on scene have not changed hair breadth in essential for thousand of year yet chris davenant eye noted one change of detail in moment a woman passed on way to fill waterpot there be new sort of amulet on wrist amulet made out of brass cartridge casing glanced round quickly to see if other woman be wearing by so doing recognised rather momentous fact namely that there be singularly few woman to be seen that who be belonged to working class turned to ram nath instantly pointed out sign a to one who ought to know value 'what be up ' said briefly must have seen amulet being sold a did be trick who be doing why ' companion shrugged shoulder priest must say be on par with paper fell from heaven there be always something think ought to protest why such manifestation of temper of mass strengthen hand of opposition by engendering fear of resistance in government so making for considerate treatment at aim be not a if such triviality must do harm might there be hope of mischief behind there must be ' beischief echoed ram nath acutely 'you know a well a that there be many folk in

claimant to beovereignty of air ' be due to be decided that evening after kite have be chosen entered for competition ram nath looked after faded brocade contemptuously 'poor devil said a englishman might have said 'one can not help pitying yet between ourselves if be in power must do anything else with though of course a opposition doe not do to say so to return to argument believe ignorant mass be helpless without lead educated party will not give towards anything unconstitutional others might burkut ali for instance ' 'burkut ali not to day at rate will be occupied in sovereignty of air

tomorrow at rate know of reason why must not be so added trifle resentfully seeing look on companion face 'and if who must well good bye if be not coming on ' chris felt doubly relieved partly at almost unhoped for straightforwardness of ram nath word mostly because have be growing conscious during conversation of fact that wherever might find comradeship be not here still in same weary bewilderment therefore seated on uppermost step looked down to where in deep shadow of archway of mai kali temple must just see above head of little crowd listening to declaiming priest hint of idol red outstretched arm brought back to in instant sense of own personal powerlessness gripped on side by east west what must do in afternoon frock coat in evening swami with question how must how must answer how must condemn naraini to living death how must give up past with good evil future with evil good putting aside for truth sake what ought to do god how powerless be mai kali widespread arm

even mr lucanaster given opinion on a expert for even agony have not be spared to unfortunate man answered sir george who have stopped writing to admire wife think how happy handsome looked how glad

satisfied especially when wife stooped suddenly kissed top of head though wondered a left room if be really getting little bald not so much because lip have thrilled because be observant enough to have noticed that partially bald head be provocative of wifely kissing still even that evil have to be faced in cause of empire so honest gentleman took up pen continued report of recent affair be writing in credit of saving situation be given unstintingly not to to others for sir george be gentleman grace however though be lady despite kiss of approval felt trifle annoyed be very nice of george to minimise part in business yet when be said done have consented to give order consented almost in defiance of official programme more thought of more aggrieved felt for so when found lesley alone in school room sought sympathy explained whole position at great length wound up by appeal do see what right mr kenyon have to credit lesley have so far managed to keep calm sough without much difficulty at present moment however something seemed wrong with work for be very busy with at window said at last then repeated remark with palpable resentment 'certainly not have nothing to do with nothing at grace looked in direction with dubious curiosity mean do ' asked 'that think one else ' think anything at interrupted girl hurriedly only say that mr kenyon did mean that be right person to praise ' lady arbuthnot be not to be put off 'because really be quite absurd a told george admitted that did not know of one not single man who must have taken grave responsibility now do tell truth lesley do know one ' 'perhaps there be more than single man suggested lesley evasively knot in thread becoming extremely troublesome grace from chair gave irritated glance towards window dear lesley be not often so so precise a if mattered to argument if there be one two wish must leave off threading needle whatever be come here be little sympathetic mean so much to know so if wish will say two do know of two people who must must do thing ' lesley folded up work with great method remained where be must complicate matter by saying two ' asked pugnaciously 'and after be mean must not be such very big thing there must be lot of people in world who must do just think even among men one know 'people who must must ' echoed grace in same tone know one ' paused added trifle bitterly know one who must then must mr raymond ' raymond why must say must ' asked girl swiftly 'why 'you need be so fierce lesley interrupted grace with little hard laugh 'though think half bad for many reason must help in thing like not ' 'that be fair ' cried lesley in flame knew ' paused be too late 'if knew what ' asked lady arbuthnot rising coming to window then standing before girl to say after pause will have to tell know lesley have started be not fool of course know jerry told that mr raymond have come to cycle with that evening that be why be so late said nothing because thought be only ' care what thought ' interrupted lesley angrily 'and wo tell anything unless promise not to speak ' will promise not to tell one who ought not to know know ' put in grace arbuthnot proudly wo promise more 'and who want more ' cried girl hotly course if people ought to know must know be only reason why be telling did mean to if can be so so unjust be only right that must know truth can judge of for when have told so need waste time ' retorted grace sudden antagonism have sprung up between two woman of be aware of be vaguely ashamed must not ignore 'thank ' said grace with chill dignity when recital be over 'you be right to tell will apologise to mr raymond ' mr raymond ' echoed lesley carried beyond resentment by eagerness lady arbuthnot not to be not one of people who ought to know that know ' beay ask why ' for instant seemed a if lesley must have matched grace in resentment then suddenly held out hand in swift appeal be angry please surely after what happened between cant help knowing that can owe mr raymond something ought to let have revenge to just to take sting away ' 'to ' echoed grace scornfully presume mean to ' 'oh may be a nasty a like about ' interrupted lesley hotly know be right must only be fresh tie between new sentiment lady arbuthnot flushed up to eye beally lesley pas bound speak a if wanted to to clutch at mr raymond when must only be too glad if however a say

pathetic yet acquiescent laughter got so far a ah lesley dear be so glad ' girl looked at with faint wonder great admiration then shook head ' believe be made different from ' said soberly can only understand one thing about how be that never forgot well never quite forgot for there be nothing to be glad of can assure nothing at did not in truth look a if there be grace a took sir george tea a
