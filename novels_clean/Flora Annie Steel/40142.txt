other word of getting hold of government contract out of must squeeze extra rupee required for purchase of rai bahadur ship proceeding commended to revengeful spiteful brain a so happened appeared in very nick of time for found colonel stuart looking helplessly at telegram from headquarters ordering to forward five hundred camel to front at once now faizapore office sent in daily schedule original duplicate triplicate with commendable regularity drew exact amount of grain sanctioned for transport animal without fail nevertheless sudden demand on resource be disagreeable so a have done once twice before in time of war rumour of war chief turned to big contractor for help not without certain uneasiness for though long course of shady transaction have blunted colonel stuart sense of honour towards equal have survived to altogether illogical extent towards inferior now private indebtedness to usurer be so great that must not afford to quarrel with knowledge nurtured suspicion shunker da made tool of idea most distasteful to pride honour mental position be more difficult to analyse than of man who having lost desire to do right from higher motive cling to from lower one belle father for instance did not hesitate to borrow cash from monies intrusted to care must rather not have borrowed from man with whom have official dealing shunker da however knew nothing have known must have credited little of survival of honour seemed impossible in eye that innumerable dishonesty of faizapore office must exist without knowledge of chief bribery be to crime be one to very large proportion of people of india to ignorant indeed seems such mere detail of daily life that be hard for to believe in judicial honesty hence ease with minor official extort large sum on pretence of carrying bribe to right quarter hence again come doubt many whispered tale of corruption in high place will lose by contract sahib said lala when term have be arranged rely on honour generous aid in future there be big thing coming in when protector of poor will doubtless remember old servant whose life good be always at honour disposal have highest opinion of of integrity lala sahib replied colonel evasively of

against discomfiture when managed to have same date on contract note of hand not that anticipated discomfiture in fact have one told that colonel be playing at cross purpose must have laughed assertion to scorn have too high opinion of perspicacity of sahib logue especially of sahib who shut eye to so many irregularity to credit possibility so drove homewards elate on way be stopped in narrow alley by invertebrate crowd without backbone of resistance blocked passage despite abuse showered around run over pig drive on say shouted to driver when other mean failed best not shunker

seems blotted out world be dark yet word be same can pen ink write differently let see that be dead oh let see be cry so took across to shabby room where everything stood unchanged save for sheeted figure on string bed gardener have strewn rose over sun streamed in brightly sight brought real conviction to belle seemed more dreamlike than ever to fall asleep a have done in turmoil of life to wake finding hush of death in possession of thing let philip marsden lead away passively like child through long day sat idle tearless with hand on lap a if be waiting for something one be busy day in

frill lace until in dawn two go forth alone to desolate graveyard read church service a best can say amen between sob there be none of strain for belle nothing to remind of inevitable so wondered what wanted of when a glare of sunset reddened wall of room major marsden came looked at with pitying eye be time be starting miss stuart said gently starting where thought must like to go to cemetery have arranged to drive down will be military funeral of course rose swiftly in passionate entreaty ah not so soon be not dead oh can not can not then seeing tender gravity of face clasped hand on arm

office have plenty of time for thought air must do head good be best for to be away just now better best a if anything must make difference now be very kind said in dull recognition of care philip marsden never forgot that drive memory of remained with for year a kind of nightmare girl in white dress sailor hat a have seen at many tennis party great bank of cloud on horizon telling of welcome rain little squirrel leaping across white road cattle returning homewards amid cloud of dust stolid stare of native a passed by be almost relief to stand side by side before open grave listening to even disciplined tramp audible above muffled drum coming nearer nearer dingy brick wall bleached to mud colour shut out view high up in sky above fringe of grey tamarisk tree procession of flame edged cloud told that out in west nature be celebrating obsequies of day in glorious apparel suddenly dead march struck up loud full bringing to philip marsden memory many sword decked coffin riderless charger behind have walked wondering if turn must come next music ceased with clash of arm at gate after low toned order two procession appeared in narrow file up central path white uniform looked ghostly in deepening shadow through break in tree last sunbeam slanted over wall making spike on officer helmet glow like star belle clasped yet listless finger tightened nervously a brigade major voice rose fell in monotonous cadence about dear brother departed seemed to like dream rather a if too be dead have tear grief nothing great numbness at heart then one put clumsily made cross of white flower into hand bidding lay on coffin bared now of protecting flag obeyed wondering while why other people must have thought of thing when have not thinking how crooked be how much better must have made perhaps for hand twined be not used to such woman work be philip marsden task also to throw first handful of earth into grave draw belle arm within own before salute rang out startled screaming parrot from roost among tree sent wheeling flashing like jewel against dark purple cloud be never going to end thought wearily a waited again yet again for rattle of rifle yet stood heedlessly silent even when band struck into quick time cheerful echo of men answering footstep died away into distance take home said doctor who with john raby have remained to see grave properly filled in will call round by by with sleeping draught will do more good than anything a drove back complained quite fretfully of cold companion reined in horse while wrapped military coat round fastening beneath soft dimpled chin with hand trembled little seemed to inexpressibly pitiful in grief heart ached for be going to rain think said suddenly with eye fixed on dull red glow barred by heavy storm cloud in west adding in lower tone father will get wet major marsden looked at anxiously drove faster frightened at dull despair of tone have meant to say good bye at door must not how must leave to unutterable loneliness yet what good must do beyond beguiling to take few mouthful of food poor healy mary ann proved helpless before form of grief to be utterly unaccustomed a presence seemed to do more harm than good philip marsden sent into next room where nursed boy wept profusely sat talking to belle till long after mess hour then when did turn to go sight of seated alone tearless miserable in big empty room be too much for soft heart came back hastily bending over then kneeling to look in downcast face take cold little hand into warm one say kind word came from very heart perhaps brought conviction perhaps touch of hand assured of sympathy for suddenly dull despair gave way laid head on shoulder cried pitifully a child cry to sleep with clasp of finger on hers breath stirring soft curly hair philip marsden heart beat fast pulse thrilled own emotion startled perplexed shrank from yet welcomed did love be meaning of how good be whispered trying to regain composure what must have done without unconsciousness smote with regret great tenderness there be plenty who will be kind to answered unsteadily life hold everything for yet dear peace happiness love love did hold for asked again a walked homewards in dark love be quite young man still only two thirty yet have deliberately set passion romance from year before poverty have stood between realisation of dream till with sight of ideal profoundly happy a one else wife have come distrust contempt for feeling experience showed did not must not last why therefore must enter into disturb life at friendship ah be different perhaps future held time when must clasp hand with life companion woman to be mistress of home mother of child belle poor little soft belle stuart with beautiful grey eye seemed to feel touch of hand in caress of hair on lip though laughed grimly at must not master joy took possession of at remembrance dear little belle amidst doubt surprise swept over a realised own state of mind one thing gave infinite satisfaction have saved from far more lasting trouble of father disgrace friend lover have be good deed to do be glad that have done nothing must alter while slept dreaming still of clasp on little cold yet willing hand official envelope lay on table beside mocking security opened next morning to lay aside with curse at own ill luck though be only notification that major p h marsden must carry on current duty of commissariat office till further order have mind to go over to brigade office get excused word two about other work must do pride rose in arm against shirking for private reason besides there might be nothing wrong in colonel stuart account even if there be must be best man to find out yet walked up down verandah prey to conflicting desire bitterly angry with for hesitating instant common sense told that might be a well for one le biassed than be by previous knowledge to undertake scrutiny that be scarcely fair for to go to task with foregone conclusion in mind pride suggested that must not trust to decide fairly even now how must when be bitterly conscious of one overmastering desire to save belle then came thought that if be indeed what in heart believed to be if steadfastness straightforwardness be more than match for own then very idea of refusing task must be offence to after nothing must have prevented from placing with open eye in

when capital warranted plunge have intention of risking position if need be of throwing up for justification must wait year unless indeed fate sent rich wife heiress however be scarce in india furlough be not yet due so john raby have to content with four per cent be more annoying when remembered that shunker da be making forty out of very indigo business on have tried to evade income tax sooner later john raby intended to have finger in pie unless more fortunate person plucked plum out first other reason for annoyance arose from fact clearly demonstrated by neat system of account over nine thousand rupee of balance be proceeds of ecarte played with man who have have confidence to make executor young civilian have qualm of conscience here either have be fair fight colonel considering quite a good at game a antagonist somehow total looked bad beside that other one where intricate column of figure added into row of nothing for widow orphan not penny so far a executor must see after paying current debt about madame black tan a irreverently styled family did not much concern for belle be different liked girl have often told that addition of money must have made excellent wife just sort one must safely have at home to busy man meant much thought philip marsden with large fortune showed disposition to annex prize lessened regret for poverty yet increased why asked savagely did nice girl never have money only gleam of satisfaction in short to be yielded by balance be remembrance that possession of nine thousand rupee prevented lala shunker da from absorbing a matter of fact executorship have proved wholesome check on usurer outcry gave young man consolation to think that one must have managed lala so well a did smile raised by remembrance lingered still when major marsden walked unannounced through window in unceremonious indian fashion hullo said john raby glad to see miss stuart be much better to day there be reason why very pleasant natural remark must annoy hearer did reminded that john raby have acquired sort of authority over dead man daughter by virtue of executorship of have seen since day of funeral for have be hovering on verge of nervous fever responsibility of caring for have fallen on john raby not on philip marsden john raby not have have to make necessary arrangement for comfort speedy departure to hill a soon a possible for mr stuart have collapsed under shock of husband death rapid indian funeral have made presence of others impossible so philip marsden felt to be out in cold resented nurse told so when inquired just now replied shortly be to see afternoon when come back from drive have sent for shunker da carriage major marsden frowned might have chosen one else surely ruined father not at all lent money one have to do well be grim world drive ca be more so than last have remembrance evidently absorbed for sat silent be looking used up marsden said other kindly anything matter yes well if have to do with commissariat business wonder colonel private affair be simply chaos pointed to pile of paper on below table with contemptuous smile major marsden shook head public one be in fairly good order be surprised at method of course have good clerk then system of check make possible to be inaccurate with utmost accuracy what be wrong philip marsden moved uneasily in chair gave impatient sigh suppose have got to tell because be man executor want to never do anything want dear fellow be mistake know what will please other people generally have rough guess at own desire suppose will please fact be there be deficit of four thousand five hundred rupee in private safe of colonel stuart kept key be that surely be enough quite enough be not exactly surprised then be returned major emphatically in fact believe there really be deficit at do think shunker da be sort of man to make false claim not unless have fallen upon fair proof said other coolly what claim doe make say paid in three thousand five hundred very day of colonel stuart death produce receipt thousand be paid in by one else day before seems odd that must just make up deficiency have proof that be actually note missing curiously enough have contrary to what one must have expected colonel stuart made practice of writing number of note received in private ledger none of four entered a having be given by shunker be to be found now a be be friend be executor do know of large payment made to one within two day of death limit see to time nothing to account for three thousand five hundred returned john raby little hastily let stick to shunker claim first may be false say hold receipt yes give number of note also right one book give where give native often confuse figure john raby nodded leant back in chair thinking believe note be paid said at last if be not to be found inference be afraid be clear colonel borrowed believe returned major slowly have be drawing diagram idly on piece of paper now threw aside pen with decision believe repeated will tell why 'd rather not tell a said before a be executor must when found dead that morning there be paper be mistake understand hearer nodded again in have set down reason want of reason clearly enough have got paper burnt suppose ought to have kept seemed pity at time anyhow total have borrowed be close on ten thousand ten said there be only just so see a luck must have have money with at time so replaced ten thousand to be strictly accurate nine thousand seven hundred fifty well need stare so raby why devil must if chose john raby gave low whistle must be awfully fond of belle said after pause philip flushed deep angry red ever since possible necessity for giving action to world have dawned upon have known what comment must be made knowledge did not lessen sting think have better keep miss stuart name out of conversation merely tell to show have good reason for supposing that there be chicanery confusion beg pardon exactly so assented john raby with smile be a anxious a can be to keep out of so a executor will undertake to refund deficiency at once there may be mistake be best to have inquiry hardly see how be to be prevented for of course have to report matter john raby literally bounded from chair in unrestrained vexation reported dear marsden what devil oh beg pardon really to begin with cut own throat what else must do asked other quietly forget be in charge of office do returned hearer pausing in rapid pacing of room ah suppose must do anything else be not so high flown ca see good of chucking ten thousand rupee into gutter for sake of sentiment then chucking sentiment after for girl adored father warn if ca keep off subject will go interrupted philip rising thought might know something colonel stuart dined with that last evening if remember civilian needed reminder indeed for last ten minute have be distractingly conscious of note for thousand rupee lying in despatch box might throw light on mysterious disappearance yes replied did see what be thinking of marsden played ecarte too to tell truth be so fuddled excited that refused to go on sent home see what come of benevolence if have let play rooked must have have opportunity of brooding over difficulty putting end to again see there be nothing so unsafe a unselfishness philip remembering notice of transfer have found open by dead man side wondered if matter might not have turned out differently have be viewed by calm light of day well ca be helped now continued speaker approve of have be done will do best in fact be bound a executor to clear matter up though be sure know where inquiry may not lead be infernal nuisance nothing le well hand over paper suppose have objection to searching office none colonel room be a left be afraid of noise so near house speaker frowned at own word annoyed to find how thought for belle crept into action so far good look here marsden if value that girl opinion go tell downright truth will be able to see afternoon piece of sound advice meant kindly have not unusual effect of making recipient hesitate about course of action on have almost decided in after year when considered tangled clew fate held at time for unwinding never hesitated to say here went wrong at time seemed of small importance whether saw girl day next once more assumption of authority on john raby part irritated into contradiction will be pity to disturb miss stuart first day replied stiffly rode away young civilian shrugged shoulder philip marsden be bad fellow on whole prig of first water imagine one gifted with grain of common sense acting a have done why if wanted girl good grace have not paid up rest of money finished whole affair be long price to pay of course be better than giving ten thousand for nothing only morbid self esteem must have prevented really sense of duty to be found in people be almost enough to engender belief in original sin mere struggle for existence must never have produced congeries of useless sentiment threw into chair determining to have quiet cigar before tasking brain with further thought about what have just heard first glance at daily paper have just come in made throw from in disgust for contained fulsomely flattering notice extolling major marsden at expense of colonel stuart openly hinting at discrepancy in account former officer be determined to bring home to latter style betrayed hand of clerk toadying for promotion style style matter be clear to be read by million came from marsden infernal sense of duty john raby have mind to spoil little game by sending paper over to belle a usual with fault be not spiteful man one inclined to play part of dog in manger consequently when lala shunker da carriage went over for belle chuprassi in charge only carried bouquet newspaper remained behind keeping company with john raby magnanimity belle never noticed omission for be still strangely forgetful indifferent even when drove along familiar road hardly remembered anything of last dismal ride only one two thing showed distinctly in midst of past pain such trivial thing a crooked cross of flower screaming parrot in stormy sky rest have gone to come back doctor told john raby ere long just now forgetfulness be best though showed how narrowly have escaped brain fever so nobody spoke of past while philip be cherishing remembrance of first day using to build up belief in trust be not even conscious that have be kindest among many kind meanwhile philip marsden have not found in bed of rose impossibility of seeing belle left prey to uncertainty if be ready fifty time day to admit that be in love there be quite a many time when doubted fact yet love love be strenuously eager to save from trouble so relief at finding office in good order have be great in regard to matter have be in colonel stuart own hand naturally felt safe discovery of deficiency therefore have be most unpleasant shock more so because saw at once inquiry might make necessary for to betray own action wearied fruitlessly with endeavour to discover error thought of hushing matter up never occurred to a possible to men might have be temptation to be none so deserved credit on score told again that if belle be what deemed must see necessity of report also then be reckoning on perfection poor belle a so happened be in such state of nervous tension that be utterly incapable of judging calmly about anything relating to father lay on sofa after returned from drive feeling dreariness of coming back to everyday life in consequence exalting standard of loss till tear rolled quietly down cheek whereupon poor healy mary full of best intention brewed cup of tea sent over road for newspaper imagined have be forgotten master of house be out for evening ride thus came to pas when called on way home found belle studying misleading paragraph with flushed cheek tearful eye what doe mean asked tempestuously what be that dare to say of father with pretty troubled face looking into john raby washed hand of further magnanimity refused to play part of providence to man who must not look after own interest whom in vague way felt to be rival so considering belle only told modified truth making a light a must of deficiency openly expressing regret that must ever have be reported more so because major marsden believed there be mistake consolation increased indignation do mean to say cried trembling with anger weakness that have dragged father name in dirt for mistake why did come to to must have told be impossible always misjudged father hated never must come here ah yes see now understand sounded sweetly in young man ear injustice be too appalling to be passed over felt compelled to defence for moment thought of telling whole truth reflected that philip have tongue a well a that one have right to make free with man confidence consequently palliation only referred to culprit well known inflexibility almost morbid sense of duty of made belle more more angry a if very insistence on such virtue involved depreciation of quality in dead man care what happens now said vehemently know well enough that nothing can say will harm father good name will never forgive never be use excusing say only make more unnecessary cruel stupid will never forgive never night lay awake working into fever mental bodily by piling up many evidence in favour of theory a to philip long cherished enmity have never called never spoken to when world beside have be friendly very kindness to dick be tainted for have not sided with boy against father once train of thought started be easy to turn point so that there seemed possibility of following other line than one laid down for a went along finally to clinch matter memory served sorry trick by suddenly recalling to recollection philip marsden gloomy face when have told who be on first meeting at railway station sat up in bed with little hot hand stretched into darkness o father father be only one who loved only one climax at once of sorrow consolation somehow soothed to sleep now while be employed in blackening character philip marsden be crediting with cardinal virtue have not seen daily paper for reason put many other thing out of head for time being have idea when wilfully went to play racquet that evening instead of following raby advice of seeing belle that be throwing away last chance of interview a sat outside court cooling after game urgent summons came from orderly room ten minute after be reading telegram bidding st sikh start to front immediately farewell to leisure for though regiment have be under warning for service in great measure prepared for next forty eight hour be one of exceeding bustle philip harassed on side have barely time to realise what meant despite catch at heart when thought of belle blood ran faster in vein from prospect of action own certainty moreover be so great that seemed almost incredible that one of whose sympathy felt assured must see matter with other eye nevertheless be determined to tell at first opportunity often a went untiringly through wearisome detail of inspection mind be busy over interview to come end be always same left with smile on face john raby happened to be standing in verandah when between pillar post philip found that vacant five minute have be chasing day long ca see be afraid returned cheerfully to inquiry for miss stuart fact be have worried into fever over paragraph wonder be infernal what paragraph asked philip innocently john raby looked at laughed not very pleasant kind of laugh upon soul said be unlucky beggar begin to think be true case for have enough real bad luck to make three volume course of true love run rough so have seen then will fetch out paper be just inside philip reining in restive horse viciously read offending line punctuating with admonitory dig of heel tug at bridle a charger fretted at fluttering paper looked well on horseback civilian lazily leaning against pillar admired dangling sword jingling spur folded paper methodically against knee handed back miss stuart believed that asked quietly woman always believe what see printed be in awful rage of course warned marsden know did be most kind will tell miss stuart when see called to say good bye be sorry yes can say be sorry for cause of fever tone be bitterness look here marsden said other huff take advice time write to do think belief of woman extends to what see written did know have high opinion of sex raby well good bye to thanks oh will be down to see st march out five be be philip nodded a rode off through last night in cantonment be angry with everything everybody included why have meddled what demon have possessed brigadier to put in charge of commissariat office why have not order for front come before why have come now what induced babu who penned that paragraph to be born why did mission school teach misuse of adjective be still too angry to ask why have not taken john raby advice that touched too closely on real mistake to be acknowledged yet awhile gloom on face be not out of keeping with scene a regiment marched down mall at early dawn while band played zakhmi that plaintive lament of afghan maiden for wounded lover yet there be pitiful crowd of weeping woman child such a often mar spectacle of british regiment going on service farewell have be said at home if woman wept in deserted line men marched eye front without waver behind sacred flag borne aloft by tall drum major whose magnificent stature be enhanced by enormous high twined turban close at heel went two men waving white silver mounted whisk over holy grunth watchful lest aught might settle on sacred page lay open on yellow satin cushion borne by four sergeant there plainly discernible even by half light be inscribed in broad red black lettering sure guide through death to life for faithful follower then separated by wide blank from book in front men behind rode colonel finally shoulder to shoulder marched a fine body of men a must be seen east west with dexterously knotted turban neutralising least difference in height so that company came by a if carved out of one block be stirring sight making blood thrill especially when at turn of road leading to barrack band of british regiment formed in front to play fellow soldier out of station sikh broke into old war cry jai jail guru ji ke jai victory victory teacher victory mingled oddly with strain of girl left behind little group of horseman waited for last farewell at cantonment boundary one of riding alongside told philip marsden that clue have be found truth must be made manifest conventional answer of pleasure came reluctantly a hand of two men met gloomy troubled face looked almost wistfully into clever contented one be very good to raby know that good bye workmanlike groan shriek of fife drum replaced retiring band a cheer after cheer greeted final departure philip marsden felt that john raby be left completely master of situation that evening twenty mile out among sandhills put pride in pocket impelled thereto by persistent gnawing at heart followed advice of writing to belle honest if somewhat hard letter telling not of good deed truth of seemed to bad ten day after at peshawar with last civilised post be to see for many week letter came back to unopened re addressed in shaky hand heart ache be better by time might have afforded courtesy of envelope said a threw letter into camp fire chapter ix clue spoken of by john raby lay in note for thousand rupee with colonel stuart have paid portion of card debt during last deal in great game proved to be not only one of missing note a luck must have very one about number of uncertainty existed figure stood a colonel have written so mistake lay with usurer if be really mistake john raby lit cigarette meditated with list before beyond odd persistency in three five figure presented peculiarity so set problem aside till must tackle on spot where have arisen for be great believer in scenery a aid to sens day be almost done however ere found leisure for task nevertheless fatigued a be set to work methodically be rewarded by immediate discovery that uncertainty existed a to number of note one have be paid in by one else entry have be blotted by hasty closing of ledger though read like be quite conceivable that might be something else again three five idly enough wrote two uncertainty on sheet of paper sat staring at till suddenly suggestion came to making re number given by shunker in close imitation of dead man bold black figure then deliberately blot by placing in ledger result bore so close resemblance to blurred entry that quick brain darted off in wonder how usurer have got hold of number of note have not paid in reasonable explanation suggesting began systematic search in waste paper basket scrap there must at least tell on what work colonel have be engaged during last day knew that shunker have have interview with in morning did not account for shred of receipt for three thousand five hundred maund of grain found almost on top old receipt dated month back three thousand five hundred too odd coincidence so far good next thing be to have sight of shunker face before have time to hear rumour make plan summons to come up for interview early next morning rather pleased lala for received while at receipt of custom when added to importance in eye of wedding guest who sat watching nautch girl sidle like pouter pigeon over strip of dirty carpet be stout to obesity oiled hair be plastered so a to narrow forehead to triangle voluminous skirt ended just under arm in superfluity of bust held one fat hand to cheek persistently a if in agony of toothache while yelled away a if dentist have failed to comfort yet best native society of faizapore have sat there for hour half with impassive face of asiatic bent on amusement face surely will make paradise dull work for houri yea will come to raby if need assented rich man turning with spiteful chuckle to right hand where old mahomed lateef sat solemn dignified see khan sahib how even sirkar favour money when be young oh shunker retorted other grimly hand of nikalsane jan larnce held sword too tight to leave room for rupee ay when khan of kurtpore brought fifty sword to flash behind without payment sword be bought nowadays who lack money must e'en go to wall old mahomedan eye flared mawillah oh buniah ji if go to wall in poor house will find sword enow yesterday hut fell mean 't be pulled down for repair came on five persian blade ready to use o lala ji spot blemish of rust haply may help back rupee day shunker moved uneasily in chair guest sank again into silence broken only by occasional tributary hiccup native etiquette demand for memory of dinner star shone overhead great trail of smoke from brazier of oil cotton seed seemed to mix up with milky way little nuttu hero of feast have fallen asleep in chair baby bride being engaged in cutting teeth elsewhere group of younger men squatted in far corner round flaring paraffin lamp talked vociferously in mixed jargon of individual freedom political right representative government one laughed cried at anything at nautch girl with unmentionable song spectacle of people discussing freedom while engaged in taking away from two harmless infant so night wore on in dull dissipation leaving shunker at disadvantage when came to confront young civilian clear cut clean shaven face in morning have made mistake lala ji began opening fire at once serious mistake about note claim to have left with colonel stuart so much at least be certain john raby however saw more in unrestrained start of alarm surprise evoked be so very serious continued blandly nothing for to be so frightened about lala ji make mistake at time by way did keep original memorandum of number in english mahajani accountant character in mahajani huzoor bleated shunker john raby smiled for diminished possibility of clerical error enormously indeed be to settle point that have sent for usurer so much better for went on carelessly if will bring paper to evening say about six will see if can get error in claim altered have interchanged five three in one number be a well to be accurate before inquiry commences will be very stringent one by by what time did last see colonel stuart usurer be prepared time when finally bowed out john raby be a much in dark a ever in regard to detail of plot felt sure have be laid day long in sort of under current of thought be busy ransacking memory invention for theory coming back again again disheartened to half tipsy laugh with colonel stuart have given note declaring be windfall windfall what must mean have shunker given back then there must have be second interview none of servant must speak to one went over early to office sat in dead man chair trying to piece thing together shadow be beginning to cling to corner ere usurer be announced something in scared glance gave towards tall figure in seat of office convinced john raby that man be reminded of similar visit to room quaver in hand voice with produced day book said that huzoor number be right after clinched matter suppose remarked young man coolly be confused by other note random shot struck home huzoor faltered fat man john raby looked full in face went one better poker be game of be passionately fond other note with three five saw got when mean second time came here when brought receipt for grain destroyed by jove threw hand up light came into face fool not to see before receipt wrong receipt of course never gave money swear did protested shunker completely off guard hearer broke into fit of cynical laughter thank shunker thank of course gave money see a one of number be different improved on original memorandum thinking have made mistake stay number be note by jove must have given back whole roll of four thousand five hundred by mistake be bigger blackguard than thought cried usurer beside with fear of shaitan only three swear only picked up three thank again lala picked up three let see how be young man rose pacing room quickly talking rapidly stuart must have taken four from safe windfall by george windfall colonel must have thought shunker have only taken two well be nice sort of scoundrel went on stopping opposite usurer viewing with critical eye so gave wrong receipt on purpose now claim second payment be that shunker collapsed to floor a if bone have left body did will swear by holy ganges by son head did mean thought must kill gave wrong receipt in hurry oh sir swear let go leg fool will stand up let teeth chatter be not going to kill so be even good scoundrel shunker only pitiful fortune finder having done clever trick by mistake thought safe to claim money again a only witness be dead be safe for chance of other note be hard luck lala ji hard luck there be something almost uncanny in john raby jeering smile a threw into chair began to light one of eternal cigarette fact being that be elated beyond measure at own success unwilling to detract a be from own skill by hint of carelessness on other side now shunker asked chief attention being apparently given to tobacco what do intend to do coolly a spoke be conscious of inward anxiety for have rapidly reviewed position confessed impotent must usurer regain courage of denial since attempt to prove fact must bring to light own possession of unlucky note best chance therefore be to work on lala terror without delay throw on honour mercy quavered usurer in dull despairing tone knowing by experience that be broken reed on to rely deserve still there be reason incline to be lenient son be young to be deprived of father care besides a colonel sahib executor wish to have committee of inquiry in office understand sahib understand eminently sensible view of matter be a welcome a be unexpected therefore will be content if withdraw claim in credible way of course equally of course will sign confession will burn when sahib how not word particularly wish to know what be going to do have lived seven year in india without being aware how thing can be burked if sahib must only tell tell to burke why man if only have conscience thing must be possible 'd make money even out of will help so far have somehow to restore certain note number of be known happen to have traced one of already happen to have got hold of wrong one will exchange if have got about ah see have be great saving of trouble quarter of hour later john raby wrote few line to major marsden successor enclosing thousand rupee note have found in unexpected place in colonel stuart office adding belief that others must doubtless turn up ere long suggesting few day grace in order that thorough search might be made never lie if can help said to sardonically that dear old prig marsden must be shocked at squaring business though at one stage of proceeding tried to do so what devil must be good of inquiry to living soul a have lost thousand in avoiding one one must accuse of interested motif marsden row in same boat if have have a much money a have well be dear little girl be fact called on dear little girl after leaving office comforted greatly by general expression of hope made almost more grateful to than certainty must have done for showed more perfect trust in father integrity so even young man caution told in favour went home very well satisfied with to await final explanation be to emanate from lala fertile brain note must be found somewhere doubt else in looking over account must discover like sum owing to government must cause disappearance of apparent deficiency amid terror lala have noted john raby assertion that given certain conscience must make money out of restitution idle word stood between many solution of difficulty soul if have one be full of hate sense of defeat desire for revenge if only must devise plan by must retain plunder especially thousand rupee note white faced shaitan have given in exchange dawn found still in upper chamber alone with faithful jackal there be determination in face dogged resistance in ram lal fool whispered usurer if fall where art thou swear will let whole thing go have money thou hast none be only year without opium tobacco ramu wife child well cared for meanwhile be going to back out of agreement unfaithful to salt year be ten year without opium lala there be need for be scapegoat be true only for safety son of owl cursed usurer still under breath be for safety thy safety a well a mine for if thou wilt do a bid thee will tie shaitan hand if be not tied will meddle besides sahib logue be never satisfied without scapegoat if one go not to jail will inquire then ramu wilt thou fare better 'twill be longer in cell be opium can be smuggled ramu see promise five rupee month to warder big caste dinner when thou returnest from father in law house native euphemism for jail listen ramu so whispered colloquy went on on through hot night during course of next day john raby be asked to sign search warrant for house of one ramu lal who be suspected by master shunker da of having stolen missing note from colonel stuart office table for moment young man taken aback by unexpected turn of affair hesitated reflection showed that for must prove to contrary crime might have be committed at least there must be time enough for interference at later stage of proceeding so ramu house be searched note for five hundred rupee be found on person two previous conviction against promptly produced by police discovery of one that smallest note gave john raby key to shunker plan for if must be proved that money have be stolen after have be duly handed over to commissariat officer lala claim must remain intact thus must be gainer by exactly three thousand rupee of must of course go towards indemnifying scapegoat ramu be notoriously contractor jackal bound to take such risk what be to be done be maddening to be outwitted in manner after one be really worse for ramu have evidently be squared shunker be bound to escape in case government have gained all round practically speaking marsden be only sufferer latter in having paid up ten thousand rupee authority must otherwise have lost in having restored one thousand out of honest earnings besides have forced shunker to disgorge five hundred in fact for ecarte fraud must not have be discovered surely be enough for man to do especially a one disclosure must lead to in case government must have to pay back money of devious straightforward argument ended in john raby taking care that case must be tried in court be successfully ram lal confronted by mass of evidence ingeniously compounded after native fashion from truth falsehood from denial of honest people who must not possibly have seen anything assertion of who be paid to have seen everything pleaded guilty to having watched master give money to colonel stuart who being in hurry have placed in envelope box on writing table whence ramu returning after dark have taken in moment of forgetfulness usual native excuse here lala interrupted court to say in voice broken by emotion that ramu be faithful servant very faithful servant indeed so jackal got eighteen month for theft shunker drove down next morning to jail on visit of inspection took opportunity of presenting one of warder with five rupee net result of whole affair from monetary be to say from john raby point of view being that shunker gained three thousand rupee government six thousand odd while philip marsden lost over nine forfeited one did not count other gain loss not even when day two after trial stood with belle hand in saying good bye to ere departed to hill gharri waited with pile of luggage outside in sunlight poor healy mary ann who be to accompany to rajpore be arranging pillow fussing over position of ice box be to ensure comfort ca thank said girl tearfully pretty eye on wish must ca perhaps may day replied vaguely wishing be possible after did nothing be clear from first that there be mistake people did not see clearness returned bitterly so kindness confidence be more welcome will never forget once more young civilian be driven by sheer keenness of perception to position of outsider who seeing game see odds also if

to beg of man be only very wisely going to take advantage of natural strength of position be a if have ever cared button for know something like flash of lightning shot down from heaven on poor belle

in more virtuous mood be trustworthy that woman who discovers other man to be sun than husband must necessarily call marriage failure so forfeit measure of self respect righteous ignorance simply made feel a looked at well laid table that here be element of mariage trois idea hateful to from according to what have be taught only escape be flight yet how must there be flight if john must not give up money then thought that table laid for two last night have be ever so much more pleasant came to reduce reasoning power to pulp listened to story of poor dick will will have led to present puzzle

finished breakfast must come talk over detail in office must like wife began philip john be much better at business than be interrupted belle take much interest in sort of thing must rather not thank so two men whom fate have always placed in such strange antagonism to other sat amicably arranging business while belle wandered about from one occupation to angry with for knowing of two have interest most at heart be settled belle cried husband gaily a came in to lunch marsden trump knew that before did will never regret though philip for be twenty per cent mistake say belle must have bottle of champagne to drink to new firm marsden raby co hurried off for wine leaving belle major alone marsden raby co horrible detestable be position bettered by philip remark that there be other way out of at present dick will might turn up if a be not unlikely one have buried poor lad there be doubt that one have looked after effect in shanty at event husband have arranged to pay back money by instalment so soon a possible only made reply stiffly that be sure john must do utmost to lessen risk will leave in hand at rate said philip who despite pity sympathy be human sha trouble much with

perception that be so added to belle wild rebellion at position in found fancied found when stood out under star again saying good night belle hand lay in philip for instant while john filled tumbler from tray in verandah somehow tragedy of face proved too much for humour of man who knew guiltless of save great tenderness be not going to bite poor belle said with smile half of amusement half of annoyance need call in aid of policeman assure looked at angrily a turned away there be tear in eye sat on edge of bed once more pondering over event of day time there be doubt in mind at cared more for belle peace than for anything else in world must go away for while must not give up must prove to that there be need for to surprise be waiting in verandah when came out of room at daybreak next

here be mine a of be quite pretty one for instance wo take ca have seen many rose lately intend moving by bye have sent out breakfast so a train doe leave till midnight can have jolly day philip fastening rose in buttonhole wondered if best parlour with cover off be not worse than call on policeman seemed to equally unnecessary then have advantage in position must show friendship in unmistakable way while poor belle have only far harder task of receiving benefit remember suleiman arab at faizapore said a cantered off be riding now oh apologise pony doe well enough for john gave such delightful surprise in buying back after be married got dirt cheap from woman who be afraid to ride remarked john coming up behind cheerfully belle be divided between vexation pleasure at depreciation of own merit must think rode pretty straight a rule said philip looking at full in face many woman make mistake of jagging at beast mouth perpetually if can trust be far better to leave alone think so john race to next kikar tree be last chance for will be among corn soon come major marsden overtaking at regulation pace owned that belle did ride very straight indeed perhaps be right after position be untenable felt little disheartened weary only pride remained firm telling that have perfect right to settle point a chose surely might at least rectify own mistake sun climbed up up even in cooler greener river land beat down fiercely on stubble where here there ox circled round on threshing floor cloud of chaff glittering like gold in light showed winnower be at work john be in element pointing out field promised to indigo village where vat be to be built be getting little hot for mr raby to be out remarked philip though be quite aware must be offence by george be late look

girth smiling began on curb what fidget be be glad john be like curb girth mean more than suppose there now can go neck crop at everything wo say nay steady lad steady one two three be right thank think have proper number of hand foot so far a know head be on shoulder replied belle tartly dipped down bit from field to sluggish stream edging higher land then scampered across muddy flat towards promontory lay right at other side of bend pull up please cried philip that strip look quick nonsense john come way week be right belle gave pony cut making forge ahead be match for suleiman who unaccustomed to spur bounded past pull up please be foolish pull up philip shouted hearing ominous cloop of horse foot dig of spur leap flounder suleiman be over creek not so belle pony slower heavier

closed on wrist a lay sinking slowly despite stillness for pony relieved of weight be plunging like mad thing churning up sand water to slush must get purchase first sand hold like birdlime said after ineffectual attempt be frightened if let go for moment then with one hand through suleiman stirrup knelt once more on extreme edge of firm ground got grip of belle again now then together more together than desired for suleiman alarmed at strain backed violently reared finally broke away leaving philip prone on back in dirt hope did hurt said struggling up rather blindly to aid belle final flounder to safe ground not much replied with nervous laugh a shook curiously dry sand from habit wrist will be bit black blue be why philip what be matter philip have doubled up limply horribly a if have be shot lay in heap at foot philip what be a slipped arm beneath to raise head something warm wet trickled over blood wound murmured handkerchief anything be sorry then pain died out of face head

dreary crossing threshold of new house with jostling shuffling footstep of who carry something be death will be death there be light in belle eye even husband accustomed a be to even nerve wondered at calm decision since must procure doctor a quickly a possible best plan must be for john to ride across country to station where afternoon mail stopped to return to saudaghur mere hospital assistant must be needle delay did not mind said being left alone meanwhile must send for supply of necessary since be evident that philip must not be moved at rate for day two so belle sat in big empty room by

village folk fresh idea for revenge came to console be never hard to change stolid opposition of indian peasant into stolid obstruction overt injustice be required nothing disregard of custom so shunker taking advantage of short period during have be associated in partnership with john raby began cautiously to call in debt in name of firm now in indian village debt to ancestral usurer be debt be to say nighty ephemeral liability may crop up at time claiming payment good solid inheritance going back sometimes generation two patent almost of solvency claim certainly for consideration at hand of banker since bumper crop might day give upper hand bad one make still more unwise for creditor to present bill thus when shunker disregarded time worn prejudice to extent of asking one peru old

sahib will pay when river come will come year perhaps if not next year if luck be bad may tarry twain not longer come ever sooner later then let talk of payment shunker leaned forward evil face kindling with malice what peru if river never return what if raby sahib new dam be built to prevent water coming so that may have grip on land what if seed grain thou sowest spring green to die yellow year after year pera ditta ox eye opened helplessly what if river never returned idea be too vast for yet remained with long after shunker have gone to sow same seed of mischief in other mind did deftly taking care not to turn screw too tightly at first lest must bring down on villager final argument of stick reason given by laird of inverawe for hanging laird of inverie that just didna like have be given before now a fair cause for doing unfortunate usurer to death with quarterstaff so shunker did not disturb primeval calm too rudely nevertheless a paused for night ere returning to

be free to go own way when summer came if sluice be made constant supply of water insured old man woman must at least escape starvation john raby who have found pathan singularly intelligent with knowledge of levelling learnt from poor dick have so far given confidence that knew what ought to be done be not well enough up in whole matter to understand that master have considerable excuse for refusing to do a matter of fact dam have be constructed with great care so a to avoid cutting off water supply from neighbouring village where flood came with fair regularity john raby have even spent money in improving chance on certain condition about indigo well knew must eventually be of enormous benefit to people in regard to further afield have made very fair proposal mainly owing to shunker machination have rejected briefly have offered constant supply of water at price of little labour few reasonable concession when refused term smiled went on building dam up to certain flood point knew

question of frequency of flood in past year must be decided one way other felt certain that sight of surrounding prosperity must have overcome opposition afzul khan however only half in secret believed that sluice gate might be made by appeal to major marsden when latter came to factory took day leave on purpose to rouse old khan to action being quite hopeless to expect to ask favour of john raby of whom never spoke save with gibe perhaps thought of seeing familiar face influenced old man for when argument reached usual climax of child khan sahib what of child gave fierce sigh

long short of more unpopular than need be for somehow people have got idea must help if chose why did marsden put appeal in waste paper basket a do instead of raising hope by referring to have be referring to husband looked at laughed be not going to give away in confidence a said before be awfully sorry came out way chanced on village be worst about here for that there be need for anxiety

nobody foul now out of goodness righteousness charitableness be one thing to be told to find comfort in a day passed belle grew more more uneasy felt sure must not be fair square that there must be antagonistic element at work to make unpopularity so intense perhaps because watched for so keenly seemed to discontent showed more more freely on face of people did meet in now limited walk one evening have bad five minute listening to row in cooly quarter with husband clear voice dominating clamour be still pale when came whistling through garden a if nothing have happened be only said war of word between kirpo afzul there have always be jealousy between latter declaring that hideous female be not worthy to touch man bread for former have risen by favour from mere cooliedom to act a cook for gang of hindu worker woman retorting that hillmen be better than pirate ready despite profession of horror at meat prepared by idolater to steal supply if back be turned afzul have of late be growing idle uppish so john have sided with kirpo in particular dispute think kirpo be rather uppish too replied belle heard ordering of men about a if be mistress husband laughed easily just like native fact being that kirpo be useful to at present by giving information can rely upon presumes on fact when flood have come will be able to dispense with with variety of thing in fact will not be sorry hate being beholden to people belle bent head over work sewed faster like afzul like kirpo like unpopularity least of oh john must not give way little be sure philip now look here belle said just now that hated being beholden to one made enough to do when borrowed money from marsden have fussed worried about ever since because think consented for sake perhaps did so mean to show must have consented for own call that laudable ambition must satisfy pride now in opinion only road to success lie way that think must settle matter once for of course be not infallible unless something very unexpected turn up will be laughing at own fear time two month now a told kirpo to come up to office a soon a be dark let get peace quiet first think haydn must suit to day there be forced sentiment in jolly old chap so belle played haydn john dozed in chair till darkness settled deep enough to hide kirpo a stole through bye path to office verandah there behind creeper hung pillar waited till john tall figure showed at writing table then went forward raising bamboo chick said softly be here huzoor right come in shut door one hiding in oleander bush in full view of incident muttered curse settled down in new position so what shunker have said be true disfigured a be kirpo still kept hold on shaitan sahib for promise have made to usurer not to anticipate great revenge brewing for john raby discomfiture ramu for be once more out of prison must have asked nothing better than to have waited patiently till kirpo appeared again then in darkness to have fallen on killed outright a be sat

flesh truly venomous dangerous animal to be lurking among white oleander in belle paradise a sat playing haydn john with contemptuous smile on face be listening to kirpo tale knew good deal did kirpo not did not know for instance that husband lay among oleander else might have hesitated in playing part of spy though be coward revengeful desire be keen by by came out crouching shadowy figure followed through garden then struck across barren plain to village john raby have described a worst of lot village of belle used persistently to dream village where even child looked at with eye of hate husband did not dream of anything used to sleep sleep of just wake fresh a lark to pursuit of one reality in life money even in pursuit be content because occupied so thoroughly that have time to notice minor detail sometimes belle irritated instant after must smile be way woman especially good woman have must not help sometimes fell foul in spirit of senior partner not for long what be such triviality in comparison with main fact of general success belle be good wife marsden good friend above concern be good concern rattling good business john raby have plucked plum out of shunker very hand that last thought be always provocative of smile meanwhile lala be smiling too reappearance of ramu who seemed to keep virtue for purpose of procuring ticket of leave have considerably strengthened usurer hand by providing with one absolutely reckless tool when time came for setting fire to carefully laid train must not have to seek for match that when one have to deal with slow brained peasant be great gain with such leader looked forward confidently to mischief sooner later kirpo might tell tale there be tale shunker meant to keep secret till right moment came for turning passive opposition into active interference chapter xxiv belle paradise did not last long in le than three week hot wind came to shrivel bursting bud turn even promise of blossom into sign of death

to end fault wondered a sent off telegram asking philip to come if must get leave chose telegram more because relieved from necessity of giving reason than from desire to save time so accelerate explanation dreaded yet when late in evening of next day john coming from factory told with certain elation in voice that river be on rise clasped hand nervously wished philip have wing next day found going to verandah whence must see sandy flat wondering if distant streak of water be indeed creeping nearer barometer falling fast so be afraid philanthropy come little too late belle said john when

save lot of bother remember be reply to pendennis about mother tear must have made weep good deal say pen enormement mon cher ' few minute later have left with kindly good bye recommendation to take thing easy a did a walked up down verandah waiting for philip arrival asked more than once whether must not be wiser to follow john advice now that last chance of remedy be over for present why must give pain of acknowledging that condemned husband action drifting way that in current of thought a many thing swept from mooring be drifting in flood beneath eye have reached no certain conclusion when even tread of horse have sent to meet philip brought back to action with strange dread of herself be beside in instant though have worded telegram so a to avoid anxiety be clearly evident in face well what be said still holding outstretched hand of welcome looking into face curiously nothing answered hurriedly nothing in least important only wanted to see come in must be tired that beast have such rough pace must have sent suleiman be lame come in tea be ready so ran on philip who to say sooth have be on tenter hook ever since receipt of summons have to fall into mood not without certain

to dull endurance by consciousness of own impotence to aid nay more with very desire to help killed by awful knowledge that men have flung aside a something beneath manhood have thrown face downward on sofa where lay with clenched hand striving to regain power of thought action yet in very effort driving to greater helplessness by wild insistence that time be passing that must decide must do something huzoor started to foot found afzul beside with outstretched hand sight by rousing physical fear brought back courage never failed at such time well asked boldly be not come to hurt huzoor to

blinded by sand scarcely thought of safety only that might get there in time only in time dear god only in time to show that be brave also lurid yellow of dust storm have darkened lightened everything to same dull tint sand beneath foot sky above swaying tree between seemed like shadow thrown upon screen own flying figure only reality in empty world of dream not sound save broad rush of wind not sight save dim dust hazed path bordered by shrivelled flower then beyond garden long curve of dam deeper sinking into dun coloured soil of frantic foot running with a ran swirl dimple of yellow river angry for silence if only might be in time there in centre of curve like swarm of bee shifting crowding pressing be that john fair head in centre if wind be only other way might have heard now even if

flood have come remarked that people must be taken by surprise said truly corollary drew from premise that be to be congratulated on good luck be not so sure for there be time when unforeseen act a spur to who when prepared often lack courage of action be case with large body of malcontent whom shunker da aided of late by lieutenant ram lal have be diligently instructing in necessity for resistance at proper time vague formula of sort be very different thing in eye of stolid law abiding peasant from resolution to day hour minute have to set aside inherited endurance ancestral calm fight so have flood come in due course after due warning be more than probable that even ram lal reckless desire for revenge must have failed to excite people to organised attack on new dam towards shunker machination have tended in saw at least temporary ruin to enemy plan fate however provided element of surprise to slow brained rebel seemed to leave choice beyond instant revolt instant submission aided by ram lal envoy news that river be rising travelled fast down depression of cultivated land along given high flood mark water might be expected be assertion wanting that flood mark have already be reached during past two day benefit neutralised by raby sahib unholy contrivance by dawn band of restless have begun to drift about from village to village eager to discus position by degree gaining certain coherence of intention even who hung back from idea of active interference joining crowd out of curiosity so increasing quantity of human tinder ready for ignition by smallest spark before noon khan mahomed lateef khan looking out from ruined tower saw cloud of dust beyond bare brown field ere long be in parley with recruiting band not swore old man fiercely be not day for honest blow son god smite who smote must tell so much son must learn father wisdom ye be fool let one of give one rupee after manner of wedding go purchase slithering lie of pleader then may ye have justice in sahib court not otherwise besides look ye shunker be in jackal ramu by twelve imaum hate worse than raby sahib ram lal hath cause retorted villainous looking goldsmith hailing from village where belle have be pelted by child hindu khan sahib be peace lover till touch woman old mussulman burst into scornful laugh best not chatter thus to gurdit inwillah there have be time when honest blow with good sword have brought faithful many hindu peri quarrel not so go way fool like sheep to slaughter if so wisdom teach bide at home nay khan sahib expostulated that very peru with whom shunker have begun work go not to for slaughter mean to petition first to marsden sahib who come to day so pathan hath given out what interrupted khan with frown hath returned then go ye doubly to slaughter for there be one who dallies not with word know how to smite if come to blow know side good sword there bide at home despite urgent importunity must consent even to join who favoured petition doubt racial disinclination to be mixed up with idolater have something to do with refusal beyond there be stronger desire to give help to shunker stronger than be that liking for sheer pluck make native regiment recruited from martial race led by englishman trust well nigh perfection of warlike weapon many record bear witness to fact none more so than story of ahmad kheyl when for englishman voice steady response of indian soldier tale might have be writ disaster instead of victory perhaps of three thousand ghazies who on day dashed like avalanche down hill side on to thin brown line guarding mistaken retreat of red coat may have expected colour to side with colour if so paid dearly for error be pluck with pluck word retreat be damned stand fast men attributed rightly wrongly to englishman not mentioned in despatch be sufficient to weld two nationality into wall broke force of one of most desperate charge ever made at least so run story out of despatch khan mahomed lateef khan then retreated growling to tumbledown roof betook inconsequently to polishing up sword hour afterwards however suddenly bade old fatma bring company raiment with medal clasp of dead son sewn on then said brief farewell to child left woman without word went over to borrow pink nosed pony of pleader father who being government accountant be of course discreetly at home why didst not make thy son take up case without payment asked old man wrathfully a neighbour held stirrup for to mount then must not have have to go in mine old age strive for peace mark for peace a rode off old sword clattered merrily about old leg smiled thinking of gift given when light of eye lay sick in mem arm sword be for hers according to oath said to god know may be peace will do naught to hinder with marsden sahib allah akbar at least worship stock stone like pig so behind gathering cloud of witness hidden in gathering dust came pink nosed pony ready for peace war odds for one other flickered up down dozen time a village after village sent held back contingent finally flared up conclusively with advent of ramu at head of particular villain armed not only with stick stone with pick shovel like spark among tinder suggestion flamed through mass why waste time in word when without blow except at solid earth must bring flood into own channel since afzul gang have declared in favour of people so said ramu peasant be only too ready to believe seeing that pick shovel be more to mind than blow thus while trio of alien to whom that low curve of earthwork meant so much be talking laughing over lunch dam be being assailed by swarm of men eager for destruction almost at same time khan sahib spurring pink nosed pony to overseer hut found afzul asleep pretending to sleep perhaps hint of bribery be true perhaps pathan thought crisis be needed at event be too crafty to show hand to stern old patron set off ostensibly to give alarm at house summon gang who by curious coincidence happened to be employed mile so further up river not till saw messenger reach verandah did khan seek scene of action pick shovel indeed well plowman have right to use such weapon must stand by see fair play how afzul fulfilled mission have already be told also result of john raby appeal for help to philip marsden to say that former must not believe eye when on first turning out of garden caught sight of crowd gathered on dam be feeble description of absolutely incredulous wrath overpowered have be prepared for opposition perhaps even for attack when such attack be reasonable that fool madman must propose to cut channel with full weight of flood on dam be inconceivable a ran back for revolver savage joy at danger to worker merged with rage at possible ruin of labour fierce determination by word warning threat to avert worst must not be such fool such insensate idiot a passed workman hut on return shouted to afzul getting reply ran on with curse at traitor be alone against despite must prevail a neared crowd bare headed revolver in hand felt wild desire to fire without word kill one matter whom suspicion however that attack must not proceed from anything revenge have grown upon became conviction a saw that largest portion of enemy be of ruck men who never did hand turn who even now stood by applauding while others plied spade mattock in latter in stolid wisdom experience lay best chance slipped revolver to pocket instantly stop fool shouted stop peru gunga where be wit flood flood be too strong then recognising old khan appealed instinctively to for support stop khan sahib be old wise tell be madness a spoke reaching growing gap leapt down into wrested spade from man nearest to be yielded almost without resistance murmur ran through bystander worker dug faster jodha boota dhurma rose john voice again singling out men knew to be cultivator be folly tell be folly khan sahib know not answered other moodily 't be shovel not sword work have right to water before god sahib have right to so much before god will have more than want interrupted that eager tone something in intelligent decision arrested one two of older worker looked round at swirling waste of river hesitated ti craft cried ramu excitedly showing for first time know raby well on on brother have wile for men a well a for woman revolver came out of john raby pocket again swiftly ominous surge together of crowd showed that must be last resource when else have failed now there be step behind coming down embankment hard fast next instant philip voice with ring of accustomed command in came sharp listen first of who put spade to ground god save soul from damnation native be essentially dramatic very turn of speech where imperative remains intact even when have filtered through other lip show to be so philip marsden with intimate knowledge of year counted not unwisely on characteristic for effect surprise appearance of one who in vague way considered of right sort certainty that voice heard meant what said produced general pause among digger pause during mahomed lateef drew sword gently from scabbard listen again cried philip put down spade will have justice promise even a spoke john raby gave quick excited cry back marsden back dam be cracking back for god sake be too late let fool be sprang up gap a did so man sprang after be ramu ready for deed have come to do fearful lest by unexpected flight prey might escape glance of knife cry more of surprise than pain john raby twisting round in last desire to get at assassin overbalanced fell headlong down into ditch next instant before philip revolver must single out criminal old khan sword swirled above high turban allah hukk allah akbar god be right might fervour of youth rang in familiar war shout memory of youth must have nerved hand for ramu head heeled over on shoulder in ghastly fashion a doubled up beneath force of blow ere fell ground beneath split a if for grave with hiss of water pouring through crack loosened soil gave way on side philip bounding down to reach fallen friend felt sudden dizziness a solid earth swirled round split up broke into island then with awful swiftness while crowd fought frantically for crumbling foothold dam like child sand castle before incoming wave broadened sank melted disappeared leaving nothing sheet of water racing madly to find old haunt then be when scene in life seemed bound up disappeared bodily from before eye that belle raby threw up hand forgot whole world for time philip strong swimmer a be struggled hard with underdraw ere rose to surface shook mud water from eye looked about many wretch swept past shrieking for aid searched for something even amid own danger must not think of without curse once twice thrice dived after hint hope then coming on mahomed lateef drifting half unconsciously down stream gave up useless search buoying old man head against shoulder struck out for back eddy be so spent when reached shore that must with difficulty drag burden to dry warm sand sink down beside whole incident have passed so rapidly that seemed instant since have be running down embankment eager to be in time have be in time for what suddenly remembered belle staggered to foot storm be darker than ever aided by afternoon shadow wrapped everything in dim twilight hid save immediate foreground still must see from ebb of flood in front of that great mass of upheld water must have surged first in forward direction then recoiled to find lower level lay at right angle thus seemed probable that many of swept away in great rush might have be left high dry quarter of mile so lower down in case nothing be more likely than further attack on house for once blood have be shed that of engaged must have lost life seemed certain even proverbially placid peasantry of india loses head belle therefore must be found not merely to tell of calamity to secure safety instant after thought flashed upon philip marsden be making way to house stumbling a ran through heavy sand in teeth of choking dust storm men even strong men have in storm lost way be smothered to death a sought shelter in hollow philip be too set on purpose to think of pausing belle belle cried a ran up verandah step burst into drawing room be not there belle belle want there be reply absence of servant deserted verandah did not surprise news fly fast among people belle be possible too have ventured out perhaps along dam very thought turned sick with fear dashed into room calling on again again thousand one delicate token of presence hit hard by contrast with idea of out there alone perhaps swirling down awful stream with seemed to be still struggling belle belle be out of house once more through garden down by hut be year minute ago that have passed that way running a now to be in time be past present nothing bad dream one of endless night from unknown horror survive thousand check go on on despite perpetual escape be not dream last time there have be low curve of earth before where now nothing showed save dim yellow flood sliding so smoothly that seemed to have be sliding there since time began step bringing nearer to brought nearer also to despair then just a have given up hope on very brink so close that one clenched hand hung over water found lying a have fallen found none too soon for even a stooped to raise few inch of loosened soil undermined by current fell with dull splash realised that ere long river must have turned forgetfulness to death lifting a best must in arm paused instant to consider what have best be done one thing be certain neither house hut be safe until time showed temper of survivor yet help remedy of sort must have shelter too from storm night thought of kirpo decided not to trust lucky decision since to seek must have be waste of time a recognising husband among rioter have fled into jungle with child servant might be found if fear have not dispersed where in meantime be to leave belle at last thought returned to old khan be faithful if have recovered might at least keep watch while philip sought other help besides not far from where have left old man philip have noticed reed shanty built against abutment of dam so hidden from sight of save coming from side determined therefore to carry belle thither if must find mahomed lateef to leave in charge be easy task for belle unconscious a be proved awkward burden over rough road be great relief to be able to lay down at last in comparative shelter assure that be still alive for a have struggled on dead weight in arm have filled with apprehension next thing be to find khan here fate proved kind within few yard of shanty philip came upon battling against wind yet finding breath for running fire of curse on idolater to cut short gratitude explain what be wanted took moment next saw philip hurrying towards house again since if rioter returned time might run short did despite hurry so after vainly searching for servant be still rummaging for more ammunition most potent weapon of for money when sound of advancing voice warned to be off thanks to almost blinding dust there be little fear of being seen in retreat yet when on reaching shanty found belle still quite unconscious recognised that most difficult part of task have yet to come have brought back few comfort snatched up hastily a made escape now set to work to force few drop of brandy down throat wrap in warmer garment chafe cold hand foot to do so have to unclasp finger of right hand by force withdraw something held in without giving glance slipped into breast pocket of coat so continued effort after time colour became le deathlike moaned once twice turning head aside a if to escape from distasteful sight beyond there be change hope of recovering shock sufficiently to aid in own escape seemed very slender did philip wonder at collapse when thought of what must have be for to stand by helpless see who have left in anger swept away into unforgiveness of death huzoor whispered old khan who in deference to inviolable custom have be sitting with averted face in doorway where shivering from chill of wind through wet clothes have be considering position carefully must get out of to sit here will have crippled with ague by dawn there be pony will go fetch from hut perchance may not see perchance must not touch if did for ramu man

a only available bridge over cut from river lay few yard further on sheltered by high grass philip eye be practically useless to pony hoof being deadened by sand needed low whistle from khan to bring

gave rider more trouble than be like to do now if be ready huzoor for though 't be dark enough there will be blaze ere long low caste pig leather working dog have got to sahib brandy bottle know what that mean did try to stop asked philip when after crossing bridge in silent anxiety struck into comparative safety of jungle old man grunted softly anger tempered by necessity for caution by twelve imaum said be afraid mahomed lateef syyed be sneaking away never even called pig despite anxiety philip must not resist smile partly of confidence for better proof of khan resolution to bring belle safely out of trouble must have be found than unparalleled meekness so went on swiftly philip at bridle rein old khan supporting belle partly on arm partly by dexterous arrangement of scabbard over old man chuckled a if in contented reminiscence of bygone day 't be a said huzoor remarked pointing to red flush rising behind be bungalow roof 't be well be out of so far philip thinking of horror of

belle hand in hut question a to how afzul have come by be in philip opinion too clear especially when inquiry proved that pathan have at rate be on peiwar pas about time of murder so far good remainder however be more puzzling philip felt that belle made wise decision in refusing to disturb existing arrangement until a put time must show what ought to do doctor strongly advised going home to england a soon a advent of rain must make long railway journey to bombay possible complete change must give best chance of recovering shock must then see with own eye how money have be spent what

atmosphere of civilisation culture say perhaps if so civilisation with advantage be apt to smell nasty saw man woman standing opposite other in london lodging in london fog five minute before philip have come into buoyantly decisively bringing with memory of sunshine purer air now stood with back to grey square of window hand stretched out to in something between command entreaty belle put down child let speak to then for first time have gone over to with child still in arm kissed jack will not trouble dear said be such quiet wee mite come let sit down talk over now when lover fall to talking hand in hand be proper even in novel to avert one head smile saying that conversation can have possible interest to outsider if sentence two be suggested be necessary to insist that love divine love can only find first expression in mere foolishness belle philip therefore must evidently not have be lover for talked serious sound good sense while year old jack with wide wistful eye lay

unnecessary husband must marry set everything right mirk fog settled very closely round a sate by fire closer on philip than on belle for be turn to be scared by phantom of foregone conclusion what have strenuously denied when position ran counter to pride seemed true enough now that joined issue with loved belle so of course must want to marry two thing be synonymous when of course there be
