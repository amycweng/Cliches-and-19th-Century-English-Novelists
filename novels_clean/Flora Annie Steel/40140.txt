dark sky kate erlton drove alone a generally did be one of woman whose refinement stand in way who be gourmet of life failing to see that very fastidiousness of palate argues keener delight in pleasure than of who take more simply perhaps more coarsely a drove mind diverted listlessly to semicircle of dark face have left unanswered what have wanted nothing worth hearing doubt nothing be worth much in weary land of exile where heart hunger for one little face voice gnawed at vitality day night for kate erlton set down discontent to fact that be separated from boy yet have sent home of own free will to keep from growing up in least like father have stayed with father simply to keep within pale of respectability for boy sake be what told allowed nothing for own disappointment nothing for keen craving for sentiment lay behind refinement asked from fate be that future might be worse than past so that must keep up fiction to end a drove sudden sound made start for soldier wife though

walk up down room thoughtfully then to pause before wish to believe said that want really to understand truth ca because know one thing know if love husband not raised head quickly with fear behind resentment of eye put outside question too have told that already be simplest best way bowed cynically came nearer to truth than evasion if wish certainly then there be boy want to prevent from realizing that father be let twist sentence what father be have expect sent away for purpose so far good will concealment of mine suffice will one else blab truth even if concealment succeeds along line will prevent boy from following in father step if have inherited father nature a well a face must be deterrent in case to know early in life that such instinct ca be indulged with impunity in society of gentleman will never have courage to keep boy out of life altogether a be doing now sooner later will bring back will bring back then on threshold of life will have example of successful

rude paused in half jesting word stooped over outstretched hand kissed kate stood looking at hand with slight frown after horse hoof died away then with smile shut jewel case not that closed incident also for full hour later be still going over detail of past interview everything seemed to hinge on unforeseen appeal of hers for chance of atonement on unpremeditated strange suggestion that spirit might even then be moving on face of water until in room gay with english flower peaceful utterly in air of security terror seized on body soul causeless terror making strain eye ear a if for hint of what be to come make coward hero of there be only flowerful garden beyond arched veranda only soft gurgle of dove yet sat with quivering nerve till sight of gardener coming a usual with watering pot

on bias so that wo pucker a turned away felt vast relief of being able to think of such triviality again after strain stress of hour since husband have come home from race course full of excited malediction on mean underhand bribery spying might make necessary for to send in paper if must kate have heard story of similar character before since major erlton knew by experience that have reputation more at heart than have that brain be clearer tact greater than have never heard one so hopeless unless jockey greyman who husband said be so mixed up with native intrigue a to have amount of false evidence at command must be silenced labor of year be ruined so long after husband have gone off to bed to sleep soundly heavily after manner of men kate have lain awake in hers after manner of woman resolving to risk even to certain extent honesty in order to silence man adventurer who doubt be not one whit better than husband now a mind flashed back over interview one thing stood out above others be bearing deference of man a have stooped to kiss hand for life of who protested even to herself that such thing have part in life must not help joy in remembrance quick recognition that

passed jim douglas who stood up pushing chair aside to give more room be so glad major erlton managed to get leave be such coward must have died of fright by in long lonely keep still interrupted peremptory voice behind a pair of swift unceremonious arm seized round waist by sheer force dragged back step then held tight clasped to something beat fast despite calm tone kill snake someone there right at foot be branch saw move stir mr gissing be right might be heart felt beat hard one beneath hand gave bound then seemed to stand still a stick stave hastily caught up smote furiously on very dress so close did certain death lie to there be faint scent of lavender about dress about curly hair jim douglas never forgot just a never forgot passionate admiration made hand relax to infinite tenderness when uttered cry no sound when there be need to hold so still did stand so absolutely in unison with defiance of fate kept steady a rock surely one in life thought have ever stood so close to yet so far off god bless soul dear lady what escape hurried faltering exclamation from bystander heralded holding up of long limp rope of thing hanging helplessly over stick be signal for perfect babel many have seen brute have thought branch others have similar experience of drowsy snake scorched out of winter quarter in hollow log crowded round mr gissing loud in praise of coolness only turned quickly to see who have held found major erlton brute have touched have began huskily then broke into almost sob of relief god what escape glanced at with faint distaste expression of strong emotion showed toward by man always provoked gave one of high irrelevant laugh be may die worse death want where be slipped away from gratitude expect said collector will betray be man who knew about chupatties sir theophilus know name douglas said host be in camp mile two down jheel expect have gone back seemed nice fellow mr gissing made moue must not have be so grateful a must only have said

tent have be for jim douglas be already on way back to delhi on way back to more than delhi if succeeded in carrying out plan have suggested to when heard of general hearsey belief that priest conducting agitation against widow remarriage abolition of suttee be leagued with mohammedan revival tara must be saint be still in delhi have not sought out before being in truth angry with woman duplicity not wanting to run risk of chattering about now a have said whole position be changed have common hold upon might through get useful hint a to leading men in movement must have seen when miracle took place at benares thought made smile rather savagely decidedly must not care to defy tongue from saint to sinner must be too great fall so at dusk very evening be back in mendicant disguise begging at doorway in one of oldest part of delhi insignificant doorway in insignificant alley there be faded wreath of yellow marigold over architrave deeper hollow in stone threshold sure sign that something to attract worshiping foot lay within yet at first sight court into entered after brief passage barred by blank wall be much a other court be set round with high irregular house perfect rabbit warren of tiny room slip of roof stair conglomerate yet distinct reached from within from without from neighboring roof heaven know how possibly by wing after fashion of purple pigeon cooing sidling on purple brick cornice in one corner however stood huge peepul tree partly shaded by partly attached to arcaded building of two story be small squalid looking black stone hindoo temple be not more than ten foot square triply recessed at corner with pointed spire continuing recess of base sort of hollow monolith raised on plinth of three step in dark windowless sanctuary open to outside world by tingle arch stood polished black stone resting on polished black stone cup like large acorn for be oldest shivala in delhi in rabbit warren surrounding survival of baal worship lived lodged yogi beggar saint insanity sacerdotalism of delhi be not place into to venture rashly so jim douglas sat at gate begging while clashings brayings drumings echoed out into alley for seven fold circling of lamp be going on if tara did not pas to evening service from outside most likely lived within that lodged near temple knew so a sat waiting watching light faded faint smell of incense grew fainter stream of worshiper coming to take holy water in god have be washed slackened then by two three brahmin yogi dean chapter a be passed out clinking half penny carrying offertory in kind tied up in service be over tara must therefore live in lodging reached from within now when coast be clearing might still have opportunity of tracing so rose walked in boldly disappointed to find courtyard be almost empty already there be only few straggler mostly woman in white shroud of widow even in gloom shadow must see tall figure sought be not among be about to slip away when following look caught sight of figure crouching on topmost step of plinth right in front of sanctuary door so that stood faintly outlined against glimmer of single cresset raised on heap of half dead flower within showed nothing more nothing shadow drew back hastily into empty arcade waited for widow lingering bare foot scarcely heard even on echoing stone to pas out leave tara alone for be tara that knew though face be turned from foot lingered on making fear lest of mendicant who must lodge in arcade must return after almsgiving time find there a lingered thought how have best make known to devotee saint must be something dramatic something to tie tongue at once something to bring home to hold upon locket slipped from neck stood ready then a last flutter of white disappeared stepped noiselessly across court so suddenly between rapt face dim light on eye be fixed dangling gold oval englishman bending over woman shoulder from behind must see amaze flash to face other hand be ready with clutch of command tongue with swift threat be too quick for be round at foot in instant clasping master master jim douglas recoiled from that touch once more with half shamed surprise regret almost remorse have meant to threaten woman now be up again eager excited huzoor be not safe here may return moment quick quick huzoor follow a blindly obeyed passing rapidly through low doorway so up dark staircase slipped locket back to place with sort of groan here be woman to be reckoned with though discovery suited purpose though knew to be a safe a woman wit must make wondered irritably if there be anything in

day by day darker more lowering until yellowing crop seem to grow greener in sheer hope of purple pall above then unseen hand juggle portentous rain cloud into daily darkness of night dawn rise clear dry to show in fierce blaze of sunlight how yellow have gained on green so day by day impression grew among elect that storm signal must pas that best policy be to tide over next few month somehow in pursuance of sepoy who ventured to draw attention to state of feeling in one regiment be publicly told need expect promotion there be dissentients to policy apparently anyhow in end of april colonel carmichael smyth commanding d bengal cavalry at meerut returned from leave one evening ordered fifteen men from troop to be picked out to learn use of new cartridge next morning then went to bed

closing in round people blocking way in front so passed on to wide northern parade ground with hollow square ready three side of threatening weapon fourth of unarmed men in center eighty five picked men of picked regiment knot of european spectator round flag listened with yawn to stout general exordium eighty five being hopelessly helplessly in wrong by military law there seemed to be need to insist on fact mass of dark face standing within range of loaded gun rifle within reach of glistening saber did not listen at not that mattered since unit in crowd have lost power of accepting fact even soma standing to attention beside tumbril only felt great sense of outrage of wrong of injustice somewhere there be one englishman at least rigid to attention also before disarmed dismounted yet loyal troop who must have felt also unless be more than human be captain craigie who when men appealed to to save to delay unnecessary musketry parade have written in haste to adjutant go to smyth at once go to smyth smyth be colonel incredible lack of official etiquette repeated hardily moreover pray lose moment go to smyth tell what only that be most serious matter may have whole regiment in open mutiny in hour if be not attended to only that so be to be hoped that captain craigie have official wigging for unconventional appeal in pocket a shared regiment disgrace to serve a warning consolation now pompous monotone being ended silence coming after clankings buglings trampings have be going on since dawn be almost oppressive three side of steel even fourth of face however showed sign stood a stone while eighty five be stripped of uniform there be more to come by general order leg iron be to be riveted on one by one so once more sound of iron upon iron recurred monotonously making silence of interval still more oppressive for prisoner at first seemed stunned by isolation from even a yet unfettered comrade suddenly from single throat came that cry for justice have claim to hearing at least in estimation of people of india dohai dohai dohai soma gave sort of sigh faint quiver of expectation passed over sea of dark face clang clang hammer going on unchecked be only answer three side of stone have come to see thing done must be done sooner better riveting of eighty five pair of leg iron be not to be done in moment so cry grew clamorous dohai dohai have not fought faithfully in past have not be deceived have have fair chance hammer went on a sun climbed out of dust haze to gleam on sloped saber glint on loaded gun send glittering streak of light along rifle so cry changed be comrade coward to stand by see tyranny raise finger of help oh curse on 't be who be degraded dishonored curse on colonel who have forced to curse on white face curse on face stood by one close to general flag broke suddenly into passionate resentment jim douglas drew out watch looked at gathered rein together hour forty five minute already be off ridgeway ca stand d d folly more dear fellow speak lower if general care who hears retorted jim douglas recklessly a steered through crowd followed by friend say be d d inconceivable folly tyranny come on let have gallop for god sake get rid of devilish sound echo of horse resounding hoof covered obliterated wind of own swiftness seemed to blow tension away so after spin due north for mile two paused at edge of field where ox be circling placidly round on threshing floor group of woman be taking advantage of gustiness to winnow bare brown arm glistened above falling shower of golden grain unabashed smiling face showed against cloud of golden chaff drifting behind jim douglas looked at for moment returned salaam of men driving ox forking straw then turned horse toward cantonment again be nothing to be one comfort said will have to suffer for in end expect who will believe when time come that gave backward wave of hand went on unwittingly of companion following look ahead to where in far distance faint cloud of dust telling of many foot hung on horizon said suddenly a if sight brought remembrance by george douglas how steady sepoys stood half expected row steadier than must remarked other grimly well hope smyth be satisfied to return from leave drive regiment into mutiny in twelve hour be record performance hearer who be civilian gave deprecating cough be bit hard surely happen to know that heard while on leave story about concerted rising later on may have done purposely to force hand jim douglas shrugged shoulder did warn what be about to do did allow time to prepare others for private mutiny dear ridgeway be put on official record two month ago organized scheme for resistance existed in regiment between calcutta peshawur so smyth might at least have consulted colonel of other two regiment at meerut a be business have strained loyalty of most loyal to uttermost deserve to suffer do indeed mince matter certainly said civilian dryly why must anybody mince why ca admit boldly c in c did on sly other day that cartridge be suspicious that leave muzzle covered with fat like tallow why admit be tallow at first why not at rate admit be in hole instead of refusing to take common precaution of having ammunition wagon loaded up for fear must be misconstrued into alarm be there medium between bribing child with lollipop torturing keeping on strain under fire a be for hour watching best friend punished unjustly unjustly yes to mind unjustly know what forcible injustice mean to child be really child simple ignorant obstinate have come back to cantonment again be rapidly overtaking now empty tumbril going home for parade be over further down road raising cloud of dust from shackled foot eighty five be being marched jailward under native escort well said civilian dryly must give great deal to know what simple babe really thought of hate stock block for time must replied jim douglas be passing tumbril at moment one of guard in sergeant uniform looked up in joyful recognition huzoor be civilian looked at companion oddly when after minute two spent in answering soma inquiry a to where how master be to be found jim douglas rode alongside once more out bit eh said dryly very much out be queer lot do remember story of self made american who be told boast relieved almighty of great responsibility well be only responsible for one half of twice born other be due to humanity to heredity what will be what make high caste men so difficult to deal with be twice born yes be queer lot repeated remark with even greater fervor twelve hour later when about midnight started on return ride to delhi for though have spent whole day in listening have scarcely heard word of blame for scene have roused to wrath that morning sepoys have gone about duty a if nothing have happened despite undoubted presence of lot of loose character in bazaar there have be no disturbance laughed cynically to at waste of day must have be better spent in horse dealing however settled if intolerable tyranny failed to rouse action there must be immediate danger ahead to big cantonment like biggest in northern india with two thousand british troop in even prospect of rising be not serious at delhi however where there be only native troop might have be different now felt that handful of resolute men ought to be able to hold own anywhere against such aimless invertebrate discontent felt vague disappointment that must be so that pleasant cool of night must be so quiet so peaceful be poor lot who must hing talk a rode through station mess house be still alight gay voice of guest who have be dining at large bungalow bowered in garden reached ear distinctly be sabbath already said one ought to be in bed hooray for europe morning came more boyish one breaking into carol of day within week

come to evening church mr fitzgerald interrupted reproachful feminine voice said must sing in choir did then will come will wake up for dinner besides will sit next last word came nearer softer mr fitzgerald be evidently riding home beside someone carriage pleasant peaceful indeed that clank of sentry here there only giving greater sense of security not that be needed for here beyond cantonment house of clerk civilian lay a peaceful a secure in veranda of one of close to road bearer be walking up down crooning patient lullaby to restless fair haired child in arm truly there must be fear be talk set spur to horse went on through silent night at hand gallop for have beast awaiting halfway wished to be in delhi by dawn there be row of tall tree bordering road on side making dark through swiftly passing bole level country stretched to paler horizon like sea a rode sat in judgment in thought on dead level people who lived in stagnant featureless dead sea mere waste of water without form void not even ready for spirit to move over for if morning work left apathetic moulvie of fyzabad need preach voice of god for surely sense of injustice to others must be strongest motive surest word to conjure with dull dead beat of iron upon fetter of others still seemed to hear surest call to battle paused in thought wondering if what fancied heard be echo from memory real sound real undoubtedly be distant clang of iron bell upon ox meant that must be seven eight mile out halfway to next stage so meeting usual stream of night traffic toward meerut passed two three string of large looming half seen wain without drawing bridle then pulled up almost involuntarily to trot at curiously even tread of drove of iron shod ox low chanted song from behind bunjarah folk rough voice familiar rhythm of hoof reminded of many pleasant night march in company good journey brother called in dialect answer came unerringly dark though be lord keep huzoor safe made smile a remembered that of course lone man trotting horse along highroad at night be bound to be alien in country where horse be ambled traveler go in two three so rough broad face must be smiling over surprise of sahib knowing bunjarah talk unless indeed happened to be possibility of being tanda knew have not occurred to before pulled up looked round breathless shadow be at stirrup fancied saw shadow two further behind huzoor have mistaken road came tiddu familiar creak meerut lie to north breathless a be there be pompous mystery in voice always prefaced attempt to extort money jim douglas having further use for old scoundrel did not intend to give so simulated utter lack of surprise hello tiddu said have idea might be so recognized voice old man laughed huzoor be mighty clever know old tiddu have eye saw huzoor horse bay wazeerie with white star none too small luck mark waiting at fifteenth milestone by begum bad huzoor being so clever be not going to ride wazeerie to night be going to ride belooch be on back to meerut though star on forehead be too small for safety thumb must cover be bit too late to teach luck mark tiddu said jim douglas coolly want money ruffian so suppose have something to sell what be if be worth anything can trust to pay surely tiddu looked round furtively other shadow jhungi bhungi perhaps memory made jim douglas smile have melted away into darkness tiddu be alone old man even so reached up to whisper 't be yellow fakir huzoor have come yellow fakir echoed hearer who devil be why must come if like tiddu paused a if in sheer amaze for second huzoor have not heard of yellow fakir dumb fakir who brings speech brings more than speech wah speech be more than speech echoed jim douglas angrily then paused in turn phrase reminded vaguely of past thought tiddu hand went out to belooch rein voice lost creak took soft sing song to mare seemed to come round of own accord yea speech be more than speech though be dumb whence come none know not even many faced can see when come others not unless will to be seen saw to night passed on white horse not hour agone going meerutward did not huzoor see be because have learned from old tiddu to make others see not to see old man will teach also if be in meerut by dawn if be there by dawn will see yellow fakir who brings speech brings more than speech sing song ceased belooch be stepping briskly back toward meerut infernal old humbug began jim douglas huzoor doe not believe of course remarked tiddu in most matter of fact creak meerut be only eight mile off other horse can wait if doe not see yellow fakir there be need to open purse string englishman looked at half seen companion admiringly be most consummate scoundrel blending of mystery purely commercial commonplace be perfect almost irresistible there be reason why must go on groom halfway have usual order to stay till master came for rest must be pleasant to renew old pleasant memory pleasant even to renew acquaintance with tiddu guile struck afresh time came across slipped from horse without word be about to pull rein over head so a to lead when tiddu stopped short jhungi will take to rest house huzoor bhungi will be safer so have clean cotton quilt in bundle huzoor can have shoe rub leg in dust will do till dawn gave jackal cry be echoed from darkness leave so huzoor be safe said tiddu jim douglas a obeyed heard mare whinny softly a if to foal a shadow came out of bush junghi bhungi doubt five minute after with certain unaccountable pleasure found walking beside laden bullock one arm resting on broad back foot keeping step with remittent clang of bell strange dreamy companionship a knew of old once more star seemed after time to twinkle in unison with bell seemed to forget thought to forget everything save peaceful stillness around own unresting peace so laden beast went on a one living breathing mortal till little shiver of wind came come with first paling of sky be one of yellow dawn serene cloudless save for puff two of thin gray vapor low down on horizon looking a if be smoke from unseen censer swinging before chariot of sun head procession of hour be so absorbed in watching yellow light grow to cloud no bigger than man hand so lost in strange companionship with laden beast bound to wheel of life death a be yet asking question of future that tiddu hand voice startled huzoor said yellow fakir be close on city of meerut road dipping down to cross depression left bank of yellow dust on side on eastern one outlined against yellow sunrise sat motionless figure be naked painted from head to foot bright yellow color closed eye be daubed over so a to hide utterly on forehead a be in image of siva be painted perpendicularly gigantic eye wide set stony before in dust lay beggar bowl for road part here huzoor said tiddu to city to cantonment a spoke handsome young fellow came swaggering down latter on way evidently to riotous living in bazaar suddenly paused hand went up to eye a if rising sun be in then stepped across road dropped coin into beggar bowl tiddu nodded head gravely that man be wanted huzoor be why saw mayhap be to give word word echoed jim douglas said be dumb meant trooper huzoor fakir wanted to give word mayhap someone must always give jim douglas felt odd thrill have never thought of before someone of course must always give word speech brought more than speech what must be something soul stirring doubt for humanity have theory that angel must trouble water so give righteous cause for stepping in to heal evil what strange knack old man have of stirring imagination with ridiculous mystery felt vexed with for own thrill own thought be very ordinary yogi must say remarked looking toward yellow sunrise figure be gone turned to tiddu again with real annoyance well whoever be can not want certainly saw willed huzoor to see replied tiddu with calm effrontery jim douglas laughed man be certainly consummate liar there be never possibility of catching out chapter vii word went forth procession of hour have weary march of between yellow sunrise yellow sunset of th of may for heaven be a brass air one flame of white heat mud hut of sepoy line at meerut looked felt like brick baking in kiln yet torpor remorseless glare of noon brings even to native humanity be exchanged for strange restlessness door stood open for most part men wandered in out aimlessly like swarming bee before queen appears in bazaar in city too crowd drifted hither thither thirstily a if be not fast month of rumzan when mohammedan be denied solace of even drop of water till sundown drifted hither thither pausing to gather closer at hint of novelty melting away again restless a ever mayhap be inevitable reaction after stun stupefaction of saturday sudden awakening to result namely that eighty five of best smartest soldier in meerut have be set to toil for ten year in shackle because refused to be defiled to become apostate on other hand old baharupa may have be right about yellow fakir silent motionless figure might have set folk listening waiting for word be to be seen by now sitting outside city at least jim douglas saw several time saw also that beggar bowl be fuller fuller impossibility of asserting that passer by saw a did haunted once idea presented to mind be always so with tiddu mystery be more susceptible to disproof than be to proof must waste time of course in case by waiting watching in natural course of event passer by must go on a if saw nothing only one in hundred so must give alms so what must be good one else however among master troubled to find cause for restlessness one even knew of to begin with be sunday so that even bond of common labor be slackened between dark face light then mile more of waste deserted land dry watercourse lay on side of broad white road split cantonment into half so that north knew nothing of what be going on in south while men be swarming like bee in sun on one side on other be shut up in barrack bungalow

contemptuously at paper brought by palace guard passed under door ordering instant opening george willoughby laughed of eight dashed people impudence cursed cheek yet after laugh head of nine walked over yet time to river bastion to look down at white streak of road how many time have looked already heaven know grave face have grown graver though brightened again after glance at lemon bush black streak there must not fail in king name open demand came from mirza moghul time for palace be without arm without ammunition if be to defend according to queen idea against corner till there be time

coward many who have spent long hour in peeping from closed door at fresh clatter in street hoping be master looked at other with startled eye helpless helpless echo of thought reached main guard still in touch with outside world whence a day dragged by fresh tidings of danger drifted down from ridge where men woman child lay huddled helplessly in flagstaff tower watching white streak of road seems like bad dream that hopeless paralyzing strain of eye for cloud of dust echo won way into magazine for simple reason that knew be not hopeless must hold own shoot that man kureem buksh please forrest if come bothering round gate again be really very annoying have told several time to keep back so be use trying to give information to people outside for head of nine be very courteous scaling ladder echoed when native superintendent told that prince finding obdurate have gone to send down from palace oh by mean let scale if like of eight hearing reply smiled grimly by mean let fly walk into parlor for if straight streak of road be really going to remain empty fuller four square wall round lemon bush must be better be sir said one of eight cheerfully a grating noise rose above hum outside be grapnel a turned to particular gun of ten told that must nick first head two with rifle keep grape for bunch so smiled at own little joke waited nine waited to gun of course there be one gun over a head of have said that must not be helped so rifle trigger clicked stock came up to shoulder then then there be sort of laugh someone said under breath well be blowed mind went back to street of london wondered how many year be since have seen lamplighter for up rope pole on roof outhouse somehow clinging like limpet running like squirrel along top of wall upsetting besieger monopolizing ladder be rush not of attack of escape let what fool who liked scale wall come into parlor of nine who knew secret of lemon bush be off safety there beside nine life insurance possible while lay ready to hand must ever see lamplighter again trivial thought be with bearded man who stood by gun real self in hidden behind reserve of courage asking other question too a waited for upward rush of fugitive to change into downward rush of foe worthy of good powder shot came at last grape came too mowing intruder down in bunch be mere rabble of city be pick of trained mutineer swarming over wall to stand on outhouse roof fire at nine so pressed in gradually from behind coming nearer nearer dropping to ground in solid rank firing in platoon so by degree hemming in nine hemming in lemon bush nine be busy with gun have to be served quickly that left time for thought then smoke flash yell curse filled up rest of world for present be last round be afraid sir sha have time for said warning voice from nine head of looked round quietly not more than forty yard now from gun barely time certainly unless have have that other man so nodded last round pealed out a recklessly a defiantly a if there have be hundred to follow hundred thousand hundred million one of gunner threw down fuse ere gun recoiled ran in lightly toward lemon tree so a to be ready for favor have begged be about full up sir came warning voice again a rest of nine fell back amid desultory rattle of small arm tinkle of last church bell a be warning folk to hurry up last invitation to walk into parlor of nine be about full up sir came that one voice wait second came head of nine ran lightly to river bastion for last look down white streak for cloud of dust how sunny be how clear how still world beyond smoke beyond flash beyond deafening yell curse gave one look at one short look only one then turned to face own world world have to keep full up indeed pyrotechnist must hope for better audience in so small place now if please someone in thick of smoke flash heard yell curse raised cap last salute a be to school schoolmaster final dismissal to scholar thousand of so about to finish lesson of what men can do to hold own someone else standing beside lemon bush bent over faithful black streak then ran for dear life from hissing of snake of fire flashing to powder magazine faint sob whispering gasp of horror came from thousand odd above came roar rush rending little puff of white smoke went skyward first then slowly majestically great cloud of rose red dust grew above ruin to hang corona glittering in slant sunbeam over school schoolmaster scholar hung there for hour to who know story seems to hang there still bloody pall for many for nine crown indeed chapter v sunset what be that question sprung to lip yet knew answer magazine have saved in main guard not six hundred yard off where very ground rocked wall shook men woman pent up since noon looked at other when first shock be over feeling that here be end of inaction here be distinct definite challenge to fate what must come of be now close on to four o'clock day be over darkness at hand what must bring if meerut with two thousand be so sore bested that must not spare one man to delhi what must mere handful hope for save annihilation yet even mr seymour only clasped baby closer said nothing for there be lack of courage anywhere kate with child in arm paused a laid down asleep at last upon officer coat to feel certain relief if be to fare thus that bitter self reproach agonizing doubt for vanished sonny be unavailing chance might well be better than theirs well indeed pent up a be cheek by jowl with four hundred unstable sepoys with ominously rising hum of unstable city on unprotected rear up on flagstaff tower crowning extreme northern end of ridge away from hum where brigadier graf have gathered together remaining woman child so a to guard a best must with such troop a have remaining many of too unstable to be trusted cityward be in better plight for have open country round country where folk must still go come with fair chance of safety since even predatory tribe always ready to take advantage of disorder be still waiting to see what master day must bring forth have also knowledge that something be being done that be not absolutely passive in hand of fate after dr batson started in disguise to summon aid from meerut must not come of above have decision have power to act while down in main guard must obey order not that flagstaff tower did much with advantage for be paralyzed by straining of eye for cloud of dust upon meerut road be damnation of delhi yet even here that decisive roar that corona of red dust brightening instant a sun dipped to horizon brought conviction that something must be done at last what hampered by woman child what must do if earlier in day have sent non combatant off toward kurnal meerut with a many faithful sepoys a must spare arming everybody from arsenal down by river must have be free to make forlorn hope free for instance to go down en masse to main guard hold if must be what one man thought who seven mile out from delhi returning from reconnaissance of own to see if help be on way saw that little puff of smoke heard roar watched red corona grow to brightness on ridge men thought differently claim of patient woman child seemed paramount so be decided to get back gun from main guard a first step toward intrenching for night at tower men in main guard looked at other in doubt when order reached be garrison going to be withdrawn altogether leaving merely forlorn hope to keep gate closed a long a possible against outburst of rabble to whom must be natural shortest route to cantonment if so surely must have be better to send woman away first still order be clear so gate be set wide gun rumbled over drawbridge under escort of guard of th at rate be good riddance of bad rubbish though wisdom of sending gun in such charge be doubtful yet how must little garrison have afforded to give up single man even of still loyal th company of whom have actually followed captain to ruin of magazine to see if must do anything returned without defaulter to say that be confusion dead lying about in hundred enemy nowhere how did men behave gordon asked commandant anxiously getting captain into quiet corner two men beloved of regiment believing in with fierce wild hope in heart that such belief must be justified looked into other face for moment in silence there be shadowing branch of neem overhead a stood in sunlight squirrel upon be chippering at glitter of buckle kite overhead be watching squirrel think hesitated sir said captain gordon quietly major abbott turned hastily looked through open gate past lumbering gun to open country lying peaceful absolutely peaceful beyond if must only have got men there away from disloyalty of th guard sullen silence of th if must only have given something to do if must only have said follow must have followed kate erlton who weary of deadly inaction in room above have drifted down to courtyard stood close to archway looking through also thinking not for first time weary day of alice gissing swift heroic death with envy be something to die so that brave men turned away without word when heard of a thought look on young mainwaring face a stood with others listening to story came back to have haunted day more than once have sought out not for condolence be beyond for trivial word two just human word two to show remembered by living now impulse came to again drifted back for there be hurry in deadly deadly inaction to find leaning listlessly against wall digging hole in dry dust idly with point of drawn sword for want of something better whereupon to use young face thought to be so old in chill anger despair went over to swiftly reserve gone laid hand upon holding sword fret so dear boy said fine curve of mouth quivered be at peace looked at in blaze of fierce reproach at peace how dare say so how dare think so when lie there paused impotent for speech before unbridled hatred then strode away indignantly from pity consolation a looked after own gentler nature be conscious of pride almost pleasure in thought of revenge must surely be taken sooner later by such a for woman child killed wounded even touched be conscious of even though stood aghast before vision of year stretching away into eternity of division mutual hate fresh stir at gate roused quick stir among group of senior officer recruited now by two junior who have earned right to have say in council of war be two artillery subaltern begrimed from head to foot deafened disfigured hardly believing in own safety a yet looking at other queerly wondering if indeed must be head of nine second in command escaped by miracle through sally port in outer wall of magazine so come back by drawbridge a kate erlton have come to join refugee in main guard be possible must world say that thought must have be in mind doubt vain regret that be under order now a listened while major abbott read out just received from cantonment briefly to take back whole of loyal th leave post to th th about hundred fifty openly disloyal men sort of stunned silence fell on little group till major paterson of th said quietly officially to major abbott if leave sir will have to abandon post must not possibly hold of men who have returned to color here might possibly fight be to stick together with retreat example of th before must not have must have life in charge when be gone warn must use own discretion in doing best can to protect paterson be right abbott put in civil officer who have stuck to charge of treasury day repelled only attack made by enemy during long hour if be to do good must have men who will fight trust th th be clearly just biding time retreat might have done six hour ago might do now if be general doubt anyhow put in voice if th be to go must take woman with must fare worse than be sure to do here think brigadier can realize must refer asked someone major shook head order be clear doubt there be good cause for anyhow must be obeyed then a civil officer in charge of government treasury ask for quarter of hour law if by then eager voice paused whether owner thought once more of expected cloud of dust whether meant to gallop to cantonment in hope of getting order rescinded be doubtful whether went stayed doubtful also fifteen minute of respite be given during preparation for departure went on men of th aiding in with new alacrity time have come only few minute now before last fear of hand to hand fight must be over last chance of master turning rending gone lingered bit though for rumbling wheel came over drawbridge once more voice clamored to be let in gun have returned gunner have deserted said escort insolently gun being in such case useless have preferred to rejoin brother a for officer have preferred to go on kate erlton drawn from inner room once again by creaking of gate saw look pas between one two of officer there stood th smart steady waiting for marching order need to close gate again since time be up fifteen minute have slipped by bringing help just a long hour have dragged by uselessly so gate stood open to familiar friendly landscape aglow with ray of setting sun close at hand within stone throw lay tall tree dense flowering thicket of koodsia garden where fugitive might have found cover to left be ravine rock of ridge fatal to mounted pursuit in center lay road northward leading straight to punjab straight from that increasing roar of city there have be no attack a yet soul within main guard knew for certainty that first hint of retreat must bring how must do otherwise decisive answer of magazine with thousand odd good reason against belief that master be helpless have died away refuse rabble of city have ceased to wander awestruck among ruin murmuring what tyranny be here that passive resigned comment of weaker brother in india in palace too have recovered shock of mean trick of nine who however must thank heaven be dead too so a gate stood open sun streamed through into wide courtyard glinting on buckle bayonet major abbott voice rose quietly be ready gordon drawbridge be clear of gun now clear of everything save slant shadow ready sir came quiet reply number called commandant voice at right hand pleaded swiftly wait for section huzoor let go at left whispered for god sake huzoor quick get out quick major abbott hesitated second only second voice be voice of good men true whom must trust four about quick march corrected sort of sigh of relief ran down regiment a swung into position foot started rhythmically action at last at long last good by old chap said someone cheerfully major abbott did not turn good by good by came voice round steady quiet voice a disciplined tramp echoed on drawbridge bar of scarlet coat grew on rise of white road outside good by gordon good by tall figure in red gold be under very arch shining glittering in sunlight streaming through step two must have be beyond time for good by have come time for th have be waiting day threw up arm fell dead from horse without cry shot through heart next instant gate be closed creaking smothered in wild senseless cry to kill to kill to kill in wild senseless rattle of musketry for there be really hurry handful of englishman be helpless major abbott men might clamor for re entry at gate if chose must not get in must remnant of th deprived of loyal companion of only two men who seemed to have controlled do anything th be helpless also by own act for have pushed major paterson through gate before closed so there be one left even to try stem tide one to check beast like cry maro maro maro in truth must have be hopeless task game be up only chance be flight two foreseeing for last hour have already made good theirs by jumping from embrasure in rampart into ditch while one uninjured by fall have scrambled up counter scarp be running like hare for same thicket of koodsia come on come on cried others seeing success then then cry piteous scream of woman reminded of something dearer than life ran back under hail of bullet to upper room have forgotten for moment somehow despite cry of kill despite whistling bullet managed to drag inmate to embrasure oh pathos bathos of poor humanity making smile tear come together woman who have stared death in face day without wink stood terrified before twenty foot scramble with rope of belt handkerchief to help needed round shot to come whizzing message of certain death over head to give back courage never failed again in long day of wandering desperate need be ere of reached safety kate hesitated jumped have not chance of doing for longing look of hers through open gate have tempted to creep along wall nearer to so that rush to close jammed into corner against door yielded slightly to weight quick enough to grasp imminent danger stooped instantly to see if door must be made to yield further that stoop saved life by hiding from view behind crowd next moment have pushed aside log have evidently rolled from pile within slipped sideways into dark outhouse be safe so far be worth impulse to go out again brave merciful death rose keen until with flash memory of escape through crowd came back to seemed to hear changing ready voice of man who held to feel quick instinctive grip on chance of life chance there be spell in very word minute after log jammed door again even have be set wide none must have guessed that woman full of courage ay hope crouched behind pile of brushwood so lay strongest emotion strange to say being raging curiosity to know what have become of others what be passing outside must hear nothing save confused yell with now again dominant cry of deen deen jai kali ma for faith be one of two great passion make men militant other sex a rule have cry fight silently giving asking word only work so fought young mainwaring who with back to same wall against kate have found leaning be using sword to better purpose than digging hole in dust rather have adopted new method of doing task have not tried to escape a others have done not from superior courage because never even thought of when be free to choose how must think of leaving devil unpunished leaving unchecked to touch dead body while lived gave little faint sob of sheer satisfaction a felt first soft resistance meant that sword have cut into flesh blood for vigorous young life made for death nothing death be not dead yonder so after bit seemed to there be too little of there that came slowly with back to wall only who cared to go for within reach for crowd be dense too dense for loading firing dense with hustling horrified wonder confused prodding of bayonet so without sound charged ahead hacking hewing never pausing not even making for freedom going for thickest silently amuk sayia muk yell that be mad possessed rang hideously a men tumbled over other in hurry to escape hurry to have at wild beast devil horror be right be possessed be life instinct with death filled with one desire to kill to be killed quickly saiya amuk saiya out of way out of way amuk saiya fate be with god be with saiya amuk so by chance not method so by sheer terror a well a hacking

at eleventh hour there really have be cloud of dust on meerut road a be confidence peace be restored in city have never be disturbed seemed weary bewildered by topsy turvydom of day desirous chiefly of sleep dream so that kate erlton peering out through chink in wood store felt that if be ever to escape from slow starvation stared in face must choose better time than when traffic have ceased moon have not yet risen have settled that best chance lay in creeping along wall at first then taking advantage of garden cutting across to same sally port through hero of magazine have told have made escape did not know exact situation must surely find besides ruin must most likely be deserted other gate of city even if be not closed for night a gate here be must be guarded once out of city meant to make for flagstaff tower for of course knew nothing of desertion so set door ajar softly crept out a did so whiteness of own dress even in dense blackness startled roused trivial wish that have put on navy blue cotton instead a have meant to do day strange how mere chance word be like spur always crept along wall hoping that smoking flaring fire of refuse in opposite corner round guard be sitting so a to be free of mosquito might dazzle eye be only chance however so must risk then suddenly under foot felt something long curved snakelike be must to scream set teeth trod down hard with strength heart beating wildly in awful suspense nothing struck there be movement have killed hand went down in dark with terror in lest touch must light on head perhaps within reach of fang forced to touch telling be coward fool thank heaven snake after only rope rope must have be used for tethering horse for here under foot be straw rustling horribly not now that be something soft blanket horse double blanket dark a darkness here be chance indeed caught up paused deliberately in darkest corner of square to slip off shoe stocking petticoat bodice so in scantiest of costume winding long blanket round a skirt veil in ayah fashion face must be hidden by modest down drop over white hand hidden away by modest drawing of fold across mouth foot then be only danger dust must darken must risk that anyhow so boldly slipped out of corner made for gate remembering to comfort that be not england where lonely woman might be challenged more for loneliness in heathen land down dropped veil hedged even poor grass cutter wife about with respect what be more even if be challenged proper course must be to be silent hurry on one challenged passed on into denser shadow of church garden to regain breath for have gone somehow why knew not have not felt frightened then question came what next get to magazine somehow strain of looking forward seemed far worse than actual doing so went on without settling anything save that must avoid road give still smoking roofless bungalow a wide birth a possible lest in dark must come on dead thing friend perhaps with thought came that of alice gissing house lay right on path to magazine surely must be near now be that long sweep of roof against sky if must see so much moon must be rising must have time to lose a crept along through garden wondered why bungalow have not be burned like others perhaps ayah friend have saved perhaps there have not be much to attract in little hired house perhaps hark crouched back from voice close beside doubled bit seemed to follow straight ahead tree ended must brave open space by house unless indeed slipped by row of servant house to veranda so through room gain further side might hide in house till voice passed there be again made breathless dash for shadow ran on till found veranda deciding to hide for time passed in at first door door of room where have left alice gissing lying dead few hour before be too dark a yet to see if lay there still too dark to see even if house have be plundered must have be however for very floor cloth be gone concrete struck cold to foot sudden terror at darkness emptiness coming over passed on rapidly to faintly glimmering square of further door seen through intervening room there be three of bedroom drawing room dining room set in row in indian fashion leading into other opening on to veranda two end one opening also into side veranda must get out again therefore by further door be bolted undid bolt only to find hasped on outside feeling of being trapped seized upon ran to other door hasped also drawing room door firmer even than others what fool be to feel so frightened when must always go out a have come in when voice have passed stole back softly knowing must be just outside almost fancying in alarm that heard step in veranda there be glimmering square of escape open shut too shut from outside have seen shut door there indeed be footstep loud footstep voice coming up long flight of step led to veranda from road coming straight locked in helpless threw up hand involuntarily at bright flash in veranda be lightning pistol shot quick curse fall yell of rage rush of foot upon step then flash more curse confused clashing stood a if turned to stone listening down step surely time rush cry scuffle fall then loud unmistakable laugh then silence merciful heaven what be what have happened shook at door gently still there be silence then gripping woodwork tried to peer out must only see bit of veranda in front of being latticed in hung with creeper be very dark rest be invisible from within leaned ear on glass listened be that faint breathing who be there cried softly there be answer sank down on floor in sheer bewilderment tried to think what to do after time faint glimmer of rising moon aiding went round to door tried again locked inside out now must see that house have be pillaged to uttermost there be literally nothing left in nothing to aid finger if tried to open door by breaking upper pane of glass of course must undo top bolt how be to reach bottom one behind lower panel why why have be locked who have locked one by have come in what be there that needed protection in empty house be there by chance someone else then suddenly remembrance of what have left lying in end room hour before came back to have forgotten utterly in alarm crept back to see if alice gissing still kept company bed be gone by steadily growing glimmer of moon must see something lying on floor in very center of room something strangely orderly with look of care tidiness about not white dress have be white kate knelt down beside touched still figure gently what have be covered with sort of network fine silken crimson officer sash surely now eye becoming accustomed to what lay before light growing saw that curly head rested on officer scarlet coat gold epaulette be arranged neatly on side delicate ear so a not to touch who have done then that step have thought heard in veranda must have be real one someone must have be watching dead woman be at door in instant rapping at pane herbert herbert be there herbert herbert might have done thing might have come over from meerut for have loved dead woman have loved dearly there be answer then wrapping blanket round hand dashed through pane removing glass managed to crane out little must see better so be that someone only heap of clothes in shadow of corner by inner wall by time moonlight be shining white on orange tree on further side of road must see beyond to garden nothing of road nothing of steep flight of step leading down to balustrade set with pot filling up center arch prevented that herbert cried again louder be that there be not sound god in heaven who lay there dying dead helplessness broke down self control at last crept back into room back to old companionship cry miserably ah be so tired so weary of so glad to rest sense of real physical relief came to body a for first time for long long hour let muscle slacken to mind a let cry on like child forgetting cause of grief in grief forgetting even that after time in sheer rest so that moon when have climbed high enough to peep in through closed door found asleep arm spread out over crimson network head resting on what lay beneath slept dreamfully once voice rose in quick anxious tone of who talk in sleep freddy freddy called save freddy someone never mind ayah be only boy other other may then word merged into other uncertainly after manner of dreamer slept sounder soundest of however in cool before dawn so that did not wake with stealthy foot in side veranda stealthy hand on hasp outside did not wake even when jim douglas stood beside looking down vexedly on blanket shrouded figure pillowed on body came to seek for have be delayed by thousand difficulty though willow grave be ready dug in garden presence of native even though woman apparently must make task longer be woman one hand on revolver laid other on sleeper shoulder touch brought kate to foot blindly without cry to meet fate god mr erlton cried recognized voice at once fate indeed chance hers chance hers stood half stupefied by dream waking after nature be ready in second for action broke in on own wondering question impatiently be losing time quick must get to safer place before dawn twist that blanket right let please will do now if will follow close must get hidden somewhere for to day be too near dawn for anything else come put out hand vaguely a if to stave swift decision away looking in face recognized that must have time that must curb own energy then be who fired said in dull voice who shut in here who killed voice why did answer when called when thought be herbert be very unkind very unkind stared at for second then hand went out closed on hers firmly mr erlton be going to save if can come know what be talking about there be time for talk come so hand in hand passed into side veranda through have entered so since nearest way to city lay down flight of step to front one take care cried half stumbling forcing to avoid something lay huddled up against wall be dead man there upon step showed white a marble in moonlight be two others in heap third lower down ghastlier still lying amid dark stain marring whiteness with gaping cut clearly visible on shoulder that still further down jim douglas gave quick cry dropped kate hand be on knee beside tall young figure coatless white shirt stiff with blood lay head downward on last step a if have pitched forward in mad pursuit a turned over on back gently young face showed in moonlight stern yet still exultant sword still clenched in stiff right hand rattled on step mainwaring understand said looking up bewildered into kate face puzzle have gone from seemed roused to life again understand now said softly a spoke stooped raised boy head tenderly in hand let leave here went on eagerly hastily leave there beside beside jim douglas made reply understood also dimly only signed to to take foot instead so together managed to place dead weight within threshold close door then jim douglas held out hand again there be new friendliness in grip come said there be new ring in voice night be far spent day be at hand be true a stepped from now waning moonlight into shadow of tree bird beginning to dream of dawn shifted twittered faintly among branch once startling there be louder rustling from taller tree flutter of broad white wing to perch nearer city half sleepy cry of deen deen futteh mohammed if have time muttered jim douglas fiercely must go wring that cursed bird neck for kate tighter clasp on hand seemed like appeal went on in silence so a slipped from garden into silent street muezzin monotonous chant began from shadowy minaret of big mosque prayer be more than sleep than sleep than sleep night be far spent day be indeed at hand what must bring forth jim douglas with sinking at heart told must at least be thankful that one day be done book iv such stuff a dream be made of chapter death pledge outer court of palace lay steeped in sunshine of noon hot rose red wall arcade

though most of ill advised attempt at concealment must have come to end by now have indeed four day of peace of hourly increasing religious enthusiasm for cause so evidently favored by high heaven have made well nigh impossible to carry on task attempted by so many when seemed likely to last for few hour only even jim douglas told must fail unless must get help have succeeded so far simply because by mere chance have not one several place of concealment ready to hand without necessity for taking anyone into confidence for have found convenient in work to have city of refuge a be where must escape from curiosity change disguise at leisure shilling so month required for rent of room in tenement house being more than repaid by sense of security possession gave be to one of therefore that took kate on dawn of th leaving locked up in alone till night enabled to take on to so by constant change managing to escape suspicion a day passed in miraculous peace recognized hopelessness of continuing life for long to begin with kate nerve must not stand be brave enough have imagination what woman with must stand being left alone in dark for twelve hour at time never knowing if slow starvation must be fate if anything untoward happened to have not already begun must not expect to stand when three day of something far le difficult have left haggard nerve unstrung left with possibility looming in future of losing self control day going madly for whole world a young mainwaring have done not that cared for kate safety so much a that mere thought of failure roused beast like ferocity in so a wandered restlessly about city waiting in fever of impatience for sign of world without rose red wall waiting day by day with growing tempest of rage for night to return let creep up dark stair assure of woman safety be piecing together plan in case of what in case story heard in bazaar be true be impossible how must english have be wiped out of india yet a saw deserted shop being reopened in solemn procession by old pantaloon on elephant calling emperor when saw abool bukr letting off squib in general rejoicing over reestablishment of mohammedan empire above when saw tide of life returning to street mad desire to strike blow smash sham be tempered by almost unbearable curiosity a to what have really happened dared not try find out useless though knew be hung round quarter where kate lay concealed for day feeling certain consolation in knowing that be a close to a dared to be life be manifestly impossible so bit by bit plan grew yet when have grown almost shrank from so strange did seem in linking of past with present for kate must pas a wife sick wife hidden a zora have be on terraced roof with tara a servant meanwhile passing a afghan horse dealer kept from returning north like others of trade by illness in house plan be perfectly feasible if tara must consent jim douglas though ignored own certainty never really doubted that must have not be born in mist covered mountain of north for nothing mysticism be part of nature felt that have saved for for only have played that childish successful cantrip with hair in way be not pathetic idyl on roof with little zora rehearsal of tragedy rehearsal without must not have played part strange thread of fate indeed linking woman together though shrank from admitting very existence gave confidence that whole must hang together securely so that when sought out only real doubt be whether must be wiser to tell truth about kate assert that be wife chose latter a le risky since even if tara refused aid must not overtly betray anyone belonging to tara did not refuse to begin with must have refused nothing in first joy of finding safe when have believed dead like other huzoors then vast confusion of love pride remorse fierce passionate denial of three led into consent if huzoor wanted to help to save wife why must object though be nothing to if mem be mem not jim douglas listening to eager protest wondered if might not safely have saved unnecessary complication then wondered at many thing tara said did at quick frown when promised hair locket a reward at faint quiver amid scorn with have replied that must still want latter for mem hair at slow smile when opened gold oval to show black lock still in sole possession have turned aside to look at hearth cake have be toasting when came in then gone into necessary detail of arrangement in most matter of fact way naturally huzoor have sought help from servant from whom else must seek a for saintship there be nothing new in have be suttee always a master very well knew so nothing did for for must make suffer therefore must arrange a have arranged for zora huzoor must rent roof roof be safest must engage half blind half deaf old sweeper woman knew of perhaps if need be huzoor need have fear of such detail if gave money jim douglas have hidden in garden of deserted bungalow in duryagunj so that in truth seemed a if whole plan have be evolved for by kindly fate yet jim douglas felt keen pang of regret when for first time gave familiar knock of old lucknow day at door of delhi roof tara opened to dressed in old crimson drapery gold bangle restored to beautiful brown arm have brought kate round during previous night to lodging have managed to secure in mufti quarter leaving there alone have taken key to tara being safest plan since everything must then be arranged in discreet woman fashion before put in appearance task have be done well outside square yard of parapeted roof entered lay conventional to uttermost spinning wheel here row of water pot there mat reed stool two cooking place in one corner ragged canvas screen at inner door nothing there to prepare for finding englishwoman within englishwoman with faint color in wan cheek new peace in gray eye busy heaven save mark in sticking disjointed jasmine bud into willow saucer of water pot tara brought strung on string said kate half apologetically after first welcome a noted look suppose meant to wear with other thing paused to glance down with smile at dress seemed pity be like new world to like promise somehow sat down on edge of string bed feeling little dazed looked at surroundings critically be pleasant sunshiny bit of roof vaulted by still cool morning sky there be little arcaded room at one end topmost branch of neem tree showed over one side on other swelling dome of big mosque looked like great white cloud in one corner be sort of square turret from roof of gained by narrow brick ladder whole city be visible for be highest house in quarter higher even than roof beside over same neem tree cast shadow a looked thought idly that dress in world be more graceful than delhi dress with billowy train loose soft filmy veil kate looked well in white in white pulled up sharply indeed memory be playing trick stress strain of reality seemed far from slip of sun saturated roof where graceful woman in white be sticking jasmine bud

broke in angry young voice why did so began one of argument so common in camp a to right of revenge pure simple argument fostered by newspaper where day letter appeared from spartacus fiat justitia such nom de plume letter alike in one thing that quoted text of scripture notably one about daughter of babylon blessedness of throwing child on stone major erlton did not stop to listen to ethic of question did not interest in truth mere revenge be lost in in desire not so much to kill a to fight to go on hacking hewing for ever ever a drifted on smoking cigar thought quite kindly of poor devil of grass cutter who really worked uncommonly well just in fact a if nothing have happened so did old khansaman sweeper who have come back to on return to ridge saying that huzoor must find tale of chicken complete garden of ruined house near flagstaff tower whither foot led unconsciously a often did of evening be kept tidy gardener when saw tall figure approaching going over to rose bush now that rain have fallen be new budding with white bud picking buttonhole sat down on plinth of veranda twiddling idly in finger a looked out over panorama of eastern plain curving river city with white dome of mosque hanging unsupported above smoke mist wreath for now at sunsetting sky be mass of rose red violet cloud white steam rose from dripping tree moist ground be perfect picture only saw city to be india that filled eye wide plain east west north south where recent rain have driven thought save one of harvest to come from mind of million where master meant simply claimer of revenue might have be non existent so far a like be concerned yet even for city have definite conception merely looked at idly then at rosebud held that reminding of certain white marble cross with thy will be done on rose suddenly almost impatiently there be resignation in face a wandered toward battery again with white flower of blameless life stuck in old flannel coat strange conglomerate of pity passion in heart while city a light faded grew more more like cloud above rose red purple until in distance seemed city of dream in truth be so still despite clangor of bugle fife bukht khan brought with when on st of july crossed swollen river in boat with five thousand mutineer square shouldered man be bukht khan with broad face massive beard massive sonorous voice to match man of cromwell type of church militant disciplinarian to back bone believing in drill yet with eye to providence above platoon exercise there be lack of soldier to drill in delhi by time came in squad battalion to jostle other in

sick bed hard by felt a if must send round beg for quiet seemed quite natural must do so for be completely absorbed over patient of hers who without being seriously ill must not get better who passed from one relapse of fever to with listless impatience now nearly month after have stumbled over threshold lay barely convalescent have be strange month stranger even than previous one when have dragged through lonely day a best must have wandered in out restlessly full of strain stress if even have be curious linking of fate what be when tended day night when week slipped by securely almost ignorantly for though soma came day to inquire after master standing at door to salute to spick span in full uniform brought disturbing news seemed to now that have known jim douglas life in truth

possible improbable passed rapidly down stair again story below roof being reserved for owner use on occasional visit to delhi be empty occupant of second floor pious folk have fled from city day two before when paused to inquire on ground floor to know if there have be disturbance found door padlocked outside sure sign that everyone be out oh why thought have not padlocked that other door upstairs passed out into street beginning to realize that task be over just a have ceased to gird at there be nothing unusual to be seen godly folk about be beginning to close gate for night paused to listen with outraged air to thrummings drumming from princess farkhoonda roof be abool bukr voice singing oh mistress rare divine then must scarcely be kate might have found friend in quarter where so

since have be whacked out of dozen house be safe now however since when be of humor newasi begum never let go till be too drunk for mischief then thought jim douglas be possible that jhungi might have given real information still one thing be certain roof be empty dream have vanished into thin air did not know a passed through dim street that dream be over also that john nicholson stood looking down from ridge on shadowy mass of town have posted in hundred twenty mile that day arriving in time to hear explosion of magazine city salute of welcome a be to man who be to take have be dining at headquarters mess taciturn grave wet blanket on jollity moselle cup fresh cut of cheese from new europe shop now when others be calling cheery goodnights a passed to tent be off to wander alone round

miserable letter indeed dream of sovereignty have come to end with salute of welcome to john nicholson book v there arose man chapter forward be here on duty sir asked brief imperious voice major erlton startled from half dream a sat listlessly watching target practice from crow nest rose saluted height almost matched speaker looked small in comparison with indescribable air of dominant power almost arrogant strength in other figure seemed to impress for pulled together smartly with certain confidence looked in truth inch soldier sir replied a briefly on pleasure distinct twinkle showed for second in general nicholson deep set hazel eye then go to bed sir sleep look a if wanted spoke almost rudely a turned on heel added in louder voice than be necessary have meant remark for companion ear only will want good fighting men before long expect if did might reckon on one herbert erlton be not good at formulating feeling into definite thought a went back to peaceful side of ridge told vaguely that be glad nicholson have come be sort of man fellow must be glad to follow especially when be dead sick weary of waiting doing nothing save get killed yes be real good sort a even chaplain have said at mess have felt quite so besieged on ridge last two day since came by george have hit right nail on head man be much good without sleep so with certain pride in following advice major erlton flung on cot promptly dozed off in truth needed rest sonny seymour safe arrival in camp two night before in charge of bunjarah from whom even hodson have be unable to extract anything save that agha sahib have forgotten letter in hurry that mem be safe have be safe have sent major erlton to watch devilish wall more feverishly than ever not that really mattered whether kate be alive dead told no did not mean that quite must be awfully glad god how glad to know safe must alter other thing must not even alter in regard to so once more waited for further news promised with strange indifference save to thought alive dead kate be within wall like woman like many woman now be dreaming that be inside also sword in hand there seemed chance of indeed men be saying to other a looked after john nicholson tall figure a wandered into post picket asking brief question pleased with brief reply now again pausing a be to come out of absorption take sudden keen interest in something beyond great question a when passing tent of only lady in camp saw sonny who have be made over to till must be sent back to mother who have escaped to meerut during brief time be plaything of parcel of subaltern who delighted in tinsel cap anklet major erlton have at first rather monopolized child trying to find out something definite from a insisted that miffis erlton lived up in 'ky wif man wif gween face white face lot of fwowers bit of tring spoke familiarly of tiddu tara soma without being able to say who be major have given up a bad job gone back to wall so subaltern have

setting senior superior in arm against have never solved yet career have be one long race with curb on year before have thrown up game in disgust begged to be transferred from punjab while must go with honor even triumphant march delhi ward in found disaffection disobedience doubt left fear trembling peace have be marred by much rebuking so once nothing inner sense pin point ought not to let out heart blood kept at post two day before on very eve of hundred twenty mile rush to delhi have written claiming definitely right of officer in position to quarrel with anybody opinion asserting duty of speaking out matter at what risk of giving offense now man year younger than in nominal command be six thirty holding view diametrically opposed to theirs have be sent here virtually to take delhi because others must not wonder then that question how to avoid collision puzzled not because knew that appointment be in offense that people affected to speak of still a mr nicholson that being real rank because knew in heart of heart at moment might do something appalling move troop under someone else command without reference a have done before during career then naturally there must be ruction have smile for thought still for present concord be assured since until column arrived repose of lion crouching for spring be manifestly only policy though might be necessary to wag tail bit to do more than merely forbid sortie buglings fool for instance who harrassed metcalfe house picket might be shown mistake made to understand that if ridge called time for little decent rest before final round meant to have so passed on errand to inculcate headquarters with decision leaving sonny playing with boy meanwhile one of garrison at least have found benefit of keen judgment herbert erlton have passed from dream of conflict to real rest of unconscious sleep oblivious of everything even rose red wall within man haggard anxious a have be be still allowing none in search for kate erlton tara a much at loss a helping for though at first have be relieved at idea of mem disappearance have soon realized that master ran more risk than ever in reckless determination to find trace of missing woman tiddu who have returned helped also mem said must have found friend must be alive such piece of gossip a discovery death of english woman must not have be kept from thunbi bazaar then who have passed from roof have be calm enough to hasp door behind did not look like violence if huzoor must only be patient wait something must turn up there be other kindly folk in city besides in meantime must do well to allow soma to slip into sulky indifference seemed to prefer take notice of only meant that good soldier in delhi be mad with for having chosen losing side for with nikalseyn on ridge what chance have delhi be rather exaggerated picture still be fairly faithful presentment of inward thought of many who long before have begun to ask what devil be doing in galley yet there be there must fight soma however be doubtful even of heart positively ached a listened to tale told in very heart of delhi of man whom other men worshiped man who took fort single handed said that given power of provost marshal must control disobedient army in two day man who yoked bribe taking tahseeldars into village well wheel to draw water for robbed ryots set woman of loose virtue who came into camp to cool in muddy tank man who flung law book on office table at clerk head then with kindly apologetic smile paused while replaced for future use man who gave toy to child remorselessly hung two abettor of vile murder when must not lay hand on principal man finally who flogged who worshiped into promising adoration for future to very ordinary mortal of acquaintance briefly hero demi god who perhaps be neither a tiddu declared have simply greatest gift of gift of making men what wished to be way be gall wormwood to soma hero worshiper by birth that side must have such colossal figure to follow so sulky sore held aloof from side doing bounden duty to more keeping guard when fellow took bribe to fight agreeing with tiddu since other besides knew of roof be safer for master to lock up live for time elsewhere so all unwittingly only chance of finding kate be lost for what have happened be briefly five minute after jim douglas have left prince abool bukr who have kept renseignement given by bunjarah who have promised to be in waiting be not to last because be close to haven where must be have come roystering up stair followed by unwilling retainer suggesting that most illustrious have really better desist from violating seclusion since be black blue already from sheer devilry desire to outrage quarter by complaint have already brought into trouble prince have begun battering at door kate running to bar more securely saw that hasp carelessly hitched over staple be slipping have slipped have barely time to dash into inner roof ere prince unexpectant of sudden giving way tumbled headlong into outer one fall gave instant more made angry end must have be certain if kate seeing new made gap in wall before have not availed herself of there be roof not far below knew debris must be on slope perhaps blue eyed boy have escaped by roof flashed through a by aid of stool kicked over in scramble gained top of gap peered over next instant have dropped down four foot finding precarious foothold on sliding slope of rubble still clinging to wall with hand if one looked over thought breathlessly be safe one did general air of decent privacy alarmed retainer into remembering that two of number have found death reward for master last escapade in quarter so after one glance round swore place be empty dragged off feebly protesting that be last chance have not bagged single christian kate heard door closed voice retreat downstairs then set to get back over gap did not seem difficult task slope on hung gave fair foothold by getting good grip on brickwork perhaps displacing brick two in crack lower down a step ought to get up easily be lucky crack be there thought in one way not in for a in effort necessarily threw weight on wall bit of gave way fell backward so half covered with brick mud rolled to roof below be luckily not more than eight nine foot down be far enough however for fall to have killed though lay quite unconscious be not dead only stunned shaken confused unable absolutely to think be almost dawn indeed before realized that only chance of getting up again be in calling for help by time door of roof above have be locked there be one to hear few square yard of roof on to have rolled belonged to one of box like building half turret half summer house native build here there everywhere at sort of elevation until view of town from topmost roof resembles nothing so much a pile of luggage awaiting tidal train at victoria particular square of roof belonged to tiny outhouse stood on long narrow roof belonging in turn to arcaded slip of summer house standing on square set round by high parapet wall quite staircase of roof one have have thatch set against wall have fallen in with weight of brick mortar still might be able to creep between wall for shelter on slip of roof below indian corn be drying during break in rain rain have filled row of water pot quite full since must not make above hear thought might be a well to secure from absolute starvation before broad daylight brought life to wilderness of roof around so scrambled down rough ladder of bamboo tied with string after brief look into square below came back with parched grain have found in basket pot of water must not starve for day by time be dawn crept into shelter listening while for sound from above now again venturing on call there be answer by degree came to that must rely on only for safety be not likely to be disturbed day where be unless people came to repair thatch under cover of night might surely creep from roof to roof down to alley what alley true goal now lay behind roof set at angle might lead far from how be to know own stair own house from outside have passed into in darkness never left again then what sort of people lived in house through must creep like thief murderer perhaps still be only chance that burning blistering day a crouched between thatch wall be bolstering up courage for effort must see ridge clearly from hiding place ah if have only wing of dove purple pigeon circling from great dome of mosque came to feast unchecked on indian corn people below then must be pious folk be past midnight silence of sleep have settled over city before nerved to chance crept down among corn difficulty in to surprise cresset be still burning in arcaded veranda below sending three bar of light across square through must pas must be better to wait while hour slipped by still light gleamed into silence perhaps have be forgotten possibility made creep down brick ladder prepared to creep up again if silence proved deceptive what saw made pause hesitating be woman reading from large book held in book rest koran of course kate recognized at once for just such have be part of necessary furniture of roof what beautiful face tender refined charming not face of murderess surely surely might be trusted three month behind veil have made kate realize emotionality of east instinctive sympathy with dramatic element in life remembered sudden impulse in regard to knife effect on tiddu felt similar impulse toward confidence here then knew that door might be locked below that best chance might be to throw on mercy of woman next moment be standing full in light close to student who started to foot with faint cry gazing almost incredulously at figure so like own save for jewel gleaming among white drapery bibi faltered be bibi interrupted kate hurriedly in hindustani be christian woman like mother for sake of yours sake of son if be mother too for sake of what love best save christian mem in pause of sheer astonishment two woman stood facing other looking into other eye prince abool bukr have be right when said that kate erlton reminded of princess farkhoonda da zamani standing so showed strangely alike indeed not in feature in type in soul looked out of soft dark clear gray eye save faint echo be lost in new sound close at hand careless voice humming song step coming up dark stair o mistress rare divine god prophet abool newasi flung hand up in sheer horror abool christian here next instant with fierce keep still have thrust kate into deepest shadow be out to bar brick ladder with tall white grace have time for thought one sentence beat on brain for sake of what love best save for sake strange woman must not be seen must not must not guess be there stand back kind one let pas came gay voice carelessly made kate shudder back into further shadow for knew now where be that must have to pas bar of light must have essayed escape to roof again newasi stood still a stone on first step of stair pas repeated clearly coldly art mad abool that thou comest hither with excuse of drunkenness alone at hour of night for shame why indeed asked wildly have come be not used to do so must have heard have come on purpose there be sound a if retreated step from dark voice came with wonder in what ail thee newasi what ail echoed what have lacked too long just anger at thy thoughtless way go have to tell thee of serious import that none thou must hear that will please thee need thy kind wise eye upon then let see by daylight not now will not abool stand back will call for help sound of retreat be louder time muttered curse came with voice have trace of anxiety in now anxiety anger thou dost not mean kind one thou canst not when have done that must make thee need help newasi be not fool remember be abool abool bukr who have devil in at time did not know by time be not that reason why must not find christian why must refuse hearing though be true that have right to be trusted in long year when have failed to treat tenderly respectfully a stood barring way where have never before be denied entrance felt a if must have killed that strange woman for being there for coming

have must have be le relentless wherefore canst not trust thy nephew fair aunt sarcasm bit deep nephew truce abool to foolish tale began hotly when interrupted of surety if princess farkhoonda desire yet must mirza abool bukr still like to know wherefore be not received tone sent thrill of terror through use of name hated warned that temper be rising devil awakening canst not see dear pleaded trying to keep hand must have drawn from hers folk have evil mind gave ugly laugh since when hast thou begun to think of thy good name like other woman newasi if be so if virtue god know be ill got be to go for naught let end heard felt turn wild despair surged up in be worst to let go in anger beyond reach of controlling hand mayhap go to unknown evil chance one since since at worst death might be

abool what what doe woman a be fear save save own love there be instant silence then reckless jeering laugh jarred loud so have come at last there be woman for kiss be end indeed did not tell thee must quarrel over day well be so princess will take virtue elsewhere stood a if turned to stone listening to retreating step listening to nonchalant humming of old refrain a passed through courtyard into alley then without word quivering with passion turned to where kate cowered dragged by main force to stair where minute before have sacrificed everything for not for for go said bitterly go curse go with kate fled before anger saw did not understand yet a flew down steep stair paused involuntarily to listen to sound sound needed interpreter a liquid persian have done of woman sobbing a if heart must break have time however even for wonder next instant be out in alley turning to right for knowledge that be princess farkhoonda who have helped gave clew to position house stair how must know must try one after since must know landing door have so often opened shut still be perilously near dawn ere found what be sure be right one be padlocked must have gone gone left alone for first time ghastly unreasoning fear seized on must have beaten at door screamed claim to be let in even when rush of terror passed sat stupidly on step not even wondering what to do next till suddenly remembered that have key in pocket that of inner padlock certainly perhaps of outer one also since tara have given up using duplicate altogether have five minute after having satisfied that roof remained a be that be merely empty for time tried to feel grateful loneliness dimness be too much for fatigue excitement so once more sound need interpreter rose on warm soft night be two day after tiddu held secret consultation with soma tara agha sahib said be getting desperate be losing head a huzoors did over woman folk must be got out of city be not a if did good by staying in mem be dead safely concealed there be alternative unless indeed have already be passed out to ridge there be talk of sort among hodson spy be going to utilize fact persuade huzoor to creep out to camp see soma must pas out must not pas in again be fortunate since folk in addition to protecting master have to make money when other corn carrier in place be coining by smuggling gold silver out of city for rich merchant tara with sudden fierce exultation in somber eye agreed let huzoor go back to own life said let go to safety leave free a for mem master have done enough for soma sulky lowering with dull glow of opium in brain for drug be only solace now swore that tiddu be right delhi be place for master once out of fighting must keep knew of old a for mem must not harm a tara have once suggested must that dream be over huzoors be true master have men who must lead men not prince in cashmere shawl who must understand word of what said mere soubadars cocked up real colonel general result of being that on night of th between midnight dawn jim douglas with elation came to always at prospect of action prepared to slip out of sally port by magazine disguised a sepoy be to please soma to please tiddu however wore underneath disguise old staff uniform from theatrical property reminded of alice gissing making whisper bravo to memory of woman whom have buried under orange tree in crimson netted shroud made of officer scarf tiddu remark that english uniform must be safest once be beyond city sent sadness flying in frank admission that tide have turned turned indeed certainty came with great throb of fierce joy a hour afterward slipping past garden of ludlow castle found in thick of english bayonet felt grateful for foresight of old staff uniform be on way to surprise take picket not to defend to attack opportunity be too good to be lost there be hurry have arranged to remain three day on ridge might not have opportunity of free fair fight have forgotten woman in world everything save welcome silence before a turned stole through tree also sword in hand by be lucky well planned picket must be asleep not sound save faint crackle of stealthy foot almost lost in insistent quiver of cicala there be challenge at last within foot two who kum dar swift a echo young voice beside came jibingly be pandy take that be just so with vengeance for right attack left be well up there be short sharp volley then welcome familiar order cheer clatter rush clashing with bayonet seemed minute before jim douglas found among gun slashing at dazed artilleryman who have port fire in hand so artillery on side never have chance major erlton riding up with th lancer a central attack found that bit of fighting over picket be taken mutineer have fled cityward leaving four gun behind against one of a major rode close to gloat over leaned man whom recognized at once god douglas said where where kate where wife be rather abrupt transition of thought jim douglas who be feeling rather queer from something scarcely knew what looked up at speaker doubtfully oh be major erlton said slowly thought mean hoped be here if be why suppose 'd better go back took arm off gun half stumbled forward when major erlton flung from horse laid hold of be hit man blood pouring from sleeve here off with coat sharp ca think why bleeds so said jim douglas feebly looking down at clean cut at inside of elbow from blood be literally spouting be nothing nothing at major gave short laugh take go out of bit though will get tourniquet on sharp send up in dhooli what unlucky devil be muttered jim douglas to major did not deny be in hurry to be off again with party told to clear koodsia garden did successfully before sunrise when expedition returned to camp cheering like demon dragging in captured gun on of wounded men sat triumphantly be first real success since budli ke serai two month before be in wild spirit even doctor fresh from shaking head over many form lifted helplessly from dhoolis be jubilant a sorted jim douglas arm keep here ten day so must say there be always chance of breaking out again till wound be quite healed never mind can go into delhi with rest of before then yoicks forward cried wounded lad in cot close by doctor turned sharply if keep quiet jones will send back to meerut too maloney have told to lie still dozen time sure docther dear ye must be so cruel said big irishman sitting at foot of bed so a to get nearer to new arrival who be telling tale of fight able bodied spoiling to be at wurrk three day be curious fact remarked doctor to jim douglas a finished bandaging hospital have be twice a insubordinate since nicholson came in men seem to think be to assault delhi tomorrow ca till siege train come of course so may be in at death jim douglas felt glad sorry in breath finally told must let decision stand over for day two must see hodson first find out if letter have have from spy about englishwoman concealed in delhi referred to kate erlton chapter ii bit bridle spur letter however did not refer to kate though curiously enough englishwoman concerned have be still be concealed in afghan house kate then have not be only englishwoman in delhi there be certain consolation in thought since what be being done for one person by kindly native might very well be done for besides removed a be now from fret strain of actual search jim douglas admitted frankly to major hodson that be right in saying that mr erlton must either have come to end of trouble altogether have found friend better able perhaps than to protect regarding first possibility also major hodson be skeptical have hundred of spy in city piece of good luck a discovery of christian must have be noised abroad have not mentioned did not therefore believe have occurred must however inquire till answer came must be foolish to go back to city jim douglas admitted also a day passed desire to return increased especially when major erlton came to see did with dutiful regularity jim douglas must not help admiring when stood stiff square thanking a englishman thank fellow for what know to be beyond thanks be sure one must have done more know must have done quarter so much be grateful said awkwardly then with best intention born from real pity for haggard man who sat on edge of cot looking a men do after struggle of week with malarial fever added luck have be bit against time have a yet perhaps replied jim douglas feeling inclined then there to start cityward game be over when go back hodson say must do good continued big man still with best intention agree with retorted other sharply perhaps not must if be rather must of course only see be different for major erlton paused finding difficult to explain memory of last letter have written to kate be always with making feel be not in way wife have never regretted have scarcely thought what must happen if came back from dead a be to answer for hated thought even now complexity of emotion irritated broke through almost brutally be wife see have nothing to do with so have better leave alone have done enough already a said before be grateful so have stalked away leaving hearer frowning be true luck have be against what right have to be so above what right have that big brutal fellow to say so there be going off to win more distinction doubt must end by getting victoria cross confound from what people said of must well deserve while even two day have brought failure home to yet told that if have failed to save one englishwoman others have failed to save hundred fresh a be to fact seemed to almost incredible a wandered round ridge inspecting that rear guard of graf sat talking to of thousand odd sick wounded in hospital listening to endless tale of courage pluck sheer dogged resistance realized at what terrible cost armed force varying from three to six thousand men have simply clung to rock looked at city there seemed enough heroism in to have removed mountain coming upon not in monotonous sequence of day to day experience in single impression futility of left appalled so did news of world beyond delhi heard reliably for first time briefly england be everywhere on defense seemed to a if from mad dream of conquest within city have passed to a strange dream of defeat why fire unchecked at first have blazed up with fresh fuel in place after place left nothing not single attempt to wrest government of country from not even organized resistance when once order to advance have be given have there be mysterious influence abroad making men blind to truth be about to pas away if there have be felt when on th watched john nicholson re enter ridge at head of column many others felt same without in way disparaging who for long month of defense have borne burden heat of day simply saw that fate have sent new factor into problem that old order be changing defense be to be attack why not with reinforcement of fine fighting men played in by band of th amid cheering counter cheering almost drowned music seemed fit a joke ran if not to face hell at rate to take pandymonium d regiment looked like mastiff to leader have likened d sikh be admittedly biggest fellow ever seen wild mooltanee horse sat lean beloochees with loose security of seat tell of men born to saddle jim douglas noted thing like fellow what sent thrill of confidence through be look on many face a at pause turn caught glimpse of general figure be that heroic figure seen for first time riding ahead of with unconsciousness of attention attracted with self reliant acceptance of fact a far from modesty a be from vanity that here rode john nicholson ready to do what john nicholson must do in pale face made paler by darkness of beard there be more than there be almost languid patience a if owner knew that men around said of if ever there be desperate deed to do in india john nicholson be man to do be biding time to fulfill hope look haunted jim douglas day stimulating strangely here be man felt who be in grip of fate who gave back grip so firmly that fate must not escape gave back frankly freely a one man might grip hand in friendship then smiled thinking that john nicholson hand clasp must go long way in giving anyone help over hard stile if have have lead over like after smash came if even now idle thought told because picturesqueness of man outward appearance have taken fancy imagination for knew be ever likely to know have be sitting idly on edge of cot in tiny tent major erlton have lent having in truth nothing better to do now voice from blaze blare of heat light outside startled may come in john nicholson almost stammered in surprise without waiting for more than word general walked in alone be still in full uniform surely man must become more thought jim douglas involuntarily have heard story mr douglas began in sonorous very pleasant voice be curious one be curious to see must know so much paused fixed eye in perfectly unembarassed stare on host face then said suddenly with sort of old fashioned courtesy sit down again please there be chair see cot will stand two of if doe will be clearly fault smiled kindly wounded too did know that scratch sir put in hearer hastily fighting shy even of commiseration have little fever in city be bright hazel eye with hint of sunlight in took rather absent look must like to have done have tried that sort of thing always find out fancy must be rather difficult to disguise began jim douglas with smile when john nicholson plunged straight into heart of thing must know lot want to know of course have seen hodson letter be different first will city fight a well a know how know better than did so fancied hodson said not by way told that declared intelligence department be simply perfect account mean

douglas eagerly when voice asking if general nicholson be within interrupted be replied sonorous voice calmly come in hodson hope be prepared to fight bright hazel eye met jim douglas with distinct twinkle in major hodson entering perfect blaze of scarlet fawn gold loose lank lavish gave speech different turn hope will excuse intrusion sir said saluting a be loudly being certain owed piece of luck to kind office ventured to follow a for fighting sir trust hodson horse to give good account of do major do replied nicholson gravely despite twinkle at present want to fight mr douglas for suggests be in blind funk with anyone else jim douglas might have refused cool demand for be little else that must defend statement against man who in be refutation of who be type of most reckless dare devil courage dash thought of umpire ready to give overwhelming thrust at time roused temper pugnacity be not conscious of being in one myself said major turning with swing brief how do douglas be most martial of figure in last developed uniform of flamingo ring tailed roarer aloo bokhara a hodson levy be called indiscriminately during lengthy process of dress evolution what be more understand what mean sir general nicholson doe think replied other will go further than did sir added facing general boldly only said that native thought be in blind funk now assert that have right to say so never stirred hand foot for whole month oh give in meerut interrupted hodson hastily be pitiable leader lost head not only leader lost from moment to seems to have never be calm calm echoed hodson disdainfully who want to be calm who must be calm with massacred woman child to avenge exactly so horror of ghastly murder got on nerve wonder exaggerated position from first exaggerate danger of now of taking delhi mean interrupted nicholson dryly jim douglas smiled sir even will find that difficult meant ultimate danger to rule there mistake utterly put in hodson magnificently mean to win admit danger there be englishman thank heaven englishwoman be crisis so desperate that need levy lady asked adversary sarcastically personally want to leave out of question a much a can be intrusion into have done mischief want to minimize horror if must forget massacre forget hope to god englishman will remember when time come to avenge ay make murderer remember too if have in power to day put in sonorous voice knew be to die to morrow must inflict most excruciating torture must think of on with easy conscience bravo sir cried hodson 'd do executioner gladly john nicholson face flinched slightly there be generally common hangman believe said then turned on jim douglas with bent brow sir must kill sir a must kill mad dog in quickest way handy a 'd kill man found with arm in hand treason be worse crime than murder to now by god if tortured anyone must be men who betrayed garrison at cawnpore yet even there in only real collapse what have happened be reoccupied already road to be hung with dead body havelock march be one long procession of success yet count ourselves beleaguered why ca understand where have order to charge to advance boldly met with reverse seems to that for massacre fear for woman child must hold own gayly look at lucknow yes lucknow assented hodson savagely sir henry bravest gentlest dead woman child pent up by heaven be sickening to think what may have happened john nicholson shot quick glance at jim douglas prof contention said latter think of fifteen hundred english native in weak position with not even palisade in place between five time number of trained soldier backed by wildest wickedest wantonest town rabble in india what doe mean make one of fifteen hundred paladin by heaven be hero still what doe mean spoke to general be silent mean echoed hodson palpably that foe be contemptible so be pandy ca fight fought well enough for in past know regiment jim douglas caught up hard believe will fight for again truth be that half even of army doe not want to fight country doe not mean fight at delhi came dry voice again delhi be exceptional besides can hing else now remember condemned unheard on th of june told that before sir did put in hodson quickly if have gone in on th a suggested must have succeeded replied jim douglas coolly nicholson rose with smile well be going to succeed now so good luck in meantime hodson put bit bridle on ranghars show ca have 'em disturbing public peace kicking up futile row eh mr douglas fear sir said hodson effusively ring tailed roarer be not in blind funk only wish be a sure that politicals will keep order when have made have to do twice over at bhagput be hard sir when one have fagged horse men to death to be told one have exceeded order if served under major hodson said general with sudden freeze of formality must be impossible instruction be always to do everything can be done jim douglas felt that must well believe a with regret that interview be over held flap of tent aside for imperial figure to pas out lingered in blaze of sunshine after major hodson have jingled off be right in thing mr douglas said sonorous voice suddenly 'd ask finer soldier than of against by by unless be wrong men of stock will be best war weapon for mind war be primitive art need primitive people country be against if be must be standing here be too busy plowing mr douglas rain be point in favor a for woman child poor soul voice softened infinitely have be in way terribly will fight better for by by meanwhile have got to smash delhi odds be bigger than be first baird smith will sap in somehow then paused looking kindly at jim douglas said have better stop go in with with rest of think not sir why because of poor lady woman again eh in way besides really have nothing else to do john nicholson looked at for moment from head to foot then said sharply did know sir give personal staff plenty of work for instant offer took hearer breath away stood silent be afraid not sir said at last though from first have known what answer must be ca that be fact be cashiered from army fifteen year ago general nicholson stepped back with sheer anger in face then what do mean sir by wearing majesty uniform jim douglas looked down hastily on old tiddu staff property have quite forgotten have passed muster in darkness of tent here in sunlight looked inconceivably worn shabby unreal smiled rather bitterly then held out sleeve to show braiding be general coat sir said defiantly god know what old duffer belonged to might have worn first instead of second hand if have be d d young fool splendid figure drew together formally other pride be up too so for minute two men faced other honestly nicholson eye narrowing under bent brow what be woman expect perhaps see that matter faint smile of approval rather took from sternness of military salute not at end of course of course not quite for ere jim douglas must drop curtain between that brilliant successful figure have turned sharply laid hand on shoulder curiously characteristic hand large thin smooth white a woman with grip in beyond most men have vile habit of telling truth to superior officer mr douglas so have shake hand on with hand on shoulder clasp on jim douglas felt a if be in grip of fate following john nicholson example gave back frankly freely so suddenly whole face before melted into perfect friendliness stick to man stick to save poor lady kill somebody be what be doing a for rest smile be almost boyish may get sack before general coat be insubordinate enough tell will have taken delhi first so so good luck to a walked away seemed to eye watching bigger more king like more heroic than ever perhaps because be dim with tear a jim douglas went off with new cheerfulness to see hodson horse jingle out on lesson of peace told that old scoundrel tiddu have once more be right nikalseyn have great gift must take man heart out look at put back sounder than have be for year must put own heart into whole camp make believe be own such clattering of hoof clinking of bit bridle have be heard often before never with such gay light heartedness only two day before lesson have be given to city there have be no more harrassing of picket at night now arm of law be going coolly to reach out forty mile be change indeed more than jim douglas watched sun set red on city wall that evening with certain content in heart a for seemed still to feel that grip hear voice saying stick to man stick to save poor lady kill somebody be what be doing sat dreaming over whole strange dream with curious sense of comradeship sympathy through until glow faded left city dark stern beneath storm cloud have be gathering day then rose went back to tent cheerfully must run needle risk must not lose head a soon a doctor said be safe must find save kate kill somebody be whole duty of man kate however have already be found rather have never be lost when tara few hour after jim douglas slipped out of city have gone to roof to fetch away spinning wheel finding door padlocked on inside have in sheer bewilderment tried effect of signal knock kate have let in a if so poor tara told be to begin over again all over again even though have spent few hour of freedom in perfect passion of purification so that might return to saintship once more gold circlet be gone already head be shaven coarse white shroud have replaced crimson scarf yet here be mem asking for huzoor setting blood on fire with vague jealousy squatted down almost helplessly on floor answering kate eager question until suddenly in midst of started to foot flung up arm in old wild cry for righteousness be suttee before god be suttee then have said with gloomy calm will bring mem more food drink must think tiddu be away soma will not help be alone be suttee kate frightened at wild eye felt relieved when be left alone inclined not to open door to again must manage told a have managed for few day by time mr greyman must have come back a long hour dragged by giving endless opportunity of thought began to ask why must come back at have not realized at first that have escaped that be safe that be a be quit of be must remain so new decision almost content came to with suggestion be busy in moment over detail to begin with news must be sent then in case be to return must leave roof tara might do so much for especially if be made clear that be for master benefit tara might never return there have be that in manner hinted at possibility store have brought in have be unduly lavish in case kate told must creep out night go back to princess farkhoonda see if must not help if not there be always alternative of ending everything by going into street boldly declaring christian must appeal to two woman first a sat resolving two woman be cursing in inmost heart for there have be banging of drum thrumming of sutaras on newasi roof three day abool bukr have broken away from kind detaining hand gone back to intrigue of palace so mufti quarter benefited in decent quiet during poor princess began that process of weeping eye out left blind at last not blind yet so sat swaying gracefully before book rest on lay word of god voice quavering sometimes over monotonous chant a tried to distill comfort to own heart from proposition that be might right far away in quarter of town tara crouched up before mere block of stone half hidden in flower be telling bead feverishly ram ram sita ram be form used for whole tragedy of appeal aspiration remorse despair hope a muttered on looking dully at little row of platter have presented to shrine that morning going far beyond necessity in determination to be heard group of woman coming in to lay fresh chaplet among withered one give jow to deep toned bell hung in archway in order to attract god attention to offering paused to whisper among of piety while more than once widow crept close to kiss edge of veil humbly be balm indeed be peace mem might starve told fiercely must be suttee after strain pain wondering ache at heart have come back to own life understood let huzoors keep to own be hers sun danced in mote through branch of peepul tree above little shrine squirrel chirruped among parrot chattered sending rain of soft little fig to fall with faint sound on hard stone still tara counted bead feverishly ram ram sita ram ram ram sita ram ari sister be saint indeed be here at dawn prays still said woman coming in lengthening shadow with odd little bit of feasting handful of cocoa nut chip platter of flour dish of curd dab of butter ram ram sita ram while poor tara be thinking of huzoor face if ever found out that have left mem to starve be almost dark when stood up abandoning useless struggle so waited to see sacred circling of light get little sip of holy water before went back to perch among pigeon to put on crimson scarf gold circlet again since be hopeless trying to be saint till have done what have promised huzoor must do must go back to mem first kate opening door to with eye glitter whole cut dried plan for future almost took breath away reduced into looking at englishwoman with sort of fear mem will suttee too said stupidly after listening while mem will shave head put away jewel mem will wear widow shroud sweep floor saying come from bengal to serve saint care tara how be done perhaps may have better plan must prevent master from finding again have done too much for a be know have replied kate eye shining like star with determination only want to save be may take away kill if like if wo help to hide will go out into street let kill there will not have risk life for again ram ram sita ram said tara under breath settled at dawn next day tara stood in odd little perch above shrine among pigeon looking down curiously at mem who wearied out by long midnight walk through city excitement of day have dozed off on bare mat in corner head resting on arm three month ago kate must not have slept without pillow now a lay on hard ground face looked soft peaceful in sheer honest dreamless sleep tara have not slept be to be told from anxious strain of eye have sat out since have returned home on two square yard of balcony in waning moonlight looking down on unseen shrine hidden by tall peepul tree whose branch must almost touch must mem really be suttee have asked again again must do so much for master must must really shave head grim smile of incredulity came to tara face then quick sharp frown of pain if did must care very much for huzoor besides have right to do mem be never suttee married again many time then mem be married to someone else must never shave head for strange man might take off jewel might even sweep floor shave head never supposing did oddest jumble of jealousy approbation filled tara heart so a yellow dawn broke bent over kate wake mem sahib said wake be time to prepare for day be time to get ready kate started up rubbing eye wondering where be a in truth well might for have never be in such place before long low slip of room be absolutely empty save for reed mat two inch of floor wall ceiling be freshly plastered with mud on floor be still wet for tara have be at work on already over doorway hung faded chaplet on lintel be printed mark of bloody hand round about in broad finger mark of red white ran eternal ram ram sita ram in sanskrit lettering in truth tara knowledge of secular religious learning be strictly confined to sentence there be faint smell of incense in room rising from tiny brazier sending up blue spiral flame of smoke before two inch high brass idol with elephant head sat on niche in wall represented eternal wisdom kate did not know in way did tara only knew be gunesh jee outside be yellow dawn purple pigeon beginning to coo sidle quivering heart of peepul leaf have everything ready for mem began tara hurriedly if will take off jewel must pull one open for tara said kate holding out arm with gold bangle on master put on for have never have off since tara knew that a well a knew that master must have put on since have not have in fact watched with jealous eye over over again there be mem without smiling over scantiness intricacy of coarse cotton shroud there be hair yet said tara with catch in voice if mem will undo plait will go round to old poojarnis get loan of razor only life up next stair will have to snip off first said kate quite eagerly for in truth be becoming interested in own adventure now that have a be control over be so long held up tress a spoke be beautiful hair soft wavy even dye unrenewed for day have almost gone leaving coppery sheen distinct must never cut off said tara to herself a went for razor woman must ever shave head willingly why when have have done for first time have screamed fought mother in law have held hand paused at door a re entered paralyzed by what saw kate have found knife tara used for limited cooking seated on ground cheerfully be already surrounded by rippling hair have cut off by clubbing in hand sawing away a groom doe at horse tail tara cry made pause next moment rajpootni have snatched knife from flung one way razor stood before with blazing eye heaving breast be foolishness said fiercely mem can not be suttee will not have kate stared at must began there be must at interrupted tara superbly will find other way then bent over quickly kate felt hand upon hair there be plenty left said with sigh of relief will plait up so that one will see difference did put gold bangle on again also by dawn next day kate found once more installed a screened woman time a hindoo lady under vow of silence solitude in hope of securing son for lord through intercession of old anunda swami have told sri anunda said tara with new respect in manner have to trust someone be a god must not hurt fly paused then went on with tone of satisfaction say mem must not have be suttee so foolishness be well over what be to be done next tara asked kate looking in astonishment round wide old garden arched over by tall forest tree set round with high wall in found in faint dawn must just see glimmering straight path parceling out into square must hear faint tinkle of water runnel ca surely stop here mem will only have to keep still day in darkest corner with face to wall said tara sri anunda will do rest when soma return must take mem away before thirty regiment come trouble begin thirty regiment echoed kate startled others have gone out to see if be true say so in palace be full of lie said tara indifferently be indeed more than ever began to need confirmation so there be big talk of action jingling of bit bridle spur in city a well a in camp be to intercept siege train from firozpur be to get round to rear of ridge overwhelm be to do everything save attack in face meanwhile other people besides soma such like sadducean sepoys have gone out to find thirty regiment secret scout from palace be hunting about for someone to whom might deliver letter addressed to officer subadars chief others of whole military force coming from bombay presidency to effect that statement of defeat of royal troop at delhi be false lying fabrication contrived by contemptible infidel english true story be that nearly ninety thousand organized military troop nearly ten fifteen thousand regular other cavalry be now here in delhi troop be constantly engaged night day in attack on infidel have driven back battery from ridge in three four day please god whole ridge will be taken when one of base unbeliever will be sent to hell be therefore on seeing order to use endeavor to reach royal presence so joining faithful give proof of zeal establish renown consider imperative though hunted high low east north south west royal scout found one to receive order so came back to delhi damp pulpy for rain have begun again turning great tract of country into marsh bog generally wetting blanket in sepoys kept guard sulkily chapter iii beginning of end drenched kate erlton also despite arcaded tree above corner a sat with face to wall in wide old garden at first heart beat at step on walk behind soon realized that be hidden by vow happed about from possibility of intrusion by penance not many step came by kept chiefly to other end of garden where sri anunda be to be found be curious experience there be yard of two of thatch screened by matting supported by bamboo leaning not far off against wall into crept at night to find indulgence of dry blanket at first felt inclined to seek shelter when rain poured loudly on leaf above fell thence in big blob making noise like little ripe fig when squirrel shook down remembrance that such woman a tara performed like vow cheerfully kept steady after day two often started to find be already noon dusk day half gone done time slipped by with incredible swiftness in watching squirrel bird in counting raindrop fall from peepul leaf what strange peace contentment life brought a sat after dark in thatch eating rice milk fruit tara brought stealthily felt at time terrified amaze at if ever came through long struggle for life surely must be strangest part of dream tara indeed used to remark with satisfied smile though mem must not of course be suttee still did very well a devoted repentant wife sri anunda must never have have better penitent then in reply to kate curious question must say that sri anunda be swami if mem once saw spoke to must know what meant have lived in garden for fifteen year not a penance swami needed penance a men woman did for be not man oh dear not man at so kate going on hint of inhumanity guided by conventional idea of hindoo ascetic imagined monstrosity felt rather glad than otherwise sri anunda kept out of way be eager also to know how long might have to stay in garden vow tara said lasted for fifteen day till then one must question right to sit look at wall by time soma must have returned plan for getting mem away to ridge settled for master be evidently not going to return to city perhaps have forgotten mem kate smiled at drearily thinking indeed might for might be dead even uncertainty about thing save that sat watched squirrel bird have ceased to disturb peace a matter of fact however be thinking of more than ever with sense of proprietorship be new to here by god grace be one woman for to save somebody to kill must fail needing selection there be enough enemy to spare within wall still even though have be melting away of late new one have come to ridge though killed few sapped steadily at vigor of garrison be autumnal fever bad at delhi in year worse than usual in wet season counterbalancing benefit of coolness sending regiment to hospital one day letting out of next sensibly le fit for arduous work claimed jim douglas already weakened by made wound slow of healing have good luck certainly said major erlton finding with chattering teeth taking quinine dismally know how be though be lot thinner life seems to suit have felt so fit for age have not be so fit in truth be healthier simpler life than have led for many long year ever since john nicholson have bidden go back to tent sleep even haggardness have left face restlessness having be replaced by eager certainty of success be coming steadily to front too so ridge said since nicholson have taken up have well deserved since there be not better soldier cool stubborn certain to carry out order very man in short whom men like general wanted if stayed to finish must have distinguished career before herbert erlton never thought of hated thought instinctively of late have even given up thinking of city never sat watched rose red wall now perhaps because be too busy so left that to jim douglas who have nothing else to do while went about joyously preparing to accompany nicholson in next lesson of law order for in city be becoming more more difficult day to make lie pas muster even in palace so in despair four commander in chief for once have laid head together concocted plan for intercepting siege train from ferozpur so be necessary that must be taught futility of such attempt not that even palace people really believed possible how must when almost day now letter came to ridge from member of royal family asking effusively how must serve english cause only old king revising list of precedence listening still to brocaded bag taking cooling draught making couplet being cozened by queen breathed upon by hussan askuri hovered between policy of being great moghul poor prisoner in hand of fate delight of former be too much for a rule must sit finger single gold coin have come a present from oude a if be to have chance of minting million with similar inscription bahadur shah ghazee have struck upon gold coin of victory even in solitary grandeur have in truth surpassing dignity of own in phrase struck upon gold coin of victory so looking at forgot that be mere sample sent a accompanying brocaded bag said with promise to pay more when more victory brought more gold zeenut maihl a looked at thought with sort of fury of certain gold within reach hidden in house what be to become of coin with john company mark on for still lingered in palace other woman have fled be wiser than knew that come what might life be safe with english a victor so there be nothing gold to think of gold jewun bukht son royal signet be in possession altogether now sometimes order especially when be for payment of money have to go without because queen of world be asleep did not dream be over though in way clung fiercely to hope so ghaus khan with neemuch brigade bukht khan with bareilly brigade khair sultan with scraping leaving of regiment who owning leader of own did what be right in own eye set out to intercept big gun nicholson set out on dawn of th to intercept rain poured down in torrent gun sank to axle in mud infantry slipped slithered cavalry be blinded by mire from floundering horse so from daybreak till sunset little force two thousand in more than one half of whom be native labored eighteen mile through swamp at noon be true called halt nine mile out at village where woman clustered on housetop in wild alarm remembering day month back when have clustered round unleavened cake head man wife have bidden listen to master gun over far horizon be to listen to again that day for enemy be ten mile further over marsh be noon force doubt have be afoot since four general nicholson be emphatically not eight hour man so shovings slitherings of gun mortal began again cheerfully still be nigh on sundown when across deep stream flowing from big marsh to west contract worker came on job be eager to finish ere nightfall six thousand rebel of arm holding three village bastioned old serai town be strong position in right angle formed by stream flooded canal into flowed water impassable save by unknown ford in stream by bridge held in force over canal on two side of on others dismal swamp desperately strong position to attack at sundown after eighteen mile slithering shoving in pouring rain especially with unknown odds against not le anyhow than three to one john nicholson have single eye be eye see one salient point here be that bridge to left leading back to safe shelter within wall of delhi cowardly foe must have chance of using that bridge during silent night watch so without pause fifteen hundred of two thousand waded breast high across stream to attack six thousand nicholson riding ahead for hasty reconnoissance since growing dusk left scant leisure for anything save action yet once more glance be sufficient ere men exposed to heavy fire of grape in crossing ford be ready to advance order be given there be hint of cover in rising ground before old serai strongest point of defense must utilize rush position change front sweep down on bridge must not remain a chance for coward instant longer than must help for nicholson in everything did seems never to have contemplated defeat so flanked by gun supported by squadron of th lancer guide cavalry three regiment marched steadily toward rising ground following that colossal figure riding a ever ahead till suddenly a charger foot touched highest ground nicholson wheeled held up hand to below lie down men came clear strong voice a rode slowly along line lie down listen to what have got to say be only few word so sheltered from fire lay listened of st know what sir colin campbell said to at chillianwallah said same thing to others at alma say to now 'hold fire till within twenty thirty yard of battery then boy will make short work of ' men can not cheer lying on stomach unmelodious grunt will sir by god will be a good a one nicholson faced round on serai again gave order to artillery so in sharp thud widening into roar flanking gun began work dozen round so then rider motionless a statue in center looked back quickly waved sword went on men be up after over hillock into morass beyond silently steady men steady with on with steady listened to clear sonorous voice once more though there be shelter now from grape canister musket ball rather only shelter of one tall figure ahead riding at foot pace steady hold fire will give word never fear come on come on so through perfect bog stumbled on doggedly here there man fell men will fall sometimes now then let have be within limit twenty yard off lay gun there be one furious volley above one word answered by cheer so at point of bayonet serai be carried then without pause troop changed front with swiftness unforeseen swept on to left to delhi brother to delhi old cry begun at meerut rose now with new meaning a panic stricken gun limbered up made for bridge too late captain blunt be after chasing wheel of foremost driven wildly jammed following must pull up so helter skelter be in jumble out of englishman helped whole thirteen day rather night be won for nature dark flag of truce hung even between assailant few desperate defender of third village who with escape cut off be selling life at cost to attacker of seventeen out of total death roll of twenty five nicholson knew position sure so left night to finish rout with men bivouacked without food cover among marsh for be too dark to get baggage over ford yet troop be ready to start at daybreak for eighteen mile tramp back to ridge again there be talk of exhaustion now a at budli ke serai so just thirty six hour after started be just one hour for mile of morass none for fight startled ridge by marching in again clamoring for food nicholson be in towering temper have found that brigade have be lurking behind canal that if have have decent information might have smashed also on way home have even guide that did pick up commented major erlton angrily by george how nigger cave in to political information be rot if general have obeyed instruction must have be kicking heel at bahadagurh still heard at about two o'clock said new listener suppose be night attack risky business rather herbert erlton burst into laugh elation on face have pathetic tenderness in be bridge expect blew up before starting sat on till then besides there be wagon tumbril thing told tomb to blow up too for of course have to bring gun back must shove lot a passed on of listener smiled be case of possession said one to neighbor pardon said who have known major for year be case of casting out wonder speaker paused shrugged shoulder did hear name have gone up for v c began companion gone up dear fellow might have gone up fifty time over be pluck that wonder at be steadiness never shirks little thing be almost a if have found conscience perhaps have be cheerful enough to have have testimony of good one a in passing looked in on jim douglas met congratulation bad shilling replied major beautifully unconscious so have heard hello what be up for jim douglas be busy getting into disguise old scoundrel tiddu came into camp with news hour ago said latter whose face be by mean cheerful be out carrying grain saw fugitive came in here hoping for backsheesh believe jim douglas looked round rapidly at major be awfully afraid erlton that have not be in delhi to speak of since left be relying on for news there be be there broke in major erlton with queer hush in voice none there may be so be off at once must have better chance villain say sepoys be slipping in on sly in hundred for palace folk at least king think troop be still engaged be sending out reinforcement so will have trouble in getting through gate major erlton radiant splashed from head to foot covered at once with mud glory looked at man opposite with curious deliberation see why must go at said slowly must if mean must rather did why question came sharply do want truth asked herbert erlton with sudden frown certainly then will tell mr greyman mean douglas be grateful d n sir if if want to be more so gave chance once like fool for might have saved hard handsome face be broken up with passionate regret pity of kept jim douglas silent for moment for understood might said at last interfere with here ca save wife mean if fail can always there be need to tell what to do then

so protecting real advance through garden be first day of siege kate erlton sitting in little tent have be moved into quiet spot a have begged to be allowed to stay on ridge until news came of man to whom owed so much thought with shudder must not help of what must mean to many innocent soul shut up within wall be bad enough here where very tent seemed to shake must be terrible down there beside heating gun in roar rattle grime ache strain of muscle in city even in sri anunda garden so naturally enough wondered once more what must have become of man who have gone back to find nearly ten day

persian character so presume be use showing to concern chiefly want to know if be safe have to answer immediately have message must like to send message echoed only that must come back at once of course john nicholson looked at calmly will say nothing of kind replied be best for man to decide such matter for flushed up hotly have not slightest intention of dictating to mr mr douglas general nicholson considering how much have already sacrificed for sake have better let do a like dear madam interrupted general with sudden kindly smile however faded a quickly a came leaving face stern like many man have sacrificed too much for woman mr erlton so if ever can make up to for of pain do so be worth good by will tell that be safe that in spite of have permission to go ahead kill more better have not faintest idea why made last remark did not puzzle for be occupied with previous one sacrificed too much that be true carried scar of knife upon clearly man who have just left presence who for courtesy have treated so cavalierly be rather vexed with for feeling sudden sense of being poor creature came over flashed upon that must imagine world without woman be in one almost at very moment not world without men yet that ceaseless roar filling air have more to do with woman than men went more a challenge of revenge than stern recall to duty be true men working night day in battery thought little of men right only of woman wrong even general wilson in order have appealed to under on ground only urging to spend life strength freely in vengeance on murderer did down in scented koodsia garden men never seemed to tire never to shrink though shot from city not two hundred fifty yard away flew pinging through tree above high wall gave cover so off duty slept peacefully in cool shade sat smoking on river terrace thus while first battery pounding away from right at moree cashmere bastion diverted attention enemy deceived by feint lavished dogged courage in trying to keep up

so position must be held so said baird smith at chief elbow so wrote neville chamberlain unable to leave post on ridge man in hospital thinking of burn bastion thinking with strange wonder of men who must refuse to follow muttered under breath thank god have still strength left to shoot coward yet general wilson in way be right five day afterward major hodson wrote in diary troop be utterly demoralized by hard work hard drink for first time in life have have to see english soldier refuse repeatedly to follow officer jacob nicholson greville speke be sacrificed to terrible indictment indeed against brave men yet not worse than underlying chief order of th directing provost marshal to search for smash bottle barrel to be found let beer wine so urgently needed by sick run into gutter admission three day later that attempt to take lahore gate have failed from refusal of european soldier to follow officer one rush must have be done easily be still therefore in same position

blown open gate got palace hafzan veil up to prevent mistake limped over to where moulvie lay turned gently on back straightened limb closed eye must have liked to tell truth to someone there be one to listen so left there before tribunal to have appealed chapter vi reward punishment so strain of month be over on ridge delhi be taken queen health be being drunk night after night in palace of moghul there be one person to whom passing day brought growing anxiety be kate erlton for there be tidings of jim douglas none at first have comforted with idea that be still for reason keeping to yet unconquered part of city that be obliged to do so being impossible long file of woman child seeking safety passing through ridge fearlessly precluding that consolation still be conceivable might be busy though seemed strange must have sent word so like many in india at time waited hoping against hope possessing soul in patience have lack of occupation to distract how must there be for woman when close on twelve hundred men have come back from city dead wounded now st of september be upon city be occupied work be over yet captain morecombe coming back from shook head have spent time trouble in search have failed failed even from kate limited idea of locality to find tara lodging roof in mufti quarter must have found said almost pathetically of course be impossible now must be so for time to come be afraid be use mr erlton said captain kindly there be not trace to be found even by hodson spy unless be shut up somewhere must be dead be so likely that must be must see that possibly before siege began let hope so why asked quickly mean that there have be horrible thing done of late thing like poor soldier who be found chained outside cashmere gate a target for fellow have there must so much rather know worst used always to tell mr douglas so prevents one dreaming at night shivered a spoke man watching felt heart go out toward with throb of pity how long wondered irrelevantly must take to forget miserable tragedy to be ready for consolation yes there have be terrible thing on side there always be ca help when sack city replied interrupting hastily with sort of shame ghoorkhas have devil in when be down in mufti quarter shot dozen of helpless learned people in chelon ke kucha one who coached up for exam about twelve woman in house of 'professor of arabic ' so styled jumped down wall to escape own fear chiefly for men wanted loot nothing else be worst of whole story from beginning to end seems so needle be a if fate interrupted quietly have be fate fate from beginning to end sat for instant with grave face then looked up with smile perhaps be rather apropos de bottes mr erlton wanted to ask question have white cockatoo once when first came here seem to recollect bird making row in veranda when used to drive up face grew suddenly pale sat staring at with dread in eye yes replied with manifest effort gave to sonny seymour because because loved broke off then added swiftly eagerly what then only that found one in palace to day there be jolly marble latticed balcony overlooking river king used to write poetry there say well saw brass cage hanging high up on hook there have be loot in precinct know for staff have annexed thought cage be empty till took down from sheer curiosity there be dead cockatoo dead echoed kate with quick smile of relief oh how glad be be dead captain morecombe stared at poor brute said under breath be skin bone starved to death expect forgot about when got really frightened be cruel devil mr erlton major have used self same word to alice gissing eighteen month before in same connection perhaps fortunately for kate in present state of nervous strain that knowledge be denied to even so coincidence of bird absorbed have yellow crest began oh then must have be yours interrupted captain morecombe rather relieved for saw that have somehow touched on hidden wound one be green yellowish green dare say king kept pet like oude man be dead anyhow said kate hurriedly knowledge gave unreasoning comfort to begin with seemed to a if fateful white wing have begun to overshadow world on sunny evening down by goomtee river have ceased to hover over then rounding of tale for that bird be little sonny favorite did not doubt made feel that fate must not leave that other portion of unfinished inevitable sequence must be worked out somehow must hear something so once more waited like many waiting with eye strained past last known deed of gallantry for end surely must have be nobler still when knowledge came told must be content yet there be thing held to hope even more than be remembrance of john nicholson word if ever have chance of making up seemed prophetic for who spoke be so often right men talking of a lingered watching advising warning despite dire agony of pain drowsiness of morphia said there be none like for clear insight into very heart of thing yet a lay without complaint be telling have be blind have sought more from world than there be in so though news of capture of burn bastion brought brief rally sank steadily hodson coming into tent to tell of safe capture of king queen upon st at humayon tomb found eager to hear particular so eager that when sirdar of mooltanee horse regiment have practically raised who sat outside in dozen waiting for breath of news about fetish must not keep quiet emphasized third order by revolver bullet through wall of tent greatly to delight since a retired further off agreed that nikalseyn be nikalseyn still surely death dare not claim one so full of life even hodson smiled in swift silence in laboring breath of dying man must be heard well sir went on a be saying got permission thanks to to utilize information mean rujjub ali that sneak elahi buksh suppose put in nicholson be sharp work king only went to humayon tomb yesterday must have have cut dried before surely queen have be trying to surrender on term time back sir replied hodson hastily have lot of treasure eight lakh spy tell be anxious to keep however to go on after stopping with elahi buksh night no doubt a say pressure be put on then went off a agreed to meet bukht khan refused to go with of course promise of life then be negotiating already not exactly must have done without promise unless wilson have agreed to send out troop must so have to give in though personally must deal rather have brought old man in dead than alive well set off morning with fifty of horse sent in two messenger while waited outside be nearly two hour before came back for old man be hard to move zeenut maihl be screw when bahadur shah talked of ancestor wept told must have thought of before let bukht khan army go in fact did business for stipulated for promise of life from own lip so rode out alone to causeway by big gate be splendid place sir more like mosque than tomb drew up to attention zeenut maihl came out first swinging along in curtained dhooli rujjub who be beside called out name title decorously must help feeling be bit of scene know being there alone then king came in palkee so rode up demanded sword asked if be hodson sahib bahadur if must ratify promise so have to choke over for there be two three thousand of crowd by time then came away be long five mile at footpace with crowd following until neared city then funked besides have said openly 'd shoot king like dog despite promise at first sign of rescue be except that must have seen officer face at lahore gate when asked what 'd got in tow said calmly 'only king of delhi ' so that be done well done said nicholson briefly reaching out parched right hand well done from beginning to end hodson flushed up like girl be glad to hear say so sir replied a nonchalantly a must personally of course must rather have brought in dead even that slight action however have left nicholson breathless only comment for time came from eye bright questioning eye seeking now with sort of pathetic patience to grasp world be leaving make allowance for shortcoming now for prince said hodson did write to wilson sir nicholson nodded think will consent only only make more promise hodson of must be hung deserve death hearer gave rather uneasy look at clear eye remarked sharply thought deserved more than hanging once sir old imperious frown of quick displeasure at challenge came to john nicholson face then faded into half smile be not so near death make difference so good by hodson may see again paused smile grew clearer strangely soft news suppose of poor fellow douglas who did agree with none sir warned be useless foolhardy to go back when information doubt interrupted dying man gently still 'd have gone in place lay still for moment then murmured to so be on way before well think can be unhappy after death a for poor lady when see hodson tell be sorry sorry have chance last word be once more murmured to ended in silence kate erlton however did not get message must perhaps have ended lingering hope major hodson be too busy to deliver permission to capture prince be given very night early next morning set off to humayon tomb once more with two spy second in command about hundred trooper small party indeed to face four five thousand palace refugee who be known to be in hiding about tomb waiting to see if prince must make term like king have done hodson order be strict be to bring in mirza moghul khair sultan ex commander in chief abool bukr presumptive unconditionally not at morning be deliciously cool crisp full of promise of winter in perfection of climate console punjabee for six month of purgatory sun sent yellow flood of light over endless ruin of ancient delhi here extend for mile on mile nasty country for skulking enemy hodson pluck dash be equal to anything rode along with heart joyous at chance full of determination to avail of gain renown someone else however be early astir on d of september so a to reach humayon tomb in time to press on to kutb if need be be princess farkhoonda zamani ever since day now more than week past when last message to city have warned that supreme moment for house of timoor be at hand have started from study of holy writ telling piteously that must find prince abool bukr must at sacrifice to pride seek since must not seek must warn keep hand in hers again have be distracted by impossibility of carrying out decision for expecting immediate sack of town mufti people have barricaded only exit bazaar ward when after day two did succeed in creeping out be to find street unsafe palace closed against now at least there be chance like royal family knew of two spy rujjub ali mirza elahi buksh who be saving skin by turning queen evidence knew of hodson sahib promise to king queen knew that abool bukr be still in hiding with arch offender mirza moghul khair sultan at humayon tomb association be fatal if must persuade to throw over uncle go with if afterward must open negotiation with englishman prove abool bukr have be dismissed from office on very day of death challenge have be in disgrace ever since have even be condemned to death by king surely might yet drag dearest from net into zeenut maihl have lured with what bait scarcely trusted to think first thing to be done therefore be to persuade abool to come with to safer hiding must risk pride reputation very opinion of for surely man of nature be to be tempted so put on finest clothes discarded jewel set off about noon in ruth sort of curtain dhoolie on wheel drawn by ox gay with trapping set with jingling bell let pas at delhi gate after brief look through curtain during cowered into corner without covering face lest might think man stop by george be pretty woman said english subaltern who passed a came back to guard room never saw such eye in life be a soft a soft a well know what looked somehow a if have be cry for year a if saw saw something know saw sentimental idiot be enough to make woman cry retorted companion then two mere boy wild with success high spirit fell to horse play over insult yet first boy be right newasi eye have seen something day night night day ever since have strained into darkness after prince abool bukr when broke from kind detaining hand disappeared from mufti quarter that something be flood of sunlight holding figure a have seen more than once in wild unreasoning paroxysm of sheer terror seemed to a if must hear white lip gasping once more over cry brought vision why didst not let live mine own life die mine own death to die to die needlessly to die in sunlight perhaps there be flood of now outside ruth a lumbered along by jail not quarter of mile yet from city gate half shivering peeped through gay patchwork curtain to assure held horror god holy prophet what be crowd on road ahead not ahead be in now so that ox paused unable to go on crowd cluster of spear point then against jail wall open space round ruth englishman on foot three figure stripped not three only two for one have fallen a crack of carbine rang through startled air two one now that oh saint have mercy vision vision be abool dodging like hare begging for bare life seeking at last out of sunshine under shadow of ruth wheel abool abool screamed be here come be here did hear kind voice may have for echoed clear before third final crack of carbine so clear that driver terrified lest must bring like punishment on drove goad into ox next instant be careering madly down side road bumping over watercourse ditch newasi felt more buffeting lay huddled up inside a unconscious a other figure by major hodson order be being dragged out from under wheel placed upon beside two other corps for conveyance to city none of crowd ready so tale run to rescue prince lest death must be portion in future raised voice hand to avenge now that have come so ruthlessly so wantonly perhaps english guard at delhi gate cowed a have cowed who day before have followed king so far then slunk away so little cortege moved on peacefully far more peacefully than other ruth with unconscious burden be racing kutb ward a if be afraid of very sunshine princess farkhoonda huddled up in jewel finery have forgotten even forgotten even vision seen in hodson a rode at ease behind dead prince seemed to court light gloried in deed telling that in le than twenty four hour have disposed of principal member of house of timoor so fulfilling own word written week before if get into palace house of timoor will not be worth five minute purchase ween telling also that in shooting down with own hand men who have surrendered without stipulation to generosity clemency surrendered to hundred trooper when have five thousand men behind have rid earth of ruffian telling that be glad to have have opportunity be game to face moral risk of praise blame got former unstintingly from most of fellow a in triumphant procession body be taken to chief police station there to be exposed so say eye witness in very spot where four month before englishwoman have be outraged murdered in very place where helpless victim have lain strange perversion of truth responsible perhaps not only for praise for very deed so mohammed ismail barter of truth soul for life of forty prisoner at kolwab counted for nothing in judgment of world hodson lacked praise blame from one man john nicholson lay too near judgment of world to be disturbed by vexed question in when next morning came men meeting other said sadly be dead news brought to kate erlton by captain morecombe when came over to report failure took heart out of even hope there be use in staying longer be afraid said quietly be only in way will go back to meerut then home to boy think must be best replied kindly can arrange for to start to morrow morning will be better for change will help to forget smiled little bitterly when have gone set to work packing up such of husband thing a wished boy to have with calm deliberation early in afternoon went over to garden of old house to get fresh flower for what must be last visit to rear guard of graf to take also last look at city watch grow mysterious in glamour of sunset seen from afar seemed unchanged mass of rosy light lilac shadow with great white dome of mosque hanging airily above smoke wreath yet end have come to four month dream a have come to hers rebellion must linger long stronghold very raison d'etre be gone memory must last longer still yet surely must not be bitter hers be not then with rush of real regret thought of peaceful roof of old tiddu of princess farkhoonda tara soma of sri anunda in garden be to go home to safe snug england live in suburb forget forget tragedy yet even that held beautiful memory alice gissing under young mainwaring scarf while lay at foot husband leaving good name to son did not thing help to make story perfect not perfect with remembrance eye filled with sudden tear there must always be blank for in record spirit have moved on face of water bringing chance of healing atonement to so many have left hers in shadow have learned lesson ah yes have learned chance of using a sat on plinth of ruined veranda watching city growing dim through mist of tear john nicholson word came back to once more if ever have chance must never come now never started up wildly at clutch of brown hand on wrist brown hand with circlet of dead gold above come said voice behind come quick need tara gasped tara be be alive then must not need mem if be dead came swift reply then with wild eye fixed on gold circlet upon wrist held tara laughed shrilly so mem wear still have not forgotten woman forget white black with strange stamp of foot interrupted fiercely come say come if there have be doubt a to rajpootni sanity at time in past day there be none now glance at face be sufficient be utterly distraught clutch on kate arm utterly uncontrolled so that involuntarily latter shrank back mem be afraid cried tara exultantly so be will go back tell master tell be right wrong for english chattered will tell mem be not suttee how must be old taunt roused many memory made kate ready to risk anything be coming tara where stood facing tall figure in crimson tall figure also in white hand full of rose have gathered tara looked at with old mingling of regret approbation jealousy pride then must come at once be dying may be dead ere get back dead echoed kate faintly be wounded then sort of somber sullenness dulled excitement of tara face be ill replied laconically suddenly however burst out again mem need not look so have done must have done be fault will not take thing mem can do more have come to so that none will say 'tara killed master ' so come come quick five minute after kate be swinging cityward in curtained dhooli tara have left waiting on road below trying to piece out consecutive story from odd jumble of fact fancy explanation tara poured into ear between swift abuse of bearer for not going faster assertion that there be need to hurry mem need not hope to save huzoor since everything have be done seemed however that tiddu have taken back letter telling of kate safety that in consequence of master have arranged to leave city in day two tiddu born liar gold grubber so rajpootni styled have gone off at once to make more money on very eve of going back to ridge jim douglas have be struck down with great sickness after two three day instead of getting better have fallen a tara put into old way so far kate made out clearly from point became difficult to understand reproach excuse pathetic assertion of helplessness fierce declaration that one must have done more what be use of huzoor talking english night said even suttee must not go out when everyone be being shot in street besides be obstinacy master must have got well if have tried who be to know where to find mem indeed if have not be for sri anunda gardener who knew gardener folk of course must not have found mem even now for must never have known house to inquire at not that must have mattered since mem must hing nothing nothing kate looking down on bunch of white flower have literally be too hurried to think of laying aside felt heart shrink be rather fateful gift to be in hand now have come there of set purpose must man who have done so much for be beyond care save pitiful office of dead still even be better than that must lie alone untended so urged by tara vehement upbraiding dhooli bearer lurched along to stop at last seemed to kate a if heart stopped also must not think of what might lie before a followed tara up dark strangely familiar stair surely thought must have known among thousand there be step on have once crouched terror stricken because be shut out from shelter within now tara finger be at padlock tara hand set door wide kate paused on threshold feeling in truth dazed once more at strange familiarity of thing seemed to a if have just left that strip of roof aglow with setting sun bubble dome of mosque beginning to flush like cloud upon sky tara watching with resentful eye put different interpretation on pause said quickly be within mem be away be quieter rest be same there be nothing forgotten nothing kate however heard only first word be already across outer roof to gain inner one tara still beyond threshold watched disappear then stood listening for minute with face tragic in intensity suddenly faint voice broke silence

fear to touchstone of truth a stood hesitating voice querulous in extreme weakness said in hindustani be too soon tara want anything need wait thank lay with face turned from so must stand wondering how best to break presence to noting with failing heart curious slackness lack of contour even on hard string bed seemed lost sunk in have seen that sign so often of late that knew what meant one thing be certain must have food stimulant if possible before startled so stole back to outer roof expecting to find tara there tara help roof lay empty sudden fear lest after have only come to see die while be powerless to fight death from sheer exhaustion seemed so perilously near made put down bunch of flower held with impatient gesture what fool have be not to think of other thing a glanced round eye fell on familiar earthenware basin kept warm in pan of water over ash be full of chikken brat excellent of kind too then in niche stood milk egg bottle of brandy arrow root everything nurse must wish for in evidently in case brew must be condemned be fresh chicken ready for use strange sight to bring tear of pity to woman eye did for kate reading between line of poor tara confusion began to understand tragedy underlying word have just heard want anything tara need wait thank seemed to see with flash long long day have passed with patient polite negative coming to chill half distraught

stronger voice did nicholson take replied quietly thinking best to be concise give a be fresh grip on fact have fallen king be prisoner prince have be shot most of troop move on to morrow toward agra epitomized situation beyond possibility of doubt gave faint sigh then be over be glad to hear tara never knew anything seemed so long have known refused to tell kate wondered in insane absorption have really thought of nothing chance fate have thrown in way of saving man life yes must have be very long kate realized a watched spent weary face before bright hollow eye fixed on glow be now fast fading from dome over murmured to well suppose must be helped followed thought unerringly great pity for man who have done nothing where others have done so much surged up in made seek to show fate worse than others besides discouragement be fatal for pointed to lack of desire for life be best weapon against death might fail to rouse a have failed who day two before have sent bit of red ribbon representing victoria cross to dying salkeld hero of cashmere gate only gained in reply faint smile word will like at home still must try yes be over echoed have cost so many life uselessly general

regret vague resentment why did let kill then go away went on almost passionately must have be better than saving to remember always stood in way better than giving chance of repaying for ah think how much better than leaving alone to new life like like others have done buried face on arm a rested on pillow with sob then be end thought bitter unavailing regret for so for space there be silence while sat with face hidden lay staring at darkening dome suddenly felt hot hand find hers so thin so soft so curiously strong still in grip give more wine something came voice consolingly will try stop if can made effort to smile back at be not very successful a fed be better did not help kate erlton to cheerfulness for be accompanied by murmur that chikken brat be very different from tara stuff so seemed to see poor ghost glowering at from shadow asking how dared take thanks ghost remained long after jim douglas have dozed off remained to ask so seemed to kate erlton question must be asked about mystery of womanhood manhood tara asked none when in first gray glimmer of dawn crept up stair again stood beside sleeper for kate wearied out have fallen asleep crouched up on stool head resting on pillow arm flung over bed to keep touch on hand seemed to bring rest tara once more in widow dress looked down on silently then threw bare arm upward so for second stood white shrouded appealing figure against dark shadow of dome blocked paling eastern sky then stooping long lissome finger busied stealthily with thin gold chain about sick man neck for there be something in locket attached to be hers by right now hers if must have nothing else for be suttee suttee unuttered cry be surging through heart brain rousing mad exultation in when hour afterward re entered narrow lane

smoke below leaping flame there be many wanton fire in delhi during first few day of license be one of already in dawn english officer be at work giving order limiting danger a much a possible ca save top bit said one at last then turned to one of fatigue party have cleared everybody out sergeant a told yes sir be quite empty have be so five minute before be not now for canopy of smoke licking tongue of flame have given last touch to tara unstable mind have crept up up blindly be now on knee in bare room set round with one scrap of culture ransacking old basket for something have not seen light for year scarlet tinsel set wedding dress hand be trembling wild eye blazed like fire below men waited calmly for flame to claim last prize for turret stood separated from next house god came english voice a something showed suddenly upon roof thought said be empty be woman be woman in scarlet tinsel set dress poor ornament possessed upon widespread arm so outlined against first sun ray stood shrill chanting voice rising above roar rush of flame oh guardian eight of world next sun moon air earth water own poor soul bear witness oh lord of death bear witness come day night twilight say be suttee there be louder roar sudden leaping of flame turret sank inwardly chanting voice must be heard for second in increasing silence followed shive jee hath saved own said crowd looking toward unharmed shrine over on other side of city kate erlton roused by same first ray of sunlight be looking down with smile upon jim douglas before waking sky be clear a topaz purple pigeon be cooing sidling on coping in bright fresh light saw gold locket lying open on sleeper breast have often wondered what held now thinking might not care to find at mercy stooped to close be empty snap slight a be roused not however to knowledge of cause for lay looking up at in turn so be over said softly said with smile yes be over down on parade ground behind ridge bugle be sounding men who have clung to red rock for so long be preparing to leave for assault elsewhere one man be taking eternal hold upon for john nicholson be being laid in grave not in rear guard however in van on outer most spur of ridge abutting on city wall within touch almost of cashmere gate being laid in grave by own request without escort without salute for knew that have failed so lie there facing city took real grave be in narrow lane within wall where who dream can see still alone ahead with yard of sheer sunlight between fellow men yard of sheer sunlight between face with confident glance forward voice with clear cry come on men come on mass of men who with timorous look backward hear in call to go forward nothing vain regret for thing familiar must be left behind going going gone so in way john nicholson stand symbol of many life lost uselessly in vain attempt to go forward too fast yet voice echoed still to dark face light alike come on men come on book vi appendix from dashe collector magistrate of kujabpore to r tape esq commissioner superintendent of kwababad fol o dated th may sir in reply to of th april requesting to report on course of mutiny in district measure taken to suppress effect if on judicial executive financial work under charge have honor to inclose brief statement for convenience ' sake have drafted under usual heading of annual report be unable to send in till last week regret delay pressure of work in english office due to revising of forfeiture pension list made unavoidable have honor etc etc dashe coll magte introductory remark so far a district be concerned late disturbance have simply be military mutiny at time must be truthfully called rebellion in outlying post indeed people knew little nothing of what be going on around even in town resistance be not thought of until prospect of immediate suppression of mutiny disappeared small force of soldier in district of course followed example of brother nothing else must be expected from position midway between two large cantonment indeed continuous stream of mutinous troop passed up down main road during summer have decidedly bad effect commenced to disperse disturber of public peace on st may be largely escaped felon from meerut jail fact that be quite indiscriminate in lawlessness enabled to rally most of well doing people on side hanged few of offender having enlisted small corp with aid of native gentleman whose name append for reference sent out under charge of assistant being forced throughout whole business to remain at headquarters keep grip on thing to put down goojurs other predatory tribe who took occasion to resort to ancestral habit of life real opposition however be ever met with in june after failure to take delhi by coup de main became known there be organized attempt to seize treasury fortunately have twenty thirty of new levy in headquarters at time so that attempt failed be able to bring one two of ringleader one regret to say man of considerable importance in district to justice subsequently made several application to nearest cantonment for few european soldier to escort treasure two lakh to safer quarter unfortunately must not be granted to so have to keep strong guard of men over money who might have be more useful elsewhere until fall of delhi matter remained much same isolated band of marauder ravaged portion of district often regret to say escaping before punishment must be meted out to general feeling be one of disquiet alarm to european native table attendant for instance absented from dinner one day sending substitute to do work under belief have given order for general slaughter of mohammedan that evening have done nothing of kind after fall of delhi a be aware mutinous fugitive fifty sixty thousand strong marched southward in compact body caused much alarm after camping on outskirt of district for few day suddenly disappeared be told dispersed during one night to own home anyhow literally melted away public mind seemed to become aware that contest be over that struggle to subvert british rule have ignominiously failed matter therefore assumed normal aspect believe that there be more shame sorrow regret in heart of many than will probably ever have full cognizance of that will take year for one race to regain confidence other self respect civil judicature court be temporarily suspended for week two after original work went on much a usual appellate work suffered there be indisposition to institute hear appeal possibly due to total eclipse of higher appellate court have little leisure for civil case criminal justice there have be far le crime than usual during past year possibly because much of have necessarily to be treated summarily so did not come on record be inclined to believe however petty offense really be fewer when serious crime be being properly dealt with police le said about behavior of police better force simply melted away a be always inefficient absence have little effect save perhaps in failure to bring up trivial offense mentioned in last para jail jail be happily preserved throughout for addition of four five hundred felon to bad character of district might have complicated matter be peculiarly fortunate in since learn that only nine out of forty three jail in province be so held revenue sub head land arrears under head be le than usual there seems reason to apprehend serious loss to government opium there have regret to say be considerable detriment to revenue under head due to fact that smuggling of drug be extremely easy owing to small bulk that demand be greater than usual stamp revenue here show increase of r be unable to account for unless prevailing uncertainty made public mind incline toward what security must compass in matter of bond agreement etc salt custom department show very creditable record subordinate with help of few volunteer be able to maintain custom line throughout whole disturbance value a preventative of roving lawlessness can not be over estimated four hundred eighty two smuggler be punished custom brought in r more than in ' work done by handful of isolated european patrol with only few native under to cause of law order can not be estimated in money education higher education went on a usual primary instruction suffered female school disappeared altogether public work many thing combined to stop anything like vigorous prosecution of new public work in hand be greatly retarded post office work in department suffered occasional lapse owing to murder of solitary runner by lawless ruffian service continued fairly efficient attempt be made by confiscation of sepoys letter to discover if organized plan of attack resistance be in circulation nothing incriminatory be found correspondence consisting chiefly of love letter financial at one time necessary cash for pay of establishment ran short be met by bill upon native banker who have since be repaid hospital dispensary be in full working order throughout year number of case treated especially for wound hurt many of grievous above average health population be normal supply of food grain ample market strong well supplied throughout grain store be burned plundered a rule if robbed b b in turn robbed c so matter adjusted in many case also booty be restored amicably when became evident that government must hold own agriculture notwithstanding violence of contest many instance of plundered burned village necessary impressment of labor cattle license of mutineer consorting with felon agricultural interest did not suffer plowing sowing went on steadily land be well covered with full winter crop general remark beyond plundered burned village be still somewhat of eyesore though be recovering rapidly only result of mutiny to be observed in district be that money seems scarcer so cultivator have to pay higher rate of interest on loan there be of course empty chair in district durbar append list of late occupant also suggest that vacancy might be filled from other list a of gentleman who helped to raise levy have not yet got chair in regard to future punishment however venture to suggest that order must be issued limiting period during mutineer can be brought to justice if such check on malicious accusation be not laid down will have fine crop of false case perjury etc since late disturbance have naturally caused good many family difference in view of also believe must be safest in event of such accusation in future to punish whole village to alleged mutineer belongs by heavy fine rather than to single out individual a example in case like present be extremely difficult to measure exact proportion of guilt attachable to member of community even with very greatest care find be not always possible to hang right man be difficulty will increase a time go on appendix b delhi christmas day dear mr erlton can scarcely believe that two whole year have passed since helped to decorate christmas tree in government college here long month before wall others of wild chase after vanishing mutineer over india seem to belong to someone else existence now world around be back in commonplace of life be down to day helping chaplain wife with tree have very pretty sister by way just out from england almost fancied a looked into dim screened veranda where be going to have entertainment must see sitting there with little sonny seymour on lap a found that afternoon half asleep that interminable play about lord of life death be have be too much for well can only hope that mr douglas health pleasure of scotch home of wrote delightful description will allow of returning to india sometime giving sight of again meanwhile be reminded that sent off small parcel by last mail trust may arrive before wedding a must do convey to kindly remembrance of friend many thousand mile away not that will need to be reminded fancy that few who went through indian mutiny will ever need to have face place saw there recalled to memory terrible a be at time feel must not willingly forget single detail so being certain that hold interest imagination also be inclosing something for to read can not imagine silent diffident dashe writing can careful way in must order gallows to be removed lay down sword in favor of pen at earliest opportunity see favor clemency canning so do most of out here except who have not yet recovered nerve remember hearing hodson sad be death over needle piece of dare devilry very angry over something mr douglas said about being in blind funk be afraid be true of good many not dashe however kept district together by sheer absence of fear so did many report then will carry on in story a be since left for rest there be not much to tell remember old mess khansaman numgal khan turned up with bill out of pure delight insisted on feasting so lavishly that have to make moderate transport even with batta prize money must have be bankrupt like royal family

school in city if have only befriended instead of turning out to find own fate must have done better for talking of friend foe be rather amusing to find village full of men busy at plow with suspiciously military set about shoulder who according to own showing never wore uniform doffed before mutiny began be much struck with one of defaulter other day big rajpoot who for name might have
