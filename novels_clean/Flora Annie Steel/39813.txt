destruction of mind so when leisure became hers at last took up thread of life where have be broken by intrusion into of gwen death started to climb hill a must have done at dawn be natural instinct always other girl might shut up in room to think might sit with foot on fender dream have to go out to feel fresh breeze on face before mind must work at a sat on rocky sheep shelter whither foot have

virginity of mind fought desperately against intrusion of glad new impulse of self surrender have felt when saw ned iris that supposed be love what be sort of love worth if brought death with to to herself to mind felt indescribably smirched stained a glanced at fresh white serge skirt be wearing seemed to see on still that crimson blood be horrible must be there always for scarlet a sin matter how white a wool seemed to others poor gwen be end of have doubt yielded to love have have terror of at first have also felt degradation of so a sat more dreaming than thinking voice called started to foot remembering in flash that other man voice have called gwen in very place man whom have called coward whom have smitten with lily held be not opportune moment for ned blackborough who having come over to cwmfaernog with congratulation have after hearing from martha of tragedy followed girl straight to favourite outlook with sort of instinctive knowledge of what must do have always seemed to posse at present moment be in offence to aura what right have to pry into mind what be wrong asked checked in quick sympathy by expression on face offence since what right have to know anything be wrong nothing answered curtly only came here for quiet seems a if be not to have stared at for second then with shrug of shoulder turned to go thereby bringing to pang of remorse since when have not be courteous not be kind quick return therefore reckless obstinacy showed on face relieved cat may look at king miss graham said coolly came to say be sorry be a fail to see that birthday have monopoly over new year day will wish many happy return of latter may temper never grow worse have to smile sudden outburst of truth be so like ned when anything occurred to ruffle disarrange smooth covering of convention thank replied quite frankly feeling curiously at ease did not mean to be rude know said simply paused knew so well that knew that though lip quivered for second said more there be need to say more be so curious to have sitting there beside now that have come trouble have gone be once more absolutely at ease thanks also for iris said after pause feeling glad to escape from tragedy of life be jolly wish have dug poor thing up did not dig up replied coolly did then how wired to covent garden for came down in charge of such superior person that almost have to ask to dine so 'the most beautiful thing in most beautiful place in world remains beside sphinx a paused a what asked have come half prepared to speak of love there be about face to day curious half forlorn puzzled look made feel inclined to take in arm kiss away a remembrance of naturally replied sat down on nearest stone feeling just little dizzy clasping hand across knee stared out at pale blue misty valley pale blue winter sky beyond why must want something to remember by said slowly will always remember without anything freedom from conventional cloakings in speech be at time trifle disconcerting felt inclined to reply be very kind of make other banal remark of sort might bring convention back then cursed for low beast followed unconsciousness a closely a must perhaps wanted to remember exact word said suggested do remember answered aggrievedly be what complain of remember little thing say be most uncomfortable can not think why must took fate in hand ca can be because happen to love sat still for second then turned looked at with narrowing eye see what have to do with knew what be thinking about very first time met must not possibly have be in love with then seriousness made laugh outright be most delicious piece of comedy to be sitting there talking of love a if did not belong to while pulse stay be bounding have quieted down to curious content be not so sure replied gravely there be such thing be doubtless aware a love at first sight not for sensible people think be sensible argued grudgingly know at rate be not in love with for long time afterwards whole world seemed to spin round with ned then be oh dear dear please cried hastily drawing back from outstretched hand hate being touched besides have nothing to do with what want to find out why from very beginning did always understand can have nothing to do with love not at least with love like gwen last sentence came thoughtfully in lower key love will be different dear said almost solemnly if will marry aura will try to understand to very end so help god smiled at brilliantly must must help be reason why must marry seems to have mixed thing up somehow be reason at perhaps not admitted following thought then marry for other reason dear shook head there be only one reason for marriage said with wisdom born of untrammelled teaching of nature if be to marry must be afraid yes ned will tell truth because be certain to understand must be afraid of loving too much want to love like sat bewildered passion dying at hand of truth then muttered half to feeling with rush of shame how far be from how little really understood innocence of evil heaven know why must be miserable beast oh hope to god must dear hope to god must why asked calmly have answer ready so harked back after while to lower level be most original reason for refusing man ever heard said whimsically have others of same sort responded instantly to mood plenty replied cheerfully to begin with be far too rich be only just beginning to realise how must hate to have money besides be wrong know know said dryly be quite easy to divest oneself of money never find slightest difficulty in getting rid of so let stand in way be turn to laugh soft little laugh with hint of reproof in expect do ted be always saying be reckless then there be grandfather know doe like so much a like ted deuce doe assented ned sudden pang of jealousy softened by sense of comic be surely not going to marry ted in order to please grandfather looked at disapprovingly might marry one worse ted be dear felt exasperated yes be uncommonly good fellow happen to love do at least think do felt that certainty might overpower self control love took notice of went on argumentatively then think like marriage in rank of life with poor man lot of work trouble child must be very interesting look at lady smith biggs know what sir joseph be like of course look a if led dull life very assented ned back to smile once more must if be take lady smith biggs ' a test case there be plenty of marriage paused feeling must be difficult with aura standard to adduce many example then be prepared to chuck everything go forth with sandal shoon into wilderness if need be yes be right be hardly marriage that wanted after so for time sat looked out over pale blue mist behind hill loomed large seeming to lose in pale blue sky there must be something better said girl at last oh ned there be something better better than love echoed perhaps than love not better than mine people always say that perhaps said to gwen child said swiftly think of be not love be not marriage replied softly what mean have nothing to do with what be called love with what be called marriage be what mean too shook head be too fine for aura want be not satisfied without be so close to that must lay hand on hers s sh said swiftly laying other hand on so a to detain listen just below in sheltered corrie grew great holly tree covered with berry glowed scarlet against distant blue on topmost twig with flaming breast yellowed by exceeding brilliance of blood red berry robin have settled to sing sang of what of berry beneath foot of distant mate out of gladness of heart of life because of beginning did not remember of end did not know who can say sang a sang two sat hand in hand forgetful even of what humanity call love forgetful of thing except also be dreaming dream of life did not say so cried exultantly when song have ceased did not tell there be something better have forgotten have forgotten yet be happy because be hand clasped answered swiftly because touched touched drew hand away flush came to face feel afraid a do want to keep what love apart to keep safe even from did not be not only kept back from taking in arm kissing to knowledge of what man love must be yes said unsteadily constrained to truth by hers there be love doe not stain will give if can looked at with vain regret in eye must if be married must anyhow ah ned must spoil spoil what asked roughly for began to feel worsted for time something better replied gaily let wait for really want to marry ned must hate knew that when saw iris then wish have climbed up

sorry vexed angry clear eye be looking through a if must see into innermost thought will not marry be afraid do understand what mean to be afraid of myself for for deserve something better suddenly stooped kissed withering flower held dropped at foot be off like mist wreath down hill did not attempt to follow simply sat down again on stone where have be sitting before swore to god sooner later

have frightened quaint compound a be of nature culture must leave to think out for two month during time also must have time to make up mind concerning many thing be becoming dimly conscious that life be resolving into spending of money in order to escape from responsibility of having money into fighting of money by money must be rather interesting to let fight go on while raised no finger to protect own personal right if indeed have be beginning to doubt aura must be a happy nay happier without money yes in one thing worth having one thing without even life be not worth having money have

be something better something beyond something of glimpse must be caught during journey between cradle grave so for one brief moment a stood looking at iris saw that something beyond birth beyond death beyond even love shimmer came to air pulse caught rhythm lo be more one be from uttermost end of space came back ceaseless wave of unity then then fear of death re asserted surely flag of iris showed limp dear thing must not stop there without due foothold on round world else must lose immortality of new birth so tired a be lifted up saxifrage in hand went downstairs so across lawn to place wotted of where might grow undisturbed by fear of old adam meddling fork there be certain solemnity about necessarily slow movement felt almost a if be conducting funeral so in truth be funeral of careless girlhood be woman now have begun to understand yet a laid flower on spot where intended to plant went for trowel pity of funeral hit hard when returned be blue eye seemed to look at appealingly from iris broad face be such beautiful eye dug furiously forgetful of everything desire to bury until step sounded beside looked up to see pair of blue eye broader bolder looking down at what be digging said ted with ring of aggrievedness in voice grave oh beg pardon dear ought to have said that ought to have reminded have be expecting to return for such long while oh poor little girl be so sorry for must have be horrible normal sympathy brought back to normal realised a have not realised with ned that after be mere girl who needed cossetting comforting after terrible shock of

grateful to for failure to disturb inmost soul must have be awful said blue eye showing kindness in world ca think how got through with a have be so brave far braver than must be come let talk think of more let spoil last afternoon stood up startled last cried in quick concern oh ted why be last took step nearer to face lit up with content be so glad care suppose be selfish be glad yes have to go hirsch have business for in paris most important business must leave by mail to night even a spoke mind running on ahead thought with different content of what visit to paris might mean to if thing turned out a hoped might must echoed wistfully seemed to a if friend have have be leaving ted have be help to during last few anxious day how will manage without went on doubtfully will miss so much there be almost tear in voice ted felt wild desire then there to come to explanation knew be wiser to wait will come back at once if be wanted replied hope sha be wanted at least not in hurry for of course will come back again soon then really have time now have to put up thing see stayed a long a must with thinking must be sure to come in at once there be faintest reproach in tone instant pang of remorse shot through girl have stopped talking sentimental rubbish to ned while ted be doing duty will go in to in moment said hurriedly have only to plant flower set to work hurriedly ted lingering to look down superciliously at iris be rather pretty said did find in wood aura blush be hidden a hastily filled in to proper dimension perfect grave have previously dug ned gave a a new year gift ted half smiled thinking that if have have a much money a lord blackborough must have known better how to spend on girl loved of course if ned chose to be so niggardly in thing so lavish in others be own lookout hope liked book binding be quite so nice a must have wished began aura interrupted heartily liked ever so much thanks so many will always like be best of book summer winter be always same became taken with own thought pursued be like flower have to watch for blooming time have even to smell scent have to think for of storm slug frost field mouse here smiled at own alliteration if want there be ready to make happy do know have be regular book to lately ted flushed up with pleasure have said frankly that be good hearing wish be whole library once more paused obsessed by idea of night mail to paris a went off to pack thing almost wished that have come in little earlier then must not have have eminently satisfactory talk with grandfather so far a at rate be concerned be plain sailing for old man distressed at hearing of ted sudden departure have for first time taken into confidence be not exactly pleasing confidence be only what ted have expected aura must be penniless since year before sylvanus smith have sunk money in annuity must cease with death under circumstance ted have felt that kindest wisest thing be to allay anxiety that tardy anxiety be in form of selfishness by speaking of own love for aura earnest desire to marry if must have of course will marry mr sylvanus smith have said with calm shrewdness who else be there for to marry whereupon ted divided a to whether be doing magnanimous mean thing have suggested lord blackborough have produced perfect storm of incredulous irritation bare idea be absurd blackborough like in rank be merely amused by pretty face sylvanus smith have only tolerated a ted friend must forbid house in future granddaughter of must marry lord briefly old man whose life have be spent in preaching socialism liberty in abstract who denied existence of social rank proclaimed right of individual to independent action be ready to forswear tenet pose a relentless parent of good old type ted have forborne to smile feeling really magnanimous time have attempted to smooth over old man irritation none le knew to be point in favour so a packed portmanteau whistled lightheartedly aura meanwhile having finished burial went off to book room where found grandfather a usual busy with pen paper writing table drawn up to fire solitary extra chair in ted have be sitting looking lone outcast camped away in open beyond leather screen in winter always surrounded mr smith socialism fire be looking little flushed paused ere sitting down on floor by hearth to say anxiously have be vexing hope grandfather while be away have rather headache so went up hill martha martha have be excellent a usual replied on whole doe parkinson work fairly well though must wish here sighed absence of suitable cap apron be certainly to be deplored make excellent omelette turned again to work of writing pamphlet on simple life aura sat watching a have watched a long a must remember be very fond very proud of extremely well read curiously quick in mind have taught everything knew be just beginning to find out that everything be more than most woman be supposed to know have found no difficulty in holding own with ned ted dr ramsay mr hirsch except so far a mere knowledge of world went be not worth counting to mind grandfather have have best of argument have ever heard then ned must never argue with still have not taught thing have never mentioned love marriage birth death though surely be chief factor in life in woman life anyhow suddenly out of almost bewildering ramification of thought put almost thoughtlessly question grandfather be father fond of mr sylvanus smith looked up startled distinctly pale have not honour of father acquaintance said icily therefore can not say then a be pulled together will oblige continued by not asking more question of sort can not answer went on writing hand trembled little have heard formula more than once after time moved thereto by new stress in thought girl rose going up behind stood looking over shoulder grandfather said be not going to ask more question about past see that matter at must like to have known that father be be glad of mother must have be think though died so soon must like to know what be in future what what do expect to do do wish to marry turned round in chair looked at helplessly be rather peculiar question dear said feebly of course answer if worry please urged quickly if must speak of must be great help vaguely felt choky over last word did seem so hard to be left alone in wide world to face dark problem be not usual subject for discussion even between parent child aura replied if ask yes be extremely anxious for to marry why question came swiftly mr sylvanus smith put down pen finally turned foot to fire thought for moment of quite variety of reason because be natural end of woman for year past have laboured in vain to convince world marriage be slavery because wished to be happy so many marriage be unhappy because must have liked to see grandchild about in innermost heart knew that few month of life be for have right to look decided finally on real reason because because when die child can not be far off voice became poignant with fond reproof heaved sigh honestly felt heroic dear said grandly there be use in deceiving ourselves may live on other hand waved pretty white hand gracefully conversation be beginning to interest though have acquiesced in ted cruttenden desire to let question stand over for present felt there must be harm in diagnosing aura attitude fact be dear that when die will be very badly off in fact be source of very greatest anxiety to aura will have nothing mean money unless be married happily married see how can earn own livelihood then must earn by being

to lip kissed little ring must be hers always to remind of love death birth came between two chapter xviii poor gwen death have caused quite pleasurable excitement in village there can be question that to save immediate few whose natural emotion be involved most death bring quicker tide of life to living have be said indeed that funeral be often prelude to marriage be that a may gwen despite gift of grace have lived short life on different plane from rest of village girl except in little shepherd cottage amid hill few real tear be shed over dramatic death be so dramatic to die in full song to shed life blood in trying to bring glad news to other soul surely that must avail surely that sacrifice must turn sinful soul to peace though did not know for mr sylvanus smith prospect of peace be a well did not aura grandfather be special object of intercession at many hundred of chapel very next sunday for story naturally grew in telling meanwhile gwen poor soul be laid with much fervour beside baby rector duly officiating for old shepherd wife thinking of own funeral to come held fast to tradition else might be in life death brought back to church back to solemn old service in dust be reverently committed to dust ash to ash nearly village attended for in way be proud of gwen there be one notable absence alicia edward be not there to take part in singing day of wrath over dead friend be in bed at rate confined to room for dramatic death on new year morning have apparently be too much for nerve gossip of village went in out condoling with applauding sensibility retailing to affecting particular of funeral wreath remembrance from soul saved by dead girl singing excellence of mourning provided by myfanwy jones apparently real grief of mervyn pugh who went about looking like lost soul only over latter statement did alicia edward commit so far a to say with sphinxlike gravity wonder mervyn gwen be always friend yes indeed even at school be friend looking back from new knowledge concerning gwen past alicia only wonder be indeed that one have ever suspected mervyn yet who must suspect mervyn pattern of village mervyn among whose perfection own facile heart have be entangled many year past be alone village girl must have given eye to secure for own now that have fallen from high pedestal seemed to woman like desired more than ever desire in truth be cause of seclusion be not ill simply must not make up mind what to do one half of asserted that ought to denounce mervyn that be wrong for to allow thus to play hypocrite that must be good for soul health to do penance in sackcloth ash other half found excuse for beneath cloak of consideration for slur must be cast by unrighteous over whole revival must be shown that one of most prominent in starting be so to speak unrepentant castaway for repentance in such case a meant confession for elder of congregation have clamoured lack of have sent unbaptized child to happily infinite mercy seat of god alicia knew have be well brought up well drilled by father in catechism in inmost soul very conventional placid harmless soul be quite shocked at mervyn stony heartedness for must not make up mind to denounce must give time knew that knew secret that be only person in world now who knew at least of world for wild girl of cwmfairnog a village have dubbed aura have not even attended inquest martha have given evidence martha have known nothing so there be likelihood of truth coming out except through alicia perhaps mervyn knowing must come to unburden soul undoubtedly if providence have not intended to denounce sinner of a day went on became more more certain must have have other purpose in making sole recipient of terrible knowledge what purpose for to a to morris pugh a to nearly trafficker in cheap marvel impulse to see hidden meaning direct dealing of creator with creature man have become almost obsession what purpose then must providence have have in thus choosing alicia edward out of village to be sole recipient answer be easy that mervyn might come to a sort of mediator a might have come to father confessor so a time wore on alicia waited for mervyn mervyn never appeared not even after came down becomingly dressed in deep mourning to sit in back parlour receive friend myfanwy jones whose holiday have be extended over funeral by reason of many order have successfully placed for looked in several time there be not much love lost between two nowadays so when on morning after funeral myfanwy came to say good bye alicia be relieved felt influence of big beautiful worldly creature to be malign once be removed be sure that mervyn must surely return to holder of secret will be going by midday carrier said alicia cheerfully will have fine drive to llanilo beautiful drive assented myfanwy be trying to make mervyn pugh take with for change prefers to mope did not know such friend of poor dead gwen challenged alicia with bold black eye alicia felt flush when people spend life together in holy work myfanwy dear replied in purring voice be very close grow to other very close indeed if spend life together anyway retorted myfanwy with superior laugh often grow very close very close indeed sometimes too close alicia be prepared for smiled sweetly understand religion myfanwy a mervyn say be such pity must hope for best will come day so will christmas replied myfanwy with sphinxlike smile be not fond of waiting may be well good bye dear be frightened when williams edward send in bill need not be paid till be married remember alicia paled memory of bill be more to now than mere fact that when came must mean demand for money that might manage how about claim on character for must be big bill record of much extravagance one comfort be that if married mervyn seemed not so unlikely now a have seemed short time ago must not be so terribly shocked at rate must not be in position to throw so many stone be lovely afternoon one of early january day when earth sea sky combine to play trick on world cheat into belief that winter be over air too felt lighter more wholesome to alicia now that myfanwy jones have presumably left village presumably because though alicia have not actually seen go box have certainly be in carrier cart alicia have almost made up mind that if mountain must not come to mahomet mahomet must go to mountain sunday must not pas without explanation between mervyn must not be right to allow to remain without reproof exhortation required good deal of courage for be by nature timid by making duty of assuring that soul good be only object succeeded in bracing up to sufficient virtue for task so feeling there be time like present spent hour in making look a attractive a must in singing dress have be designed with considerable care for appearance set off on mission did not go straight to minister house stood at further end of village most incongruous unhappy looking villa such a one see by dozen in suburb of large town stucco bow window gable end for might have provoked attention branched off to left so going up school road be prepared to make visit on return journey by going down pathway led from school towards house have often returned from class thus with mervyn choosing longer road for sake of handsome boy company thought made mind drift back to long year during have be taught have taught so many thing what relief have be to escape from living by rule so much time for so much time for duty punctual a clock dependent on machinery certain to run down stop unless received continual impetus from without 'that cometh from without ' word came back to vaguely yes have be taught so many thing what have learnt how many four shilling worth of stamp for instance have not saved up herself caused pupil to save up child in village have post office saving bank book have be taught thrift one of girl must do a have done run into debt over clothes at least put money on back be tired of be hungering for natural work wanted to be wife of strong man bear child live immersed in household detail be metier felt drawn to so a turned in at back entrance of minister house heart be soft felt in sentimental mood past be past most men life held something be not quite well quite respectable in case there must be earnest repentance to make past more more presentable then through window of dining room saw group of two people standing face to fire back towards there must be no doubt a to skin tight black sheen of waist round mervyn arm circled in security of possession be be myfanwy in best dress also in second hot cymric blood lay hidden somewhere behind alicia almost phlegmatic calm have leapt up in resentment almost before realised what be doing have passed entrance stood in room challenging two table be laid for tea there be air of placid comfort of a be collusion gave finishing touch to anger so have not gone with carrier myfanwy jones said mervyn arm left black satin waist hastily myfanwy did not budge simply threw backward glance over shoulder oh good afternoon alicia did not go mervyn be to drive over to llanilo in thomas waggonette a soon a have have tea in instant resolved into duel between two woman for possession of man who stood beauty somewhat blurred by anxiety looking like fool between have come replied alicia firmly to have talk with mervyn about about something so perhaps will drive alone to llanilo myfanwy might be better fixed mervyn with eye held in world of entreaty besides indignation inward uneasiness felt threat perhaps must be better myfanwy said helplessly have much to talk over arrange before start again on on work myfanwy turned on like flash will hold tongue mervyn pugh said magnificently be between alicia edward then turned back again to adversary say what will to now alicia be engaged to be married so can say to what will say to alicia gave little cry of real dismay oh mervyn say be not true think of poor silly gwen just dead pulled up being in truth still half hearted in desire to denounce myfanwy shot swift glance at mervyn be really honestly fond of idea at rate alicia word suggested be not new to still matter what said to about in future be time for defence quick ready defence yes said gwen be dead so why must drag out of grave poor soul 'let dead past bury dead alicia learnt that in school be sure happens be going to marry mervyn of that may be sure be then that alicia feeling inward certainty that be true that bolt have failed of mark gave rein to denunciation must speak to oh mervyn think cried voice ringing with perfect medley of emotion who have saved so many think of own soul think how soul of child think how soul of poor gwen cry out against man step on gravel outside made myfanwy start forward with muffled exclamation be quiet will will be overheard will ruin will hold tongue cried alicia be past worldly wisdom even with myfanwy strong hand threatening stood ground voice rose let hear let world know that mervyn pugh mervyn good righteous be gwen seducer father of child then even anger failed before knowledge that morris pugh stood at door listening with muffled cry mervyn turned flung down on sofa face crushed into hard horsehair cushion vaguely felt hardness to be shelter myfanwy looking a if must have killed alicia moved to laid hand softly protectingly on shoulder fret mervyn said coldly will soon be over so for space there be silence then morris pugh braced to task be a pastor of wandering sheep a stand before maker alicia edward said bringing hand down on table to grip with clenched nervous force be accusation true answer be sudden burst of tear ask sobbed be true voice insistent almost cold in very insistence must take denial yes assent must scarcely be heard for sob morris pugh gave sigh be almost a if be human in left body with long laboured breath for instant afterwards be accuser judge mervyn pugh god forgive for bearing father honoured name have done wrong without repentance have stood by child grave said never word never word even to spiritual guide although asked remember that asked have stood before lord long month eating at table drinking of blood with sin lying unconfessed in heart partner of sin have stood together before great white throne voice mingling in god praise while body mervyn started to foot morris morris before heaven be not true be not so bad a checked in full flow of superhuman blame minister paused something of man came back to will say nothing of myself went on of of shame have excuse can show just cause why must not deal with ala thousand time ala brother a minister of god must deal with unrepentant sinner with hypocrite with man who have defiled innermost sanctuary of god temple there be silence only round myfanwy full lip showed certain impatience weariness for necessary fuss to subside leave room for common sense so have excuse then prepare for condemnation of congregation prepare to be humbled to dust before lord myfanwy shifted impatiently what good will do will only humble congregation came clear full voice will only be paragraph in paper morris pugh winced thought of before muttered god forgive thought of before too much perhaps no added firmly shame must be faced yes mervyn must be faced even if mother then with cry morris pugh be on knee by table hand clutching at rim head between sinking to very dust oh god forgive oh god for sake for sake forgive for sake of many prayer tear forgive mervyn stood pale a death alicia little part long since played sobbed softly in corner only myfanwy looked at three almost with distaste mervyn be very sorry be sure of that must not have be worth fuss said hardly why must shame be faced when when one be dead buried mervyn can go away living dead be one woman in sight of lord replied morris righteous wrath re aroused by word mervyn may go if like brother will denounce before congregation lip hand be trembling voice be firm mervyn sat down on sofa again covered handsome face with hand mind be in whirl chief thought being abject remorse for brother sake for mother be best so myfanwy muttered hoarsely go be can do for for now took up cloak hat without word there be use in trying to persuade people when be so exalted yes will go said be very silly mervyn come alicia have done enough mischief for one day be sure alicia followed meekly feeling not in least ashamed of role have played for violent emotion be to part of religious stock in trade by by must quiet down mervyn must make noble confession eventually must rise superior to trouble above rise superior to myfanwy girl did not say one word to other a went back to village together one meeting might have judged best of friend only a myfanwy branched off to smith cottage paused moment to say with smile day will pay out for alicia edward so mark word will pay may be forgiven myfanwy jones retorted alicia with spirit have done duty left alone by brother reverted of necessity to more humble more homely relation righteous wrath gave place to real grief blank hopeless remorse to real regret by time that housekeeper came in to clear away almost untouched tea have accepted position in so far a must be accepted there be nothing for to face public confession by so doing make what reparation must be thus tardily made mervyn indeed be by far more cheerful when time came to say good night have barely have time to think relief of having touched bottom a be be great felt in fact a repentant criminal might do on last night on earth a if morrow be to bring expiation must also bring pardon peace have spent evening together on highest possible plane of religious exaltation be mervyn who gripped brother hand said courage out of fulness of emotion face looked almost saintly a said hour later indeed when morris who have lingered near dying fire beset now be alone by almost unbearable grief looked in to see if brother be asleep found lying like child smiling in dream morris gave faint sob mervyn stirred in sleep mother said hurriedly softly mother dear dear mother must instinctively morris blew out light held lest might wake dreamer from dream so in moonlight stood torn asunder by love grief watching dim peaceful form upon bed suddenly turned closing door silently behind went downstairs once more outside narrow wall of house moonlight slumbered peacefully upon everlasting hill surely somewhere beyond narrow wall of world judgment slept eternal peace instant afterwards front door closed softly morris pugh leaving brother asleep have gone to find wisdom where have often sought of late in temple not made with hand must have be hour later that mervyn woke roused by pebble at window sat up with blurred consciousness wondering vaguely what be until pebble struck pane voice cried in soft whisper mervyn myfanwy by be strange then in second whole memory of what have happened came back to came back to find a be giant refreshed with sleep none of be really same for two consecutive hour many man will brave in morning from must shrink at night there a peered through curtain be myfanwy sure enough beckoning to to come down sight sufficient to bring combativeness to young blood even without two hour of blessed rest in sleep mervyn said when five minute after lip met in long kiss have come for see how love to do thing might ruin poor girl reputation have done wrong poor boy very wrong so have many of others who be so saintly why must stay to be prayed over by by alicia edward too will not have there will be no more if stop mervyn come

morris too if go why must speak what be confession without culprit come can write to from blackborough come there be more for from to night when morris pugh returned from temple be made without hand hour later house lay very still in moonlight paused at brother door to listen there be sound so passed on to own room took father bible mother picture few odd pound have in house so passed downstairs
