experienced eye following taut line rested finally on cast looped round branch just above apparently within reach mere possibility be sufficient to make forget save instinct to help break please can get eager voice unmistakably girlish refined echoed across to paul macleod who after moment astonished search traced to face half seen among parting leaf took off hat mechanically for though might have be pixie there be mistaking gender sex found large measure of outward respect in paul macleod for rest help offered be with invariably help accepted fact accounted for large portion of popularity since people like around whom memory of own benevolence can throw halo so stood watching marjory settle methodically to task wondering while who girl must possibly be for have white hand trim ankle be abundantly evident of charm be to be expected in rustic beauty of glen be afraid be giving lot of trouble said sympathetically a for third time branch flew back from marjory hold with sudden spring not at gasped jerkily one can not speak otherwise on tiptoe with hand above one head perhaps have better help perhaps have answered resentfully desisting for moment after fourth rebuff there be positive necessity for to remain idle might for instance reel in a pull faint smile be tempered by respect young lady on opposite bank knew what be about perhaps might even be good looking if be not

jump after next instant disentangled cast flung into air by rebound be hard fast in higher twig marjory must have stamped with despite thought wiser to laugh found opposite bank full of silent grieved sympathy will get yet called across water with renewed determination think if will allow will break in came deferential voice after time really must be very tiring to jump like not at thank retorted without pause never give in so appears will allow to come over help come over help indeed marjory growing anger slackened to contempt a if must come over without detour of mile down quarter of mile up river must know unless have memory ca jerked between effort have better slack line sit down will get somehow very much somehow hat fell off first then after desperate spring in succeeded in clutching lower branch hairpin struck work hot dishevelled exasperated yet still determined persevered without deigning reference to silence over way until arm clothed in grey tweed reached over hers bent branch down within reach looked round even in surprise great personal charm beauty of face looking into hers struck almost painfully for seemed to soothe quick vexation so to claim something from

so pointed out probable lie of fish sporting instinct overcoming contempt exclaimed against gaudy cast selected cast decent fish must have looked at except in flood time cried in real eagerness

seems so cruel many thing seem so afterwards one might spend lifetime in regretting if be worth be be wish anyhow have killed that fish why not go further back wish have interfered to safe cast for a happens one chose out be very one fate have ordained must remain in alder bush perhaps do replied stiffly realising how have played upon for first time knowledge rather to own surprise brought tear to eye wonder that regret having helped said with sudden change of manner if will tell where to leave fish will no longer trouble be sorry for having given so much already there be mistaking hidden depth of apology a stood there in sunlight looking at gravely marjory felt to full charm of gracious presence who must really be angry with for trifle for be trifle after name be marjory carmichael said briefly live at lodge with camerons want fish indeed then will not have owe obedience do not thanks beyond measure stood there with cap off smiling at feeling apologetic in turn hesitated after if be

somehow uncommonly pretty eye be too into bargain chapter v paul macleod sate in business room where so many laird of gleneira have received rent signed cheque playing part with great propriety much to will cameron delight astonishment captain macleod be undoubtedly laird a such bound to semi parental interest in living thing to say nothing of stick stone about old place on other hand have be away in perfectly different environment for nearly ten year seemed nothing short of marvellous to factor that must remember farmer cottier nay more wife son daughter by name so perhaps be though to tell truth mental quality represented be small being more le than quick responsiveness to renewal of past sensation very responsiveness ten year before have made paul shrink from giving unpleasant memory place in life moralist be apt to sneer at popularity possessor of faculty enjoys of course be easy to cheapen sympathy of man who when see be instantly reminded of past connected with in detail proceeds to inquire eagerly about ox as manservant maidservant everything be within gate yet when be said done though certainly give false impression that thing have never be out of mind gift be not only enviable one in argues quicker sensibility than possessed by more stolid if more honest neighbour so there be effort to paul macleod in taking up thread of past life at gleneira at same time felt more regret at hearing a did through will answer to inquiry of jeanie duncan death somewhere in vague south country than did for many item of news partly because old life have really passed out of existence for altogether partly because will being good natured kindly soul said nothing about child poor old peggy have brought with there be many men of sort more men for matter of than there be woman who hate to face sad aspect of life slur over painful story whenever can thus captain macleod be able to quit past plunge into future without even slight regret news must have brought for in way have really loved jeanie thought that admirable self sacrifice have not availed to keep memory pleasant must have be distinct annoyance a be began at once on plan arrangement convinced will cameron that laird must be going unconsciously to follow advice marry rich wife nothing else must explain fact that gleneira house have to be generally smartened up for present pending more solid repair during winter carriage horse have to be bought at once preparation of sort made for houseful of guest must come with shooting season in matter of slate glass stable garden will cameron felt equal to

smile turned round again so let be off to mr cameron perhaps that young lady who be staying with met by river morning marjory put in will eagerly why yes of course be very person want have awfully good taste indeed said other smiling again be thinking that in case must not claim distinction since have not favoured with much of approval not that mattered since have quite made up mind that during next few week before married sister came to do hostess marjory must be decided acquisition to limited society at command for paul be distinctly gregarious in taste did not take much to amuse needed gentle interest to start wheel of pleasure that interest be preferably woman so being able thus to combine duty amusement by visit to lodge calmly suggested adjournment on spot to will agreed blissfully oblivious of fact that not hour before have left mother in agony of redding up best parlour with view to laird expected visit in afternoon doubt when woman of future have won large interest for spectacle a mr cameron presented when saw two tweed clad figure lounging up path together will be impossible even nowadays attempt to describe feeling must fall far short of reality since few of

conviction brought sort of martyred resignation with a continued in lower key parlour a bare a loof o hand save for tea leaf on drugget more forlorn picture of discomfort must not have be suggested marjory standing by with needle thread promptly suggested that laird must be shown into study since be on point of going out assertion mollified old lady by suggestion that visit must be to alone wherefore not since have seen three generation of macleod come go so with vague remark about sparing rod spoiling child be to be supposed bore reference to poor will education hurried off to meet

paul on high chair began seriatim on domestic event in gleneira family during past nine year until head whirled life have seemed to so varied gay reduced to mere excerpt from first column of time yet deferential courtesy never failed a usual brought own reward for after time old lady finding impossible to resist charm thawed completely finally getting quite jolly frankly confessed annoyance hurried off to see if cake be not sufficiently baked to admit of gleneira breaking bread in house just for luck sake paul left alone began to frown be miss carmichael room apparently meant to steer

gently then hurriedly while marjory voice exclaimed in joyous relief gone at last what relief paul emerged from concealment with outstretched hand good morning miss carmichael said in charming voice

again if like so be anxious good pretty little mamma be very fond of jack be dear fellow intend to marry see quite well how foolish must be for mr woodward a watched rider pas down road told that alice be one in thousand deserved to be happy a doubt must be if married paul macleod who be so very nice looking point of good look be one upon mr woodward laid great insistence enabled to spend next hour two in finishing sentimental novel in lover after sternly rejecting counsel of parent guardian be rewarded in third volume with l year baronetcy for like most mother poor mr woodward be sadly at sea on matrimonial question romantic side appealed to fancy business side to experience since woman can have done duty in married state for quarter of century without seeing that where personal pleasure have be motive power in one point sheer personal self abnegation have be motive in ten meanwhile cousin after cantering round row have reined in horse for walk alice rode well exercise have brought unwonted animation to appearance jack on other hand be tall burly young fellow trifle over dressed otherwise unobjectionable looked best with heartwhole admiration for companion on honest face what pretty couple must make thought old spinster taking constitutional in kensington garden began straightway to dream of certain hunt ball where someone have danced with five time before supper how many time afterwards have never have to confess even to twin sister thanks to extra of course need not count yet nothing have come of just a got so far in reminiscence alice be saying to jack pleasantly will miss ride of ours jack sha why must miss asked anxiously for there be superior wisdom in tone knew dreaded be going down to heddingford when go can ride there be going to scotland first did mamma tell be to stay with captain macleod poor jack heart gave great throb of pain macleod echoed be tall handsome fellow be who used to hang round before came up from work allusion to paul good look be unfortunate since jack be not improved by sudden flush crimsoned even ear know what mean by hanging round retorted girl quickly be very vulgar expression again be unwise for jack knowing strong point be not refinement felt instantly superior to such triviality took upper hand call what like ally know perfectly well what mean what meant too there be denying after why must be denied have not right to have other lover besides jack let come for canter said in tone of voice elder sister might have used to troublesome little brother who required to be coaxed out of ill there be use being cross about know went little too far roused into laying hand on rein abruptly action startled for hated display of emotion being in truth totally unaccustomed to not yet ally want to have out first be time did yet know how to begin perhaps because never have beginning have always cared for know that ever since young man eye grew moist suddenly over childish recollection then almost savage look came to face cared be sure cared people have knack of saying wrong thing in case poor jack woodward gave mistress handle to pride prudence care echoed in patronising tone of course jack cared cared for very much care for now so much so that be not going to let be foolish more did understand what thing really meant in old day understand now broke in hotly continued perhaps for really see what there be to make such fuss about be very selfish do mean to say that be selfish of to love cried selfish to interrupted again with same facile wisdom very selfish if stand in other way after jack what need to make life really successful be something have of got be only soap boiler know society society echoed sternly what have society to do with did think be so worldly be not worldly retorted in quite aggrieved tone unless indeed be worldly to be sensible to think of a well a of to be unselfish straightforward straightforward what do call straightforward to let hang round a have done really jack be impayable with hanging round can not find le objectionable phrase be fencing with saw saw resented with almost coarse resentment of nature stronger yet le obstinate than hers yes if like will say have played fast loose with a have have known for year cared for intended to marry when girl allows that sort of thing to go on without word doe mean say be flirt heartless flirt have nothing more to do with turned horse a spoke without word rode off leaving to go home with groom inexcusable violence doubt alice told so again again in vain effort to get rid of certain surprised remorse for girl be emphatically moral coward display of high handed resentment so far from rousing opposition invariably made doubtful of own wisdom hated scene most cordially hated above thing to have opprobrious epithet hurled at for clung with almost piteous tenacity to own virtue be too hard too unkind of jack to blame yet despite condemnation seemed to dim lodestar of firmament common sense after if liked why must not marry why must such devotion be sacrificed to moloch of position in truth a thought over incident odd mixture of anger regret came to upset usual placidity so that much to own surprise broke down helplessly into tear over mother conventional inquiry a to how have enjoyed ride must find reason for unwonted emotion beyond fact that jack have be brutal called flirt have ridden away declaring that must have nothing more to say to that such must be case mr woodward a administered sal volatile talked about trying heat felt be most devoutly to be wished long course of three volume novel warned of danger of trusting to permanence of lover quarrel so after daughter have be provided with darkness eau de cologne variety of other feminine remedy against evil effect of emotion went off to own sitting room to consider position by light of five forty year of human experience to begin with girl feeling be clearly more deeply implicated than for matter of alice have imagined question therefore came uppermost whether fact ought to be admitted deprecated whether in short evident dislike to giving cousin pain be result of romantic attachment simply natural kindliness of girl for young fellow have known from infancy now cogitation of mother over daughter matrimonial prospect be always fair game for moralist novelist for mysterious reason least display of prudence be considered worldly yet on face of woman who have have say five twenty year of married life can not possibly fail to see how much of own life have be made marred by influence never considered in accepting dick tom harry in nine case out of ten be remembrance of own ignorance make espouse cause of lover who can bring greatest number of chance for content be idle to deny for instance that girl marrying into family will welcome be far le likely to quarrel with husband than one who be looked on askance by mother in law there be in sober truth immense deal to be said in favour of french theory hold that given favourable nidus kindly atmosphere germ of happiness be more likely to grow into goodly tree bear fruit thousandfold than when be planted in hurry by two inexperienced gardener in first pot fancy in great mart owing however to somewhat startling view a to sanctity of romantic passion over claim of duty towards others minor consideration be considered mercenary to last degree mother who be courageous enough to confess openly be held up to obloquy why be difficult to say since none of really believe in popular theory will not hold water for instant when put to practical test of experience even if leave out of consideration fact that fully one half of people one meet have never felt have never felt desire to feel absorbing passion mr woodward for instance have not moreover have brought alice up from cradle to share view of life have never once found way barred by bias towards more passionate outlook in fact be in mother estimate very last girl in world to find sentiment soothing on contrary distressed made cry necessitated lying down with smelling salt hot bottle then above thing loved certain refined distinction exclusiveness even a child have held head high in soap boiling connection though must doubt be very fairly happy with jack macleod family be distinctly more suitable question therefore soon resolved not into whether outwork of girl placidity must be defended how must best be effected how in short jack must be prevented from posing a martyr for mr woodward be sharp enough to see at present at rate danger lay entirely in daughter remorse be very unkind of jack must say commented skilfully on story alice unfolded to after time must be hard on dear men never have so much self control a have doubt knowledge that be right vexed get over little rebuff very quickly seemed to hurt though hate sort of thing murmured girl doubtfully looking a if be going to cry again hurt apparently though know quite well that only did duty suppose so remarked alice still more doubtfully only wish have be so unreasonable so do in case girl always have to have sense for besides jack have vile temper be soon over will see that will come to dinner a usual be opera night must miss for anything not even for dear alice smiled watery smile said did not think meant so little to a mr woodward maintained position having in fact ground for belief owing to despatch of certain little note have sent off before coming in to console alice ran thus dear jack alice tell be very much put about to day regarding visit to scotland why can scarcely understand dear boy if only for own sake since can scarcely wish to quarrel with do try keep temper of yours little more under control poor girl came home cry really can not allow to go out with again if be so inconsiderate ought to know quite well how sensitive be so for goodness ' sake let stupid misunderstanding disturb affectionate aunt sophia woodward p dine earlier to day a alice want to be in time for overture 'tannhauser note meant nothing according to wish of reader in case meant for jack returning to room after disastrous attempt to begin future role in life by playing whist with old fogy at club be feeling that life even a misogynist be unendurable when sight of aunt handwriting made heart beat note be not in least what have expected to receive made somehow feel a if have grossly exaggerated necessity for grief aunt soph be on side anyhow said young man with certain elation be brute be afraid result being that before alice who have be spending afternoon with paul macleod sister lady george temple have returned from drive jack with big gardenia in coat be ushered into drawing room where aunt in satin diamond be skimming through last few page of novel have to be returned to library that evening good boy said smiling now hope wo spoil alice pleasure to night by even alluding to rudeness jack looked little aghast aunt sophia must beg pardon then have better do at once replied mr woodward get over for there be at door can run downstairs meet for will have to go up to dress at once be late a be begging mistress pardon on way upstairs before eye of butler footman be not quite what jack have pictured to be better than nothing alice unfeigned look of relief at seeing must not be mistaken mr woodward slept soundly that night feeling that have done good day work steered bark of daughter happiness out of great danger happiness to philosophy meant much since virtue be so very much easier of attainment when life went smoothly be partly reason why did not detail past danger to husband after manner of wife who love to chase sleep from good man eye by breaking in upon delicious drowsiness of first ten minute in bed by perfectly needle revelation of past woe tie in fact between two whose night capped head reposed side by side be curious one if absolutely commonplace consisted of vast amount of mutual respect for other position a husband wife solid foundation of placid affection confidence for instance mr woodward knew considerably more about son sam woodward be debt than father did to say nothing of minor point in matter of household management then at least two third of mr woodward life be absolutely unknown to wife of bosom breakfasted dined at home on week day on sunday added lunch to other meal what be more never deserted for club on occasion of at home of life between be pm knew nothing except that lunched at bar in city so far a went be to exactly what be to outside world be to say mr woodward lucky financier whose name meant money even success failure of company saw advertised with name a director did not interest her for knew by experience that money to spare be always forthcoming to tell truth mr woodward be singularly lucky man when smash came to company for preserving north american indian from total extinction by supplying with sparkling beverage exhilarating non alcoholic to take place of deleterious fire water have happened to sell last remaining share day before even when scheme for supplying hard boiled egg to settler in africa failed did not affect home supply at yet mr woodward character a business man stood above suspicion worst have ever be said of be that must sail point two nearer to wind with safety than most men so that night also slept sleep of just undisturbed by thought of jack temerity even if have known of be to be feared that must have set question aside with mental verdict that be clearly business of girl mother to see to such thing poor mother who a look at bald head on pillow beside own can not feel even while must not now part with for world life must have be le disappointing if circumstance have be more kind a for alice slept peacefully also doubt poor jack pain have raised in gentle mind having be allayed by prompt submission jack snored positively snored for be rather fatigued with own excitement being of sort take most thing not so much keenly a heavily to tell truth also determination to marry cousin be so fixed that greater part of pain have be sheer inability to grasp idea of denial so that reverted gladly to old position without asking question a le tenacious man might have done chapter vii lord george temple sate moodily in armchair of study in little house in mayfair chewing end of cigar looking disconsolately at tray of whiskey water plate of oval thin captain biscuit on table be red haired smooth faced man with rather long upper lip good natured somewhat whimsical expression be confounded shame said to wife who with opera cloak slipping from pretty bare shoulder be resting for moment before going upstairs to bed graham give cook twenty five pound year heard telling so one day when be wanting new one yet there be thing fit to eat on

tolerance invariably extended to view ca give friend roast chicken rice pudding ca indeed nowadays people must come dear girl interrupted lord george obstinately there be four men at table who like partook of soup fish cheese straw one poor beggar did even have soup thought be apparently comforting for began more contentedly on biscuit wife be now interested in subject most thing interested either to affirmation denial for paul macleod sister be very clever woman if at same time curiously conventional well know who eats thing then said aggrievedly why last time have dinner party mean when woodward be here be sure paul ought to be infinitely obliged to for trouble take cook who came in used pound on pound of stock meat quart on quart of cream to say nothing of whole bottle of whiskey have better give lady ' said jane 'for fear a dinner might 'ave appearance ' among other unknown despised talent did not suit lady george theory of own role in life be distinct turn for mimicry admirable impersonation of jane therefore made husband burst out laughing since by whimsical perversion of affair loved wife dearly for very quality feigned not to posse for blanche be essentially theatrical woman loving to pose in relation of life present one being that of dutiful sister on paul return from india have not only hastened to impress on absolute necessity for marrying heiress if wished to keep gleneira in family have also introduced to alice woodward a girl who must suit part admirably for lady george knew brother foible thoroughly understood if married for money bride must be person who must neither offend refinement require much display of affection since paul must certainly never give away by pretending depth of sentiment did not feel yet must not marry

terribly expensive place to live in london mean retorted sister gaily can always go down to gleneira vegetate have be at beginning of season now paul have gone down not to vegetate to prepare old place for visit of inspection not without certain resentful irritation at necessity for though at same time put affair on easier footing for present afterwards however paul have intention of imparting sentiment into transaction if must be done knew to have vast capacity for falling in love after approved romantic fashion with pretty girl who be willing to let make love to so sister bewailing pound of stock meat quart of cream expended on behalf yet felt that have be successful then must hardly have recognised if have not be so since in own little world carefully avoided extending unwisely upwards downwards lady george temple be always cited a success in role felt called upon to play heard from paul to day by way said a gathered up glove fan want to go call on mr vane remember who mean of course replied lord george relapsing into moodiness over biscuit never do remember what mean dear be colonel wife who nursed paul when nearly died in india of course do very often know be more confusing than sending for woman whom can pay get rid of afterwards still really did save life under providence of course at least paul always said so well husband who believe drank did something died two year ago leaving dreadfully off so went to live with somebody uncle aunt who fancy must have left money for have just taken house somewhere in chelsea paul who have seen since old day have asked

blasius to understand what be really required of here advent of big stalwart figure in wrapper bearing white shawl brought such sudden comprehension to stalwart little one that room for one brief moment resounded with yell next found door closed upon lady george looked disconsolately at husband a listened to retreating struggle of youngest born can not think what make so different from others said gloomily dear replied husband consolingly cain came after adam eve perhaps next will be abel besides blasius be risky name told so at time saint blasius be very worthy man retorted spouse hotly considering that boy be born on day must say think quite natural must call child george blasius let see be blasius george be matter of importance dear replied husband drily did not remind wife did choose to remember at time have be playing ultra ritualistic role to tell truth did not care to be brought face to face with past impersonation unless fancy seized to revert to when at moment notice must resume character a if have never ceased to play so next day with view to making suitable impression on paul widow a chose to call mr vane put on most dowdy garment actually went in omnibus down king road thus far environment suited foregone conclusion a stood in wide stretch down by river brilliant sunshine streaming upon very bright knocker very white door certain feeling of distrust crept over be darkened room into be ushered reassuring parquet floor be almost bare window beneath striped venetian awning be set wide open to balcony wreathed with blossoming creeper hung with cage of singing bird scent of flower be in air coolness emptiness yet first impression be one of ease comfort not room of old frump be not old frump rising from cushioned lounge coming forward like white shadow in half light how good of to come lady george dazzled a be by change from sunlight outside to darkness within yet saw enough to make gasp lo little bit of woman with syren written over from tip of dainty parisian shoe to crown of fair curly head be paul widow mother forsooth pretty mother indeed having got so far a blanche being amongst other thing somewhat of artist felt bound to admit that violet vane be very pretty indeed so pretty that be pleasure to watch piquant face full of quaint sort of humour freshness grow clear of shadow in half light looked younger doubt than really be still even in garish day lady george felt instinctively that charm must remain in fact be not at not in least suitable companion for paul when so much depended on being reasonable have seen brother for year came sweet rather thin voice be so good of to remember so more than good of to ask down to gleneira mean to go if only to ensure kindness being credited to wonder if be much changed there be certain challenge in speech lady george be quick enough to recognise a recognised wondered if own astonishment have be too palpable a in must be mistake so replied deftly be not changed in one thing gratitude to be grateful also for paul be very dear to dearest fellow in world be not be statement to in language of poker mr vane must hardly go one better therefore left a be to under study of devotion used to be very nice when knew then sick people be always nice be so much at one mercy said little lady airily be in way admirable type of kind two woman artificial yet with artificiality sprang from head in one case from heart in other for mr vane saw through lady george did not so be paul sister said former to a on way back to lounge after escorting visitor in friendliest fashion to stair paused to take up photograph case lying on table contained paul portrait a have be before time when have watched fair head tossing restlessly on pillow in hot indian room nothing must cool memory of dreary day night came back to in rush making paradoxically look year older worn haggard anxious seemed to be back in to hear gathering cry of jackal prowling past open door to see flicker of oil night light gleam on splintered ice turning for brief second to diamond a prepared for burning forehead above bright yet glazed eye more than seemed to feel old passionate protest against possibility of passing for ever out of life joined to fierce determination to save to uttermost from what from perhaps for mr vane have performed most unselfish act of life when have laughed scoffed at devotion gratitude of patient have have many said have always felt like during period of convalescence there be nothing for sequela of jungle fever like three month leave to bear in kashmir if liked might bring home one of little silk carpet for sitting room a fee must prefer carpet to anything else so paul have come back with unromantic offering cured a have prophesied of feverishness not of friendliness have lasted despite separation of year something else have lasted also to judge by look on mr vane face a stood with paul photograph in hand lady george temple took cab home tried to regain sense of lost importance by having child down to tea paul have kept thing secret from have allowed for year to speak kindly effusively of woman who have saved life a if be old frump when be really blanche being person of sense felt forced to acknowledge truth one of most charming little creature imaginable with just that half sympathetic half bantering manner be so taking paul having done own role of devoted sisterhood suffered thereby so fell back upon motherhood thus when husband returned found room littered with kindergarten toy while adam be threading bead by multiplication table eve be busily engaged

consent to build puff puff out of real terra cotta brick column be intended for architectural object lesson oh george began wife pausing with lump of sugar in tongs over cup paul widow be dreadful know what will do with hand over to can generally manage to get on with people said watching tongs greedily for question of sugar in tea be cause of much dispute between wife slow smile came to face a replaced lump dear must be good for said coming back to present then frowned can not think what induced paul to ask just when so much depends on woodward feeling to be guest par excellence continued after brief picturesque description of offender woman be sure to sing play dance act saw in face jolly sort of person to have in country house must say remarked husband secretly impressed knew must say that george put in wife resignedly yes be just sort of woman men love to dangle round then ask someone to dangle will leave coast clear for paul miss woodward lady george raised eyebrow scornfully a if must do good that sort of woman always insists on having best men paul look that in most society besides feel called upon to pave way to heiress for anyone else brother be what must come to can not conceive why paul must make thing so so much more difficult for natural depravity dear suggested husband helping on sly to sugar there be such thing hullo what be that be sudden discovery on blaze

save blab blabbing of tiny wavelet on rock a whispered to other of havoc have done far out at sea met now again with little tinkle of laughter to drown stone to marjory looking listening so intently

undoubtedly charm lay elsewhere in considerateness quick sympathy did not come a averred from mere selfish desire to be liked mere selfish consideration for own comfort might suit to say so to declare

not allow denial of own virtue accept estimate of be to cheer up forget dislike to carrying dirty little boy expect study of one own motif miss carmichael got further for turned to with quick gesture of pained denial please why must slander something in tone roused response in for moment next have smothered in sort of reckless desire to shock girl with intelligent trustful eye to force from belief in slander echoed there be slander assure what do know about life must help to understand complicated state of mind about boy for instance if told be once madly in love with mother that still think most beautiful woman ever saw have not intended confidence yet now have given did not regret impulse did wonder at since thought of past idyll have be interfering so much with present one during

replied changed subject from day mutual attitude towards other altered perhaps unconsciously to tell truth remembrance of st christopher rose up between paul in le admirable impersonation more so perhaps because of strange impulsive confidence regarding love for boy mother must have be quite boy at time thought older than be now boy be so much younger than girl for age felt vaguely sorry for young paul fruitless love for marjory like most girl who have be much in contact with poor accepted fact of life calmly looking at straight in face calling by name fairly ere passed by so doubt of past to paul have alluded so frankly ever crossed mind felt almost unconsciously that must not have spoken about to have there be cause for such suspicion so only effect of attempt to shock be to

whereupon old lady must remark that a at least knew duty father son must never lack bread in house so bustle away good humouredly to hurry on unpunctuality be not however always fault on one occasion followed on incident have curious effect in still further softening marjory judgment on handsome idle kindly paul introducing that vein of pity in woman of type seems almost necessary ingredient of affection may be only triviality half humorous despair of buttonless shirt possibility of dirty tablecloth may go further into uncared for sickness loneliness thought of personal discomfort to man whom like be always grievous to woman who have not be educated out of housewifely instinct came about in wise there be certain loch of fairy despite great beauty marjory have seldom seen for reason lay hidden in highest corrie of deer forest accessible only by burn watering sheltered glen from time immemorial have be sanctuary not even for marjory must old john macpherson disturb deer allow to

start early make day of will ask gillespie to come be always telling cock bull story about big fish there so will set to catch one never did will cameron agreed also saying must take opportunity to meet forest keeper on march settle position of new fence to keep hind from straying only old john shook head with muttering regarding future sport old tradition a if be not worth sport in world said paul almost exultantly a climbing last bracken set knoll leaving last scotch fir hanging over wild leap of burn filed past sheer bluff saw in front of long narrow almost level glen through stream slid in alternate reach foaming fall on side almost inaccessible cliff in front of cutting blue sky clearly serrated wall of rock closing up valley great sharp edged fragment from height above lay strewn among sweeping stretch of heather whence brood of grouse rose blundering to anxious cackle of hen there be said will from force of habit in whisper up on higher pasture thought must be so sha disturb bit if keep to burn marjory shading eye from sun stood looking on one of prettiest sight in world herd of red deer dotted over hill slope seen outlined against horizon line paul from sheer habit also have slipped to ground have glass on splendid royal to left cameron wonder if will get year by george there be old crooked horn remember miss carmichael trying to put bullet into well wo say how many year ago what slaughterhouse man memory must be remarked marjory with head in air not in case at rate retorted paul sometimes be merciful miss answer purpose quite a well a spoke memory of jeanie duncan rose quite causelessly to mind started to foot impatiently for somehow little paul existence have taken bloom off self complacency in regard to episode now for pixie loch cried gaily lady have own way there in destruction if tale be true wonder of three unfortunate male will choose a victim to day marjory looking down a crested last boulder strewn rise on almost black oily sheet of water in crater like cup of corrie felt that did not wonder at legend have gathered round spot very perfection of loneliness beauty marked a thing apart from more familiar charm of world around there seemed scarce foothold for goat on pillared cliff sank sheer into dark water streak two of snow lingering still in northern recess marked felt sure deep crevasse hidden from sight by innocent looking mantle of white must one judge of depth of lake by jagged point of rock rose here there from surface of water for a stood leant against fragment of earlier world looked a if must have fallen from sky since vacant place left by such huge avalanche must have remained visible for ever in rock above so out yonder might go down down forming vast cave where pixie might hold court of drowned dead men turned to look at paul suddenly apprehensively perhaps because even in innocence recognised instinctively that there with gift with charm lay nature to syren song be irresistible stopping on brink to dip hand into water be looking back at with laugh by jove said be cold enough to give anyone shiver a spoke far out on glassy glint of water came speck of stronger light widening to circle widening widening ever in softening ripple there told so cried reverend james excitedly five pounder at least after naturally there be time for sentiment time for anything unconfessed race a to of three must have fly on water first marjory left to own device wandered a far a must round level edge to south lay between lake cliff until came to moss clad moraine through water found way to new life in first long leap of burn below for loch be fed by unseen spring must hear stream beneath foot tinkling musically gurgling softly a if laughing at something have left behind something be going to meet sound oppressed vaguely here in angle of sand stood half ruined boat house within boat painted gaily yet with air of disuse about made marjory go inside look at more closely seemed sound enough yet a wandered on hoped that fisher might not be tempted to use out on unknown depth then coming on great bank of dewberry sank down into yielding heather gave up to enjoyment finally stretching at long length on springy softness watching lake through half closed eyelid suddenly with smile began to sing then a suddenly ceased cliff must give back echo certainly not so clear one a tenor tone followed close on first phrase of lorelei instant after paul figure showed round rock below busily engaged with swishing trout rod die schoenste maedchen sitzet dort oben echo indeed marjory sat up among dewberry feeling indignant captain macleod called aggressively have caught anything turned a if have be unaware of presence raised cap be not question of catching anything miss carmichael of being caught there be syren about somewhere heard just now did generally hear when be singing replied coldly where be will will replied paul cheerfully be swearing round corner have just have splendid rise hook drew further description necessary laughed captain macleod went on in easy familiar tone have taken sting out of so many other remark to marjory unsophisticated ear have savoured of impertinence if of get round be going to start over hill for fence want to see will find splendid place for tea about quarter of mile down below fall heap of stick bit of primeval forest washed out of moss so will manage nicely besides gillespie will be here be just such careless brotherly speech a will might have made marjory appreciated besides thought of hour two absolutely to in solitude have indescribable charm indescribable because to who know not of word be useless who do need not for with stainless past hopeful future be bliss unalloyed to wander down burn side resting here there watching ring ouzel skim from shelter oak eggar settle lazily on moss cushion yet a sate perched on rock far down valley above deeper pool than usual amused by singing lorelei from beginning to end secure from unwelcome echo so back on trace to basket have be hidden in fern preparation for tea relic of primeval forest burnt bravely aided by juniper branch kettle be filled boiled set securely on stony hob then free from care marjory chose out springy nest among short heather curled round lazily to watch sky line where before long two figure must come striding into sight dark against growing gold of westering sun blissful indeed extremely comfortable also when woke paul macleod be calling by name started up in hurry came on a fast a must lest must be wearying said face showed spoke truth be further than thought for where gillespie ca be fishing still surely did see on shore a came past marjory confused a be by sudden awakening remembered one thing one thing only boat old rotten looking boat did see have be here oh captain macleod do hope nothing have happened boat nonsense replied paul decisively nothing can have happened still be late have be asleep time expect perhaps have missed gone home must not miss fire said quickly can not swim if have taken boat if there be use imagining evil put in paul drily a be anxious will go will come with said eagerly if put more wood on fire will be ready for when return remarked paul cheerfully gillespie will want tea expect be in to big trout paused before anxious face told again that nothing must have happened surely did not believe in pixy still grew graver when look at boat house proved to be empty first shout brought answer except confused resounding echo if have gone beyond bluff into inaccessible part be likely to have done with boat might not hear come on imagine worst if when can see water paused said more a with following fast at heel hurried up brae hid further reach of lake so being step two ahead several inch taller than be view halloo followed by laugh be first intimation that search have come to end next instant have joined laugh for more ridiculous sight than reverend james gillespie presented a stood up in full clerical costume on uneven rock two foot square in very middle of loch must scarcely be imagined cause however be clear in half sunk water logged boat jammed on jagged rock be just visible above water close by have be there long called paul recovering afternoon came back in hoarse distinctly cross tone shouted till must shout more thought have gone home gone to sleep remarked paul aside a sate down began deliberately to unlace boot now miss carmichael if will look after tea will rescue shipwrecked mariner bring to be comforted marjory eyeing stretch of black water nervously suggested have better wait for will to turn up paul laughed be relieved to find have anxiety left for be really absurd must swim ten time distance ten time over besides will bring back with oar if will satisfy felt that ought yet a turned to leave keen pang at heart surprised not even gay call of reassurance two tea please hot in ten minute given knew from such kindly motif availed to drive away sudden thought of gracious face drowned dead drowned such irrational fear when come at come overwhelmingly since mind imaginative enough even to admit be natural prey yet very imagination of own be in startling to girl who caught wishing have not sung lorelei with sort of surprised pain at own fancifulness be absurd ridiculous yet sight of will loose limbed figure coming to meet brought distinct relief a bade go on help captain macleod even so a blew at fire made tea thought must come that man who must not swim must be of possible use if if if so in midst of imaginings came at last sight of three figure striding down brae talking laughing at least two of be so engaged reverend james having scarcely recovered temper being in addition almost quite inaudible from previous effort to make heard pixie must have said must suit place said paul gravely when with aid of several cup of tea victim have finished tale of big trout have deliberately dragged on to jag knocked hole in bottom of rotten old boat left helpless taking advantage seemed greatest offence of confusion consequent on manoeuvre to swim away with ten yard of good trout line excellent cast at least be will view of situation reverend james attempting hoarsely to give greater prominence to saving of own life while paul gave graphic description of procession down loch to landing place with clerical costume packed out of harm way in fishing basket be swung to butt end of rod marjory indignantly disclaimed slumber of seven sleeper declaring that shouting must have gone on when have be down burn so chattering laughing tea thing be packed up started homewards let have race down level said paul suddenly that water be cold a ice five minute after when marjory caught up a lingered little behind two others who be just disappearing behind bluff at entrance to sanctuary be startled at face ague said in answer to look be worst of india told water be cold enough to give anyone shiver tried to laugh off be blue pinched teeth be chattering with step effort to stand steady became more apparent sight of helplessness made girl forget everything womanly instinct to give comfort have far better sit down for while said eagerly can easily light fire have kettle hot whiskey water paul be actually beyond refusal sate down weakly utterly knocked over for time unable to do anything mutter between chattering of teeth that must not last long that must be all right when hot fit began that have better go on leave to of marjory replied in businesslike fashion by bringing great bundle of bracken a pillow spreading waterproof over piling over with more fern till smiled faintly chattered something about there being necessity for covering up with leaf be not dead yet then fire have to be lit kettle boiled jorum of hot toddy brewed stone warmed set to hand foot now if lie still for hour said magisterially expect will be much better when come back be hot a fire of course shaky still cramp very apologetic for delay must possibly help interrupted quickly looked looked then something seemed to rise up in throat keep silent be just look of utter helplessness remained in mind bringing with always tender compassion a remembrance of with little paul on shoulder served to soften towards atrocious sentiment so of sudden physical collapse served to lessen sort of resentment have hitherto felt to charm of great good look must not have explained how of fact came about be not even aware that be so yet did make difference in attitude towards pity for weakness for fault failing came to take place of condemnation so day passed until one evening a trudged home from unsuccessful raid on river mr gillespie remarked that herring be in at craignish mackerel often came at back of herring so maybe must be worth while to have try at better than river anyhow grumbled will who even with red tailed fly felt horrid weight of empty creel on shoulder paul looked at marjory have come to in most thing by time a often a not a now word be necessary then will tell john macpherson to have boat ready to morrow for be last day of leisure mean sister come on saturday guest follow on monday after that deluge suppose must not wonder remarked will gravely midge be awful to day paul marjory laughed must not help despite vague regret that holiday time be over chapter x paul last day be one of never to be forgotten day when mist lie in light wreath below mountain top rise clear sharp against intense blue sky when mass of white cloud hang in mid air bringing with new moment fresh beauty born of shadow to sea shore when cool breeze blow unevenly now again darkening water to purple cresting wave with foam streak edged with turquoise none too soon said paul briefly a tubhaneer so called from washing tub like build cast off mooring stood out for middle of loch told must be deluge after to day miss carmichael will have rain to morrow will nodded head oh talk of to morrow said marjory quickly to day be enough surely paul from amid ship applauded softly attempted frown ended feebly in smile wherefore not sufficient indeed unto day be pleasure thereof red brown sail drew bravely long line lay curled up forward oyster dredger rested rifle be with paul amid ship lithe rod swept out astern behind marjory a leant lightly over tiller eye upon quivering sail for needed inch must gain to avoid tack even though

to be duty yet very people who deny possibility of content be first to point out that when be said done man can only do what wish to do so that when on next morning dr kennedy who have listened to tale of what have be going on what be going on in big house with certain foreboding came to marjory urged to accompany on visit there in afternoon did so with distinct intention of feeling self complacency of duty performed marjory in turn thus brought face to face with very reasonable proposition found hard to make excuse did not rouse own indignation by being over serious after why must

loneliness too be at home in idle careless life be only one who be out of came upon by surprise for though have known be proud of fact that guardian belonged by virtue of mother birth to best of french society have have actual experience of in part of man of world be that of good world too recognised frankly a sate listening to now animated conversation about people have never heard of thing have never seen at same time trying to be agreeable to girl who dutiously have taken in hand felt that be duty sort of indifferent resentment possessed even when lady george hoped must accompany dr kennedy who have kindly promised to dine with next day talk over now possible theatrical yet rather to surprise accepted without even look at face made quite polite little speech about hoping to see more of girl so with certain independent grace passed out into hall leaving detained for moment by last remark must hear mr vane light laugh voice then laugh a stood waiting beside deferential butler involuntarily lip curled miss carmichael how glad be be paul newly in from moor looking best a handsome man doe in rough shooting clothes have tuft of white heather stag horn moss in one hand with sudden impulse held out gaily to tit for tat welcomed here though never thanked for so doing did be turn now have meant offering for violet vane alice woodward whichever met first now seemed a if fate have sent for marjory for one else felt a if be so looked a if be so for first time in life marjory felt odd little thrill run through vein thank said soberly yes did give to so now be quits mean corrected hastily that that be on same footing there be quite tremor in voice too a seeing dr kennedy beside turned to quickly be captain macleod tom have be very kind to in nine case out of ten paul macleod on being introduced to man belonging to girl in marjory position a be having claim on must have be studiously frigidly courteous more so might have once for chilled marjory sudden confidence relief in finding old friend in new environment be difficult for emotional man to be cold when sudden glow of content make feel absurdly happy consequently went out of way to be frank kindly in expressing pleasure at making acquaintance of one of whom miss carmichael have so often spoken in term of reprobation doubt replied dr kennedy lightly guardian be disagreeable appendage though try to be a little of nuisance a can so do retorted paul with smile miss carmichael be so dreadfully hard to please a dr kennedy keen brown eye took in figure before told that girl must be hard indeed to please if must find fault with be handsomest man have seen for long time said a walked home what be like inside marjory paused with head on one side considering oh nice in way way of world suppose thought nicer than ever to day being in own house agrees with oh tom how wish have accepted that invitation to dinner yet when returned from big house have little flush on cheek when dr kennedy challenged to tell truth in answer to mr cameron inquiry a to how got on answered with laugh nod why not be rather interesting quite evolutionary process before went be protoplasmic in jelly then at dinner be amoebic digestive apparatus nothing else afterwards with lady felt like worm fish out of water then wanted to have wing like bird fly away must for quadrumana appeared from dining room became ape what be lassie talking about put in mr cameron with toss of head can answer straight question wi ' straight answer what then say what then yes what then marjory asked tom kennedy quickly knew answer yet wanted to hear from lip because must satisfy so far have be right then why then suppose became girl at rate enjoyed be so kind mr vane suppose in world tom there be heap of woman like not many so charming answered heartily in truth have be very pleasant meeting again after so many year for man even when be in love supposes to be in love with one woman be never proof against pleasure of being made much of by dr kennedy with quaint simplicity wisdom be perfectly aware of own reputation a one of boldest adventurer in new field of discovery told that people made much of for own sake because carried restless energy with into society a well a into work for energy be a rule godsend to fin de siecle men woman so conceit of slipped off like water from duck back leaving free to take world a found marjory felt once more little chill of regret for thing have not known in life there be one thing forget to ask said quickly name be not alphonse be thought tom unromantic so promised to change name if changed hers men generally do a much a grumbled will so be going to have theatrical be that mean that horse will be dead lame laird will be wanting more how on earth do make out asked dr kennedy woman said will laconically something will always be wanted in hurry telegraph station be ten mile off woman seem to think horse can change leg when come home there be truth in remark during next ten day gleneira house lived in continual bustle gave time for thought save perhaps to mr vane who busy a be found time to congratulate so far on success of plan for marjory paul have perforce to meet constantly more than once something occurred to encourage belief that there be material for mischief ready to hand if be needed other material came to light also so seemed to cynical experience clue to came one day when marjory who have grown keen a be only natural over novelty of amusement be searching through old portfolio of paul sketch for hint likely to be of use for drop scene be nothing more than portrait of girl with bunch of red rowan held up to cheek be very well done paul said mr vane holding up for to see a stood little way off who be beautiful model came over to hastily oh one know be really worth looking at wretched caricature did not know be there something in voice roused amused malice always lurked behind mr vane treatment of paul foible disagree with look miss carmichael think that quite best thing have seen of captain macleod doing be lovely face said girl reminds of someone then looked up in sudden interest surely be paul little paul mean peggy duncan grandson perhaps stopped abruptly remembering big paul confession blushed scarcely knew why then feeling vexed with for doing so put down sketch taking up made trivial remark about being very pretty mr vane have not done with sketch that highland type of face began there be need to theorise over likeness in case interrupted paul seeing through a nearly always did be little paul mother a think told once miss carmichael most beautiful woman ever saw be why call caricature mr vane anger in voice be not to be mistaken marjory a moved away to resume tete tete with alice woodward be left with uncomfortable feeling that have somehow betrayed secret though common sense resented imputation mr vane looked after retreating figure with one of fine smile so memory of particular most beautiful woman in world there must have be good many of in paul macleod life be not pleasant to wherefore question came quite idly passed from mind without answer marjory on other hand took hers a to whether be to blame not seriously to heart so much so that when have speech with paul alone occurred naturally enough when brought cup of tea a sate stitching away for dear life at ridiculous theatrical property near window so a to get full advantage of waning light reverted to subject at once interrupted hurriedly almost before have begun please must so much rather said nothing more about understand thank heaven replied why must say that cried reproachfully can not see why must not if can be not fool marjory interrupted dr kennedy coming forward little paul duncan have just come round from lodge with message that grannie want to see might go round way be getting late a be there be hurry put in paul will tell to give boy piece can wait till miss carmichael have finished giving absolution be wrong way about surely said be usual way between man woman replied paul will be to end of chapter be afraid hour afterwards mr vane who have come out into hall with parting instruction to marjory stood looking down with others at little paul duncan who weary of waiting have cuddled round on doorstep fallen into heavy sleep of childhood look very delicate said violet kindly stooping over a lay with one hand tucked into back of neck in rather unusual posture then suddenly looked up at big paul for trick have taken back to old day when have watched sleep with jealous care lest patient must be disturbed how often have not wondered why chose so uncomfortable position impossible yet there be likeness name too evident dislike to mention of boy mother must mean something what thought left pale so paul turning back with when two have gone noticed telling that be overworking herself of course be overworking retorted with strange mixture of self pity blame fierce resentment always do be fault if do thing quicker than other people be fault if see thing more clearly think be always managing managing so be how can help when everything keep coming into mind one think care dear violet have be overworking indeed must take easier will be having laid up then what must paul macleod do went on with reckless laugh wo make so disagreeable a that if can help paul how can one help being disagreeable at time when one be wise wise old oh paul how old be see answered with amused smile never see anything began then suddenly returned to own light half jesting manner be not true see most thing be too young to understand dreadfully young for age paul so be lucky there be so many of to look after when went upstairs to dress for dinner sate down before looking glass stared at with sort of repugnance yes be old hatefully old in mind in knowledge of world in experience thought have flashed through brain at sight of little paul lying asleep on doorstep be not nice thought yet must help flashing if there be anything in thought might not knowledge strengthen hand in coming fight for fortnight daily experience of alice woodward calm attraction have raised mr vane opposition to marriage with paul to virtuous horror true friend told must hesitate to throw difficulty in way of so disastrous connection at same time felt almost afraid to reach out after new weapon lest might prove too heavy for delicate hand of hers accustomed for most part to leading rein be one thing to goad guide people into right path to split open head with sledgehammer though how must be such lethal weapon must not see since knew enough of paul macleod to doubt if must have have hardihood to mention jeanie duncan to marjory if there have be anything between in past yet so stood before possibility shivering on brink finally telling there must be time enough to think of such thing if le heroic measure failed be mistake to touch pitch needlessly at same time be a well to make sure there be pitch in pot so next day saw on airy pretence of getting old peggy to knit stocking sitting beside old pauper bringing to bear on ailment wrong gay cheerfulness sympathy paul declared always put in good humour chapter xv apparently have same effect on peggy duncan for next saturday when a usual ancient schoolfellow crony janet came to give hovel weekly redding up be beyond little paul ability old

finding description of mr vane dress puckles o ' tea appeared from pocket far more interesting than old lady usual snappishness then under circumstance peggy tongue must have be softened by knowledge that help be more than ever necessary that day since visitor be expected to tea so old woman watched preparation with wrathful eye did not even quarrel with polish of two silver spoon usually secreted with other treasure in bottom drawer of bureau now graced clean tablecloth to tell truth however fault finding must have have practical effect since janet never took slightest notice of beyond remarking now again whist woman whist be breath will be having to crack with doctor on other hand wee paulie who contributed share by timidly presenting mug full of early rowan berry heather for middle of table be sternly bidden to take away ugly trash solemnly warned against sin of mistaking weed for flower thus setting up to be judge instead of abiding by will of providence rebuke however

idealist result of deliberate choice of lower level be in way stranger still for alice woodward whose emotion under circumstance must never have risen to higher point than calm affection felt more content than have ever done over future actually lingered in mother room most unusual event in reserved family to remark gleneira be really delightful in fine weather when house be full of people captain macleod showed immense presence of mind too assented mr woodward contributing quota to general satisfaction very admitted alice colouring little behaved so nicely afterwards in such good

slightly bored by reverend james failure to respond evident disposition to remain spiritual director assumed that of great lady helper in general to world in character gave a opinion that parish clergyman must be married if only in order to make understand child grasp true bearing of education question whereat blushed violently five minute afterwards have confided hope regarding marjory to

coming separation lay upon most of party on none more than tom kennedy who have filched few extra hour of marjory companionship from great enemy by scorning mail cart in favour of solitary walk over crest of ben morven to nearest coach place settled on for picnic being so far on way though unconscious of keen pain at heart felt vaguely that must miss touch of kind hand sound of kind voice more than ever now now that seemed only thing remaining of old calm confidence lady george be prey to thousand care beginning with lunch culminating in certainty that one of three child whom husband have insisted on bringing must be drowned just at last too when have brought safely through danger of gleneira for nurse be to start by early boat next morning day be indeed to be fateful one for be not paul last chance of speaking to alice did not mr woodward for conspicuous calm show to watchful eye that also be aware of fact paul showed nothing then be always exasperatingly cool when little touch of excitement must on whole be pleasing of face that of reverend james gillespie displayed sense of duty most clearly what paul lacked in animation made up for in sheer restlessness since time have come when must carry out intention ask marjory carmichael to marry if only because must be advisable to set up house at november term when must have chance of furnishing cheaply of getting good servant so wandered about in fuss alternately trying to make opportunity then flying from until paul always observant began to wonder what be up then chancing upon one of bashful lover bolder attempt swore under breath at fellow impudence tom kennedy be gentleman marjory with iceberg of heart must be happy enough in keeping by bye rampant red faced fool then laughed thinking suddenly causelessly of certain little face looking very winsome despite weariness must have laughed too for mr vane have somehow failed to rally from shock of old peggy death with usual elasticity be still in room

little causeway of rock jutting forward like peer wave blab blabbing upon side reminded of evening when have sate listening to paul have come along shore behind like st christopher bearing burden of world immortality childhood tom said in low voice turning to in swift appeal why knew not let get away from might go along point look for clam a used to do remember be last will see of so talk about manner being wanted think of what other people think spoke petulantly there be sudden tear in eye yet a moved off together of then realised that fateful moment have come gone that trivial word covered unconscious revolt of one side of woman nature against other that if instead of hunting clam like couple of child have taken hand told truth of love marriage a have seen in life must have turned instinctively from world apotheosis of passion so have found compass to guide out of danger tom kennedy being conscious that be once more under glamour have come gone many time already even in sober life must not find in heart to decry utterly so stalked clam instead advancing on tiptoe over wet sand with eye alert for sign of air hole then pouncing like cat on mouse to seize collapsing tube

have claim upon must be indeed ungrateful to ignore meant much to be sure of welcome real good feeling underlying stilted word went straight to marjory sense of justice made metaphorically pas bishop besides little discussion have a be taken personal flavour from point at issue left contemptuously tolerant a have be many many time over reverend james view of life lady george asked categorically magisterially have also claim to be consulted coughed rather think broached subject saw loved here man broke through clerical coating for do love be preposterous must do best to make good husband must

made way down to picnic party be soon recovering equanimity over scone jam marjory on other hand felt indignation grow a hurried along regardless of briar brake to shore beyond narrowest where out of sight of others might hope to find boat must ferry across loch found one hardly what desired since a made way through alder brake to projecting rock saw tubhaneer lying close in with paul macleod alice woodward in stern while brother two of child be lolling about in bow have be amusing by tacking lazily about in slack water must have beaten quick retreat have not paul eye be quicker swift turn of rudder shown that be observed oh trouble called only want to get across will find one of rowing boat about expect be above called back tide be running out fast now so sent to upper bay just step on further rock if can will run up to for second there be something in easy familiarity decision of manner always soothed into reasonable compliance next minute found apologising to alice woodward a bellying sail slanted across loch oh alice wo mind said paul cheerfully like sailing alice marjory looked at a looked at other be silent so that be settled again be love love marriage what ghastly farce be when came close to be sorry kennedy have gone remarked paul with eye on face be one of best fellow ever met will have to tack tide be too strong even so uncertain breeze failing ere reached slack water missed landing stage by few yard drifted into willow seaweedy bay below paul be over side knee deep among boulder ere marjory must expostulate steady bit sam can get grip on oarweed now then miss carmichael if please be duffer at steering can lift across easily if will allow thanks must have preferred to wade for opposition must have provoked when after few slippery stride set down on shingle turned to go with briefest of acknowledgment wait bit please said quietly alice must see miss carmichael past gate macinnes bull be loose be always quite canny will be back in minute keep helm in sam let drift current run like mill race round point be already well over soft sea pink set turf marjory walking fast with heightened colour there be really need for to keep miss woodward waiting said impatiently be quite accustomed to take care of alice will not mind alice be so eager for to realise new position that must need enforce knowledge of upon in fashion be glad miss woodward doe not mind must be perfectly aware of that have not philosophic acquiescence in inevitable be pity for fret needlessly over people who be not worth be not worth thought made walk faster until sudden cry from behind made companion pause look back hastily good god will be on rock cried a without instant delay dashed across sward down to shore followed closely by marjory whose heart throbbed with sudden fear a realised what have occurred boat have left safely in backwater minute before be now racing down stream with sail full set how have occurred be question must not then be answered possibly sam proud of new seamanship have proposed sail anyhow there be in stream even without knowledge of sunken shelf of rock half mile further down curve over water rushed in fall at time of tide young man sufficiently grasped danger of situation to be doing best to lower sail again rope have kinked in pulley sudden discovery that have forgotten to re rudder paul have removed in order to bring boat closer into shore completed consternation rendering absolutely helpless captain macleod took in a ran ere marjory have reached have kicked off boot flung coat waistcoat aside to free for sharp short struggle with racing tide in lay only chance of reaching boat then waded breast high in slack water bided time needed quick thought quicker decision to seize exact moment when by one supreme effort must hope to succeed yet marjory watching with held breath felt wild rush of exultation not of fear a with one splendid stroke shot far into current swimming have always effortless look sweeping stream carrying down remorselessly aided illusion so that not even marjory with knowledge of tide guessed how nearly paul macleod strength be spent a hand touched gunwale touch did next moment with sam help be aboard busy at sail while alice woodward deeming danger over began to cry helplessly even marjory breathed again only for moment however next though sail be down realised that boat be still in current paul be vainly trying to tear up thwart rudder rudder must have gone adrift in sam clumsy effort to ship then be better off than before nay worse since be nearer unseen rock be in danger now what be to be done thought be agonising a scarcely knowing why kept abreast of drifting boat stumbling over boulder slipping on seaweed unable to see to think to do anything save listen to ominously rising roar of water just beyond turn fell in regular cascade over black jagged shelf of rock ah helpless child paul must do something try to do something then on sudden came to a such thing do come a if have be settled beforehand clear connected at last spit of land not fifty yard above fall streak of sand bank capped by pile of boulder jutted out if must cross dip reach heron used to sit there till well on to half tide once will have found oyster trivial thought came a will come in time of stress flashing through brain without obscuring even a thought mind be busy over one certainty somehow must give help by cutting across next grassy curve must be there in time might think be deserting what then if must succeed even so far must know that be not so must understand that meant to be nearer nearer did great glow of pride in pluck came to when a boat swept round curve saw floundering half swimming towards boulder at sight bent quickly for coil of rope have not thought of one impulse having be to get nearer now be a far a can go sheer at foot sliding among stone be stream below be roar rush of fall save to left where shelf to eddy above be boat drifting drifting more slowly now for shelf of rock back water little then for first time realises what be to be done for there be paul at bow with coil poised in hand of course be be dug heel into crevice of boulder a stood knee deep among kept eye upon face now a cry left lip something like black snake shot out through air flung across breast stinging almost blinding with pain there be time for pain time to seize bend round nearest boulder so twice round waist with loop through across arm took thought strength till with slow rasping noise of wet rope slipping on stone strain began knot grew tight tight tighter then slip then tighter again pain yes be pain god what pain ah slip paul be that knife have in hand must never be there must be more slipping even if drowned for with more of sheer obstinacy than courage flung sideways in water among rock so with whole body wedged in behind two boulder there must be no more slipping there must be nothing more life death for of be life paul macleod standing knife in hand ready to cut rope felt claim of pluck to fair play paused must do thing if must even a decision came to came also knowledge that have done a with sidelong sway boat brought up drifted into slacker water five minute after be untying knot binding wet handkerchief round bruised arm salt water said trifle unsteadily be best thing in world for bruise be more bruised than fancy blanche for alice woodward shriek have by time attracted plenty of help boat have come over in hot haste from other side fuss over miss carmichael with sal volatile salt doe need be wet through if be wise will walk home with at once be better than waiting for carriage yes please replied catching eagerly at chance of escape from general excitement gratitude indeed must rather lady george be not bit hurt only a brother say wet through so have better get home at once started off together at brisk pace silently until a topped nearest rise chill evening wind striking through wet garment made shiver then held out hand to suddenly with smile come let run will take off stiffness keep warm so hand in hand like couple of child ran through autumn wood startling roe deer from oak covert sea gull from little sheltered bay hand in hand while shadow darkened gold in west faded to grey warm human hand in hand confident content in companionship seeking nothing more than confidence content think will take cold said paul with blood tingling in vein breath coming fast think will laughed chapter xxii remembrance of thoughtless run through darkening wood seemed incredible to girl at least when next morning companion in came down a in duty bound to inquire after result of wetting for be palpably conventional commonplace partly because lady george accompanied eager to renew protestation of gratitude partly because be way whenever have made special departure from ordinary line of conduct laid down for evident artificiality have effect of producing same sort of unreality in marjory so that only straightforward part of interview came from lord george who with odd little quake in voice thanked for fact that blaze be at present moment rehearsing scene in nursery must see little beggar said word doe seem to have missed single detail have sam to life have be obliged to forbid alice scream be heard over house what doe say be own part in business asked marjory remember be face very like yours george with great wide eye while eve adam be hiding theirs lord george gave odd little sound between laugh sob say sate still swore like uncle paul be afraid did miss carmichael confessed culprit with flash of old manner really tangle that young idiot have got thing into stramash turned to window with frown looked out be heroine of hour see added cynically there be manse machine with two devoted admirer in come to congratulate blanche if have induced miss carmichael to dine with to night last night have better quit court by way mr vane desired to say miss carmichael that did not intend to leave gleneira without seeing again so a be not well enough to come to lodge may be induced to take pity on covert implication that such inducement be necessary to overcome reluctance stung girl pride without recognising cause of accepted invitation hurriedly telling be glad be last after to morrow must return to old peaceful day thought made turn with quick expansion of face manner to two old men who advanced to meet a accompanied lady george to garden gate two old men almost tremulous with pride delight tanto fortior tanto felicior cried little father fresh round face beaming with sheer content so so young lady have heard story put in minister full of courtly bow in suggestion of shapely calf have fair field true be that fortis cadere cedere non potest ah lady george have to express great thankfulness that dreadful bereavement have be spared under providence by dear young friend courage rather by wisdom since without quick thought former must have be useless in case to paraphrase saying tam minerva quam marte a even soldier must allow will not find backward sir in acknowledging miss carmichael wisdom courage replied paul thus challenged tone have suggestion of hidden meaning in to lady george objected rightly a bad form so covered by remark upon beauty of boy who stood holding open gate be little like crayon portrait of when be boy paul added cheerfully be old peggy grandson replied marjory a have be left to dr kennedy care be to look after will be first pupil then likeness will soon disappear said paul in low voice a passed out perhaps will be not worse of retorted marjory in same tone know men who be brought up by woman be generally prig woman who have be brought up by men asked sharply not thinking of herself past be brave said quietly brave so thought that of one word be worth rest a went up path again with father macdonald on right hand mr wilson on left fine phrase seemed forgotten in simple acknowledgment must remember that always even when old peaceful day came back a must on morrow there be only dinner at big house between that desirable consummation be ordeal without tom who be at home anywhere to tell truth must have be ordeal to one le reluctant than marjory for general air of uncertainty like of amateur theatrical when prompter be best man pervaded party mr woodward called host by christian name with manifest effort of memory when sam ventured on like familiarity with blanche face betrayed real feeling indeed took private opportunity of confiding to lord george relief that be only one night part a must not stand much longer yet condemn poor paul to life long connection with young bounder upon soul woman be queer creature perversity of feminine nature appeared to absorb for rest of evening even mr vane who ventured down to dinner for first time must make nothing of ghastly function so retired immediately afterwards on plea of being tired chiefly because wished to have opportunity of seeing marjory alone secured by bidding in whisper be sure come to room after have said good bye to everyone else departure reduced drawing room to flat despair be sadness of farewell remarked miss smith part of whose contract be that be to remain to last see nothing be forgotten not even decent show of sentiment parting be such sweet sorrow murmured major under moustache be most cheerful of party since flirtation have resulted in week grouse shooting with charmer father mr st clare have written sweet thing called 'good bye ' continued moth appealing to poet might recite to cheer up wonder how many poet there be who have written piece on subject put in paul hastily a mr st clare gave preliminary cough yet will supply ton of agony to generation still unborn there be forty song of name remarked alice practically wanted one for friend music man told so then remembrance of friend certain young fellow with pleasant baritone voice busy over tallow at riga gave quite pang of regret mostly trash too assented major tosti be best even there one be battered to piece before end be true put in marjory eagerly see poet begin by fine drawing agony composer follows suit singer carry out distortion so in third verse there be nothing for to 'kill coo have heard 'auld robin gray ' for twenty year murmured lord george one sings anything german nowadays german comic opera miss carmichael sings scotch song have heard said paul from skein of silk be holding for alice woodward oh do cried moth something touching somethin ' to cheer up mean put in sam somethin ' with chorus know something old fashioned protested lord george something appropriate to occasion suggested wife something miss carmichael approves of came from skein of silk girl stood by piano for instant looking at with touch of fine scorn in face will do best said at last with laugh next instant with crash of chord clear fresh young voice rang through room in gayest saddest of song weary lot be thine fair maid weary lot be thine to pull thorn thy brow to braid press rue for wine lightsome eye soldier mien feather of blue doublet of lincoln green more of knew love more of knew paul hand turning skein paused eye be on girl face a with mixture of recklessness regret went on morn be merry june trow rose be budding fain will bloom in winter snow ere two meet again turned charger a spake upon river shore said 'adieu for evermore love adieu for evermore ' what heartless unromantic roving wretch remarked lady george in pause followed refrain hope be jilted after by heiress there generally be heiress in case then becoming aware of possible indiscretion of word looked at brother hurriedly in case married lived happily ever afterwards at least be what must have done in case think be so heartless after told truth be a if have sneaked away without saying good bye marjory rose from piano with little shrug of shoulder must say good night at rate lady george sneak up to see mr vane for be getting late have to be up so early paul standing at door holding open for to pas through be last of group to whom have to give conventional farewell good bye said feeling above real regret relief that be end auf wieder sehn replied be what tom have said a ran upstairs to mr vane room be telling passionately that did not want to see captain macleod again that must rather went out of life altogether cease to make wonder at changeful mood entrez said soft voice to knock next moment felt in atmosphere in have never be before semi darkness of pink shaded light littered dressing table soft perfume thousand one evidence of almost sensuous ease be to absolutely novel small figure nestling in armchair so dainty in lace little velvet shod foot meant something have never grasped before something attracted yet repelled how pretty be said in sudden impulse a finger stroked one of soft fold almost caressingly mr vane hand went out swiftly drew hers closer child doe for not for so be good bye be not sorry eye scanned girl closely then smiled if be will get over soon be best of work often wish have to make forget do work work harder than anyone know in way why to night be quite dull so dull without everyone missed yet yet out with little one be wondering if be worth yes if have craze to be admired a have did ask to come here in order to talk about must not understand if did pray heaven never may so have said good bye to be not sorry be well now let wish good luck give word of advice twenty if like make most of luck alphonse mean dr kennedy asked girl stiffly dr kennedy there be not many like in world doubt if there be at least have not met replied with quick flush of impatience be glad to hear say that good bye dear forget a soon a can will remember kindness for have be kind of good bye when door have closed mr vane leant back in chair with sigh of relief be over then so far a must judge without harm to girl now now must face other problem perhaps there need be harm there either must think must think so in softness dimness luxury face grew more anxious more weary until memory of marjory word came back to be worth whether be worth not did not matter plotting planning have become second nature to must think must think marjory passing out into calm cool of night gave sigh of relief also be over strange life so different from future one lay before be sorry little one must know paul macleod not feel regret at thought of future yet be glad be over despite queer sort of numb pain at heart at thought of unfailing kindness to now must never see again never red star showed low down behind turn in rhododendron moment after paul voice said easily a threw away cigar have not be long so be not over be first thought then came quick flutter at heart over be not rather just beginning for be new pride rose in arm against instantly did not expect began almost haughtily did not be rather foolish of expected to let walk home alone think know duty a host at rate be true did know there must not be two opinion a to considerate courtesy to admitted fact to herself gladly telling that be quite natural must see home though possibility of doing so have not occurred to hitherto of course tom have be with to night be alone be usual thing yet not usual surely that must be walking fast through darkness without word just a if have quarrelled what be there to quarrel about nothing not engagement certainly though might think so if kept silent on fact one have attempted to conceal hitherto have have opportunity of alluding to now there be excuse merest acquaintance must be expected to take such opportunity of wishing good luck unless unless personal motive prevented there be none how must there be since paul be surely welcome to do a liked yet for time crunch of gravel beneath foot a walked on in silence be only sound upon cool night air glimmering white of lodge gate nerved to effort want to congratulate captain macleod began when interrupted quickly hush if there can not be truth let there be falsehood between be a if thunderbolt have fallen piercing ignorance stopped short pulse bounding to strange new thrill in voice seemed to make forget surprise indignation have to steady own tone ere must reply there have be falsehood on part have there not then there will be none on mine marjory love nay will listen outstretched arm barred quick movement of disdain will not keep long must hear truth have loved from beginning love now feel a if must love always stood there a if have be turned to stone listening listening like child to fairy tale in darkness look have never be there before crept to clear eye quiver to mouth yes love not only a most men count love so that touch of hand thrill thought of kiss be a heaven shrink from truth must face sometime why not now be so god know be new thing to be new that be soul if have one marjory marjory why have made feel like why must never see a really be why must always believe better than be passionate questioning seemed to pas by stood silent till in darkness seized hand drew closer to peering into face a if to read answer there for pity sake look so kind so sweet burst out vehemently for even in faint starlight must see something of eye tell how vile be then must go then must leave listen to marjory voice grew calmer sort of bitter entreaty came to passionate anger know quite well be certain that only chance of living what hold to be worthy life lie with yet have renounced do renounce without shadow of remorse be not that enough be better one hope of redemption yet still say adieu love adieu for evermore then half seen softness of face seemed to madden before god will see a be will understand arm clasped close reckless passionate kiss be on lip then then stood a be before tribunal have invoked that tribunal of perfect knowledge of blinding truth in alone lie terror of judgment marjory whisper must scarcely be heard marjory be true god be true that love still held with touch have changed utterly tone be almost pitiful in appeal marjory why why did not know why did hide from did not know answered voice have ring of pain in how must know must have made difference difference to keenest reproach must not have hit so hard a instinctive defence of own ignorance own innocence pierced armour of worldliness went straight to part of nature even at worst held fast to life in sort of veiled self contempt be right must have made difference difference to such a be then in darkness be at foot kissing hem of garment adieu love adieu for evermore next instant sound of retreating footstep broke stillness be alone alone with smile upon face smile of infinite tenderness for manhood for own new found womanhood tingled in vein seemed to fill whole world with cry love love so be love unreasoning joy absorbing desire to hap to hold to let else slip by be forgotten a nothing worth to live for alone since be one one only yes loved like memory of voice clasp of hand touch of lip came back to in rush dazing bewildering utterly so that stretched arm into night whispered into darkness paul come back must come back tell what mean paul paul be gone then pity of shame that have left came home to not for herself for with little short sharp cry such a will come with sudden physical pain turned on way tearless composed half stunned by own emotion when have undressed blew out candle kneeling by window pressed forehead against cool glass while gazed unseeingly into night so be love love poet called divine love to have looked forward life what did mean what be feeling have come to unbidden unrecognised for now with opened eye understood that have be there almost from beginning that have be cause of mood curious attraction repulsion unrest desire to influence ought to have known sooner perhaps yet how must when own nature education have given hint of thing love have dreamed of have be thing of mind of conscious choice be not no best to tell truth be not a knelt there alone in ignorance not so much of evil a of reality of life must yet see that unreasoning attraction though with must not be indissolubly mixed up with something higher something nobler than something craved like nobility in object be yet in very essence of earth earthy without something what be be clear sighted be girl whose reasoning power have be trained to be truthful so did not attempt to deny paul macleod be not ideal of what man must be that whole soul went out in one desire that must be so in tender longing to help to comfort console did not alter fact that desire that longing be apart from bewildering emotion filled world with cry love love loved a be not a ought to be a be then eye seemed to come back from darkness find light a remembered word of be not only a if loved a men count love then too understood too be torn in twain sense of companionship seemed to come to rose from knee crept to bed a lay awake slow tear fell on pillow so be love bitter pain keener joy underneath stress of passion fainter reflection of lay something might bring peace if must let thought of made whisper softly paul love come back to paul will forget love up at big house be cursing own folly in yielding to temptation of seeing marjory home yet what have come over who for most part behaved with regard to gentlemanly instinct what have done memory of seen by light of knowledge of evil filled with shame well that finished when have time to think must never forgive must understand that look must fade from face that look be right even if have seen before must have made difference must have gone on way same why have ever seen to give needle pain be miserable memory only thing be to forget to forget not love thrilled that heaven know must be easily forgotten that other yes must forget be only thing to be done now chapter xxiii luckily perhaps for determination to forget variety of cause combined to give paul macleod breathing space before have a be to take up burden of engagement with alice woodward to begin with have to pay visit on way south delight of really good partridge shooting be of distinctly soothing nature there be something fat calm comfortable about stubble turnip field make one think kindly of county magistrate quarter session of growing stout laying down bin of port wine very different affair from cresting brow of heather covered hill with wild wind from west scattering covey like bunch of brown feather while next brae rise purple before up up with strain effort yet with pulse of life beating strongest then when north mail finally set down at woodward have gone to brighton there be that going on in artistic little house in brutonstreet must have made unkind for to leave town follow even if own inclination have not be to stay see what day brought forth for blasius be ill dangerously ill lord george be piteous sight a wandered aimlessly down to foreign office after vain effort to remain at work wandered home again with eager question on lip be there change there be none child after manner of sturdy kind took disease a hardly a must be taken then fought against a gamely so little life hung in balance till there came day when pretence of foreign office be set aside lord george sate in nursery with little son in arm unconscious burden in red flannel dressing gown somehow seemed connected with so much of blaze short life blanche almost worn out stood by open window holding paul hand paul who be always so sympathetic so kindly when one be in trouble so waited to see whether child must choose life death while outside people be picking way gingerly through mingled sunshine shade of thunder shower be so silent that must hear clock on stair ticking above faint patter on window pane almost hear splash of slow tear drop trickled down lord george cheek fell on blaze closed hand then suddenly pair of languid eye opened little voice mellow still despite weakness said quietly ith waining blazeth want wumberwella in day following if blaze have wanted moon lord george must have entered into diplomatic relation with man in regarding cession of territory child according to doctor wanted sea air more than anything else so naturally enough migrated to brighton though did not realise general sense of relief contentment pervading whole party did much to make paul macleod feel shackle bearable then mr woodward alice be at one of big hotel temple be in lodging while have room at golfing club to belonged arrangement gave everyone certain freedom finally a paul discovered on very first day alice showed much more to advantage on parade riding over down putting on green than have ever done at gleneira oh yes said gaily be regular cockney at heart love pavement hate uncivilised way know when blanche told have to see sheep cut up at gleneira made mental note must must for hate sight of raw meat bear butcher shop with tolerable equanimity returned lover who hardly liked constant allusion to highland barbarism a matter of fact raw meat intrudes more on notice in town than ever doe in country perhaps then sheep with flowery pattern down back look like sheep a for beef why ca connect joint with part of animal at least ca believe can either now what part of beast be aitchbone paul set question aside by proposing canter by time be over be quite ready to be sentimental for alice looked well on horseback in sort of willowy graceful fashion made pastime seem superabundantly feminine still subject have knack of cropping up again again once when have excused for aspersion by saying good naturedly that be mere matter of association that be of cat kind liking thing to be accustomed have taken up short by saying must have to get accustomed to gleneira will asked somehow think will live there very much be nice enough for six week shooting even then damp spotted of dress be getting plenty of new one at rate retorted paul for room be littered with chiffon raised pretty eyebrow oh be only pattern always send for when be away from town be almost a good a shopping mean to buy much now will wait for winter sale be such fun like getting money worth though of course father give a much a want still bargain be bargain be paul acquiesced conversation rankled in mind to begin with gave insight into certain bourgeoise strain in young lady nature though told that nothing else be to be expected from mr woodward daughter who derived chief charm from fact that father have made bargain got money worth did not make presence more desirable then must not escape reflection that be bargain that whole family into be marrying must make point of having money worth must have realised still more clearly if must have seen one of daily letter mr woodward with praiseworthy regularity wrote to lord master in london for be sort of shibboleth of married state in must write to other day whether have anything to say not alice wrote be so sensible seems quite content at one time feared slight entanglement with jack lady george have be most kind taken to best place be of course what have right to expect by way there be irish member here o'flanagin something like declares land league will spread to west highland so must be sure tie up money securely a doe not seem quite safe investment mr woodward on receiving missive swore audibly asserting that devil might take if knew of investment must be called safe in present unsettled state of market for visit to gleneira where a angrily put telegram came occasionally post never have somehow be beginning of one of streak of real ill luck defy speculator result being that mr woodward generally left office in city poorer by thousand than have entered in morning though knew own fortune to be beyond risk of actual poverty altered outlook upon life threatened credit a successful financier did threaten alone there be uncomfortable rumour of disaster in air in course of time came to lady george ear do hope mr woodward be not mixed up in said to paul a sate working bilious looking sunflower on faded bit of stuff for highland bazaar be little distrait when came down last sunday did eat dinner to speak of dined with remember perhaps gave too good lunch at club replied brother jocosely besides must let few loss spoil appetite be well secured then must always fall back on share in soap boiling business be not thinking of paul be thinking of must not boil soap fact be indubitable though brother laughed felt vaguely that there be two side to bargain when sister began on subject again met hint with frown be perfectly aware said that patagonians be dangerous mr woodward know a well a do be nicked that be how city man met at dinner last night put be nicked in atalantas also if have asked blanche instead of inquiring from stranger a seem to have done interrupted brother with great heat must have told be nicked a choose to call heavily very heavily have be unlucky of late admits good heaven paul what be going to hing be quite capable of managing own affair pretend to be stupid paul mean engagement what have business to do with asked quickly taking high hand lady george be match there everything unless have fallen in love with home thrust of sort be however unwise since rouse meanest antagonist to resistance have so if will be quite ready to admit love have nothing to do with business honour have be engaged to miss woodward be enough for lady george shrugged shoulder there be manly dogmatism about manner be simply unbearable dear boy said if man begin to talk about honour be time for woman to beat retreat since have such strict notion on subject presume have explained to mr woodward exact state of affair at estate overburdened not penny of ready money to be have except by sale really ca discus subject with blanche woman never understand man code of honour on point never understand business crushed down obvious retort in favour of peace for be genuinely alarmed so much so that moment returned to town went to see mr vane thinking more than likely that paul might have confided something to be just sort of little woman in whom men did confide paul be perfectly silly about though of course be very charming little woman now mr vane have heard rumour of mr woodward loss before heard with glad heart since possibility of having to use letter be locked up in dressing case weighed upon have not heard from paul have not seen in fact a have only returned from country two day before have since be ill with fever nevertheless very next afternoon in obedience to little note left at club paul walked into flower decked drawing room gave exclamation of surprise concern at white face figure on sofa have be ill said quickly why did let know before only go of fever have danced night long of dance with paul when have worse bout one found out let make cup of tea please not will take one yes remember be regimental ball there be so few lady never spared violet never knew how to take care of perhaps not must pay someone to do suppose like other old woman for friend be deserting two married last month hear from mr woodward that wedding day be fixed be not aware of replied with frown if be fail to see why must desert friend mr vane laughed dear paul be something of man of world did ever know of anyone like keeping up friendship with anybody like after marriage mean out of page of french novel certainly not be quite resigned to prospect suffered blow in minor degree when left india besides must not anyhow see much of if lived at gleneira will have to do so wo till mr woodward recovers paul stirred tea moodily so have heard too said distastefully everybody have heard of course such thing be godsend at time of year lady dorset be quite pathetic over bad luck yesterday told one must think worse of miss woodward if be to think better of since poverty even comparative poverty must suit neither of spirited pose of head a spoke bold challenge of tone be admirable said that must have break word because promised wife have few pound le than expected laughed again how lofty be paul caught that trick from marjory carmichael by way heard from to day come up to town soon so believe heart gave throb at sound of name must not confess even to excuse if hark back to other subject must like to hear what have to say on woman have such curious notion of honour at least blanche so lady george have be taking to task have be very unwise of for part have opinion never liked engagement a know like still le now when if tale be true mr woodward will not be able to make daughter so handsome allowance a a expected may not be true there be reason why must not tell that be true allowance will be about quarter of what be intended mr woodward spoke to to day about hinting that might make difference of course cut short of course there be fine smile for instant on face ere went on still be right doe make difference undoubtedly make difference echoed paul testily one know that better than do be reason why must back out of word will have to vegetate at gleneira suppose live in villa somewhere poor paul how funny be interrupted taking up letter have be lying beside giving little flourish be just what must have done with someone else so will do for girl love what must not do for one be really too funny one half of being unable to exist without love other without money cut gordian knot by experimenting on life without now must have tried to secure might have managed that think paused moment then went on a be friend be not unwilling to play hero to limited extent because soothes make feel le mercenary ah dear paul understand only might not be more heroic le mercenary to give miss woodward chance of something more to taste than villa somewhere of course heroic husband may not like heroic of must be prepared for that gentle raillery of tone have touch of seriousness in seemed to throw new light on view of subject mean that be likely yes think extremely likely that woodward must rather break off why asked angrily rising to pace room prospect have not changed 'they twain will be one flesh ' quoted mr vane lightly do really think so much of heroism that unaided by love remember will fancy will compensate alice woodward who love pavement for damp dulness of gleneira remember paul voice grew trifle unsteady having to decide similar question once to decide whether must compensate man loved for something well for something be not more dear to than civilisation be to young lady though loved knew must not be right asked with sudden interest of course be right recovered loss of rapidly yet be not unattractive what be more be generally considered good company defy anyone to be if career up down room like polar bear please sit down let make nice cup of tea last be sure must have be horrid know how to take care of bit paul be lucky will get plenty of people to pay for privilege of doing so told that talked great deal of nonsense at time that did a did everything else with infinite verve grace blanche who have not said half a much have made angry here be seated beside violet sofa enjoying tea feeling that sense of bien etre always felt in company yet even might have failed in producing for once if must have overheard conversation be going on over cup of tea in queen garden where mr woodward with real frown on usually placid face be listening to husband account of interview with paul that morning very honourable doubt exceedingly unsatisfactory remarked with asperity must say that think failed did wish to give man conge dear interrupted spouse irritably if so must have told so distinctly if come to can write dismiss have such crude way of putting thing james though presume to understand business affair must own seems inexplicable how difficulty have come about alice be so accustomed to civilisation jack be coming back from riga next week so doe seem to flying in face of providence mr woodward looked at in impatient amaze good heaven maria what do mean who what be flying in face of providence everyone everything seems a if have be away on purpose so that there must be fuss have always be so fond of other alice must be miserable if have to think about money so why must be sacrificed to captain macleod notion of honour dear yes james sacrificed say told plainly state of case behaved a gentleman must expressed sorrow at loss gave to understand that must make difference to to alice never gave thought to suppose men be alike selfish to core really dear protested mr woodward roused by general attack well be selfish be not sitting there calmly proposing to sacrifice alice to adventurer principled adventurer if like though be miserable attempt to what be used to call guaranteed stock disastrous attempt to combine safety speculation suggested husband meekly just so be disastrous attempt to combine common sense romance will not have alice sacrificed will speak to man will hing of sort dear if necessary can do there be hurry must be settled before next week unless want fuss tell that will be settled must talk to alice first be surely possible may be in love with man mr woodward shook head wisely why in heaven name maria be handsome gentlemanly well born why must not love because be in love with jack god bless soul chapter xxiv when paul macleod left mr vane drawing room afternoon told that must for once afford to sit with folded hand let world go own way for time everything seemed working for so there be need for to work for question of letter must very well wait for time for knew to contrary lawyer might have similar proof of little paul legitimacy if have not why ought to have unless indeed marriage certificate have nothing to do with boy at in be conceivable with woman a jeanie duncan must have be anyhow for present child be in comfortable circumstance since dr kennedy have taken in charge a marjory mentioned in letter be to come to london become scholar at school first thing be to see foolish ridiculous engagement broken off then if big paul be wise realised that love money be at command might be possible to tell truth under other circumstance since none must console a must for loss of gleneira therefore for sake of everybody concerned best thing must happen be that must be paul wife great tenderness showed in face at very thought poor paul said half aloud must be quite happy with quite content oh surely deserve something after year be getting tired of doing everything for people care about a have done life long be true in trivial detail of life be a thoroughly unselfish woman a ever stepped ready at moment notice to weary out for sake of making world more pleasant to others so letter must remain locked up perhaps for ever in sober truth must scarcely imagine using melodramatic force be so unlike gentle spiriting by usually effected object though must never recall night of poor old peggy death without shudder sound common sense told that after in advising old woman not to open lawyer letter have done so in ignorance have acted a thought for best everybody be liable to make mistake so much for one party to interview other once spell of mr vane personality be removed felt vaguely that matter be becoming uncomfortable have never occurred to before that ran chance of being jilted bare idea filled with indignation yet saw justice of mr vane remark be not good match for girl who wished for nothing better than to remain in state of social comfort to have pleased providence to call if be so must be better to save dignity by broaching possibility anything be better than being dismissed like footman be never long in deciding question of sort yet quick a be found not moment too soon for when walked round to see mr woodward next morning before gentleman went down to office found in act of writing note asking to call fact be macleod said elder man little nervously wanted to continue talk about engagement to daughter paul flushed up took bull by horn without moment hesitation came for purpose sir have occurred to have somewhat overlooked miss woodward side of question will be infinitely obliged if must treat with perfect frankness in regard to what doubt know better than dignity of speech soothed awaited reply with tolerable equanimity very straightforward very straightforward on part macleod said man of business approvingly one can scarcely be too careful in regard er in regard to such contract remark make regret more than ever duty for really have be be fancy painted may say doe not alter fact that be now comparatively poor man of course may very probably will recoup at same time be not sort of security for for marriage settlement trustee understand of course now what have to face be do think daughter be suited to be wife of poor man even possibly poor man then must be content if have to live most of year at gleneira away from society telegraph post mean post telegraph be pretty place macleod interesting place with with sort of er respectability about be devilish bit out of way perhaps must do best to make daughter forget said paul gloomily sense of being weighed in balance found wanting paul macleod whom so many woman have fancied be exquisitely painful mr woodward blew nose elaborately just so of course of course very right proper very much so indeed only dear macleod marriage after be speculation like to see girl putting capital into concern have even good prospectus how many shareholder must even name produce if must say of new railway be that though chance be dead against traffic must do best to ensure of course er if be violently attached to other one might allow something for er good will of business under circumstance be led to believe though know nothing about that young people be content to live er on ridiculously small income own impression be however alice be not that sort of girl of course may be mistaken in case put in paul loftily must be best to refer to alice exactly what mean er decidedly two can settle for yourselves mother have wish to interfere unnecessarily that think will own be fair dealing though of course a business man have felt duty to warn against risking what be virtually all in concern to put briefly have unpromising prospectus if will allow will give same advice there be pompous warmth in shake of hand a accompanied visitor to door tone changed to confidential whisper see be a if be limited liability lord only know how many child might have paul a made way to little boudoir where alice frittered away so much of time over chiffon picture paper felt that be being pursued by nemesis of own creating have entered into engagement by light of reason in obedience to dictate of sound common sense seemed likely that must be driven from by same mean found for wonder busy with needle thread though subject of be only stitching of tinsel round remarkably large velvet leaf pasted on satin gave more solid air than usually have brighter flush upon cheek told that be expected forewarned of decision indeed felt that word be really unnecessary that might just a well have turned round gone downstairs again leaving white finger busy with gold thread there be certain strain of savagery in paul macleod a there be in most men when dignity be touched resolved to go through with have just seen father began now have come to might have be excused for turning little pale letting work drop for tone be not reassuring saw dread of scene gave faint laugh there be need to be afraid alice have never made disagreeable to yet be not likely to begin now when have come to ask plainly whether must be happy with must clasped unclasped hand quite nervously be ready to try if like if think ought to have nothing to do with put out of question please of course be always painful for man to know that woman doe not care for sufficiently be not that broke in hurriedly must not have promised if have not liked be dulness poverty have never be accustomed to might not be contented then how must be good wife if be not happy be not a if there must be distraction there must be none like country a girl do marjory carmichael for instance looked at sharply eye met without hidden meaning in must not be dull must then how must cheer up for need cheering at gleneira know do truth irritated from infer that must rather be free well have only to take leave said curtly caught in breath a usual display of temper made piteous be angry paul there be nothing to be angry about if wish will try can always be friend if be wiser to part then be wiser be for to decide be at order stood there looking very handsome gave sigh of indecision though certain resentment at being a be thrust into breach came to aid do think wiser repeated how can tell want to do be duty be afraid if be afraid that be enough said losing patience good bye alice if have decided otherwise must have tried to be good husband to faint flush came to cheek must have tried to be good wife well think that with trying to be good husband trying to be good wife life must have be little dreary sometimes curse of home truth seemed in air paul felt have answer ready yet liked better for first touch of sarcasm have ever heard from lip reminded of mr vane a shook hand with servant entering announced mr john woodward paul going downstairs met big florid young man coming up with gardenia in buttonhole parcel tied with gold thread in hand be box of paris chocolate jack have purchased on way from riga two scowled at other a passed after manner of englishman who have never be introduced paul a put on hat felt sudden insane desire to go up again tell alice that have changed mind yet a walked aimlessly through park so northward into street beyond certainty that life have be changed in twinkling of eye came slowly to a did scarcely knew whither to turn for little solid self esteem of late have be nurturing own magnanimity a mr vane have told to face fact that alice woodward fortune be for time diminished in future uncertain have not be without consolation prevented from feeling that people knew to fraction what price have put upon now though be a be genuine reduction have be rejected rejected thought be intolerable even memory of marjory look in eye have seen that last night brought cold comfort for told that even if have wished to do so must never go to say have be jilted yet must not tell lie did not want to seek consolation from marjory after have only be old story of passing fancy fostered by romantic surroundings since have left gleneira have scarcely thought of for must have be quite content to fulfil engagement therein to tell truth lay whole sting of position so wandered on until found in regent park then with idle distaste to decisive action return clubwards must necessitate in zooelogical garden be year since have be there of morning without band crowd year since have brought paper of nut biscuit given to bear now be free yes be one comfort be free to do a liked so watched polar bear made smile at recollection of mr vane sally found certain dreamy pleasure in strolling round by antelope recognising beast like of have shot in strange clime there be always satisfaction to be got from bygone prowess in sport a finally found leaning over railing of tank where pair of dipper be

sweet maidenhood have never seemed so hedged about from evil a brynhild whose very womanhood have be hidden beneath glittering armour of mail that must have thought thing showed strain of romance touch of mysticism be in by right of race though a ever chafed against thing must not escape from from self contempt took possession of ever since night when have said good bye a have boasted to best part of there have be something to prevent realising extent of degradation first relief of certainty bringing with very real content then anxiety for child bringing out kindliness of nature finally knowledge that be not after so mercenary now be defenceless against own worldliness against memory of wanton insult to marjory for be insult nothing a wandered moodily back into town back to face world comment seemed to a if there be not rag anywhere wherewith to cover wounded self esteem one thing must do must go down ask marjory to marry owed so much must refuse of course since be not sort to care for other folk rejection knew by long experience how keenly such love a have seen in eye resented neglect how quick be in changing to repulsion if pride be outraged yes must go down to gleneira regain of belief in by giving marjory revenge then must go abroad shoot lion do something of sort everyone must know have be jilted so might a well play part to bitter end behave a man ought to behave who have have disappointment meanwhile might a well go see violet congratulate on acumen might even go so far a to tell that taking word to heart be about to propose poverty to girl loved a have proposed to girl have not loved of course not knowing of wanton insult must not understand how idle proposition must be liked to be thought clever liked to be at bottom of everything so be not exactly in amiable easily managed mood a followed servant upstairs at mr vane house a luck must have came at time when be too disturbed to have cool head steady nerve necessary to steer into haven

sate waiting eye fixed absently on word that two love other looked up from to see paul macleod standing at door have come back to five minute before have asked almost passionately of friend what must do in such case now there be one answer paul outstretched hand sought a stood tall straight trying to master emotion to preserve calm to have schooled through long journey have ended here here where might once have found rest here where save such self respect a apology might leave be lost for ever paul oh how tired look how cold hand be come dear come warm must be perished did not speak perhaps because hoar frost of pride have chilled eye melted before radiance of hers hoar frost be water after so drew to fire then still holding one hand a if to lose touch of knelt on one knee to stir peat

put jeanie duncan letter into hand walked away to window while read felt more of cur than have ever done in life before what must girl say what must say that served right if dismissed also told that did not care to exchange love for must not that serve right also so a stood frowning moodily at growing glint of sunshine far out in west driving mist in dense mass up glen voice came to a laid down letter with sigh be glad called paul turned quickly to in sort of incredulous amaze be that have to say sort of chill crept over even though found at foot with hand in kissing softly a told with break in voice that be too good too good for man thought brought certain consolation a went on evidently with desire of taking sting from memory to speak of strange coincidence of little paul devotion to of liking for lovable little lad surely if gleneira have to go must far rather went to than to stranger who must care nothing for way why said trifle tearfully have be so much with lately since old peggy died that felt quite lost without when went yesterday for farewell visit up glen to macintosh boy be great playmate so see paul will not matter so much for will live with of course be long long time

afterwards how must ever put up with yet question be once more forgotten in charm of present be end of soft day summitless mountain looked purple green under mist wreath now again seemed to descend to fill valley leave sparkling drop of dew on little curl below marjory cap while river ran roaring beside making kind of droning accompaniment to shriller drip from tree upon stone then fine rain must cease bird begin to twitter rustling damp leaf sending faster shower on path while from west gleaming blade of light must sever mist give glimpse of new heaven new earth where sun be setting peacefully a walked along beside face seemed to hold sunshine mist once in middle of talk over future paused to hark back to past if must begin over again from day first met on river think might have

on world white with hoar frost be not for eye fell upon bunch of late rowan still adorning tree stood so close that on windy night berry must tap against pane like ghostly visitant claiming admittance also be veiled in silvery tracery so trivial remembrance of certain ball dress came uppermost instead of sober reflection a matter of fact larger half of existence can be excellently executed on penny whistle what very good imitation berry have be tom have sent from paris how unlikely be since paul be poor that must have so magnificent garment again must not be wanted be one comfort if lived quietly at gleneira of course must do unless paul be to try get back to active service again must talk that over with many thing when began life again down by river side be ill singing mavis song in

for instant before letter to tom kennedy still lay unfinished a have left looked down again on last word be true still with sudden impulse took up pen to say so tom wrote problem be solved paul have come back to be going to begin new life together yet stretch out hand to dear a did before say 'friendship be bigger thing than love ' then went gaily through garden to pick late carnation for paul buttonhole a picked sang flower o ' forest have seen tweed silver stream glittering in sunny beam grow drumly dark a row 'd on way tune with haunting cadence lingered in mind more than once fell from lip when with light heart faced ups down of white road a crept round loch to where bridge spanning river must enable to strike across moss hag to alder fringed bank above paul must be on other side a have be before must not jump time for be one of thing did not like thing be going to take out of life hers very thought indeed of risk of slip made shiver a paused for moment on bridge saw yellow brown flood swollen with night rain rushing against pier drumly dark drumly be yet scarcely dark ran too fast for up yonder where be to meet paul must be mass of foam with yellow light in sort of syllabub of river pouring over curved edge of rock heavily not like water at like drugged draught falling not with roar rush with slow deafening boom water of lethe might fall so fancied well paul must run risk of to day for be before time must be there to warn so thinking clambered down to water edge seating on only level slab of rock projected slightly over boiling pool below faced downward course of river certain thus of seeing first glimpse of lover tall figure above bracken crested almost perpendicular rock on other side have seen morning be most distracting tune more so because word must follow mr cameron sentimental lead instead of keeping to old lament with lilt of battle sudden death in flower o ' forest fought foremost prime o ' land be cauld in clay be why played a dead

foremost yes if be soldier wife be what soldier must do even if have to sit drearie lamenting dearie be too bad told for tune to haunt so since paul must be coming soon now when have first met head have not be full of flower of forest such thing have be reading one of tom letter how foolish of not to have brought one to complete illusion unless indeed there be by chance one in pocket yes scrap of one old enough to rouse curiosity engross attention a smoothed out began to read to be disappointed in love phrase be arbitrarily bound up with state of celibacy wherefore dear marjory wherefore if love a once agreed think be touchstone of life then marriage appears to to be continual essay of love where ala gold doe not often reach standard for hall marking therefore be conceivably better to be continually in love not to marry know how be mademoiselle grand serieux philosophy invariably end in paradox of doubtful propriety now doe looked up smiling then rose to foot quickly for there be rustle behind paul might have be there ahead of after have gone up to look at river yes there be someone at head of fall where solitary rowan tree leant above alder bush for branch swayed paul cried across boom of river be that come down bit be here be coming miss marjory be coming answered childish voice be berry be getting for first be last will be getting in gleneira be thinking be real beauty great heaven how reckless of boy yet be not recklessness in blood there be clinging to overhanging branch instant might fall paul cried quickly peremptorily come down at once want saw bright flushed face through sparse yellowing leaf close to bunch of red berry clutched by little brown hand so like picture of mother so like so like paul too paul ah god in child have slipped hold tight paul hold tight vain cry almost before be uttered seething foam with sunny glint in have stifled swift scream marjory made sound white desperate leant over slippery edge of shelf clutched at something seethed upwards for second lost balance be gone in silence heavy foam closed over like snow drift with sun on help bravest heart must have given be hope that unconsciousness might come quickly through kindly rock not in slow agony of suffocation be over in minute for nature know own mind when be in tragic mood allows time for unavailing tear when not minute afterwards paul macleod cry of marjory marjory with ring of glad certainty echoed over pool there be not sign to show that must ever give answer to call again marjory marjory marjory pitiful appeal though knew not not even when vague wonder at tardiness clouded careless joy have come to with dawn of new day new life for night seemed to have stolen fear a fit companion for shadow left nothing hope marjory marjory marjory be there anything in wide world so terrible a slow dread come a minute pas unavailingly by a certainty that something have gone amiss seems to grow from very passion of protestation against possibility then when fear have gone unknown grief be companion of fruitless search in wild hope will spring up sometimes to intensify pain of such thing men may surely pray fancy not memory may speak be tom kennedy letter lighter than love have penned gave first clue hope went out from paul macleod face for ever when quick eye found like foam bubble in backwater near ford will be in long pool must be looking whispered rough tender voice to other paul heard paul knew paul understood what must come if not that night then next day next fate be merciful did not prolong agony look laird oh dear carried in arm a laddie look sobbed old macpherson a with first streak of following dawn men who have be working night long bent over oil strewn torch lit depth through grapnel came up slowly heavily paul be coward have looked death steadily in face many many time stand back john said quietly will lift in a held there in arm while drifted down stream space to shelving grassy bank bent over calm face thanked god there be passionately for gift of sharp cut just showing beneath damp curl through friendly rock have brought quick end to life a looked up again dawn be out paling star bird in alder bush be stirring into song what day be asked drearily of old john sudden forgetfulness be only sign showed at time of terrible shock have sustained yet none who noticed must ever forget look came to face when guided by clue given by child cap still clenched in girl hand further search ended in discovery of little paul body marjory lover realised that must have lost life in effort to save namesake indeed in after year old john telling tale must often say that never went in such fear of seeing murder done a when mr gillespie have suggested touching propriety of burying brave girl little friend side by side have even taken bunch of rowan berry found in boy finger from girl breast where have laid a doubt have be intended to lie saying in sort of fury that nothing of child must come near beyond that made sign old john said true paul macleod came back courteous calm among many mourner who climbed one sunny afternoon to sunny spot on southern slope of hill where marjory have said light lingered longest james gillespie fair florid face gaining dignity from office leading way bareheaded in white surplice through dead bracken over heathery slope while voice steadied over word of consolation hope tom kennedy will laird mr wilson who old a be must not be gainsaid carrying dear dead resting at time upon lichen covered rock aided by other hand tenderly sorrowfully willing a theirs falling for time step behind save paul who setting even old john offer of help aside kept clasp tight upon tough ash staff until a passed wishing well on downward way broke across knee fiercely flung piece on dismal little pile then be that father macdonald who with sad serene eye softly moving lip have followed at little distance pleaded with great judge for soul needing mercy paul came back courteous calm also from smaller drearier procession laid new found heir among forbear in stone vault belonging to macleod far over by ardmore point in old kirk yard dr kennedy knowing circumstance must fain have spared empty

past anything save that odd rhythmical tossing from side to side of restless head come when brain be conscious of nothing fever raging in lord george came down at once gentle a woman surprised to hear long tale dr kennedy have to tell for paul have only written of sad accident lady george followed with two plain black dress little assortment of highly starched linen collar cuff in portmanteau ready at point to take up role of nurse though why woman must nurse better in handcuff prevent natural play of wrist why patient must be supposed to like dangling of starched cap string in face be matter still head tossed restlessly parched lip went on muttering muttering at first of many thing faintly articulate many thing of many place then by degree centring round one time one scene finally emerging into monotonous whisper violet violet violet think have better telegraph for mr vane said dr kennedy looking grave mind have gone back to time when nursed through something similar be often so in brain case can not afford to lose chance of saving sane that previous attack lessens chance terribly came of course without instant delay a must have come to anyone who needed extraordinary tact
