moment of success have made mistake have have time to consider must never have given away to enemy a have done by showing that knew of talisman be tactical error might be partially rectified so far a people be concerned therefore without further delay sent message to william leedes at hall of labour to come up to at once bringing false diamond with when arrived did not take long to exchange true for false then with due decorum to send turban back to beneficent lady who knew from what mihr un nissa have said have given to prince calculated cunningly that return must at least keep quiet woman be invariably at bottom of conspiracy felt very secure very confident very complacent spent hour two in entertaining william leedes with eastern sumptuousness ere ordering palanquin to take jeweller diamond back to safe keeping in hall of labour whence assured thief in world must have chance of purloining in truth have reason for complacency since general outlook be clearing repeated failure must dishearten enemy of empire mere fact of bond of brotherhood between king son have come incidentally by way in course of counterplot added to chance of akbar being content with practical politics

exulting awe almost fanatical enthusiasm for for ideal so often possessed seized on birbal riding up in weary haste found centre of enthusiastic crowd who granting supernatural power be busy substituting dead woman for living girl while latter sate stupidly in sunlight watching flame blaze up round victim with burden of old man head upon lap anyhow promise be unbroken birbal a rode back behind majesty told there be trouble ahead such incident be not wholesome especially when effort must be made to keep king down to practical politics so little might make break away so shaikie hath lost one chance of love said akbar suddenly when after long silent ride tower of fatehpur sikri showed clear again empire hath gained many chance of stability replied birbal drily with grandson of rajput descent majesty may hand on crown when god time come in security of what asked akbar swiftly that dream will be fulfilled dream of king then suddenly almost drew rein woman must be rewarded birbal who came god know how to warn must not have escape reward a majesty have bidden act charan at festival to day replied birbal still more drily there seems small chance of escaping notice king face broke suddenly into charming whimsical smile of truth friend must be thorn in flesh even to thee to others god know how bear with how will bear with acquiesced birbal grimly for liberal culture boasted freedom from prejudice be conventionality in somethings irked to think of woman masquerading a charan yet atma devi looked best when few hour afterward knelt on floor below short flight of
