a said before uninteresting since most museum posse something of sort however be very different be will again observe of very recent construction joined to fact found on harp viking tomb famous in local tradition point to mind conclusively towards survival amongst primitive people of if not original cult of fate need scarcely say that nothing be more difficult to track home than faint footstep of discredited belief simply because rash inquiry result in prompt denial must therefore be careful will ask also for present at least to preserve kindly silence on discovery looked round company a if be full meeting of british association after lunch a matter of fact consisted of lady maud husband eustace gordon have barely finished breakfast when professor ignorant of discomfort walked in on according to previous arrangement mr wilson slight pleasant looking man with short beard covering chin want of chin have be moving restlessly from window to fireplace back again during speech now

good joke that come along have thirst for knowledge on morning lady maud left alone with two carven image took up sea waif carried off to own sanctum where stuck in place of honour on mantelshelf then walking to window looked out on pale green jostling wave purple green swaying heather wonder when louisa will turn up thought irrelevantly after must have done better to come on with get over instead of waiting in yacht for calmer weather suppose be never to calm down threw open window with reckless laugh fresh wind raced in bellying curtain like sail catching slender figure with such force that

thing not for lady maud despite many attempt have never be able to get whip hand of conscience have to menager by driving round anything at thought likely to shy marriage to mr wilson have be approached in circuitous way until manifest advantage completely obscured central fact that really loved cousin eustace a yet repentance have not come to indeed came hardly to one so full of common sense worldly wisdom a be came sometimes once a child have come suddenly in sunlit solitary room into have be set apart for reflection have knelt down to say naively oh god be sorry now please make sorry again for like that briefly be still attitude towards ideal did not love husband thought sufficiently gentlemanlike pleasing to save regret did rather have loved eustace idea of of permitting that past folly to interfere with present have deliberately chosen be absurd to begin with must see little of other when did must carefully avoid renewal of confidential relation be great safety in

delightfully new of rich man who quarrel with supply not price so topic passed will have cigar go to bed did sleep bit last night said mr wilson shortly after returned to bare drawing room guiltless of decoration where lady maud parisian teagown looked so oddly out of place take hot whiskey water laughed wife wo go to smoking room must be tired professor after long walk learned man social belief forbade cigar when charming woman be alternative so elected to remain being in reality much fatigued however shortly afterwards gave way to seduction of semi darkness arm chair semi darkness because kirsty lamp smoking horribly preferred light of blazing peat fire outside wind crooned round house lullaby to ear acquainted with other note to accustomed to stillness of south banshee wail of coming trouble with firelight playing on jet agraffes held cunning drapery on gleaming bust arm lady maud be picture few men must look on absolutely unmoved if eustace gordon felt charm of beauty gave sign of a yet sate there in semi darkness side by side sometimes silent sometimes talking indifferently of indifferent subject alone a utterly alone in world a if two be only man woman in for barrier

inroad for coffee cup peat candle again must really high class butler have permitted professor endorwick to snooze undisturbed in chair for two hour on end not that did harm by slumber might have

opened door of dressing room softly so a not to disturb husband must have fallen asleep great fire burnt bravely in little sitting room beyond something in unusual silence of enhanced comfort in eye if josephine have be awaiting a usual must not have put off task of undressing in favour of sheer idleness by fire husband be right something in rhythmical surge of sea made one not exactly restless on alert disinclined for action yet prepared for foolish idea since what must be going to happen to small household already for most part asleep professor must have taken first opportunity of recommencing that snooze legitimately in bed even eustace why must thought run on eustace irritated at own self consciousness took up book impatiently interested by by turned for second volume to find

elected to sleep in great chamber on upper storey besides what good must be kirsty slept outside with other farm servant eustace not eustace not now at rate not till be certain there be cook of course people in rank of life be accustomed oh be not possible what wretch be to harbour such suspicion when might be ill perhaps dying with protest in mind rich drapery caught over arm candle flaring

when after scudding with wind at back for two mile came upon ferry one glance showed even will lockhart inexperienced eye that cockleshell of boat bobbing up down in backwater must never fight way through mad melee of wind against tide in middle of narrow stream comparative calm reigned to one side in inland loch to other in open sea here wave leapt at other in pyramid sending jet of spray upwards with very force of meeting good thrower must easily have flung stone across channel for that be impassable till tired tide must turn join wind in race eastward so at rate said rick adding that aunt must be delighted at contretemps must procure visit from old friend why will lockhart must have hesitated when be raining cat dog be two twenty year since have parted in anger from hot headed quick tongued chit of eighteen who be now by account brisk contented woman of forty be not easy of explanation perhaps thought of lady maud triumph rankled perhaps when be said done be not quite

whither rick led be miss willina fortunately perhaps for dignity of be extremely tenacious have be in potting shed feeding late brood of chicken presented to that morning by inexperienced young mother who have preferred bed of nettle behind peat stack to comfort of hen house nursery so have ample opportunity of seeing pas up ferry path of grasping situation to say nothing of smoothing hair washing hand before putting in appearance be great support to most woman in crisis of life a matter of fact however miss willina have never regarded episode of earliest year of conquest a one of supreme importance perhaps slight inkling that really did mean more than be prepared to admit be at bottom of deliberate want of romance on subject have have many admirer have still for matter be perfectly aware for instance of professor interest for that have never felt inclined to marry since salad day when have drowned resentment in knowledge men who knew be at foot why must marry there be plenty of time opportunity if wished then when time passed leaving still miss macdonald told one else that be of own free will pleasure a undoubtedly be scouted regret only when masterful current of vitality slackened a even hers have to do at time did wonder if early love affair have not be at bottom of cold bloodedness will lockhart did not think much changed daintiness wilfulness chiefly remembered be still there be like old time to hear order up with rick to change foot see swift touch with rescued antimacassar from annihilation when sate down want of change depressed by emphasizing long year must not forget there be much a remembered people told also that have changed little yet in old day have seemed impossible to conceive of life apart here be free unmarried talking calmly with new generation for listener about past time what have kept separate except own free will nothing yet have of deliberately anticipated ending when quarrelled over bread butter now be thinking of professor

will want men too if one be to cross stream tonight be nice boy said will lockhart putting down glass a rick figure on way to boat house blocked out professor increasing despair just about age be when paused looked at companion yes be twenty one be eighteen be standing close together firelight throwing shadow out faintly against growing darkness on face dull autumn twilight lingered blotting out trace of passage of time came little nearer to wonder why quarrelled said argumentatively mean what quarrelled about be never very difficult to find be why did quarrel finally that last time recollect that be more wilful than usual doubt be more aggravating retorted quickly do wish to begin over again will if have mind to begin what quarrel of course thank there be professor hauling down flag have seen rick acknowledged defeat good man think miss macdonald that must be more comfortable by fire than here at window more comfortable than professor be poor man be what mean how selfish men be then expect not to see through think ever be quite so exigeant a be do know rather wish must just cast eye over innermost thought at present moment must save beating about bush perhaps despite outward calm be little excited for have taken up knitting half mechanically now needle clashed fast furious be leaning towards elbow on knee hand loosely clasped together something of youth not so much in romance a in imperious desire to know understand be in face miss macdonald have right to ask be going to marry man on other side gave little conscious laugh nervous half gratified be what call beating about bush suppose why why must marry anybody for life of must not tell save in vague way that dead past seemed so pitiful because be dead past why did quarrel repeated if clansman have come in unexpectedly that evening after time so given opportunity of going off in sulk must have made up a usual seems such little thing to come between laid down knitting looked at thoughtfully woman le truthful than miss willina might have allowed inevitable satisfaction of being remembered to give extra tinge of regret romance to past in sober fact have have little of miss willina sense of humour be of rare kind be not blunted by egotism ridiculously little in novel read dozen of in winter be always something pathetic letter left in blotting book wrong initial on envelope false announcement of marriage something not to be foreseen helped if be fault of fate get brain fever forget own name just quarrelled did care to make up be in least romantic be afraid did forget said in same argumentative tone at least did of course not doe one ever forget absolutely voice trembled slightly pathos of memory be not to be ignored entirely seems such pity leading such lonely life lonely must see noah ark well scoff at suppose be absurd to night somehow interrupted with soft hand laid on please be like child trying to pretend shadow on wall be alive be shadow nothing shadow light throw pointed to window with laugh be sob poor man ought to be extinguished by time perhaps be right replied sadly still holding hand seems hard shadow be so pretty not so pretty a reality what be that that have met forgiven

cobweb until come back in summer summer be over not st martin one often have spell of fine weather late in year when earlier portion have be stormy shook head v well hooper what be lady maud stood at bay once more with diffident looking man at door three week have passed since first interview only three week seemed to eternity of fear anxiety now letter written in reply to hers have come from american doctor knew worst mr wilson case have at once be easy difficult easy because of singular lack of will power difficult for same reason joined to very bad ancestral record so bad that maternal uncle from whom have inherited large fortune being deeply resentful of treatment sister have endured from drunken husband have burdened legacy with certain unusual condition a to sobriety control consequently when shortly after release from restraint of minority inherited tendency have shown in mr wilson have voluntarily placed in dr haddon charge urged to step by fear of pecuniary loss be briefly whole story save that dr haddon continued to have charge of case must be obliged if lady maud must co operate with in continuing system have hitherto be so successful did not scruple to add be mr wilson only chance of fulfilling condition under held fortune for believed there be danger of relapse might even be possible after year to relax supervision in case begged to remember that hereditary tendency must need be weakened by generation even of enforced sobriety have hoped that there might be necessity for to be made acquainted with circumstance a whole affair have be dealt with in strictest confidence essence of treatment lay in ignoring difficulty now that untoward event reported by hooper have occurred be better must clearly understand position of affair briefly be paid for keeping mr wilson from losing very large portion of wealth apart from that be interesting case in regard to hooper be thoroughly trustworthy conscientious most necessary thing when influence be easy to attain at same time if hooper failed to commend to lady maud must be replaced in view of heavy stake at issue however must recommend extreme caution in making change a for reason for allowing mr wilson to marry under circumstance be manifold belief in system be so great that felt confident lady maud must never find cause for blame in husband conduct letter in bald statement of fact assumption of perfectly satisfactory state of affair carried with sort of cold comfort yet lady maud felt wild revolt against such a verdict of disease death must have aroused like most woman who marry men to whom be indifferent have looked forward odd a may seem to having child who must give zest to otherwise insipid life now mere possibility be terror not in pity for who might come handicapped into race from sheer physical horror that must be hers terror came uppermost in first few minute of shock have heard from dr haddon morning lady in future be to take order from so have come to ask for disapproval in tone be audible felt rash resentful desire to bid go leave free doctor warning checked word what if must have burdened life for nothing who have refused money again again because seemed vulgar to fastidiousness might appeal to husband a man chance influence against hooper haddon system what if failed during last three week have silenced heart despite effort must have way by protestation that be only awaiting doctor reply that by by must no longer consent to be man wife on term to live on a if knew nothing to give help condemnation to acquiesce without word in future filled with shame horror when knew fact must decide now knew too much have order said in low voice new one can go then suddenly thought flashed through arrested with gesture yes lady still be silent one hand gripping edge of table breath coming fast think place be good for mr wilson indeed ladyship broke in hooper relieved have thought so irregular habit in regard to spirit be trying think must be better away exactly so lady only did not like arrangement being a be settled voice have gained in steadiness by time there need be alteration must remain here of course paused hooper shifted uneasily mr wilson have invitation to perthshire yesterday must like to accept do understand indeed lady can not to begin with be not allowed by dr haddon stopped angrily if can not obey there be others so dr haddon say consider place be bad for mr wilson be wish must leave do hear for life of try after calmness a must entreaty despair made command falter must go if only to give time to think time to settle what course must choose if ladyship take responsibility in regard to dr haddon mean take responsibility for everything then will suggest may not succeed will do best if fail ladyship must remember be not engaged for such work grotesqueness of struck sense of humour despite turmoil of emotion in found yes yes said impatiently will remember be not place when have gone stood for time

about boat being heavy professor will row of course one row at oxford indeed for one think oxford style be best in world then perhaps will not require aid only learnt off coast of cornwall cynthia looked at usually docile adorer in amaze did not understand that big man have for once thought worth while to make up mind must go without pleaded quite meekly see have be there before ah must go without if can be of use said captain magnificently sight of aggrieved courteous dignity gave cynthia quite pang so be arranged that about slack tide professor must row to eilean fa ash from boat house on north headland afterwards taking advantage of full tide southerly current slip down coast across sand to meet wagonette eustace maud proposed to start about same time for eval house so that might say good bye to miss willina before joining yacht boat at grada point whence carriage on return journey must take lady maud back to roederay sombre silence have lain between two day even when be left alone on terrace watching others disappear shorewards said nothing for time great stillness seemed to be in very air not breath on water not sound on moor not cloud on sky very house seemed asleep most of servant away for edification amusement at preaching mile to south amongst peat bog heather singing psalm eating peppermint drop praising creator flirting with creature silence must have reminded eustace of fact for at last turned to companion hastily wo be at eval so there be use going come maud be last time will be together suppose come be not much to grant thought when might never see again so went out together over moor down by little pool where water showed shadow blended one into other upon cairn where sate together looking out over sea together always together eustace a have be at beginning be end very end meanwhile trio in boat set forth gaily professor very straight in back with little style giving stroke whilst arthur week gloomily polite paddled in bow debarred from even fair sight of beloved full flood tide lapped at furthermost scallop of seaweed on shingly shore touched sea pink cresting rock must pull leetle harder suggested captain drily when professor paused in long sentence to take breath want to hustle anybody have only just got time to manage be making good deal of leeway channel north be bit dangerous cynthia glanced nervously towards pole oh yes please mr endorwick pull harder can talk when get to island easier said than done perspiration poured down professor face bow kept head straight a die yet still boat failed to respond a crept along slowly channel between headland island began to open up showing still oily water tell of swift current be too far north said captain resting on oar moment tide ca have be quite slack when started however doe matter for current here will take south in time professor pausing too drifted idly be landing place miss strong went on speaker yonder where bent almost touch water square thing behind be stone cof paused abruptly why what devil be drifting north due north by george be though in good sooth be drifting north like feather north impossible current run south at flood stay by heaven remember ronald said something about change at equinox quick man alive pull pull hard once get beyond rock will have dickens to keep out of eddy run like race higher up amongst sunken rock last word came in jerk a set strength to oar boat spun round with point of professor oar a axis spun round drifting a span damn shouted man of war busy on rowlock beg pardon miss strong here man quick give oar go forward lie down in bow keep keel stiff now then cynthia scream there be good girl there be danger a yet lie down too then wo see anything did lie down ignominiously right down at foot feeling that must be content to enter paradise clinging to man coat tail if only that entry be not premature whole world to lay in strength of arm when meeting piteous eye face relaxed to something like smile gasped right getting along nicely felt once for loved little finger better than whole of abject figure in bow so crouched lost in sort of terrified reliance on till with queer little sound half sob half laugh slackened without pause proceeded to retransfer pair of rowlock to bow now then professor if please sorry to have be so abrupt one manages better sculling when there be rudder break be caused by being out of breath otherwise be full of dignity cynthia strong broke down suddenly into subdued tear have better lie still said see here coat fumbled into pillow with left hand a went on rowing with right raise head please so a bent over whispered cry dear be over now what cynthia strong did to hand so near lip be dead secret between two captain fine flush be doubtless due to previous exertion why pillow must have caused rush of blood to cynthia terror blanched face remains mystery work so hard professor cried former gaily be pulling round have to get head towards home eilean fa ash be out of question besides miss strong will be better for cup of tea sort of thing be fit for woman nobody denied vii man woman looking seaward from grada point to north long curve of sand hidden by flood tide curve ending in low line of eilean fa ash viewed from here seemed a if be joined to mainland beyond northern headland whence roederay lodge stood out against sky to south coast broken into little point bay with slender mast of yacht standing above near promontory to west spit of rock running out into atlantic once more lay like golden garment stretching far a eye must reach on hand at foot little boat swaying gently against bare ledge of rock for tide be at full do come said man have really seen yacht ca possibly miss returning wagonette will send man to watch if like then there can be mistake did not look at voice be instinct with passionate entreaty men may not be here till late lady maud did not look at yet same repressed emotion rang in tone can row have only to paddle round rock current will take right on to yacht men lazy beggar let swim besides must have be here long ago be past five half past have be here put store in boat be who be late moved step closer impatiently what have men to do with maud be childish what be afraid of not of surely there be pause be afraid of nothing said lightly come will be pleasant out on sunny sea at rate steadied boat for stepped in where to asked half in jest when stroke two have taken from shadow of rock into glitter of sinking sun where lay bathed in light water dripping from lifted oar like drop of molten gold why must leave everything behind set sail for nowhere anywhere with arm resting on oar leant forward fixing dark eye on face be full of pity great tenderness look so nice there maud take off hat dear let sun shine on hair a used to do when be girl if have will maud must always be in sunlight know that oar fell into water softly a rowed on whilst sate silent trailing one hand in water watching great big medusa come pulsating past how pleasant must be to drift like said half to herself once again drip drip drip of golden tear filled up silence a boat swayed idly on breathing of sea why must drift there be plenty of time god know tie enough a rule grapnel fore aft mud bank under to stick upon talk of now eustace broke in hurriedly let forget for last half hour be enough to be here together enough for now replied unsteadily for afterwards there may be afterwards shook head man never think of that ca live on moonshine sunshine want something real so do maud what will do when go back to put out hand in entreaty with little cry oh eustace can not let be happy for one short half hour happy when be going to part happy when know what future will be when know will be torture to why did send away if be not because strain be too great for to bear did not send away faltered pshaw hooper told about fool be afraid then wire came of course there be need for other meant maud ah darling

fate point way be drifting drifting little more current will take why must go back to empty house empty life maud maud what doe man say to woman when have forgotten everything in world save mad desire to keep for own must be said in tenderness passion selfishness be hers a boat drifted drifted be cold said suddenly giving little shudder yet drawing closer to will be too late too late to return answered joyously oh maud trust once see yacht be close turned gave quick exclamation of surprise where be not a expected within stone throw of coast drifting surely southward here be nothing save sea rising slowly from on side thin mist golden in sunlight through in far distance shadow two loomed faint unrecognized above sky clear a ever below sea bright pellucid between gathering curtain even a looked faded from gold to white from white to grey a unseen sun sank beneath unseen horizon be sea haugh said lightly wind must have changed to north cold condenses vapour have seen often after hot weather be all right must be close to yacht for be well in current when stopped rowing run inshore due south if whistle must hear answer none came sound seemed to return resonant from mist showing that have not travelled far so whistling shouting rowing spent time in vain till fear began to invade courage what if have drifted past what if be drifting out to sea further further from safety tried to scoff at alarm though own anxiety grew fast a mist settled thicker thicker till must not see yard beyond bow suddenly with grating shock boat stopped abruptly almost throwing into other arm heart seemed to stop also a remembered having heard of sunken rock in mid channel be aground stay still will see stepped cautiously over side one foot into six inch of water shelving bottom other into three then on to firm dry warm sand laugh of relief be genuine adventure be over maud come let help out must be mainland where ca say difficult question indeed to decide with grey mist curtain closing in shutting out save patch two of bent at foot stay here bit continued will explore take whistle wo go beyond reach be away long road must be close by be not however returned after time with clouded face understand sea seems to surround except in one direction be sand bent remember such point below grada perhaps be above suggested companion quite impossible current run south sort of back eddy from big stream be what brings drift to grada sand question however be what be to do take to boat again punt along shore till find landmark must say best not to desert ship again brought disappointment hour rowing punting towing resulted in nothing by time be almost dark mist gathered denser than ever with approach of night north wind rose steadily sooner settle better if have to camp out look like said at last still if light fire one may see anyhow there be store sail in boat so will manage cheer up maud imagine be child again how often have pretended to be cast away on desert island together how happy be true enough yet a helped to gather driftwood for fire thought be on difference between day there be more to in mischance than there must have be to others what have meant to do when stepped into boat must not tell only knew that fate seemed to have decided for if fire brought one well good if not why then eustace have gone adrift question be settled forever sate feeding fire whilst foraged for eatable in boat stick seemed to doubt dispelled how flamed crackled sparkled a driftwood doe out of sheer joy in burning yet one came one later on with tenderness be fierce delight to found what shelter must on bare waste of bent shingle though be only nook backed on windy side by rough slab of rock half embedded in sand still be dry warm with boat sail wrapped round foot towards freshly built fire must lean back comfortably defy of growing cold rising wind sate watching silently a sate by fire turning now again to assure of comfort tuck sail loosened by wind round more closely suddenly during one of ministration eye caught sparkle of dewdrop on coat stretched out delicate hand to touch sleeve be quite wet there be plenty of room for here eustace said quietly sail will cover if sit close together must not begin by being selfish then calm gave way oh eustace eustace must love other very dearly will die of shame something in almost despairing surrender to fate roused best part in nature drew head on to shoulder kissed gently good night dear go to sleep if can will watch fire gave little shivering sob clung to be settled now have taken life into own hand struggle be over be haven of rest haven of rest thought went further than for be utterly wearied out a sate beside mind went far afield into afterwards have claimed a right more than once a stirred in uneasy sleep into have fallen bent over again kissed be past be at end scruple must come later if came at have foreseen ending from beginning perhaps have tried to escape from perhaps have not much be certain star have fought for be wind swept steadily round safe sheltered a be feared harm when dawn came trouble must all be over forever so sheltering a morning approached too fell into doze fire deprived of fuel sank by degree to heap of smouldering ash then chill come before day sought out even in other arm brought to vague surprised consciousness of surroundings where be what have happened with eye still full of sleep dream saw grey mist hanging round ash of fire have burnt so bravely last night last night great god how came there eustace cried starting up wildly one hand finding aid from slab of rock behind pretty hair be damp with dew face flushed where have rested on shoulder for answer caught to covered face with passionate kiss too be fresh from sleep dream dream of hereafter now day have come yonder where mist showed lightest sun be rising oh panted struggling to escape maud tone be full of surprised reproach a fell back step what be have done have done echoed swiftly ca remember oh god what be that voice rose to shriek clung to convulsively with one hand while eye fixed on stone slab have sheltered north wind have done work during night embedded slab be clear now more than clear formed part of stone coffin whence wind have driven sand leaving content exposed to view only few bone backed by drifted sand still kept semblance of skeleton sitting staring out into mist eustace gordon recoiled best of men must have done so much in such situation then memory aided be eilean fa ash maud eilean varai remember must have drifted north somehow look so scared darling be only eilean fa ash island of rest be did not heed eye full of almost insane terror be fastened on fleshless hand lay so near oh god in heaven so near own a clutched side of coffin ring whispered look look ring ring ring yes on dead a on living hand saw ring with legend beautiful constant chaste chill came over even passion yet turned to with sudden petulance well what then know whence must have come what must have be from beginning suppose come let leave horror let leave past be sensible come maud gave one look look never forgot with cry of rick ring rick ring broke from disappeared into mist maud maud be silly maud where be going for god sake maud come back mist sea be mad maud maud then too be blotted out growing light of day found nothing human there save bone of woman who have be loved nothing ash of fire have gone out maud maud cry hit on mist came echoing back to a following faint footstep pursued once looming through fog thought saw pausing a for breath passionate entreaty for to wait for eager reminder that be eustace eustace lover brought response did imagine faint cry a if started off in renewed alarm be only sea bird hidden in mist uttering plaintive note brought up suddenly with gasp of horrid fear a foot gave way beneath deeper deeper be right firm ground once more where be where be faint footmark leading maud come back be not safe still went on not safe indeed floundered desperately for moment then stood with laboured breath dew of deadly fear on face looking round sun rising steadily have by time turned mist into golden haze through must see that few seaweed hung boulder have be gathered to heap whence sprang cross shaped post must be ford sea ford to eilean fa ash way then lay safety for few hour way have gone stooped to see with fear for for fighting with love then stood up pale a death maud come back maud will not hurt surely surely there be answering cry relief seemed to blind deafen here here where be be next instant rick halmar be beside fiercely imperative where be where be eustace gordon looked at eager boyish face stupidly faltered be afraid ran away know why call might come to call bright blue eye seemed to pierce through through before sought ground there be not much to be seen only print of woman foot in sand foot going south due south coward word rang out clear from golden mist like voice from heaven eustace gordon be left standing alone beside cross pointing towards safety rick halmar have gone south due south viii then new cry beat upon curtain of mist lady maud lady maud be rick rick halmar boy voice reached further than man a moment by moment sea haugh lightened softened rose until seemed no more than golden halo round climbing sun be rick rick halmar hand clenched tighter tighter a ran to eustace danger have be uncertain unreal rick knew inch of ground knew that step left hope further behind already accustomed ear have caught curious whispering hush with land give way before sea knew what meant on grada sand firm foothold for second then shivering murmuring sliding gulf oh horrible most horrible to think of lady maud be rick only rick thought came to suddenly that be birthday have promised to give something ah fate must not be so cruel on birthday of day in year foolish irrational thought somehow brought comfort a keen eye sought sign found nothing shining footstep whence water filtered even a sped past thank heaven for so much since showed that tide be still far off that a yet there be time lighter lighter too soon might be able to see ghostlike through mist at least judge distance of creeping line of foam still unseen still hoped fiercely far far off yet seemed to occupy thought to fill memory tortuous like snake with snake low hiss a curled along quivering sand suddenly heart stood still for there out of golden mist grew tall black spar of old wreck with message of warning pretty safe so far most time beyond that recollection of own careless word prompted cry lady dearest lady be rick only rick what be on sand blotting yellow sand just below spar stone seaweed be woman dress be there face downwards on sand fallen insensible perhaps saved thank god saved stumbled in mad haste to reach be stumble have foot broken through firmer crust again time foot must have come so far so close only to fail impossible then beneath felt tremor first slight tremor heralding dissolution of dry land with sudden resolve in time of danger separate one man from fellow decisively absolutely to utter annihilation of cant about equality put strength into one bold leap forward next instant be clinging to spar like monkey sailor tremor passed sand settled once more with low gurgling murmur proclaiming back draw of wave still hidden by haze cautiously tried one foot beyond single plank between destruction hopeless even if stood still to reach must take step two again tremor came shifting sliding sparkle of sand grain a parted figure lying with face hidden resting on right arm sank little only very little yet still sank have come prepared for danger with rope wound about waist almost with first foothold on wreck hand have be busy with coil even while thought eye be elsewhere bight here bend there be fast a sailor lore must make to spar to body not there for have to be doubled to bear strain must not afford to lose inch so tight over one shoulder with treble twist round outstretched arm must not give way unless tore arm from socket then rope being high up on spar must give greater purchase when time came for strength how long thought action seemed to take yet must not spare one of even though with soft swishing rush hidden enemy made sally time lingering moment round figure on sand a if to gain firmer hold upon perhaps not so firm a must be now be ready with swing backwards forward to gain additional impetus rope coiled loosely so a not to drag leapt clear of wreck towards instant doubt have by hand left hand lay stretched on sand a have fallen how cold be must be dead horror of thought be forgotten in fight for now with same chuckling sound a if devil below be laughing at came back draw not inch not quarter to be yielded come what might rope despite bitter clench upon strand cut deep into arm seemed a if red hot iron pierced shoulder a sinew strained to uttermost ah be relief weight be heavier surely that meant le stable support hanging a be by one arm other outstretched to keep hold on must see nothing save unsteady sand closing round seemed to feel nothing save little cold hand in be now never grasping rope a high a must reach put out whole strength hoping to move inch nearer to hopeless back draw coming on unawares found a be on rack seized opportunity set teeth endured how never knew when agony passed dew like of death be on face hung nerveless helpless save for desperate resolve to keep hold to keep hand in wave again little bubble time a if one be drowning close by ah if must only see even though be to see gripped in pulsating horror maud be only rick cry came from a hung on rack once more perhaps if must keep hold coming tide must slacken that grip might must how far have sunk already have golden head disappeared be there nothing left save little cold hand where must feel ring ring slipping under clasp ah there be wave again surging in ear whispering whispering whispering surely of far off country of great rest peace forgetfulness rick halmar hung limp upon rope nature have stepped in patience be exhausted must have more heroism no more delay two hand have held other long enough time have come for to part quietly peacefully not in moment gradually a if even in unconsciousness spirit strove against flesh slender finger slipped through strong one slipped slipped till with little jerk rick hand closed upon fell back inert while other still stretched in mute appeal sank slowly into sand sun having escaped from halo saw deed done smiled down upon sight cheerfully only boy with birthday present in hand only one more woman loved lost what be to weep over wheeling gull sweeping by on broad white wing suggested sympathy in reality came to see if deed portended food for young one there be other spectator have there be must have be so occupied by vain attempt to aid that essence of must have escaped such thing be better told than witnessed so thought miss willina when three week afterwards rick with left arm still in sling tried to make understand be not fault wore silver ring on right hand have found there tight clasped when set on track by eustace gordon came in boat to rescue just too late to do more than release rick from torture none le painful afterwards because be unfelt at time perhaps with older eye miss willina saw further into blame than did said nothing so rick kept ring with legend beautiful constant chaste a birthday present did not even give to wife belonged said to most perfect woman have ever seen when people suggested propriety of being euphonism for one have chosen a life companion shook head with smile nevertheless miss willina be not silent of blame poured vial of on own head for having neglected clear duty if have only insisted on other devil being burnt a well terrible thing might not have come to pas anyhow must go over to deserted lodge without delay destroy wicked idol lest must do more harm let come too said rick in low voice time miss willina did not meet request with query be so pretty a that dear indeed memory of word choked so rick went for first time into little sanctum where lady maud have stood adrift at window image be still on mantelpiece started at sight of aunt will cried in quick half alarmed tone never made that be not work be not professor have be right for once when called genuine savage conception of fate brought thither by gulf stream rick took up in hand looked at curiously wonder said half to if thing must have be different then with sort of appeal turned to miss willina aunt will
