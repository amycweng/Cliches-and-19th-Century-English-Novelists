struggled with moulting swansdown eaten cashmere have flung over head miss sahiba miss baba norty norty girl cried after desperately in double capacity of escort ayah then consoled with reflection that be bare quarter of mile to serai along straight deserted high road even real miss sahiba might go so far alone unhurt so after pausing moment from force of habit to re light lantern ambled after charge a fast a old leg must carry suddenly heard noise such a have never heard before close behind horrid panting noise then something between bellow whistle turned saw red eye glaring at next instant infernal monster darted past whirring snorting in pursuit of course of elflida norma what tyranny be here what defiance of custom saw anyone ever like on decent metalled road only ayah god forgive lie wanting to make thing in order confused helpless thought ran swifter in old man mind that leg carried body a followed in pursuit of monster lantern swinging wildly hindered such light a there might have be without knew thing be ahead of by truly infernal smell left behind then from darkness ahead came curiously familiar cry hut hut get out of way oh damn crash followed then silence few second afterwards be gazing helplessly bewildered at two figure who be looking at other wrathfully across white streak of road one knew be elflida norma impromptu ball dress metamorphosed by race into loose white drapery out of small dark head slim throat with circlet of big blue bead rose a from cloud other unknown be that of tall fair young man if have only stood still latter be saying angrily must have managed dodged about like like eye have taken in by time paused in simile hers have wandered to monster prone in dust stepped closer to curiously suppose be named motor bicycle said coolly have not seen one in place before only in picture book be glad there be regret apology even iman khan when recovered breath made inquiry a to whether young man have hurt in getting out of miss sahiba way simply looked at wheel of bicycle then at stalwart young rider god have be kind sent husband in miraculous car ii iman khan sate in early dawn putting such polish a never before be put on pair of rather large size oxford shoe so far have gone well own vast experience aided by stranger complete ignorance of indian way have sufficed for much alexander alexander sahib twelve imans be praised for such name be now comfortably asleep in bastion opposite widow quarter under impression that hastily produced whisky soda with sand beef sandwich in case hunger have come on road simple clean bedding briefly luxury of night sleep after somewhat severe shaking be due to commercial instinct of good old chap in charge of usual rest house that being exactly what iman have desired a beginning sequel required thought a polished brain be full of plan for immediate future one thing be certain however quite certain husband god have sent in car must not be allowed to ride away on before seeing more of miss sahiba arrangement must be made a always have to be made in best family generally began with tennis party of course be out of question perhaps accident on road might be taken a equivalent for introduction then there be dance fool food picnic one might be considered a taken also others be out of season in heat of may there remained drive dinner possible required time therefore time must be have chota sahib must not ride away after breakfast a have settled on doing must monster be found fit for road now chota sahib seemed none worse for fall a iman in capacity of valet have have opportunity of judging inference therefore be obvious must be monster who be incapable iman gave finishing glisten to shoe placed decorously side by side ready to be taken in when appointed hour came for shaving water then went over looked at motor bicycle be accommodated in verandah did not pant smell now a if be alive for that looked horribly healthy strong be evidently not thing to be broken inadvertently by casual push then thought struck ambled off to old blacksmith who still lived in serai arcade boasted of past trade of mending spring shoeing horse selling to traveller own manufacture in way of wonderful soft iron pocket knife with endless blade corkscrew warranted to draw instead of cork ari bhai said iman mildly to worthy thou art prince of workman truly come see something beyond thy art in iron bapri bap warrant thou couldst not even guess at inner part must not tezoo smith thought otherwise being clever a well a voluble hit with fair correctness on pivot cog wheel such like inevitable of machinery result of interview being that iman armed with kitchen chopper bundle of skewer have subsequent tete tete with monster in latter came off second best so that when owner fortified by most magnificent breakfast served in verandah by reason of central room of bastion having absolutely unsafe roof went to overhaul metal steed be fairly surprised be verra remarkable occurrence said softly to a deft hand busied with nut screw for be scotch engineer on way to take up appointment a superintendent in canal workshop most remarkable must be fine example to old minister thesis accident be not chance there be just method in be absolutely uncanny in short even with smithy on premise of good old chap in charge spoke consolingly be clear must not start before evening if then not that mattered so much since have plenty of time in to join billet thus a smoked pipe question came at last for old matchmaker have be longing who must young lady be who smashed up last night in reply iman dragged in warm e stink sahib bahadur vast amount of extraneous matter out of own past experience regarding present however be distinctly selective without being actually untruthful late e stink sahib widow child for instance being also at rest in serai be equally under charge being so since there be one public room in dinner must possibly be served a must be served here iman made digression regarding right of sahib logue at large e stink sahib family in particular be possible that huzoor might meet fellow lodger miss sahiba again in fact iman must find more convenient if meal be eaten together at same time mem absence being one of eliminated truth must knew fall in with suggestion of statement again be absolutely true alec alexander lost in intricacy of piston rod acquiesced mechanically though in truth likelihood of seeing such remarkably pretty face again be not without usual unconscious charm to young man charm however became conscious hour afterwards when hard at work in smithy coat off sleeve rolled up showing milk white arm above tanned wrist looked up from bit of glowing iron on anvil saw large pair of blue eye large string of blue bead about almost childish throat struck that be a blue a sky inarching wide inarched square of old serai struck also that eye anyhow have more in common with sky than with house made with hand in stood even though dead king have built yes whole figure did not belong somehow to environment to litter of wasted forage ash of dead fire to desertion neglect of place having served purpose of night lodging have be left behind on road seemed worth more than gave nice toss did said elflida norma breaking in on quasi sentimental thought with certain complacency if have got out of way must have be more better mean if have got in mine replied grimly let quarrel about now mischief done so far a be concerned blue eye narrowed in eager interest have broken thing inside too asked sympathy absent pure curiosity present in tone did said shortly be not of kind break easily considered calmly from head to foot o o admitted sparingly suppose not arm look veree brittle like china suppose be from being so being so chicken white perhaps said still more shortly be relieved when iman having from cook room where be feverishly feathering fowl in preparation for night feast detected elflida flagrant breach of etiquette in having anything to do with coatless sahib hurried across to beguile charge back to path of propriety by reporting that lily baba to whom girl be devoted evinced determination to eat melon with brother iman be far too busy to frustrate need not make such pother about big dinner to night said viciously when with absolutely accommodating lily in arm stood watching far le interesting process of pounding forcemeat on curry stone for heard tell smith that must go evening if well if somebody kept temper in boiling oil queer idea a if anybody must old iman hand fell for instant from munadu maintenon cutlet be preparing for understood frail foundation on chance of manufacturing husband stood jullunder sahib must be making spring if oil in have to be boiled a cook knew something of property of hot fat felt convinced that spring must never be fried in time so that long hot day toiled slaved in company with anatomy of man whom have unearthed from city man who have also in youth served white blood have never risen beyond scullery man who called great artificer fanned charcoal fire indiscriminately according to need long hot day on other side of arcaded square work went on also so that clang of metal on anvil cook room fire rose in antagonism on dusty sunshine slept between dinner dinner spring spring circling dark shadow of kite above in blue sky be almost only other sign of life for elflida norma have found sleep easiest way of keeping lily baba from melon boy slept a slept always a sun set iman knew that fate have decided in favour of dinner for jullunder sahib came over from smithy with empty hand found hot water in room change of white raiment carried in knapsack laid out decorously on bed took hint dressed for dinner even to buttonhole of jasmine found beside hair brush elflida norma under similar supervision dressed also in fact everything be dressed including flat tin lid of saucepan iman have impressed into doing duty a side dish surrounded by castellated wall of rice paste supporting cannon ball of alternate spinach cochinealed potato really looked very fine so did iman starched to inconceivable stiffness of deportment so even did anatomy who promoted for once to dining room grinned at young man girl at great artificer work with usual indiscrimination in truth deserved grin yet elflida norma looked at alec alexander at at dinner table set out marvellously with great trail of common pumpkin vine looped with cheap silver tinsel indian bazaar provides felt sudden shyness of of other unwonted snowiness

perfunctorily apologising for impossibility of hice puddeen fateful cry came from next room elflida started to foot be lily began iman frowned into seat again turned to anatomy superbly go said with dignity bid ayah see to lily baba result however be unsatisfactory certain obstinacy grew to elflida small face finally blossomed into open rebellion burst of confidence see said blue eye of hers almost blinking a narrowed with earnestness smell guava be more hobby than melon even young man smiled who be lily asked sister suppose half sister replied solemnly will cry on see if be not let to come to place then let come why not be evil custom began iman a order be given knew graver blame than even for whole decalogue in ruin elflida norma stamped foot a have stamped in polka so have to

seemed almost level yet far near from foot of lover a sat close together to uncertain ending of visible world not straight line be to be seen everything showed in curve curve told unflinching tale of unseen circlings wrinkled ripple left by last wind upon sea of sand around waved over endless undulation of desert sparse tussock of coarse grass fell in fountain from own centre stunted thorn bush be coiled twisted on like tangled skein without clue faint track of sand rat partridge wound snake like in direction even footprint have brought two lover in present resting place held same hint of reference to unseen continuity for absorbed in love new world have wandered on aimlessly unheeding of old one at foot result stared in face now in firm yet undecided trail be by far most salient

critically to appraise perfection of poise to world where be made perhaps for look old doe wonder who paused becoming conscious that someone be standing behind jim forrester became conscious of fact also showed in such aggressive way that exclaimed hastily be angry with please must have be quite chance must have known be here even without plea must have be difficult for young englishman to refuse chance of explanation to figure have appeared so unexpectedly for though in outward accessory be only that of wandering goatherd there be calm dignity about claimed consideration fillet bound hair sun ripened to rich brown on wave curl be only knotted bit of goat hair string head encircled have youthful buoyancy such a greek sculptor gave to young apollo resemblance enhanced by statuesque fold of rough goat hair blanketing be sparsely draped over bare sinewy yet fine drawn frame face however be faintly aquiline eye deep set between prominent brow cheek bone have mingled fire softness in india so often redeems otherwise commonplace countenance be stalking bustard huzoor said goatherd frankly with flash of very white teeth being face down on sand yonder behind grass saw nothing till presence stood up glint of sun on something spoke to man eye be on girl golden crown of hair jim forrester suddenly broke arrow across knee threw fragment from into sand ripple hand over bow too said peremptorily then paused hullo where deuce did get that be very old oldest have seen with looped string too added handling curiously goatherd smiled presence be welcome to keep if like can get plenty

gave quick exclamation laid hasty surprised touch on lover arm be right jim said why did notice before stand out quite clear even rise round centring on unseen sun how very curious ask name jim so that father may be able to get hold of fancy if find buried city must be a good almost a gold coin though somehow make feel creepy gave faint shiver a spoke queen lady must not remain in wilderness when sun have set came in swift warning from goatherd there be fever fiend lurks in brings strange dream something almost of familiarity command in liquid yet vibrant voice made jim forrester frown again say shortly yes must get back grows quite cold girl looked half bewildered first to one then to other of two tall figure stood between fast fading light against still saw clearly that faint swelling domed blue shadow a of other world forcing way through crust of visible one so stood silent vaguely disturbed while few question necessary to identify man who answered be asked did not speak indeed until with face set on right path for camp civilisation generally paused on top of first sand rippled wave to look back shadowy dome be still there swelling towards vanished sun from side figure of young goatherd rose into darkening dust haze be calling to flock word of old time chant be clearly audible o seeker for life meat course be run come home with weary foot rest be so sweet what though one day be done have begun flock fold be one where long year meet hope told real name said suddenly ii dear child goose be swan so be poor mother before said father then eye grew dreamy perhaps over intricacy of new coin be classifying though in truth memory of young wife who have left alone with week old baby in day of youth have somehow come harder to during last few happier more home like year since daughter have returned to take mother place a mistress of house for girl be very like dead woman have brought father afternoon cup of tea to office tent cleared for brief recess of cloud of clerk witness who through wide canvas wing set open to let in air must be seen huddled in group among sparse shadow of stunted kikar tree amid camp be pitched must be heard also since in limited leisure at disposal be hubble hubbling away at hookah conscientiously noise in rhythmic intermittent insistency seemed like distant snore from sleepy desert of sand stretched away to horizon on side of course went on must hardly be expected to know though really dear have mother quickness of perception regarding people place mere fact of goatherd fellow giving name a khesroo admitting be low caste must have made doubt assertion confess have little hope for such knowledge a professed to have be generally in keeping of priesthood only jim be there mean mr forrester began father coughed uneasily because call personal assistant whom have known a child jim be reason dear queenie why must contract habit think poor mother must have liked besides though be able young man very much so indeed when grows older will make excellent officer mr forrester ahem made violent effort over name have genius for antiquity utterly fails for instance to realise far reaching importance for must of course alter whole chronology of graeco bactrian era of contention concerning what hausmann german school generally venture to designate post vicramaditya yet day feel sure gold coin of kapala give so exact description in bc with date under legend double profile on obverse will turn up then point will be settled even if live to see be fairly off on hobby have risen to pace tent hand behind back many time oft have listened to patiently almost eagerly for story of india golden age always fired imagination to day be thinking of other thing of engagement for one must break to sooner later so went up to tucked arm into coaxingly may father might be found day do know believe must give almost anything even daughter for ducat must absolute jest a be voice trembled over trivial word a voice often do unconsciously when fate mean to turn to own purpose smiled patted hand undoubtedly must dear nice a be one be likely to offer that exchange to begin with coin a simple unique must be worth fortune then there be fame think of philologist most of historian german fellow routed on own ground who know said then frown dimmed amusement in eye though ca understand added why man khesroo denied a say did having met jim mean yesterday ca be wrong man can mr forrester think be not can see for replied father returning to tea treasure for be still over in orderly tent have such trouble hunting out of jungle persuading to come here that said must keep overnight anyhow in case be wanted hour so afterwards therefore yellow legged constable escorted goatherd who have answered to name of khesroo into verandah of miss sahiba drawing room tent also be set wide to cool of desert evening easy chair low flower decked table strewn with book magazine struck curiously dissonant note from sounded by wilderness of sandy waste on side hemmed in little square of white winged camp with certain hungry emptiness be man jim said girl in undertone for father have come over from office be seated within reading daily paper camel post have just brought yet look different somehow so ill too did look ill with languid yet harassed air follows on malarial fever buoyancy of carriage be replaced by almost dejected air yet be unmistakably goatherd have met evening before who in obedience to sign squatted down midway a be between culture inside tent savagery without look a if have be having fever have asked girl abruptly for year of authority have made knowledgeable in such thing malika sahiba say right replied khesroo indifferently have have much long while back have yesterday day before be yesterday be put past by day yet here vague perplexity came to dulled yet anxious face a looked first at girl then apologetically at jim forrester what presence said about meeting be perhaps right after yes be right did see huzoor have remembered from graciousness of queen lady gold crown of hair young englishman frowned angrily work miracle in memory dear queenie said there be quite aggrieved tone in voice a turned shortly on speaker why on earth did tell truth before then old city suppose remember about too old city echoed khesroo doubtfully huzoor what must know about beyond what know that there be city that be lost such a know only what wise tell paused even to deprecation came half resigned self assertion yet have more chance than most seeing that mother be twice born be be put in hearer then looked round towards chief do hear that sir mother be brahmani may account for profile said morning puzzled in low caste man said be scythic in type so be be answer a speaker laid down paper came forward for further inspection so mother be twice born continued addressing goatherd child widow suppose khesroo stretched hand out finger wide spread in dignified assent suited better than former almost cringing humility huzoor yes people however did not find till be nigh six after of course be alone hush fell on group for to three listener who understood simple word told of common enough tragedy in india of life denied natural outlet of unworthy love of outraged pride of race followed by sure if slow revenge father who be kresroo shook head have one mother huzoor there be hush on girl voice rose clear with curious thrill in be very beautiful be not son be good looking fellow at rate remarked jim forrester coolly moving away took up newspaper conscious of certain irritation began to read latest report of wireless telegraphy with unsuspicious unquestioning assent of latter day reserve for marvel of matter only father having gone back to paper also girl goatherd be left alone midway between civilisation savagery huddled in coarse blanketing bare arm crossed over bare knee there be nothing distinctive unusual in khesroo figure behind background of shadowy desert be fast fading into shadowy sky except haggardness of aquiline face hollowness of dark eye struck stretched out hand to feel have fever now be quite cool shivered slightly at touch eye passing hers seemed to rest on plait of hair huzoor replied be thief fever be hard to catch smiled think quinine will manage shook head nothing catch robs of life at own time will leave none day spoke unconcernedly a if fact be beyond question then why do wear that amulet if be of use said pointing to little leathern bag such a wild tribe use for carrying of charm be tied round arm khesroo shook head again smiled time flash of white teeth must have removed doubt of identity have such doubt existed queen lady mistake said doe not contain charm be photongrar what echoed uncomprehending photongrar picture huzoor that sun hold always of thing have ever seen in world showed to memsahiba long ago when be little showed to mother mean photograph huzoor yes perhaps queen lady might care to see since be like mother a be before found perhaps be thought of what poor woman must have be like after finding made english girl feel vague oppression a took tight roll of paper that khesroo unfolded from piece of red rag be five huzoor said simply mother loved much small wonder be girl first thought a looked at sedate yet childish face half concealed by high turban have evidently be borrowed for occasion at quaint dignity of childish figure huddled into finery too large for holding flower in hand a if have be sceptre a looked startled expression came over face stood up hurried to father with appeal in voice oh father do look here how very curious photograph of khesroo when be child think mother must have taken for be almost sure there be one like in diary in volume gave to read other day because be camping through same country stay will fetch be back in moment with unclasped book in hand fluttered hastily through page sketch almost to end there cried suddenly be sure of father laid one photograph beside other jim forrester looking over shoulder curiously compared also be identical underneath one pasted into book woman hand have written son of king title fitted picture reminded girl of something in khesroo have struck yesterday be absent to day turned over page beyond be blank word be last in diary think remember something about now dear said father taking hand away from book gently may have be last took for be camping round here a assistant just before before be born be always taking child giving picture to mother not that remember that particular one see must be fifteen year ago at least nearer five twenty dear said softly a realised impotence of what world count a time to touch smallest thing once have be utter irrelevance of day week year in connection with single thought photograph before grew dim to eye fine feminine writing with verdict son of king became invisible so through tear saw only blurred indistinct wondering face of khesroo goatherd look said in sudden impulse sun must have held two picture of stared at duplicate stupidly did not steal began uneasily of course did replied smiling now be mother who took picture gave to yours be mem sahiba spoke of perhaps remember look almost of relief came to goatherd haggard anxious face yes perhaps slave remembers be why thought recollected graciousness of queen lady gold crown of hair will be slave did not lie to huzoor looked apologetically towards young englishman latter have once more aggrieved tone in voice a said shortly in english whether did did not doe much matter there be anything to be got out of apparently so perhaps have better tell orderly to take back to tent see that take quinine send a suppose will iii meant to tell yesterday jim said girl in undertone glancing with almost maternal solicitude at father who be writing within grey somewhat bald head shining out in light of lamp by be working against intense shadowy darkness of tent wall disappointment

with fever surely hear that in voice have better come back to tent let send someone to take into shelter look after for instant one spoke then seemed almost bodiless voice from desert broke silence

of reality time can not touch alter for instant only be conscious of instant might have be hour in suggestion of infinite experience then time claimed once more time triviality commonsense so that ten minute afterwards jim forrester having made preparation for tramp into desert be stooping to say good night to betrothed to assure of speedy return moon must rise in hour distance to place where have first met khesroo must not be over three mile must be back by midnight meanwhile must tell father have turned in if chose to sit up well a lip met lingeringly little breeze have wandered from desert shifted ripple two on sand wave about foot died away like sigh in fine fret of kikar tree above unseen tent iv be hour before dawn desert must scarcely have be stiller than camp in white moonlight white tent looked like shrouded city of dead forgotten yet unburied for here there out in moonlit open other flecked with fine shadow of kikar tree lay corpse like figure swathed in sheet a if waiting for graf there be sound sign of life not even where moonlight slanting through still wide set wing of drawing room tent showed fold of woman dress daintiness of high heeled shoe rest of figure be in shadow though light in last effort against darkness of tent claimed page of open book lay on sleeping girl lap turned one of into silver framing for photograph of child so vivid be light even fine feminine writing beneath showed in dead woman verdict son of king for girl have be pondering over strange chance have brought in turn within influence of nameless kingship when a waited for lover return have fallen asleep in chair yet a have sat there thinking watching have felt very wide awake indeed not with anxiety however have passed in fact a followed in mind what have gone before jim forrester quite prosaic start to walk three four mile into wilderness on moonlight night to be shown bearing of buried city possibly to be given proof positive that there be ruin beneath sand have be in grave doubt a to what have actually occurred have there be conflict have love jealousy hatred resolve risen up claimed surely not why indeed must be so though doubtless in in lover in goatherd there be something held a be in common yet have struggled to be individual separate have be most marked between young englishman goatherd unaccountable a be felt that in mysterious fundamental mind of hers two be associated indissolubly that stood towards on same plane nay more that be consciousness of kept calm overbore possibility of future danger memory of past conflict what harm must happen to son of king with son of king phrase have be on lip a fell asleep be on a awoke stood up suddenly open book sliding soundless from lap into soft sand phrase brought comfort with now have be asleep for long have lover returned be past midnight anxious question surged up through crust of calm before be half awake instinctively be outside tent in moment on way towards lover rapid foot shod in dainty high heeled slipper dimpling shifting sand coming dawn have sent cloud herald to west advanced pursuivant drifting across moon shadowed thing faintly seemed to increase silence called softly there be reply so looked in glance told that lover have not returned light stealing in through uplifted screen showed by travelling clock hung to tent pole that be already past three o'clock three what have happened what be to be done for instant ordinary inrush of anxiety made think of rousing camp of sending out search party next brought curious conviction that in case danger lay in seeking outside help certainty that in matter must stand alone in crisis whatever be there must be three alone if indeed there be three lover nameless son of king so almost without pause dimple left by rapid foot be curving towards highest sand wave within sight of camp thence must watch desert sea perhaps find even now close at hand once there next sand wave attracted a being better point of vantage so from wave to wave flitted in white dress like desert bird leaving behind curved track of dimple in sliding sand until little wind herald blast of hurrying cloud overhead crept low down over world swept dimple back into old ripple khesroo called suddenly for shadow seemed beside hers in empty wilderness there be answer jim called again uncertainly there be reply yet be not frightened knew now in mysterious fundamental mind of hers that alone be responsible that only must solve riddle khesroo have be right if wanted thing if have believed if have trusted must have gone before now must hurry must be too late wherefore for what scarcely considered khesroo called once more time there be faint inflection of fear in voice for be that figure khesroo goatherd be lover be someone only of whom have dreamt a son of king must go back wish struck keenly ignored went on must knew have left camp far behind if have kept right direction must soon be close on spot where straight line of arrow have startled by intrusion into dream of love if have kept surely have for behind east be faintly lightening with dawn yonder therefore in dark of heralding cloud have huddled upon western horizon must lie domed shadow of buried city khesroo cried instinctively very soul of speaking show to for sake of woman who died a woman die for life of love love of life show to then behind heard voice chanting a khesroo goatherd have chanted call of guidance for wanderer in desert yet word be different for be seeker for sleep arise rest be done go forth with weary eye to find prize in vain in vain to none will slumber have begun till from heart of one desire dy listening turned to look then realised that in searching must once more have circled back on own footstep for behind not before dark clear unmistakable domed shadow of lost city lay against lightening east on swelling side a khesroo have stood before stood again be rising sun turned fillet of knotted cord about head to gold dyed coarse blanketing to royal purple transformed wearer into perfect kingliness of buoyant youth beauty never knew only felt that something stronger than caught held clasped yet drew on so that with hand outstretched ran towards cry between smile tear son of king son of king next instant have tripped fallen heavily on face over tangled tuft of grass concealing unusually deep descent of desert wave a picked up confused somewhat dazed paused to free eye from sand grain clouded something almost at foot brought back to reality gave quick exclamation for in hollow beneath wave where have evidently sought shelter deliberately jim forrester lay curled up comfortably fast asleep at least so seemed though khesroo quaint old bow must surely make rather uncomfortable pillow stooped over sleeping man for instant face whitened bent lower to listen to breathing a listened couple of startled sand chaff fled from neighbouring thorn bush chuckling cry echoing over desert like evil laugh minute afterwards in answer to touch jim forrester be staring at trying to collect sleep scattered sens hullo said slowly how on earth did ah remember that brute of goatherd played garden as lost so after wandering about for hour turned in till daylight dearest dear started to foot a realised presence there held out hand to a did so something dropped from lay glittering on sand at foot be gold coin looked at other amazed then stooped picked up double profile said slowly holding so a to catch growing sunlight legend round spelt out from greek lettering 'basileus basileon ' date cried date yes date be there replied still more slowly turning to obverse bird date be all right be thinking of other what other basileus basileon 'the king of king said softly looked out towards sunrise light have claimed whole world sent shadow flying so happily prosaically went home to breakfast yet there be one thing never told anyone perhaps because might have stood in way of popular explanation of whole affair namely that khesroo have happened on coin must have put in jim forrester hand after latter fell asleep so not even when father proudly pointed out to admirer that double profile be that of man woman that latter curiously enough might almost be portrait of married daughter did ever say that when found husband asleep in sand morning looped bowstring of khesroo goatherd bow be loose about neck

be barren honour since be not one of there be many who make stipend out of unpaid post thin old finger trembled little eye lost faintly blue film age draw between real unreal whether mind reverted at once to hereditary enemy who be not mentioned in paper be doubtful felt to be honour in miserable day when moneylender have more chance of being elected to district council than gentleman of part to

in uniform on threshold of brine sahib verandah whither have repaired full of courteous acknowledgment to one whom recognised a being at bottom of appointment faint frown came to old face brine sahib broke to gently with graceful tact gained so much confidence government recognising many great excellency have found impossible to do otherwise than elevate to bench where must doubtless remain a be now best representative of hindu mahomedan feeling in district then tim o'brien made few remark about king emperor devoted service sent old hand out in swift stiff salute doubtless be shock to find equally honoured regarding in banco admitted instantly to that be better to sit next hereditary enemy than stinking scrivener mean moneylender so bikrama singh twirled grey moustache said be well

dissatisfied dimly uneasy mahomedan be fool remarked bikrama singh thoughtfully saw a quickly a did that truth lay with defendant lie with plaintiff by god truth admitted buktiyar khan grudgingly hindu be not such blockhead a deemed saw a quickly a did that lie be with plaintiff truth with defendant be almost intolerable be true hereditary enemy have agreed about something on god earth a time went on unanimity of opinion became most salient feature of newly constituted court agreed about everything of different race different religion something deeper in than surface variation coincided innate sense of justice fostered by fact that have be brought up in india of past that represented law moral maxim made judgment identical waste time babu jee broke in old bikrama singh on lengthy peroration of newly passed pleader eager to air eloquence word be idle when fact stare in face know be silent who talk know not a proverb hath be enough be satisfied wah wah assented buktiyar khan at once acquiescent regretful truly pleader jee thou hast said that before why say again if sugar kill why try poison be satisfied so be enough be more than enough for local bar went in body to tim o'brien complained that be not treated a lawyer must be treated a usual brine sahib met with sympathy be sympathy of inaction sincerely regret gentleman said softly that sufficient toime be not allowed to get word have at command off stomach beg pardon mind see judgment of bench be unfortunately quite sound 'd be watertight against full forensic flood of whole high court bar so see what divvle be to be done do did not in sober truth sense of equity in hereditary enemy be too strong for lawyer old men be honestly fulfilled with desire of punishing evil doer praising who did well such flimsy overlay a race tribe caste family creed did not touch agreement on thing necessary to salvation fact be rather pain grief to did not make treat other with le stately dignity cause to be one whit more friendly out of court sirdar bikrama singh went home to womenfolk railed a ever against neighbour khan buktiyar khan a rolled little opium pill betwixt finger thumb must do same thing in heart of heart knew that since judge must always be ignorant man between two wise one plaintiff defendant must be common ground in made view coincide meanwhile fame of collective wisdom grew litigant indignation at brevity increased amongst lawyer tim o'brien however when timid little commissioner showed numerously signed petition from local bar protesting against strictly non regulation curtailment of eloquence only smiled suavely get at right of case by congenital intuition sir high court have upheld judgment in few appeal pleader have cared to make so see what div mean sir see what be to be done do once again there be answer tim o'brien a dashed off here there to institute enquiry in obedience to cipher telegram came pouring in from calcutta by day by night felt comfort in knowing that one sub division of district at rate be being well administered for be troublous day for officer in charge someone somewhere have be unwise enough to take thumb mark of peripatetic preacher who be suspected of being anarchist be proved to be apostle of unrest be also unfortunately man not only of thumb mark of mark professor briefly in far away college so official who have ordered indignity in interest of public order be degraded thereinafter naturally began campaign of must be terrorism amongst schoolboy student of province shattered nerve of government by lord who

hereditary enemy held next sitting be confronted with lengthy police case against gang of boy whose age varied from ten to thirteen bikrama singh listened gravely to detail twirled grey moustache buktiyar khan also listened gravely stroked purple beard listened very patiently yet vague impatience came to old face then looked in other eye at last wisdom of heart found speech where be teacher of

o'brien exultantly when news be brought to have more spunk than have so now to get out of scrape did best be good deal law lie be against schoolmaster happened to be somebody nephew by marriage though there be ample evidence to prove that have misused position a government servant utmost favour tim o'brien must screw out of power be permission for offender to retire instead of being dismissed from honorary magistracy broke to old men with usual tact applauding between line for courage to surprise relief accepted position calmly better subordinate said le likely be to be always in agreement with

from miscreant back ye have there sahiban tim o'brien replied with conviction must not ' be god truth so old men sent in resignation not altogether regretfully for one thing unanimity of opinion have be disturbing old antagonism seemed more natural there matter must have ended unfortunately for did not to be brief tim o'brien be asked one day a district officer to sign warrant for arrest of sirdar bikrama singh khan buktiyar khan on charge of assault battery against head master jee who turned out to be sib to local bar there be reason to go into legal point of incident to tell of vain effort of tim o'brien to save whilom bench from last affront epidemic of case against magistrate have set in late one evening district officer started to ride over break news of coming arrest to hereditary enemy nagadrug stood on nearest scarp of sand so went there first found old sirdar looking rather frail engaged a usual in glaring out over arid field to shakingarh time tim o'brien tact did not avail for calm incredulous anger half dazed indignation took place must not be true what be rajput of rajput to be dragged to court at bidding of miserable hound whom have whipped rightly whipped have not brine sahib applauded act have not done right plural pronoun came out naturally be not false guree god basest creature did not law say so who teach false teaching who kill own soul let die why have

companionship in revolt old heart knew be certain of sympathy in ancient enmity utterly sickened at tragedy must not prevent district officer went tactfully a ever to shakingarh only to meet with even deeper indignation innocent though knew to be englishman positively writhed under contemptuous unsparing scorn of old pathan what be sirkar not strong enough to protect then let pack up bundle get out of hindustan let leave india problem to people northern folk who have harried bengal in past who god willing must harry again have brine sahib not heard saying who us public office to betray state

sit stitch if not come to claim freedom in thing when yellow baby have gone silence fell on desecrated little square of virtuous roof truly be hard after life time of patient propriety long year of

male head of family a guardian to leave to starve while made merry over poor pittance of pension granted to by government in consideration of race good service wonder then that khulasa sat helpless resorting for comfort to little rosary always carried that aftaba tear ran silently down withered cheek that lateefa sullen anger gave dangerous look to still handsome face so dangerous that fear pierced aftaba soft self pity at last making ask anxiously what be said to thee privately lateefa naught worse surely darkening of handsome face be not all anger now lateefa rose with bitter laugh nay spoke of 'fees for justice a if have aught to pay yet something must be done have done too much already came khulasa shaking voice if have trusted in lord instead of sending petition there must have be need for to tell lie if have waited lo have waited put in aftaba petition be new thing father made be not like 'bannisters strange men there be need for to explain what be to virtuous roof for at

niruheem returned virtuous one decorously only lateefa standing in corner felt that there be truth in word god might be clement in next world be far from merciful in yet be not fault of world be fair enough there be displaced brick in corner where stood profiting by temporary blindness of veiled companion did what have done several time on sly during past few week took advantage of brick hole tip toe to gain glimpse of outside world be veriest glimpse indeed of purpling shadowy roof huddled against flare of sunset sky dust haze through saw seemed golden halo of transfiguration in second have made choice must pay retaining fee for bare justice to own womanhood jewuni be right time have changed why must waste life clinging to old way when new freedom be within reach yet there be startled half frightened look in sunshine shadow of hazel eye a waited face towards wall till cool sound of pouring water have ceased be free to resume limited life limited indeed how strange limitation seemed in light of new decision brief minute of arrest due to old shamira entry into feminine cosmogony have curiously enough brought decision to other two woman for in truth jewuni story jewuni giggle at joke have be last straw to patience final goad rousing to action of in own way have be dreaming for long too felt that time be past for temporising for trimming sail to suit other opinion so khulasa khanum pallid high featured face be more like of one new dead than ever when shamira gone returned to work in truth have in few second died for ever to world work delicate from babyhood saintly from pure suffering joy have have small part even in desire resistance to pain have be always half hearted for what be even justice of man worth in comparison with justice of god naturally enough then jewuni tale of sorry jest have be more horror to than to of others making turn to hidden meaning of thwarted life for comfort retaining fee for justice must be paid where there be fear of miscarriage in meantime while tyranny of life lasted must work work to end for on work practically others lived in town hand must spin finer thread than old khulasa khanum very spinning jenny of bombay must not compete with ceaseless industry there still remained noble folk who clung to spider web muslin of old time so hand twirled faster more deftly rest be with god aftaba khanum on contrary have decided for world not a lateefa have done for world a be in latter day for world a ought to be a used to be have very different strain in from other two from khulasa in spirituality lateefa in emotionality aftaba even when thing be at worst smiled consoling roof generally with unexpected perhaps extravagant scrap of amusement mouthful of pillau concocted out of nothing to season dry bread dinner ridiculous toy made out of rubbish whereat laughed courtier born loved even old etiquette by instinct while keen wit must find clue of intrigue a deftly a finger must disentangle khulasa cobweb of three kept in closer touch with world with have not quarrelled despite injustice towards there be indeed certain uncle chiragh who still came to see only once twice year blue beard dodderer with twinkling eye still mellow voice who sometimes brought quail with spice so that aftaba might regale with one of best curry for be great cook so spur of jewuni retailed insult came a challenge to aftaba sense of propriety world might be diseased by novelty foundation be sure have be fool year to acquiesce in impersonal petition with purposeless stamp to instead of graceful tribute after older approved method true have once broached subject to jewuni have even gone so far a to bring out certain faded brocaded bag be greatest treasure produce therefrom medal two dozen more worn letter quaint old world information to reader that bearer futteh iman hassan be such such worthy person gold spangled record of thanks for service in mutiny intimation of one rissildar tez khan death in action latter have indeed be cause of aftaba loneliness even curious survival of friendly day gone never to return few english word in sprawling irresponsible boyish handwriting to say that self same tez khan knew whereabouts of living creature fit to shoot in whole countryside jewuni have scorned suggestion of sending to bigwig with say basket of aftaba famous pumpkin preserve since ala orange stuffed with rupee be out of question indeed have said succinctly keep till day of judgment lord may look at law will not for see be not even stamped without stamp be justice possible even then old aftaba have felt with dim obstinacy that be not law justice sought be favour favour such a great have to give in well ordered world so in turn came back to limitation of life with decision uncle chiragh have told week two before a luck must have that whole town be to be in uproar very next day over unveiling of statue of malika victoria anniversary of great day in heroic annals of defence of residency for by way that gold spangled gratitude have be given have be chosen a fitting for ceremonial ground be to be lit up firework let off special message sent to from queen while statue must be covered with offering must anything be more opportune for decorous presentation of retaining fee so next day while lateefa khanum stitched repenting not at yet still with flutter of heart khulasa khanum with odd flutter at heart also kept colour even from lip worked prayed aftaba used privacy of tiny kitchen for preparation of other thing than scanty dinner of herb meant loss of only silver bangle sold on sly through market woman who came morning be quite most valuable thing in house yet there be farthing two left by time pumpkin preserve covered with silver leaf lay in tinselled rush basket with precious brocaded bag on top market woman bribed to return for in afternoon have received generous douceur must surely ensure due delivery took time be tiring to boot so be nigh sunset when after sleep have taken almost unawares in little cook room aftaba came out again to limited life on roof a did so familiar tentative cough of shamira bhisti on round accompanied by squelching of water skin made step back into screening wall bismillah said wondering not to hear familiar greeting old shamira be staring helplessly at something have never seen before be old khulasa khanum must be dead said simply to aftaba horrified disbelief see sits with face unveiled be dead retaining fee have brought justice swiftly lateefa aftaba when realised emptiness of roof save for herself dead woman wondered if be sight of one who belonged to slipping downstairs from virtue that by terrible confirmation of wantonness have sent khulasa to seek to higher tribunal a for herself night when waiter have gone promising to return at dawn be left really alone for first time sat wondering what fate preserved pumpkin must bring then did something have never done in life before too used hole left by displaced brick to gain glimpse of world be doing honour to dead hero to queen for whom died a did so first rocket rose from unseen residency to commemorate brave defender set star of glory in high

appeal in eye wife veru be scarcely whisper heard with cry of joy caught in strong arm laid on ground tearing cloth aside sought for wound finding lip be on in second ah must kiss draw poison surely frantic love must avail eyelid closed there be sound only little quiver that felt through lip then beauty lay still beneath after time drew away from laid head upon lap so sat dazed thinking of jasmine wreath in dust of half heard whisper wife veru what there be none to come after said village worthy when fire of prema burning have died down to smouldering ember oldest man of clan in village have performed rite must have be duty of son then shook head wisely thinking that men of prem singh kind ran ill risk in next world without son to perform funeral obsequies especially nowadays when law prevented dutiful wife from ensuring husband safety salvation by burning on funeral pyre yea be ill world indeed in fostered virtue of woman have cared for cossetted might not avail to save man loved from pain of purgatory then drifted away full of surmise deep desire concerning headship of village mai sarsuti must not hold a widow though must hold land there be relation none so coast be clear for many claim sarsuti meanwhile have not clamoured a many indian widow doe even nowadays to be allowed to sacrifice for husband salvation have scarcely wept have on contrary spoken sternly to

vaguely that foot of idol have be of clay that with prem thing be possible poor wandering foot might yet have kept to straight path if oh prem prem have be fault be wronging then suddenly that recurring phrase recurred to once more footstep of dog footstep of dog be past midnight have day begun day of judgment surely then must see yea must prove be not true moon be just sinking a close wrapped in veil crept down to edge of nullah where burning ground lay gruesome place haunted by spirit of departed not to be ventured near after dark sarsuti have forgotten village lore have forgotten everything save deadly doubt yonder must be on point close to water for still almost mist like vapour lingered there sped past faintly lighted patch on hard baked soil told of other burning murmuring prayer for peace of dead soul so found beside little pile of dear ash breeze from coming dawn stirred sending grey flake two to meet prem whispered then a stooped to look whisper passed to cry oh prema prema lay there face down hand grovelling in still warm ember on there showed unmistakably footstep of dog moon sank so there be darkness for while then in far east horizon lightened bringing grey mystery to wide expanse of level world behind greyness came primrose dawn sun rising serene bright sent shaft of light to touch a lay then rose dusting dear ash from almost blistered hand crept back to wide courtyard where veru still slept worn out by sorrow stood watching asleep wondering at own blindness then touched on bosom wake cried in loud voice wake oh veru speak truth girl started

deserved for came of long line of virtuous loyal people so sarsuti with vera lived in seclusion befitted recent loss though according to custom still wore wife dress grew haggard a month went by small wonder said village matron when returned from occasional visit seeing that awaited fatherless child then one morning veru looking very worn frightened ill came to tell elder that son have be born to

money laid up in bank rich headman be always prop to village so wife went to congratulate new made mother be looking haggard still scarcely seemed to rejoice in great gift perhaps might come by bye
