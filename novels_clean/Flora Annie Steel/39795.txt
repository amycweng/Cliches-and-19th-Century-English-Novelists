deen went back to quarter over big entrance gate where warder waited on a if be prince pondered over dilemma in white heat of indignation be so selfish of shureef when god knew be few tear more le when man have deliberately cast away right to wailing dozen time over what shureef have said about first count be true what of others what right have to claim compensation for first injustice what right have even to claim commiseration for result of life have chosen yet doctor gave even ordered back to garden after day two with remark to native assistant surgeon that be case of candle of life having be burned at end might live year said critically give three month of course might drop down dead day might if only must before week be out thought shurruf longingly must save so much trouble for though whole truth must easily be shirked must scarcely be possible to deny relationship hush up own share in youthful escapade for there have be sufficient for to be dismissed by magistrate with reprimand for keeping bad company added to scandal of notorious criminal claiming kin to must militate against promotion if shureef must only drop down dead did very day before week be up be shot in

with duty poor devil said doctor musingly a finished necessary examination be fool to try if did run must have finished to certainty even excitement of being in fun might have killed without anything

be likely to want back same put in new yard doctor hand a drew up sheet finally lingered bit if if wanted to get outside may a well poor devil so in cool of evening shureef wrapped in white cloth be taken from solitary cell given into guardianship of god in sun baked patch of earth where be first to lie be desolate patch bare of everything save white efflorescence of salt showing a warder remarked cynically that be only fit for corps not even for dissented digger who with leg iron clanking discordantly lingered over task while shureef still white roll of cloth waited pleasure soil said be much harder than in old place if folk be to be dug up a well a buried not that must want expense of moving shureef whose name be byword here overseer portly figure showed in adjoining garden hurried on with work shurruf did not come over to grave however perhaps because be in demi toilet of loose muslin without turban in charge of little son pretty child of four whom obsequious gardener have presented with bunch of jasmine rose who after time becoming bored by father interest in spinach onion drifted on by to find something more attractive until came to stand wide eyed curious in mourner place at head of grave there stood silent watching proceeding keeping tight clutch on flower until hand from behind dragging back passionately sent shower of earth over edge on to shureef body have just be laid in last resting place sent also bunch of rose jasmine to lie close to shureef heart for child dropped in fright weep not prince cried warder thou shalt have again here one go down hand up shurruf overseer who with little son clutched up in arm stood now in mourner place face almost grey turned on man with curse let flower lie said there be plenty more in garden so without word left to fill up grave having done left shureef with flower on breast to guardianship of god there stayed month after month until year drew close to end shurruf deen stayed in gaol for after man whose place have hoped to get be allowed year extension of service perhaps be deferred hope told on overseer nerve certain be that passing month brought strange look of anxiety to face perhaps be that though have set aside much must not quite set aside thought of bunch of rose jasmine little son hand have thrown upon shureef breast something there be in mind without doubt made few week before guardianship of god must end before momentous question of promotion must be decided steal out more than once at night to shureef solitary grave a have stolen to solitary cell memory of still white roll of cloth with flower upon touched more closely than memory of listless figure letting wheat grain slip through idle finger why must have done so be hard to say fear have something to do with sheer superstition that when guardianship of god be over uncared for body might fall into keeping of devil torment love have part too love vague remorse born more of chance have made little son chief mourner than of sense of personal guilt plainly did not do to try escape tie of kindred altogether so by degree thought grew that must indeed be safer for shureef to pas into other guardianship before god ended have asked for nothing save that grave might be cooled by tear if must be compassed surely ought to be satisfied ought to forget everything else leave kindred in peace might be compassed with care shureef mother not own for have only be half brother be alive alive blind poor too since father stung by son disgrace have sent back to own people poor blind mother here be material ready to

whereupon doctor have smiled grimly said that in case of resurrection there be safety in extreme nevertheless be love of horror doubt made gathering round opening grave so large old woman sate in mourner place tear flowing already others however talked over probability told tale of former disinterment with cheerful realism while shurruf deen bustled backwards forward among elaborate arrangement dug down to one side of original grave after approved fashion so that there must be a little disturbance a possible when trace of what be sought showed in fold of still white shroud extra cloth be sent down in covering a exposed workman gradually swathed be mortal of dead dacoit hath not lost much weight said at rope a hauled so there task be done decently in order shurruf wanted something knew must still lie within brand new shroud ere lifted gruesome bundle to coffin awaiting stooped then stood up suddenly grey to very lip crushing something in hand something so seemed to

shahbash wallah bestowing praise where in doctor opinion none be deserved what right for instance have water carrier filling pot sweeper removing refuse to senseless commendation for performance of daily round common task especially when be so ill performed even in matter of punkah pulling subject on native might be credited with knowledge surgeon major pringle seethed with repressed resentment for day over intermittent pulse of office punkah finally in white heat of discomfort indignation burst out into verandah harangued coolie at length in fulness of western energy went so far a to show how to keep up regular even swing masterly grasp of till then untouched occupation not only satisfied also shahbash wallah who a usual be lounging about in verandah doing nothing so of course shahbash

least not to loaf about verandah fate be against fiat in moonless half of may driest of month hindu returning from hurdwar fell sick hour after report surgeon captain terence o'brien going out of ward with senior paused in cheerful whistling of belave if endearing young charm to say under breath cholera mild type now cholera matter of what type have ugly face when seen for first time especially when face look into wondering if mean life death have youth in eye so in dark night dhooli came into requisition with torch bearer until green blue yellow ward overflowed into verandah even pink post mortem claimed final share of boy not large one however since a terence o'brien said be wan of epidemic when ye must rightly say man have cholera till died of be bad enough however to make surgeon major who have never seen one before set to work when passed suddenly a have come to cipher out average tabulate treatment with view to what be called future guidance so a confided to assistant with great complacency became clear a daylight that largest percentage of recovery rapidity a natural corollary incidence of mildness in attack seemed in connection with position of cot close to door actually on verandah be most fortunate so be inclined to believe in value of current of fresh air fresh air be echoed terence with encouraging smile maybe maybe not god know may be anything in wide wurrld since there be wan thing can bet bottom dollar on in cholera sir be that ye ca tell anything about for certain that experience of wan epidemic wo be that of next neither doe experience mr o'brien retorted senior sarcastically militate against mine being more fortunate mean to leave stone unturned to arrive at reliable data on point appear to to have be overlooked for instance will begin by asking case of recovery if remember anything seemed at time to bring relief to stimulate in vitality be so essential to preserve in pursuance of plan went out then there to verandah where

seemed like a must ' so will in case of extreme nervous depression sir began junior mischievously counter irritant pshaw interrupted dr pringle angrily walked back with great dignity to office conversation thus started lingered among grey dressing gown result of comparing note being general verdict alley taw deserved that kicking did not actually get however boy be too big too small for sank into still greater disrepute becoming in truth that most unenviable of thing not made created begotten of idle wit garrison butt not that seemed to care much grew more furtive in lounging nothing seemed to disturb divine calm of commendation for world have created for with bravo boy bravo behold thing in be very good that at least be terence o'brien fanciful way of looking at position a went about work whistling belave if endearing young charm tune said cheered boy must often pause to smile at shahbash wallah after time however smile must change to quick narrowing of eye a if something in

look a if be gigantic bird flapping one wing in attempt to rise fly away from little hollow in stood be motley crowd indeed awaited fiat of dispenser of justice in fastness of central hill of india climbing rolling upward sweep of sandstone where ripple mark of tide built remains to tell of vanished sea have once covered dry thirsty land where water be for nine long month of year be curious

have be who must deny be not very caste name to distinguish from others ghatwal pas keeping one have have to keep long time because old god have decreed that son must be defeated by tigress cub might happen to best of pas keeping one since thing feminine be untrustworthy consequently nagdeo have have to go on beyond year of greatest activity until grandson reached here boy be now of age twenty than most taller a learned in jungle law with spear nimble to keep pas ready to be enrolled present old god before with subject old man word have returned to idiom of wilder tongue drew out of waistcloth little iron image of tiger not three inch long to salaamed reverently for be old god what be grandson name asked district officer be baghela tiger cub said nagdeo have seemed suitable name for one born six month after father have be found lying dead on top of dead tigress dead lip close to teat must suckle dead whelp more have be misfortune deplorable yet without shame due possibly to dead youth over soon marriage to thing feminine such thing being notoriously untrustworthy therefore have refrained from entangling one with such thing feminine more so because there be already sufficient of in house what with baghela mother grandmother briefly worship of two female thing be sufficient for lad without adding to adulation by third so in evening when magistrate legal work be over old man young one came up to tilted tent again after curious little oath of fealty to old god in shape of three inch tiger vow of war till death against live thing mimicked shape have be taken from grandfather dictation by baghela latter name be duly enrolled a hereditary guardian of jadusa pas two struck bee line towards home over low jungle a if belonged to a indeed did since few traveller save keeper of pass ventured to brave tiger dreaming in lair pacing trackless waste hungrily after dark old nagdeo be jubilant over mere chance of coming across one not that be likely since what tiger ever be whelped must dare to face grandson men here gave sidelong glance of pure adoration at baghela height who have back who if failed a even pas keeper must sometimes be found face up to sky face up to claw face up to teeth of course sometimes accursed brute who assumed shape of blessed budhal pen old god of god must out of sheer spite roll dead man over claw at back that also be without shame since dead men have choice so old man babbled on garrulously young one listened till reached little village at foot of pas moon have risen by time showed upright slab of sandstone clustering under wide spreading tamarind tree on outskirt slab marking graf of dead gone inhabitant be ready now for young girl to break pitcher cover emptiness with shard said old man pausing for second beside cluster of stone then raised hand spoke to unseen fear not slumberer who come to join hath scratch upon back be nunc dimittis after made way to low shingled stone hut covered with gourd stood on rising ground outside hamlet towards pas drank to excess from pure joy of nauseous spirit made by untrustworthy feminine out of wild berry then slept a sound a if be indeed with slumberer for question of due keeping of pas have be on old man nerve for month rain must be due ere long bringing doubt twinge of lumbago to grandfather back have of late made difficult indeed to keep pas open for traveller since to do that man must give beast rest must harry lair when be absent scare from road with strange noise ringing of bell if be obdurate face claw teeth now there be one to do one of true race yet by fiat of old god bigger than most ay with more personal enmity than most towards evil one who stole old god likeness for must not six unborn mouth of wrong of loss of grief anger count for something yes baghela must be keeper of pas indeed be old man thought a fell asleep dream a lay sound a slumberer baghela slept too badge of new office necklace of tiger claw round neck tasselled spear hung with jingling bell beside untrustworthy feminine mother grandmother still sate by ember of fire whispering fearfully for knew that six unborn mouth translated in way might mean something very different baghela however have suspicion of possibility set about new duty with immense amount of swagger least hint of marauding intruder about winding path led to fertile valley towards south must send through village with boastful jinglings of bell a luck must have that jingling seemed powerful for time towards keeping of pas nagdeo who now that necessity for presenting youthful appearance be over permitted seat amongst village elder certain stiffness of carriage generally used to boast of peace dogmatically such thing a news even of intruder so far on in season be unheard of in palmiest day have never be so fear compelling be six unborn mouth of hereditary hatred did doubt baghela thought so too a long a rain be slight a long a flock herd kept to upland only shepherd herdsman have tale to tell of loss then one day cloud broke in slanting shaft of almost solid rain water ran over rippled sandhills a if have be tide once more then sun shone for day at dusk everything yard two of shadow round baghela a patrolled path be blank nothingness blotting out even darkness with wet impenetrable vapour dulling even sound of bell deadening scent so neither tiger have instant warning be face to face in moment then baghela knew what unborn mouth have wrought in terror absolute uncontrollable seized on young strength knew nothing save desire to escape next instant felt hot vapour on back husky angry cough sent there that young strength of spent in cry like of untrustworthy thing feminine when have told of young husband death into mist fled feeling cold vapour in face hot behind until suddenly desperate atom of leaped forward from what lay behind fell none too soon for even a shot downward shadow shot over in mist something ripped bare back lightly a with greater impetus than shadow plunged into void second afterwards long drawn howl of rage spite rose upward through mist to meet baghela whimper a lay caught above sheer precipice by bush after while rose crept carefully up to verge then sate shivered at at inheritance of fear more than once hand sought that faint scratch upon back be not much not more than kitten might have made in play felt like brand by degree however began to think tiger must be lying dead at least helpless below rock must get down to leave mark of spear in mark of claw surge of shame swept through must go back unscathed one must have chance in dressing wound of seeing faint mark behind so next morning old nagdeo must scarcely contain for pride a sate among village elder boy have killed first tiger without scratch have brought home skin biggest seen for year true lad have found fight too hard be even now shivering shaking with ague that only proved how hard fight have be untrustworthy feminine be dosing so must be afoot again in day two then village must see that ere month be over naked child might go through pas alone in safety be not so baghela be true be well enough by day a dusk came on strong young limb always fell shivering shaking there be more room for quaking see in than in old nagdeo must explain elaborately to crony a held out arm with inaction sudden cessation of imperious effort began to show age clearly one must pay for size strength courage there be harm done a yet mimicking devil have lesson when killed champion without scratch harm came in time party of salt carrier taking advantage of break in rain arrived at village carrying extra load body of man killed by tiger half eaten by jackal ague ague sonling said old nagdeo almost coaxingly to lad hour after appearance of grim visitor thy bell must be heard in pas to night will be sufficient considering lesson thou hast taught beast thou art strong enough for ringing of bell thou canst return afterwards to shiver shake sonling since thou art not of to do in pas old man chuckle at little joke be tenderly triumphant when have gone untrustworthy feminine alone remained baghela turned with sob to mother who crouched beside hid face in clothes a if have be hurt child mother cried got from thee yes heart of heart answered passionately from thy murdered father too have not told thee so often a for old man see since have come upon shivering be no longer refuge go there be need to ring bell need to go farther than little cave old man fails fast will not live long then when be dead old tale will be told can tell new one like other folk why even now see there be need for traveller to cross pas let take 'rail huzoors have made old world talk be foolishness yesterday bread have be eaten water drunk 't be time for new dinner be more than month after one sitting on village dais underneath tamarind tree in sight of slumberer in trying to use betel cutter said carelessly hath grown rusty like baghela bell nagdeo turned on speaker like lightning that month have left curiously aged with wistful anxious expectancy on old face though when more than once folk have commented on changed look asked what ailed have only replied almost apologetically death lingers be time be with slumberer since baghela keep pas a father did now old voice rose haughtily like thy wit rather canst not see that youth hath be overbrave mimicking devil will not face bell who can kill foe keep distance if bell ring not be not in hope to lure coward close to take unawares argument came swiftly a if have be rehearsed before rehearsed without audience yet when old nagdeo moved off a if in displeasure hand crept out towards stone marked slumberer eye sought almost pitifully that night after baghela have gone on round after untrustworthy feminine have slothfully sought bed old keeper of pas crept out in rear of young one spear in hand yet without jingle since what need be there for two set two where

lad back paused spear from behind reached to struck sideways next instant challenge echoed through pas be accepted shadow grew short showed paler till two green light flashed out with roar rolled among rock tiger faced crouched sprang old nagdeo vanished youth returning for space sprang too watching that other spring so spear in hand found close to striped skin of base usurper of old god shape into with force possessed drove weapon point baghela with thought flight felt full force of mighty claw on back fell perhaps neck be broken anyhow lay still heedless of piteous cry followed face keeper of pas face teeth face claw ere thou seekest slumberer yet entreaty be not utterly disregarded since baghela dead that keepership passed again to one whose face faced old enemy bravely that face however have triumph of victory in when nagdeo stooped over grandson body turned scored back to be hidden by mother earth there be mark anywhere else not scratch at rate must not be must be remedied before villager saw before even sun saw for be not budhal pen old god sun god also so drew lad body deliberately within reach of mighty claw used slack a be in newly come death for purpose

be so then be best to settle before dawn when folk might come prying bent curiously over dead lad then laid hand on dead heart go keeper of pas to slumberer without fear nagdeo will punish intruder hour after stood silently in hut beside still sleeping wife old woman blind deaf near end a be scarcely stirred a drove spear through heart doubt thee not naole said inwardly unless devil wronged thee

remarked doctor thoughtlessly whereat frowned charm charm boy be certainly worse next morning that despite fact that bisram who have steadily refused to go further than verandah have spent night huddled up outside threshold within mistress refused to allow to come needed rest said though must not compel to take must at least not work have better let have own way to night said doctor at

crouched beside with clasped hand hanging over knee dark eye staring hard into darkness a if waiting listening so sate clasped hand loosening eye growing softer a hour passed bringing nothing half conscious sleep half conscious wakening to child until suddenly irrelevantly just on border land of night day fretful wail rose upon silence loudly insistently where be noose bisra want o bisram bearer bring noose strangle something slackness dreaminess left man hand eye stood up blindly desperately to face last word word for have be listening yet there be still same pathetic self control a stretched hand out over sleeping child lo kali ma muttered have not served thee a ever despite child have set before thee nay thou knowest have risked life to have thy tale of offering complete when be hindered thou didst not suffer wilt not wait for once wilt not wait one little while voice sinking in entreaty ended in silence only for second then fretful wail began again noose bisra be not

sleep in peace there be sound in room after save little contented sigh in restlessness find rest outside shiver of cicala seemed to count second inside hour seemed to pas unnoticed a bisra sate beside cot hand listless eye dreamy there be nothing to wait for now nothing to fear that have to come have come so with first glint of light stealthy step glided in anxious voice whispered how be with child bisra be well whispered back rising rather stiffly hath slept since darkest hour will sleep on mother peering carefully for glimpse of child face smiled at what saw sleep indeed thou hast done well bisra made answer ere left room night watch being over paused to touch foot rail of cot with hand so salaam a do who leave presence sonny be still sleeping when father entering study with lighter heart found stranger a thought awaiting there be man naked save for waistcloth lean sinewy lithe head be clean shaven save for brahminical tuft face be disfigured by weird caste mark of extreme fanaticism who began shrinking involuntarily from one who might well be dangerous be bisra huzoor said familiar voice gently bisra child bearer bisra servant of kali also lo here be noose a spoke held out crimson scarlet handkerchief twisted to rope coiled in curved palm like snake master being learned will know noose meaning hath brought many blood offering huzoor many many year without fail will not fail year will bring blood of servant blood of bisram strangler bisram strangler echoed magistrate stupidly a even monotonous voice ceased then sate down helplessly in chair in truth knew too much of mystery of india to be quite incredulous yet two hour after when with help of police officer have be cross questioning bisra upon confession told a helplessly that be incredible man must be mad have be born to strangle said have strangled to keep kali ma content be necessary when be born servant especially when have child perhaps have let little shelter of world creep too close to heart though have striven to be just at rate kali ma have become jealous have not known at first must never have given mistress promise about noose for if have be in harry sahib hand devi must never have sought life always protected with noose never came to harm unless have paused there then asked quickly if have not said enough did want to tell more must not give name of victim of course not knowing be many very many there be nothing against own story said magistrate fighting against growing conviction that man spoke truth ca commit to session on there be something more think replied police officer reluctantly remember that man who be found dead in railway carriage about time last year have up country ticket on a be out of beat of strangler inquiry be made here be just about time bisram say be in hurry because year be nearly up have be nursing boy boy father leaning with head on hand groaned bisra be quite cheerful looked little anxious however when two day after be brought up formally to be committed for trial there be still nothing definite against save own confession coincidence of strangled man in railway carriage opinion be dead against amongst countryman of course be one of kali strangler did not look one be not born one so how must help being one argument brought consolation to sonny father bisram again be cheerful stood patiently between two yellow legged policeman told tale at length a if anxious to incriminate a much a possible anxious that there must be mistake when mysterious intricacy of charge paper be over two policeman nudged to make place for other criminal with friendly come along brother paused moment with handcuffed petitioning hand to ask how soon be to be hanged magistrate leaning head on hand made answer knew what question meant must not thought of little son came between truth namely that bisra sacrifice must wait law pleasure doctor too in charge of gaol where bisra awaited trial have not heart to tell truth day when on round looked into cell like wild beast cage where bisra being strangler therefore dangerous to life be confined alone answered question tall naked figure stood up at entrance to ask in same word harry sahib be better a for hanging must come soon enough never fear yet day pathetic self controlled eagerness on man face struck with sense of physical pain left helpless before own pity until day came after not many day when with face sad from sight of bitter grief that must understand sense of absolute helplessness before mystery of man nature made doctor feel inclined to throw pity to wind fall back on sheer common sense after man be murderer if have be fond of child what then such criminal be often men of strong affection yet once again sight of submissive salaaming figure sound of wistful yet calm voice made answer a usual child be better hanging must doubtless come ere long for once however bisram did not accept reply a final huzoor mean that will not come today asked quietly doctor raised eyebrow to day what made think of to day certainly not there be chance of be wrong two hour afterwards gaol overseer sent for in hurry because bisram have completed sacrifice by strangling in cell with waistcloth what else must do seeing that be last day of year during propitiation of sacrifice kept kali ma from revenge poor devil said doctor a stood up after useless examination be glad now did

presumably mental condition be similar whereas have to spend three week preceding irrevocable step in jungle station where novelty must necessarily be attractive spent in environment gave endless opportunity of seeing other men comparing with ideal result being that found be in love with one else being frank honourable told truth with kind of blank dismay did not offer to fulfil engagement how

christmas did take care of yes answered colonel quietly brought offering gold frankincense myrrh surabhi famine tale be only cow be thing wife child earth heaven to old gopal brahmin who owned apart from estimation have value connoisseur in village a looked over low mud wall separated slip of open courtyard ten foot by six where there be just room for crazy four legged string bed between surabhi manger door must nod say must have be good cow when young when be only god knew whereupon gopal must raise shaven head with faint frosting of silver hair from surabhi silver flank a squatted holding brass lotah in one hand milking with other smile scornfully old young be best milker in village best looking one best bred must say wherefore not be not surabhi great milk mother whom even god worship since without where must little godlings be then must pop down lotah cease milking for moment so that hand might be free for reverential salaam to old cow who at cessation must turn mild white face real brahmini zebu face with wide dewy black nostril wide dewy black eye long lopping ear to see what have come to old gopi a often a not must give round frosted black poll lick round with black frosted tongue by way of encouragement to go on a if have be calf connoisseur over wall must snigger touch forehead say that gopal da be getting quite childish mixed up thing though doubt great surabhi must have be just such cow since old man said right there be not like in village not even now that govinda have brought home brown cow with five teat have taken prize at huzoor big show be younger of course surabhi must outlast old man what more must want then who before latter day have ever heard tell of brown cow a for five teat might portend more milk be lawful so long limbed whole hearted dull headed villager went doubtfully about business scarcely le confused than old gopi between fact fancy reality unreality tied bound a like be in hamlet village by allegory of faith whose inner teaching have be forgotten old gopal stayed with surabhi life be bounded by how lived be one of many mystery of indian village life did nothing look after cow must have inherited fractional share of village land from father be entitled by reason of race to ancestral due for twice year at harvest time must come back to courtyard like squirrel to nest with so many handful of grain so many handful of so many bundle of wheat straw millet stalk pea stem on milk gave surabhi lived contentedly be very old if have have wife child in past have quite forgotten yet be typical of village life that one forgot old gopi right be due to from well unwatered land even if be only so many leaf of tobacco chili pod came to courtyard a regularly a sunshine regularly a sunshine too old man after have milked surabhi in early dawn must go with solitary blanket little spud spend whole day till sunset in gathering succulent weed for great milk mother supper be religion under broad blue sky edging plantigrade path over parched plain leaving like locust not green leaf behind old gopi mind must be full of confused piety mystical meaning be highest service of man be faith hope charity combined since one knew surabhi be world mother without here old brahmin memory of word must fail must fall back on deed by digging at biggest weed within reach from year end to year end seldom fingered coin if did be surabhi who brought to last calf have long since become ox drifted away from village to fill gap in great company of ploughers martyr who give coffer of empire gold die in thousand long before famine touch humanity without penny piece from coffer being spent to save from starvation yet still after fashion of race gave milk to spare latter went a rule to folk poorer still than old brahmin especially to child when sold part of money be always spent on new charm for surabhi neck might be noted that whenever by looking over old mud wall separated village courtyard one from other found that govinda brown cow have fresh bell disposition of cowry round neck there be always enough milk over above gopi want next day to procure similar adornment for white one with heavy dewlap rivalry grew by degree into definite challenge between owner so that when after time govinda beast fell off in milk gopi delight be palpable scouted reasonable explanation of fact cow said be underbred must see by hoof that have be accustomed to wander about pick up own living like low caste folk while surabhi bore token of lifelong seclusion in polished ring of long pointed black toe before question at issue must be decided that came about dried up cow in village made even old gopi brass lotah cease to brim there be rain even in december january though sky be dappled a partridge breast cloud carried moisture elsewhere where did not affect villager be not here be knew autumn crop mean fodder have be scant one cattle be thrown entirely on still scantier growth of grass in waste land when failed custom did not fail herd be driven forth from thorn enclosure morning to wilderness taken back from at eve just a if wilderness be still grazing ground what else must be done seeing that when cattle starve be not famine be time when help be given by new master god know why since old master never gave such time of help must come of course ere long if cloud remained dry meanwhile flock herd went out to graze on mud if failed to return in evening what else be to be expected so long dry day dragged on spring harvest old gopal share of garnered grain be scarcely worth bringing home squirrel hoard in little courtyard be scanty indeed very soon have to stint own share rise hour earlier to go weed grubbing return hour later so that surabhi must not low discontent at short common for must be shame unutterable even though brown cow have long since be driven from high class seclusion to fend for with common herd from dawn to eve thus old gopal lank anatomy be appreciably more lank more skeleton like when one day headman of village a smoked pipe in front of house of faith where stranger be lodged announced that famine have really come at last over in chotia aluwala there be pile of basket spade huzoors be there in white tent so doubtless ere long god know why must begin digging earth from one place putting in so that distribution of grain must be made in evening be headman idea of relief work hearer have other now chotia aluwala be ten mile at least from surabhi stall of late gopi have scarce found weed within twice distance so very next day when backed by pile of forlorn looking earth on one side not much smaller pile of basket with earth have during day toil be conveyed to present resting place one hungry face after came up in file to distribution of food old gopi frosted head be among number be bitterly disappointed at dole of cooked dough cake have expected grain though more than enough for old appetite what must surabhi with seven stomach say to such concentrated food after long trudge home passed miserable night seeking by mean in power to supply bulk necessary for satisfying of clamorous stomach even chopped up grass twine of string bed tempted old cow to chew by soaking fibre in of own milk thus once more came off second best for milk must have be share so must scarcely manage to stagger along with basket next day not that mattered for already englishman who in khaki clothes huge pith helmet be supervising work be saying tentatively with glance at totterer that might have be better to start relief little sooner down in one hollow gopi saw woman being carried away while babe have be at breast yelled feebly in orderly arm sight did not affect gopi in least have thought out plan filled confused old soul with heavenly joy so when two dough cake be given that evening hurried off with to contractor in background through whom huzoors have arranged for supply exchanged at loss inevitably for coarse husk bran sweeping absolute waste must not be used even in famine bread arrangement suited party contractor old gopi who day after day trudged home hungry with bulky bundle of fodder for surabhi be fair exchange round even with old cow who turned fodder into milk not much be true since bundle be not over large enough to keep gopi soul body together soul grew if body wasted how must be otherwise when one be permitted to be babe suckling a be of great milk mother great world mother whose sacred work be to nourish thing even little godlings old brahmin eye grew softer more trustful more like eye of child a day went by a milked surabhi black frothed tongue often licked more than shaven poll a if be concerned at bone showed through skin of calf gopal however took licking a mark of divine favour a for thinness be not babe suckling growing thin be true englishman in head charge of chotia aluwala relief work canal have that thinness on conscience what must man do in wilderness without mother without milk have on heart too because be father because despite mother milk doctor dosing galore be not two month since have seen first born waste away mysteriously to death a child will waste so mind be full of when for sake of seeing lonely wife mother rode forty mile after to little bungalow so empty of child voice have got quite nursery of 'em now said grimly beat ca get men in charge to mix that tin milk stuff right know little beggar wo look at teaspoon perhaps be ride have tired anyhow crossed hand on table laid head on wearily roused however at touch on shoulder let come said have have nothing to do here looked at for moment then turned eye away will said in odd voice that will be awfully jolly so in day two armed with dead baby bottle feeding cup god know what such mother lore a dead child have taught be at work in white tent set in shade of only tree at chotia aluwala must have more milk said decidedly there be new light in eye new tone in voice when brought yet whimpering black baby be end of by hook by crook must have more milk there must be somewhere send out see so because when woman be standing between death child order be order of who must be obeyed sent of course one of first discovery made by native underling to whom inquiry be entrusted be surabhi in other word that old brahmin in receipt actually of relief be possessor of remarkably fine cow if not in full milk yet capable of supporting infant two need vicious flair of underpaid chuprassi to find such chance for tyranny extortion at first throw off one be found when gopi returned that evening to little courtyard official with brass lotah be waiting for milk must be paid for of course by by gopi must keep account sirkar doubt must pay provided proper official certified by countersign old man be too confused too tired to be ready with protest at moment notice so that night went supperless to bed in white tent over at chotia aluwala englishwoman pale face have quite colour in fancy said two whole quart of most beautiful rich milk must reward that man if be hubby be to have same day mean four life at least possibly for baby take le to keep alive than old man small tragedy of sort be common enough in india be difficult to give fineness of detail to english eye old gopal be at once cunning a fox guileless a child through guile innocence ran that bewildered belief in surabhi a something beyond ordinary cow tried to escape impasse by not milking dry so a to leave for though surabhi resented other hand finishing task be impossible for experienced onlooker to be deceived result of therefore be abuse blow then tried keeping back one dough cake from daily dole for only exchanging other for fodder reduced milk in reality also reduced surabhi to lowing sense of sin in consequence became so acute that be forced into going back to old plan tactic have by time roused petty official ire mem sahiba have spoken sharply to because milk have fallen off in quantity quality for have not scrupled despite old gopi tear distracted prayer to take away milk mother character by filling up measure with water so lost patience thus one day avenged attained object by first reporting gopi brahmin be wrongfully fraudulently obtaining relief seeing that be amongst other thing possessor of remarkably fine cow whose milk be selling to huzoors then seizing surabhi on ground that gopi having mean of supporting be not fit to take care of so valuable animal two blow followed by sight of surabhi being walked off on dainty toe into rough outside world quite upset frail balance of old man mind crouched shivering night in empty stall feeling accursed be not worthy surabhi have gone how long remained there speechless famine stricken yet not hungry did not know be early afternoon when white garment brass badge of authority showed again at door in low wall voice said sullenly thou must come thy cursed cow be devil for kicking mem be fiend for temper badge be gone if thou come not pony will carry two sun be showing red behind great pile of earth in wide level plain rose like range of hill when oddly assorted pair rode into shade of chotia aluwala tree there be need to announce arrival surabhi declared who one be almost ere stumbled to ground stiff dazed bewildered more bewildered for vision of something undreamt of unseen hitherto in gopal da ignorant village life woman fair a milk smiling at gladly calling with quaint strange accent quick quick wait be hungry be not baby there be dark toddler round white dress dark head on white bosom old gopi muttered something about milk mother world mother a with brass vessel one thrust into hand squatted down beside surabhi scarcely needed to milk perhaps be a well for be very tired lotah brimmed have to be called for while surabhi black frosted tongue licked black frosted head between moo of satisfaction beyond in shadiest part of shade there be more satisfaction to spare after while old gopi crept stiffly to watch squatting in dust with dry bright wistful eye fixed on bottle baby above on milk white face full of smile until suddenly gave little cry too mother of mercy great milk mother of world too said like child so fell forward insensible with outstretched petitioning hand be end of trouble when came to great milk mother be feeding with teaspoon when recovered strength must let out of nursery for by time whole story have be told with curious calm acquiescence of villager in such pitiful tale of mistake wrong one have known truth of course what then huzoors wanted milk for baby gopi be old be only baby interrupted woman voice indignantly when explanation be being given why morning made a happy a king by letting suck one of bottle said that there be nothing left now to be desired nothing wanting except except what asked man voice that must see little godlings like like then there be silence on old salt road after discussion on certain story told by grey man have reached dissolution point from sheer want of coherence observed that major though still standing in usual place by fire be looking into ember instead of warming coat tail at fact expression of face convinced that have forgotten present in past experience major remembers story remarked aloud looked up with smile must have very transparent face said be quite true have be wondering if ought not to tell something happened to one to in fact great many year ago seems to that ought see most of be inclined to scoff at story have just heard unwilling to allow anything rational explanation of mysterious summons be not simply because happen to have have certain experience most of have not have question therefore arises a to whether be not bound to give evidence so perhaps prevent from forming hasty judgment looked inquiringly round room one spoke be so much accustomed to accept major decision a above thing equitable that be content to let arrive at one unbiassed by view during pause followed found thinking that weight for weight inch for inch brain for brain knew man who have made better use of life than major not over clever certainly not handsome handicapped heavily by having to start at scratch in worldly matter have distinct personality of own influenced society entered felt somehow that estimate of society rose from presence that brought element of sound healthy strength of heart mind into melee must not willingly spare from struggle for existence came to have not be there world must have be worse for absence high praise indeed for man yes continued major after pause will have to tell tale like ancient mariner if in so doing bore with few uninteresting confidence about ca help will have a little of a possible be so long settling in chair pulling up trouser in careful economical way poking fire that attention have begun to waver when opening word startled into renewed curiosity suppose began that of know be widower be wife died year after marriage child too girl if search whole wide world through wo find more desolate creature than boy of two twenty coming back alone in strange country from grave of wife child perhaps a rudyard kipling say have business to have wife child anyhow feel mistake somewhere in universe when try to behave like man in little drawing room made so pretty twopenny halfpenny fan put up to hide bare wall little dodge to make stick of furniture look nice seemed to so clever over have laughed so often unused basket thing done up with lace frill over be so happy that last evening while sate by wondering if must be true that child must lie amongst dainty furbelow well suppose have to be sometimes drove mad be like boy in of kipling tale must think of nothing death to end just to creep away die by somewhere did not want so much to be dead to be quite alone by see have lost everything for ever rest of stupid world drove wild with impatience so went out on leave to old salt road ran right across loneliest part of district perhaps of know what salt road be simply custom line in old day used to be patrolled day night in order to prevent smuggling cactus hedge have be cut down when protection system be given up road behind be still passable patrol house more le dilapidated stood at interval of ten twelve mile have seen of when out on shooting expedition remembrance of desolation came back on now with new sort of fascination after settled to go used to lie awake wondering of must be place not first be within hail of other people help besides must not so soon get rid of servant whom have to take with in order to avoid suspicion plan be to send man on early with order to do two stage have everything ready for at night in bungalow number three then must have day to must be bungalow number two at noon wondered a there be five patrol house in must most likely be two four if liked of others better must easily find excuse for getting rid of servant may seem unnatural be really quite mad with sort of rage spite against everything everybody so utterly absorbed in felt a if be taking revenge on life by quitting own pain being axis of universe world must surely be loser by removal in fact mental position at time might be fairly represented by of man quitting pleasant society because one have be rude to have hope of bettering condition simply wanted to show resentment believe ever slept sounder in life than on first night after leaving cantonment perhaps be change remember being disappointed disgusted with when woke to find broad daylight streaming in through broken window of number one servant according to order have started at dawn for weather be still hot enough to make early marching necessary have however left bottle of cold tea provision ate with appetite now come curious thing though have quite made up mind to face death danger might bring positively hesitated about starting for ten mile walk in sun from fear of heat apoplexy be very unreasonable show force of habit after have decided on remaining where be till evening walked round tumble down mud building wondering if must do for final tableau did not please so lay down slept feeling ought really to have remained awake brooded over grief unconquerable drowsiness be upon making sleep like child how well remember ten mile walk to next bungalow afternoon shadow lengthened across half effaced road a tramped along in solitary silence have nothing with save revolver small writing case with to inscribe last word of defiance thought be full of what must be for have now quite made up mind that bungalow number two be to be place that very short time must rid of foe felt distinctly easier than have done before being a be wound up to tragedy pitch cheerful appearance of number two a came up to in sunset disappointed in cutting down thorn cactus hedge have a usual left kikar bush have grown into tree forming avenue while few more shaded house be also far le dilapidated than number one not only be door window intact at few of still hung usual reed blind chick a wandered round house before entering noticed what one might call graf of garden broken mound of earth giving reminiscence of walk bed with here there globe amaranth doing chief mourner evidently bungalow number two have be permanent residence of patrol annoyed to find wondering if have have wife child so hastily entered centre room determined to put end to useless sympathy without delay to surprise contained few half broken stick of furniture telling that must make last task easier laid revolver on table taking out case sat down to write again felt curiously drowsy more than once rested head on hand rubbed eye in endeavour to collect thought sudden increase of light in room visible even through shading finger made look up chick be turned aside holding back with one chubby hand stood little child about three year old think without exception loveliest little girl ever saw great mischievous brown eye fluffy curl of pale gold turn black in after year raised hand from door jamb placed finger to lip brimming over with laughter ma ma teep dot 'un away ' such ripple of voice musical with happiness be always

b'aave girl dada say so spoke more to herself than to word be evidently formula well known often repeated 'who be dada ' asked feeling first curiosity have have power to touch for many day dot have raised to level of table with tiny hand now stood on tiptoe opposite fair curl framed face a laughing brown eye fixed on revolver be ' said coaxingly 'dot want to make puff puff boom ' childish word evoked quick horror why can not tell sudden vision of a must be in lonely room after dull report rose up blinded somehow coaxing babyish phrase filled with awful revulsion of feeling head sank into hand when raised child have gone went into verandah uncertain what to do room next mine have chick also so that must not see in from outside from within came low crooning song like lullaby now again little burst of child voice dot doubt recaptured soothed to sleep be evident that bungalow be occupied by others beside for in gathering dusk thought saw white form flitting about servant quarter wondered faintly at latter for have half recollection of noticing that hut be entirely in ruin mind however have now reverted to original purpose with increased strength returned to room considering what have best be done child word 'dot be not af'aid dot want to make puff puff boom ' must not keep out of head after be not only way of phrasing own desire be not afraid not afraid of what amid questioning one thing be certain must not be bungalow number two must not frighten child ah must not frighten dot for ever with awful puff puff boom have set to make must therefore be number four so packed up writing thing set off to rejoin servant at number three how childish be a trudged along caught smiling more than once over recollection of dot mischievous face at door servant be patiently

have settled on number four so there be nothing to worry hustle about bade call early determined time to have day to myself then fell asleep to dream night long of dot revolver indeed thought be so full of even when woke fancied more than once heard voice in verandah though knew must only be trick of fancy for bungalow be perfect wreck even room occupied have roof must have be about eleven o'clock ere reached number four stood off road little be much smaller than of other bungalow indeed consisted of two room opening one into other looked very picture of desolation planted square in open with single kikar tree struggling for life in one corner of enclosure yet be best preserved of patrol house perhaps because of smaller size greater compactness anyhow needed little to fit for habitation a found out afterwards be constantly used by civil officer when on tour of inspection at time however be surprised to find sign of recent occupation about in shape of earthen pot half burnt stick in mud fireplace going into outer room found contained like number two few bit of furniture feeling weary sat down by table without looking into other room only portion of be visible through half closed door once more laid revolver beside took out writing material have just begun task when deadly disgust at whole business came over resolved to end everything without further delay hand

evidently be recently fired a laid down astonished beyond measure saw own on table beside whose then be other did belong to one else in bungalow be once more to be disturbed rose instinctively pushed open door leading into inner room to still greater surprise found littered with half open box various thing lying about in great confusion few common toy be on floor on bare string bed bundle of bedding on table heap of towel basin of water ominously tinged with red fireplace be on other side of room beyond table crouched beside on floor be woman closely huddled up in common grey shawl held something under fold on knee something drew breath in long gasping sigh with fatal pause between ' beg pardon ' stammered intending to retire just then woman looking up showed young face so wild with grief terror paused irresolute ' will one come ' wailed seeming to look past with eye blind with grief ' o god dear god will one ever come ' then a face fell again over burden on lap moaned like animal in mortal agony above moan must still hear that curious gasping sigh 'can not help ' asked gave reply so went up stood beside still seemed unconscious of presence for once more came wail nobody come o god will nobody come to help ' have come ' answered touching on arm looked at then curious thrill made feel quite dizzy for moment perhaps be reason why face voice seemed to changed altered eye met mine doubtfully did not come before ' said 'no one ever came one one a removed hand bent once more over burden with same piteous moan evidently be stupefied by horror suspense so gently raised shawl to see what be matter great heaven what sight after year seem to see now fair silky curl dabbled in blood welled up from under handkerchief woman held convulsively to little white breast one chubby hand thrown out stiff clenched great brown eye glazed dim grey lip where gasping sigh sent tinge of red 'dot exclaimed dropping on knee better to assure of awful truth familiar name seemed to rouse wavering life 'dots not af'aid dot only wanted to make puff puff boom ' word seemed to float in air heard a in dream a in dream also came insight into what have happened dada revolver within reach of tiny hand o dot poor little brave dot felt helpless before awful tragedy once tried to take child woman resisted silently must get to listen to entreaty that must at least move to easier position at last seeing must hing acknowledging sorrowfully that nothing must do be likely to be of avail contented with waiting beside in silence until end a waited coherent story grew out of what knew what guessed have come on early that morning father on way further afield mother child to remain in little bungalow till return then in minute accident then only servant have be sent forth wildly for help whilst wretched woman waited alone yes that must have be so clear so simple so awful in very simplicity there be not sound in house save at interval woman moan 'will one ever come o god will

with tray of tea toast there be four cup of tea only two passenger man who have already be asleep on one side of carriage when took possession of other at bhopal so saw other for first time a sate up in sleeping suit among blanket pillow a train moved on in series of dislocation sent half tea into saucer left wistful old face looking at two unsold cup of tea regretfully wished have bought lot seemed such pathetic group to leave there in wilderness backed by european oven climbing gourd be wilderness mile mile of same pile of red rock blackened on upper surface scattered a if have be shot from cart among dry bent stunted bush curious bush with plenitude of twig paucity of leaf here there be still more stunted tree with paucity of rudimentary tree splay gouty with dozen so of kidney shaped lobe in place of foliage parched dusty unwholesome not level country one dented into causeless dell raised into irrelevant hillock however trending almost imperceptibly upwards so that eye deceived by imagined greater thing on horizon there be nothing only here there bigger patch of charred blackened bent telling where spark from passing train have found wider field for fire than usual unchecked by pile of red rock that then be secret of blackened surface be too still in hot windless dawn for flame a sped on added to dull trail of smoke creeping slowly among stone bush with faint touch of fire showing like eye to snaky curve behind sinister looking landscape indeed to unaccustomed eye like mine sate watching stealthy fire tipped finger in grass till at curve in line due to steeper rise saw something what on earth cried involuntarily what be what returned unknown companion in such curious tone of voice that involuntarily turned to for moment that tree suppose be began look for turned back to sight have startled gave low gasp be gone on more level ground be steaming quickly past very ordinary dent of dell where a usual one of stunted rudimentary tree stood on open patch of dry bent seamed seared by fire trail looked at companion incredulously what extraordinary thing exclaimed must have sworn that saw paused from sheer astonishment what asked other passenger curiously what echoed be just question looked like tree skeleton tree absolutely white with curved rib of branch there be tongue of flame paused again looking out on what be passing must of course continued have be curious effect of light on stunted tree yonder branch be curved like rib if notice bark be lighter exactly assented companion then told long botanical name pointed out that there be many such tree bush in low jungle distinctly to be seen against darker kind distinctly not blindingly like curious effect of dawn light have seen have however almost forgotten vision a thus started

graham be splendid chap keen a mustard on everything did not matter what be so that one day when be working out level after late breakfast jumped up like shot just a if have not be tramping over cursed rubbish shoot of red rock for six hour at sound of feeble whimpering near cook room tent devil of yours be at again ' said 'and wo have be ' a went off followed for did not relish graham justice when disabled cook time owned that brute deserved punishment for more forlorn little tragedy than be being enacted among pot pan never saw mohubbut khan chief villain be seated naked to waist bald a to head after manner of native cook at work on low reed stool brandishing knife in one hand while other held skrawking leggy white cock exactly in front of be group more suggestive of monkey than men consisted of very old man wizened bandy legged bandy armed whose white teeth showed in animal perfection a howled child of same build clinging to convulsively leg arm shriek between cook

cock be few year grand dad will hatch be sacrifice sacrifice to sahib logue who bring death a choose ' well turned out of course to be case of wanton cruelty always be for hopeless inability to be considerate commend to native jack in office there be fifty other fowl in neighbouring village nothing must serve underling whose duty be to collect supply that wretched child pet must serve for huzoor dinner old man joy when be released be purely pitiable must have reared for grandson asserted garrulously ay even to hatching of egg from very beginning with toil by day night only great god knew if child heart must have gone out to chick a have to cock for heart be capricious be not to be counted upon since great god made men yea even huzoors different from others looked from graham to a spoke somehow felt small so a graham be evidently master of situation slunk back to work there be sound of woe thereinafter from cook room tent graham supervised dinner night in order explained somewhat apologetically that might not suffer from conception of duty be two day after have shifted camp fifteen mile when having occasion to go into graham tent after dark stumbled over one sitting among corner tent peg be grandpapa of white cock explained to in lingo for be one of jungle people that have come in exchange for precious bird one life mattered little grim sahib have spared child

instead of white cock be absolutely must get out of so for day week followed be useful in way especially to graham who have passion not only for sport for sort of odd knowledge remember interrupting here that be pleasure of new surroundings to fellow traveller replied drily that have expected must say so a really reminded very much of graham passion of however led into being bit reckless a hot weather came on began to get touched up by fever still continued working during off day seemed little worse until one evening when went to bed with shiver after leopard hunt then old bunder crept over to tent sahib must go home across black water at once huzoor said quietly 'or bone will whiten jungle have seen skeleton tree ' be in essence all have to say though explanation be lengthy be simply skeleton tree be always seen where fire finger met who saw became skeleton in jungle before long unless possessed certain talisman there be such talisman among hill tribe who fell sick of fever always wore one if must compass be not often since be rare have one what use be when life from old age have become no more worth than white cock so grandson wore wore a fed joy of heart peacefully in ancestral home thanks to grim sahib how do know saw tree asked 'it be when have crawled up nigh end of dip huzoor replied bunder 'he looked up said what be when asked what have seen said be gone must have be that stunted tree looked like skeleton there be fire finger round so knew send home huzoor away from power bone will whiten jungle during following day really began though be not imaginative chap to feel bit queer about thing graham must shake off fever more than once when be delirious in evening must startle by saying 'what be ' must laugh next moment add 'only tree of course be light there be doctor within mile besides be not really such bad case a at least did seem so to to graham only to old bunder who became quite nuisance with warning so be glad when after confused rigmarole about white cock sacrifice disappeared one day be seen no more partly perhaps because moved back to higher camp in hope of escaping malaria did graham grew appreciably worse be fairly well by day be at night that fever seemed to grip used to sit up with till twelve one o'clock then turn in till about dawn when servant have order to call must go over see after again one day rather night be still quite dark when bearer roused with persistent drone of beaheeb saheeb ' knew in instant something be wrong graham shortly after left have got out of bed dressed in shikar clothes taken gun gone away

idea a attempt on boy part to relieve from responsibility organised whole camp into search party be last quarter moon will never forget eeriness of long fruitless search at first kept calling 'graham graham ' after time felt to be useless that must be either unconscious delirious determined to keep out of way so pushed on on in silence through bush bent expecting worst after be best found at dawn
