however began at once after wont to make plan for resuming of courtly way hurry have made impossible gold embroidered royal red umbrella be one thing be determined to have who be to hold over royal infant roy must get tired of during long march be boy after there must be deputy assistant second umbrella bearer to majesty must meroo properly dressed of course be promoted to position actually woke foster father from well earned first sleep to propound knotty question good woman murmured patiently make what court appointment ye will create scullion prime minister so have sleep be snoring almost before word be out of mouth so next morning head nurse refusing baggage camel with pannier prince askurry sent for use of little heir to empire organised procession of own first of came foster father stout solid on skew bald hill pony be called horse chestnut because be patched over like unripe chestnut with yellow brown white have lovely tail touched ground coat be long wavy like irish setter wise sober pony be horse chestnut never attempted to climb up anything thought too difficult just gave look at to make sure then put down head calmly began to graze until rider found easier path next came trooper faithful on old white charger lightning once upon time have be like name swift exceedingly now like master be slow stiff then followed head nurse astride in indian fashion bay belooch mare have be queen humeeda favourite mount until have have to be left behind in one of hasty move have of late be so common in hunted life of royal fugitive mare of course have be taken by pursuer brought along with groom in charge of have come grinning with delight to foster father when found in same camp again foster father be for riding bay mare giving sober horse chestnut to heir to empire head nurse must not hear of bay mare be said altogether more royal so there be with baby akbar astride cushion in front perched on skittish creature feeling at heart very nervous for be poor rider however held on very tight with one hand held baby akbar still tighter with other trusted to providence while roy meroo ran beside on side alternately holding up royal umbrella a best must foster mother on mule with little adam perched in front of brought up rear of procession be poor one for progress even along level because of bay mare fidgeting caperings when steep hill side be reached became impossible to keep up with rest of equipage so prince askurry men pushed on ahead leaving little party alone since escape be impossible on wild mountain road especially with rear guard of camp coming few mile behind indeed if such idea have entered head of of party must soon have fled before difficulty of getting along at be steep zig zag path looking upwards must see zigging zagging right away to sky line poor foster mother who came last must not take eye off for bend immediately above be filled with most terrifying sight first stout husband who seemed to be in act of slipping over horse chestnut tail on next old faithful driven to dismounting laboriously lugging lightning up by bridle last zig zag in front of called forth piercing shriek for bay mare not having be ridden for time be full of bean baby akbar insisted on holding rein meroo whose turn be to hold umbrella must slip slither among stone thereby bringing fringe right on bay mare nose oh head nurse have care blessed child shrieked poor foster mother a more than usually bad stumble sent umbrella on to mare tail be too much for frightened out of sens gave frenzied bound forward then rearing straight up hung over edge of path a if meant to take downward plunge seemed lost foster father faithful stood petrified with despair meroo must have dashed forward to catch at rein roy knowing with curious instinct of that must only make matter worse a must still further frighten mare held back by main force only person who be not spellbound with fear be baby akbar thought fine joke that mount must stand up on hind leg paw air so shrieked with delight dropped rein to clap hand a always did when be pleased now be very best thing anybody else must have done mare feeling free thought better of wheeling round dropped fore foot on path once more foster father loud arabic thanksgiving ended in equally loud order get off mare woman horse chestnut be only mount thou art fit for roy carry foolish umbrella behind in front emblem be ever carried in front protested head nurse feebly said behind be answer got behind went while toiled up up after while road became surprisingly bad nothing in fact watercourse foster father began to doubt if must be on right way possibly when be excited over mare bad behaviour have taken wrong turning a path led ever upwards judged better to go on though be terribly hard work moment road became worse worse until ceased to be more than mere ladder of rock puzzled even horse chestnut more than once stopped dead must no doubt have refused further attempt to climb have there be anything at to graze there be nothing nothing rock so after pause made best of bad bargain raised on hind leg sought foothold for fore foot in crevice then scrambled up only two child enjoyed baby akbar laughing with delight clapping hand over slip slitherings even nimble horse chestnut made reduced head nurse wet nurse to piteous wail to roy not for heaven sake to let go of heir to empire baggy trouser adam enjoyed also running on in front making snowball in drift ere long be to be seen sheltering from sun in cleft of rock sight of made foster father frown go too high said heaven send have not to climb to higher pas remark made head nurse give way altogether wept loudly saying in case have better stay die where be thus saving trouble of carrying down hill at very moment however adam who have run far ahead began waving arm shouting say top top cried roy who be keen in hearing a in everything else courage trouble be over have not quite ended in few minute more have reached beginning of pas proper before lay grassy boggy slope curling gently upwards between higher rockier slope little stream plashed softly adown through perfect wilderness of flower without one word tired traveller threw beside for rest refreshment baby akbar looked little troubled amma dadda 'way in 'ky said solemnly essayed to crawl on over grass for must not walk yet though spoke so well say began to talk when be nine month old chapter iv tumbu down after while party started on way once more feeling greatly brisked up heat of day be now upon though snow lay close beside path fierce sun melting made vapour rise turned narrow valley into regular steam bath perspiration ran down traveller face especially down poor head nurse for have insisted on taking off veil to twist turbanwise round baby akbar head since royal umbrella be forbidden foster mother have tried to take off hers also head nurse have angrily forbidden to do such thing if head nurse died of sunstroke what matter if foster mother failed what even though one back tooth have be gloriously cut must become of heir to empire admired of world great in pomp etc so to comfort went on mumbling title a struggled along sun beating fiercely on bare head quaint head with sleek black hair parted plaited hung with jewel even down long pigtail of brown wool be added on to back to make hair look more plentiful be piteous sight foster mother be so conscious of devotion meant that said lo head nurse thou art good good soul though hard one to will never never never forget day groaned head nurse 't be for heir to empire be full hour before slope ended in level bog on other side of began visible descent then in angled hill blue shadow began to rise telling of valley below bismillah thanks be to god cried foster father piously one echoed remark except baby akbar turned round looked back at snowy peak be beginning to show behind amma dadda 'way mountain said regretfully little mouth went down a for cry when everybody attention be distracted by sudden appearance of huge furry black dog came bounding down hill side big white teeth gleaming a uttered shrill sharp growling bark head nurse foster mother shrieked with fright little adam ran like hare for shelter of mother petticoat meroo cook boy remembering bare leg for like indian scullion wore short cotton drawer squatted down where be standing in order to protect even roy brave boy that be looked uncomfortable foster father old faithful whipped out sword be not needed however for next instant wild looking figure clad in brown blanket started up from behind rock shouted to dog stopped instantly stood still snarling though obedient be funniest looking dog can imagine bigger than big collie be furry over even to tail be black a ink in fact with tiny prick ear small sharp pointed muzzle lost in huge soft black ruff nothing to be seen red tongue white teeth beady black eye be regular golliwog of dog when foster father saw man in brown blanket who from crook be evidently shepherd heaved sigh of relief now said will be able to find out way be mistaken man did not understand word said must understand word said head nurse be in despair speaks like ghost of desert wept will die of starvation before understands die echoed foster father stoutly not so woman there be one language understand whereupon placed right in front of shepherd opened mouth wide then shook head next pointed to stomach shook head again finally began to chew violently rubbed stomach grinned shepherd grinned too rubbed stomach whereupon foster father turned triumphantly to head nurse said not sooth woman asked hunger hath tongue of own men know once begun sign soon brought so much understanding that whistling to dog shepherd started down hill at great pace beckoning to follow not so fast friend not so fast panted foster father be not born on mountain a thou art there be woman child too pointed to poor head nurse foster mother who be indeed dropping with fatigue man seemed to understand for pulled up have to keep way off because dog who kept close a shadow to master heel never ceased growling so tramped on wearily until just below saw marg mountain upland where goat be grazing one part of dipped down into little valley there in shelter of huge rock saw two three small brown blanket tent such a shepherd use on beluchistan hill be just like waggon tilt only not so large here at rate be prospect of food rest poor traveller brisked up again ala between tent lay formidable obstacle nothing le than birch twig bridge over rushing stream filled up bottom of wide rift chasm in upland chasm stretched right across upland from steep rock blocked up head of little valley out of stream gushed there be way of crossing so shepherd explained by sign except birch twig bridge now birch twig bridge be very terrifying thing to anybody who be not accustomed to be simply strong flat plait of birch twig about nine inch wide be flung from one side to other of course droop sag like rope in middle into plait be stuck few foot so cross stick to stick rope be fastened a sort of hand rail across bridge a hill child walk a easily a english child doe over great brick span head nurse resolutely refused to set foot over much le to allow heir to empire to risk neck on appallingly dangerous structure in vain foster father in order to set good example allowed to be led over by shepherd with eye carefully bandaged lest must get giddy in middle by looking down a matter of fact only made head nurse more frightened for of course bridge swung swayed with weight of men on must sooner declared try to climb heaven on rainbow be at least steady roy tried to hearten up by walking over with open eye though felt frightfully dizzy have to fling flat on grass to recover when did get over then meroo blubbering loudly that be going to death for young master climbed up on shepherd back allowed to be carried over just to show how easy be be in vain head nurse be firm must bring tent to heir to empire heir to empire must not go across tight rope to tent there must have remained have not great tall burly woman with fat baby on hip come out of one of tent grasping position stalked over bridge without even touching hand rail caught baby akbar from foster mother who be too taken aback to resist set on other hip calmly stalked back again leaving two woman too surprised horrified even to scream when saw heir to empire safe on other side consented to be carried across pick back so there be before long eating goat milk cheese fried like beefsteak drinking long draught of sort of sour milk one of shepherd must speak little persian from foster father to great relief learned that prince askurry camp be only mile two down valley so feeling certain of being able to reach before sundown called halt lay down to rest in one of tent baby akbar between two nurse for safety sake for one must never tell head nurse remarked what might happen amongst people who spoke language of ghost in desert kept such strange animal great golliwog of black dog who sat on one side of tent like image watching a if meant to eat great fluff of white cat sitting on other with eye shut a if did not want to watch indeed be impossible to tell what might not happen be exactly how turned out what really did happen one knew be foster mother who waking first let loose shriek while still awake roused head nurse who let loose for baby akbar be no longer between heir to empire have gone have disappeared be not to be found roy be out of tent in second treading in haste on meroo who be sleeping outside who began to howl confusedly old faithful fumbled for sword foster father rubbed eye a if must be at fault there be baby what be more black dog white cat have disappeared also at least be no longer on watch never be there such commotion rock resounded with cry one searched everywhere even in great tall basket pannier in hill shepherd carry good chattel not one sign of little fellow be to be found until horribly dreadfully near to awful birch twig bridge foster seized on tiny gold embroidered skull cap be lying on grass be sobbed be darling hath tried to get to mountain to amma hath fallen from accursed cat cradle be dead be killed face except shepherd who did not of course understand what be said turned pale be indeed possible perhaps probable that faithful little soul who remembered when others forgot have tried be terrible thought shepherd seeing cap at once whistled to dog one who spoke persian explained that if be shown cap must take up track of child at once though whistled whistled dog came then shepherd began to look grave mutter among be saying what gibberish be talking shrilled poor head nurse trying to keep hope alive by being angry man who spoke persian looked at cheerfully only that perhaps dog have eaten child keep hungry that may chase wild animal be too much for womankind simply rent air with heartbroken sob foster father grave silent must not give up hope foot of ravine must be searched first downwards a have child really fallen into stream must have be carried with then a last forlorn hope upwards so peering down carefully from side traced ravine till gradually becoming willower le steep merged into grassy valley there be sign then sadly commenced upward search until be close to high cliff whence stream gushed out here found that ravine be wider at bottom of patch of sand boulder showed that there be foothold beside roaring torrent will climb down see if there be aught said roy be easier here if have fallen here might tear in voice prevented more a tucked up garment preparatory to difficult descent shepherd raised urgent outcry there be demon in cavern said whence water came there be use angering use in losing life roy struggled madly in detaining hand old faithful foster father looked at other whether there be demon not be risk to life must not be young one boy said old warrior stoutly be task not thine be good swordsman to begin with demon if there be like not clean sword thrust also have be pilgrim to holy mecca demon if there be like not pilgrim flesh so muttering prayer holding drawn sword in teeth since hand be needed for parlous descent commenced task while others watched eagerly about half way down paused looked up called back must not hear what said take thy sword out of thy mouth man shrieked head nurse almost beside with grief rage be manner to speak with mouth full true enough old faithful have difficulty in obeying order however managed to steady for moment on two foot so sword in hand bawled back 't be true there be demon growl hear plainly farewell go on secure in sword holy here foot slipped went sliding slithering slipping down to bottom where happily only bruised sat half stunned staring in front of then there echoed up to listener most terrible barking yelping growling spitting that ever be heard demon demon yelled shepherd in terror ran for life roy ear over cliff listened for second next have followed old faithful foster father be not long behind meroo be close on heel foster mother head nurse be not to be left out somehow managed to get down in safety then stood sat silent agape with surprise delight for what saw be low cavern in rock on shelving bank of dry sand baby akbar sitting up rubbing eye while on one side of be golliwog of black dog fur bristling white teeth gleaming a filled air with furious bark while on other be white fluff of cat back arched tail size of two spitting growling fiercely how have got there foster father looked at foster mother head nurse looked at old faithful roy looked at meroo looked at other baby akbar only put out one fat hand towards black dog said tumbu other fat hand towards cat said down be must say have tumbled down how when where how dog cat came to be with one ever knew from day to chapter v on road naturally when after uneventful journey with shepherd a guide reached prince askurry camp that evening came to talk over incident foster father be not sparing of head nurse whole tissue of misfortune have ended in baby akbar so nearly losing life that have be spared be simply miracle arose from insisting on royal procession for child must have gone comfortably on camel must have kept up with other baggage animal none of distressful event must have happened must not however happen again of course head nurse tried to brazen out assert that heir to empire must always count on miracle in favour in heart of heart knew that foster father be right so next morning said nothing when saw camel with two pannier kneeling in front of tent ready for load have to be endured revenged by objecting to black dog white cat who sat expectantly one on side evidently prepared for start whose be uncouth beast asked of roy angrily did not tell ghost of desert who call shepherd to remove last night why have come back take away catch tie up such mean born animal have right to attend mighty in pomp lord of light etc etc rolled out title sonorously determined that if be docked of dignity in one way must have in now be not very hard to catch big black golliwog of dog even though did snarl snap try to bite there be lot of camp follower who be only too glad to have amusement of capturing so after very short space poor tumbu for baby akbar insisted on calling so be being dragged off at end of long rope to master shepherd looking very sad with tail between leg be quite different with down cat have made up mind to stay where be be very hard indeed to make cat change mind when be once made up so moved about gently from one place to other purring softly looking a mild a milk blue eye for real persian cat often have eye of different colour one of be always blue ever so friendly a if be just longing to be picked up only very tip of bushy tail swayed little be sure sign that cat be contrary contrary down be very instant one tried to pick up why be somewhere else head nurse ere long joined in chase saying rest did understand cat soon lost patience declaring that have never be done by dumb animal yet started capture by force circle be formed round point where down sat blinking in sunlight shawl veil be held up to make complete then step by step advanced towards cat who in truth viewed enclosing wall with polite indifference be really rather funny sight to see stout head nurse without veil tip toeing in line towards pussy shrilling out order to others to close in be sure to leave loophole step by step voice became more more triumphant really seemed a if cat must be caught time for down sat sweetly purring until be actually hidden from sight behind high held screening cloth now then quick shrilled head nurse close in close order ended in scream of fright for there be pussy in one flying leap on bare head scrabbling up scanty hair with away up hillside leaving nothing claw mark behind head nurse wept with angry tear foster father always sensible said enough cry on camel if will now be time to slip away before obstinate animal can return there be wisdom in therefore head nurse composed comfortably in one pannier while foster mother who be lighter settled into other with baby akbar so off set at dignified lollop camel affect head nurse began to congratulate on having successfully evaded uncouth beast there be counting on cat if be here one moment gone next be also gone one moment here next so a camel be passing under thorn tree about mile out from camp great fluff of white hair sprang from branch landed right in head nurse broad lap there be mistress down looking a if butter must melt in mouth purring away like kettle on boil head nurse gave in altogether then when cat really make up mind said with forced wisdom be little use one else making up theirs so pussy sat in lap after while warmth of pretty creature even very roughness of small three cornered red tongue that licked hand a half unconsciously began to stroke long soft fur made say suddenly who know be will of creator mean born thing may in future be of use to light of world observed of observer etc etc etc word be to come true for a will see by bye down be of great use to little master nevertheless when at very next camping ground great big black golliwog of dog with gnawed end of rope still round neck be seen calmly awaiting at door of tent be pitched for reception head nurse became tearful again said that if providence intended to send wild beast of field to look after baby akbar there be need for so must give up place little prince be delighted plumped down on hot sand beside dog hugged calling dear tumbu when white cat jealously rubbed back against little fat person hugged too called darling down hark to lord of universe giving creature name said foster mother piously so after everybody called golliwog dog tumbu fluffy cat down be beginning of whole week on camel back very pleasant week too though mind of elder be rather on stretch concerning fate of king humayon queen humeeda still sky be a blue a blue must be sun shone bright air be crisp with coming winter head nurse spent most of day dozing mumbling long string of title in one pannier while down slept purred on lap in other pannier be foster mother baby akbar little fellow did not sleep much spent most of time craning over pannier side to see everything there be to be seen what amused most be to watch tumbu who must look up bark gambol for hour to attract little master attention whereat down must become impatient come over camel hump from other pannier rub back against little prince watch too with sort of dignified contempt be way of dog to be loud effusive gushing did mean much tumbu for instance despite display of affection must leave post to run after wild thing saw though always came back to be so helplessly breathless with yard of red tongue hanging out that must have be little use have enemy turned up protection be needed cat be far wiser sat still watched so be always ready one evening down watched to purpose baby akbar be asleep on quilt down a usual lay keeping foot warm eye closed purring away like steaming kettle must have sworn be half asleep in second there be one spring something reared at to strike paw be too quick one two three came blow swiftly like box on ear there be snake squirming helpless in dust old faithful armoured foot be on head in second danger be over truly cat be terrible thing said head nurse in twitter there be fear in reptile have not chance down be back on young master foot eye closed purring away a if nothing have happened tumbu be in favour however next evening for different cause appeared with great prickly porcupine held gingerly in mouth laid before baby akbar ohi porcupine for supper cried meroo cook boy who knew what delicacy be head nurse shrieked take away quick heir to empire will prick with quill be poisonous take away at once say ala heir to empire be wilful like eastern princeling shrieked to match at suggestion so there arose such hubbub be only calmed by baby akbar being allowed to do a chose poor poor said a little hand touched sharp prickle one found out till foster mother came to put to bed that really did scratch there be quite little runnel of blood on palm akbar even when be baby be proud knew how to bear discomfort punishment when be own fault be rather merry night for have roast porcupine stuffed with pistachio nut for supper afterward roy sat by baby akbar pile of quilt sang to sleep with royal lullaby baby baby ling be

creeping stealthily to tent be on foot in moment challenging hush whispered newcomer bring message from king humayon must see foster father at once good man be already between quilt got up quickly when have heard message sent for head nurse foster mother old faithful for felt that most momentous decision have to be made yet message be very simple one in charge of child be to creep away very night with messenger who must guide in safety to king humayon who have found help shelter in persia head nurse foster mother wept tear of joy at glad news proposed at once that must wrap child in blanket start foster father be more wary come a thief in darkness said where be token from king may know who be there be token then child stay where be asserted foster father boldly be not right oh faithful assuredly lord be right who know man may be emissary of who must wile away little lad from uncle prince askurry protection other uncle kumran be not so kind messenger scowled at old man a

who must fain have sided with messenger go fetch heir to empire cap that will go a sign that be father vassal to do what be told when order come accredited so take that a answer to who sent sir messenger so despite head nurse protestation man went off with nothing little gold laced skull cap have not to go far only into tent on outskirt of camp for foster father suspicion have be correct

old fox be too wary said must get at child other way one of party took up cap fingered half idly have large sized head for year remarked if be full of brain hereafter may do well chapter vi at court of course messenger never returned from king humayon with token foster father be good natured man did not boast of wisdom to head nurse who however remained wonderfully meek silent until at end of fortnight marching saw against blue of distant valley white dome of town of kandahar with citadel rising above then with chance of court before once more began chattering of ceremonial title etiquette praise be shrilled in high voice no more jiggettings joggettings on camel back will be on own foot once more will not be fault if just due be not given to great in pomp etc etc foster mother interrupted string of title so that harm not child said clasping charge tight be always thinking of safety always alarmed for danger young turk that be struggled from arm pointed to hill be leaving behind dadda amma 'way mountain repeated once more then added cheerfully akka 'way too be prophecy said old faithful overhearing remark sure grand dad baber on whom be peace have gift babe may have inherited may have echoed head nurse indignantly have inherited have much of own besides mark word if child live heaven grant will be king of king not two summer old talk a one of three aye assented foster mother doe not walk yet head nurse sniffed thou be foolish soul woman sure foot tongue must come first for part prefer tongue babe can walk foster mother be silent be true one must not have everything last camp be pitched just outside city of kandahar so prince askurry must make regular triumphal entry next morning let everybody see with own eye that have come back victorious holding baby akbar a prisoner hostage did not suit head nurse at have notion that heir to empire must be stared at a captive so though started from camp humbly a ever on baggage camel sooner have passed through arched gate of city with prince askurry well ahead of in narrow street than out whipped royal umbrella have patched up with old scarlet silk petticoat there be baby akbar under shadow having young a be be taught to salute to crowd began waving little fat hand with much dignity until people who have come out to gape whispered among said look inch king son be what be said bold voice in crowd though folk turned to see who spoke there be sign of speaker for loyal men have to hide loyalty in day still populace be pleased with little prince bearing many hand be raised to welcome before reached frowning palace indeed where prince askurry kept right royal court a governor of kandahar head nurse mind be full of thing intended to insist upon for honour dignity of small charge meanwhile have to obey order to take at once into princess sultanam apartment now princess sultanam be prince askurry wife have boy of own who be about three year older than baby akbar little daughter who have just be born about month before so a lay among cushion at farther end of long room with prince askurry who have hurried to see wife on return beside looked suspiciously at child head nurse put down on persian carpet a soon a came into room since though others might carry to upstart at farther end be not going to do so when be clearly bound to come humbly to heir to empire prostrate before so there stood baby akbar fair square steadying by head nurse petticoat for looking bold big brave now princess sultanam be kindly foolish woman at heart much given to impulse sight of upstanding little boy made think instantly what fine man must make brought thought made sit up delightedly clap hand have lord exclaimed turning to prince askurry be grand idea will betroth little amina to young master will settle everything will be handsomest couple in country now strange a may sound to reader prince askurry who be accustomed to indian habit of settling that quite little boy girl must marry other when grew up must not help at once seeing that wife suggestion be not such bad one must help to keep hold over little heir to empire if king humayon returned must make more inclined to forgive if did not why must prevent cruel brother kumran from stepping in getting all since a father in law to young king askurry must be regent still taken aback hummed hawed must be long time to wait until be old enough to marry began long interrupted lively princess gaily longer for merriment festivity thy daughter lord be already beautiful will wager boy will be grown man ere have time to turn round so that be settled therefore come hither oh nephew jallaluddin mahomed akbar since be thy long name kiss thy cousin amina nurse bring sweeting hither now then woman continued sharply addressing head nurse who stood petrified with astonishment anger at very idea of such scant ceremony if boy can not walk carry head nurse must scarcely speak to be called woman by upstart for prince askurry have married princess sultanam for beauty be too much foot of most condescending of majesty began pompously have not yet conferred happiness on earth by treading underfoot here broke off hurriedly for at very instant a if in denial of word baby akbar gave little crow of assent let go petticoat with outspread balancing arm leg very wide apart launched boldly for very first step bismillah well done shrieked foster mother in delight bismillah bismillah echoed one in room while eye full of smile be on stalwart young toddler a lurched forward face one broad grin princess sultanam clapped hand again thy turban lord cried in flutter of amusement thy turban quick a father be not here 't be thy place to prevent falling of thy turban quick quick prince askurry full of laughter pulled off soft turban wore be wound round round to fit head like cap in obedience to indian custom always prevents child from falling of in first attempt at walking flung full at little lad caught between outspread balancing arm over went on to thick pile carpet foster mother be beside in second eager to snatch up cover with kiss baby akbar wriggled from hold have set task meant to do go way said with determination tumbu down get up again so calmly reaching round for turban lay beside evidently thought have tumbled down too clapped on head with hand rose to foot recommenced forward lurch yard two of fringed turban have become unrolled trailing behind like royal robe be quainter little figure than before nobody laughed now looked at other then at child staggering along under prince plumed turban then at prince askurry standing bareheaded before nephew be ill omen yet a head nurse said proudly when got back to room have be given in frowning bastion of palace baby akbar have once more scored off uncle indeed be so cock hoop about that stickled for stickled for until attendant who be at first inclined to be civil began to look askance foster father have to bid hold tongue wise folk leave steel trap alone said fiddling with let off spring then pouf shook head significantly steel trap echoed head nurse sniffily who be talking of steel trap be woman replied foster father sternly tell kandahar be a steel trap ready to snap on at moment head nurse be silent even though also have ventured to call woman be beginning to learn nine time out of ten foster father be right chapter vii winter winter settled in early that year with pass of hill blocked by snow caravan of laden camel in addition to merchandise of sort brought news from world to east world to west of mountain clipped kandahar ceased to come into big bazaar cold kept most people at home shivering beside glowing brazier set outside shop be not season for active work so prince askurry let slip by without really making up mind what be to do with baby akbar meanwhile child must live in bastion of palace play with little cousin whether be to be betrothed to baby amina not must be decided in spring be time for rest home comfort without fear of disturbing since none must cross pass in winter princess sultanam however to whom in seclusion winter summer be much alike grew fond of little lad never ceased to urge on husband wisdom of so treating prince akbar must king humayon by good luck have knack of being lucky find again with army at back hand must be tied from revenge on court at kabul now askurry be fool saw that for present at rate until humayon fate be decided must be wiser to be kind so decided that when held new year assemblage must present little prince in due form to chief noble head nurse be almost crazy with delight at very idea foster mother sent jewel to goldsmith to be made up into suitable ornament for baby akbar ransacked shop for odd scrap of brocade with to make finest of fine state robe on eventful day began child toilette early pressing roy rajput into service a tire woman to hold ointment scent what not that deemed necessary for due dressing of prince so that rather dashed spirit when foster father came in with sober face news that man have come into bazaar bringing bad tidings of king queen have said be lost in snow whether be true not who must tell then what be use of worrying snapped head nurse who be too much occupied in making charge beautiful to think of other thing lo foster father evil be never lost on road arrives sooner later so why watch for at door be true replied foster father mark word depends on good news if come child be safe if evil then god help roy who baby akbar being nearly dressed be now holding pot of lamp black oil with head nurse after indian custom must put finishing touch to work by smearing big black smut on child forehead lest must be too sweet so attract envious evil eye looked up at word face full of light remembrance god doe help true kingship said proudly mother used to say so be why be never afraid paused light in face faded remember more added apologetically remembrance snapped head nurse hold pot straight boy thou wilt spill over mighty in admired of world etc foster father looked at old faithful laid hand kindly on roy shoulder matter not roy be there within thee same 'twill come back day never fear for one added aside to old trooper must not wonder at much for lad manner be ever above present station old faithful shook head wisely 't be not boy manner friend said breed man may compass manner for not that father must have have also by time black smear be on baby akbar forehead despite smudge looked very fine little fellow indeed so much so that murmur of delighted admiration ran round assemblage when askurry appeared leading by hand for have quickly learned to run about be now quite steady on leg chip of old block said ancient mountain chief who have known grandfather babar many others nodded assent then prince askurry began set speech little akbar seated on knee while be very clever crafty speech must be taken two way prince askurry be so much interested in making sure that be neither too disloyal too loyal to unfortunate brother king that did not notice what be passing on knee until sudden lack of attention on part of audience made follow eye look down at child upon lap then then sat dumbfounded face flushing to dull dark red for saw in moment what thing have happened must mean to others audience before men have summoned to listen to half hearted word yet be very simple little thing baby akbar tired doubtless of uncle speechifying have found amusement in slender gold chain hung round uncle neck have traced to secret pocket in inner waistcoat so have drawn out from hiding place golden signet ring set with engraved emerald toy indeed so after playing with for bit child have slipped onto little forefinger held up better to admire new found treasure so came to pas that a askurry smooth oily voice went on on who listened must see little image sitting on knee dignified gracious looking image with forefinger held up in attitude of kingly command on forefinger what signet of king ring of empire be unmistakable askurry must have found in fugitive brother tent must have concealed uncertain what part meant to play in end must have worn on person until child true heir to empire chief looked at other furtively there be pause then suddenly old thin voice voice of old mountain chief who remembered babar brave rose on silence god save heir to empire gave lead from side rose cry god save heir to empire illustration child have slipped onto little forefinger prince askurry face fell have not meant to rouse loyalty be quick clever so saw that have be roused now be not time to try stifle so frown turned to smile a caught child to rose holding in arm rogue lord said lightly have forestalled meant to place ring upon finger before in token that doe in truth represent king praise be to heaven have saved task long live heir to empire noble a passed out of assembly people who heard tale outside said be strange happening that innocent child must so claim right cruel brother kumran party laid head together once more swore be time to end prince askurry foolish hesitation must get at child somehow by time if prince askurry have not quite made up mind how must treat baby akbar have quite settled that one else least of cruel brother kumran must have anything to do with child so little prince be carefully watched guarded rather to foster father old faithful relief indeed a time went on almost forgot to watch being accustomed to see sentry walking up down before entry to narrow stair led up to three room in old bastion be given a lodging be large comfortable room inner one be used by foster mother head nurse baby akbar outer one by two men two boy while middle one great wide hall of place used a living room be lighter than others since have slit of window without glass of course high up in wall though let cold a well a winter sunshine into room there be roaring great fireplace kept farther end of hall nice warm here on very frosty night woman folk must drag bed sleep while during snowy day must spread quilt on floor baby akbar must have high jinks with tumbu down who be constant playmate then when be tired roy must cradle young master in arm sing to not lullaby for little akbar mind kept pace with body month saw more more of boy le le of baby tell how rajah rasalu did tell how rajah rasalu did that must say so roy boyish voice must go over old story of endless adventure have delighted so many indian child for so many generation so time passed quite merrily until one night when something dreadful happened so dreadful that will really require chapter to describe be one night when roy have be telling little prince how rajah rasalu friend forsook for fear a be rather nice story will be told here know great kingly child began roy how rajah rasalu be born how rajah rasalu set out into world to seek for fortune taking with dear horse baunwa iraki parrot kilkila who have lived with since be born besides carpenter lad goldsmith lad who have sworn never to leave young master so journeyed north to lonely place set with sombre tree night be dark so set watch goldsmith took first while young prince slept by carpenter lad on couch of clean sweet leaf lest heart of prince must sink sang cheering song 'cradled till now on softest down leaf be thy bed to night yet grieve not thou at fortune frown brave men heed not slight while slept goldsmith watched snake slid out from tree 'now who be ' goldsmith lad come to disturb rest ' 'lo have killed living thing have ventured within ten mile of place of rest hissed 'and now will slay too ' so fought fought goldsmith lad killed snake in end then hid body under shield lest others might be afraid roused from rest carpenter lad to take share of watch while in turn on clean sweet leaf lay down beside prince while slept carpenter watched dragon slid from tree 'now who be ' carpenter lad come to disturb rest ' 'lo have killed living thing for twenty mile round place will kill too ' roared 'and crack bone to eat ' so fought fought fought till killed dragon at last then hid body behind bush lest others must be afraid roused rasalu from out sleep to take share of watch while in turn by goldsmith lad lay down to take rest while slept rasalu waked thing slid out from tree awful thing man must tell th unspeakable horror of rasalu smiled in face of dread laughed in horrible eye who be to disturb rest why do dare to come ' 'lo have killed living thing for twenty time twenty mile will kill upstart boy crack bone to dust ' so fought fought fought rasalu drew bow arrow fled like wind pierced awful horror through then fled to cave close by with rasalu at heel so fought fought fought till dawn showed clear in sky awful horror gave up with groan rolled on side died now just a rasalu wiped sword sleeper awoke from sleep beee here ' said goldsmith lad with pride killed in lonely watch 'pooh only snake ' said carpenter lad beee dragon have killed ' rasalu took by hand led into cave dead a be shrieked with fear at awful horror saw fell at rasalu foot groaned moaned prayed wept 'let go oh hero be men dare not follow now be nothing to be death to to follow be friend then tear came into rasalu eye said word of nay a will ' said to ' will not bid stay 'aloes linger long before flower gracious rain too soon be overpast youth strength be with hour glad life must end in death at last king reign king without consent of courtier ruler may rule though none heed command heaven crowned head stoop not rise haughtier alone friendless in stranger land ' so friend forsook fled rasalu went on way chapter viii down stratagem now terrible thing happened be one foster father might have expected for two thing one be sentry who walked up down night long below high second story window of central room must be bound to see attempt to gain entrance through even if be wide enough to admit entry of grown man be not other be fact that old faithful meroo roy slept in outer room into only door opened so that intruder must have to force entrance over body for slept with drawn sword beside so a day passed on foster father vigilance though knew that cruel brother kumran agent be on lookout for opportunity of kidnapping heir to empire slackened somewhat especially when afternoon drew in fire in big hall be made up quilt put down baby akbar surrounded by admiring circle listened to roy story tumbled about with playmate tumbu dog down cat one day however down did not appear until little akbar be having supper then came in great hurry out of small archway by big fireplace led to sort of cupboard in masonry where charcoal have be kept gobbled up plate of bread milk hurried in again a if have to catch train have have kitten said foster mother wonder if be white black black sniffed head nurse what else must be in hole have care woman heir to empire will be blacking too archway be large enough for to creep in heaven only know whither might lead be true replied foster mother alarmed a distracted child attention in day two quick ear caught sound of feeble mewing inside arch of course wanted to know what be so be told that kitten have to be kept quiet down must be very vexed if kitten be disturbed that by bye must doubtless bring out for to see then of course must play with now baby akbar be always reasonable little fellow so waited patiently though night when went to bed down came out for supper little mouth must go down must hold up little hand twiddle round say mournfully kitty not 'weady kitty not 'weady now one night there be great festival in palace heir to empire have to go pay respect after indian manner on feast day to aunt uncle then when returned sent after indian wont tray full of fruit sugar toffee made in shape of animal few piece of muslin stuff to make new dress for party in addition to there be trayful of supper came afterward when daylight have gone with princess sultanum best compliment at least so said man who brought did not wait to be questioned disappeared so soon a meroo have taken tray from be full of most delicious dainty including bowl of sweet milk made with almond honey rice meal for baby akbar head nurse however must not let eat be always afraid of little lad being poisoned so meroo always cooked with own hand everything child ate therefore gave to tumbu instead for having be brought up by shepherd loved milk licked lip after be soon sound asleep by fire lamb stewed with pistachio nut full of saffron looked however so delicious that after meroo have tasted pronounced quite safe since knew that saffron must not go with real poison set to work finished platter be a jolly a must be afterward though heat of fire heavy supper made sleepy so head nurse declaring be far too cold in inner room dragged bed foster mother close to fire others retired to outer room before long be snoring away quite happily for if supper have not truly be poisoned have be drugged drugged with sleep bringing drug so a firelight flickered over room faintly showed head nurse face foster mother face even tumbu black muzzle in dead sleep be almost unconsciousness in outer room foster father snored even roy keen hawk face lay like one dead only baby akbar tossed turned in comfortable nest between two nurse save for due to head nurse precaution in not allowing heir to empire sweet milk for supper be a cruel brother kumran agent have planned when have sent pretended messenger from palace with platter of delicacy even sentry below be sleeping sound after share of kid curry thus who be on roof waiting until moon have set must without fear of discovery lower young lad who be to steal baby akbar down to window through being slender thief must slip easily felt that task be almost done reckoned without great white fluff after time showed at entry to charcoal bunker yawning stretching blinking eye head nurse have be quite wrong in saying down kitten must be black in hole mother anyhow be beautifully white perhaps because down be sensible cat have only chosen charcoal bunker because have found lot of old straw blanket tucked away in farther corner besides a only have one kitten must spend time in licking cleaning with rough red tongue after manner of cat anyhow there lay right out of reach of one little bundle of white fluff down be just beginning to feel that there be other thing in world besides kitten for instance be that scratching on roof think mouse if so passed to fire be warm nice just very place for kitten first look at world there be troublesome people about not what be anxious to show kitten to baby akbar who knew if horrid head nurse might not try to catch head nurse be asleep down whisked tail disappeared through archway reappeared again gingerly carrying kitten in mouth sprawled in firelight mewed piteously there be that scratching on roof again really kitten be bore when one wanted to mouse so far be easy to follow down thought what came next be more difficult one can say whether cat have really notion danger to young master be abroad whether only wanted to show kitten whether wanted taken care of for persian cat if kill rat at night have often be known to jump on master bed insist on taking custody of prize lest must somehow come to life again if left alone only be certain baby akbar woke with rough red tongue licking nose there on quilt be down beside fluffiest darlingest little kitten that ever be made grab at with little fat hand whether frightened anxious mother whether down really have purpose in view who can say only be sure be off bed in second miss kitten in mouth minute afterward baby akbar be off also with little crow of delight drugged nurse did not stir be away in land of dream hark what be curious noise outside window a if something be slipping down wall perhaps be that frightened down once more for just a baby akbar hand reached out to lay hold of kitten have set down by fire down snatched up again be off with back to charcoal bunker with baby akbar after face full of solemn resolve meant to play with kitty play with did at least after disappeared down archway by fireplace did not come out again only down reappeared seated at entrance ear cocked eye fixed on window for something very funny have happened there though flicker of fire have died down must see with cat eye lad have slipped in carrying end of rope to be attached network bag now since be dark be striking light feeble little glimmer sufficient to show two sleeping nurse comfy little nest of quilt between be empty boy seemed puzzled went into inner room only to return without what sought then stole into outer room came back softly with puzzled look on face then began to peer about on floor in corner holding feeble light in front of whereupon down apparently to satisfy that kitten really be safe in corner of charcoal bunker where have left retreated for moment so that a searcher came round saw nothing low round arch next gave stifled yell for something white be claw leaped right in face over went out went light look more said shivering a after five minute hasty retreat stood on roof among who have sent down let one else go tell child be not there one of crafty cruel men have sharp wit must have crept into charcoal bunker suggested face round lit up lad remained sullen a wiped blood from down scratch said go not near that cat again so a one else be small enough to slip through narrow slit of window conspirator must only curse bad luck thus came to pas that hour passed by without further attempt at baby theft while foster father snored head nurse dreamed most heavenly dream of wonderful court ceremonial others be wrapped in profoundest slumber woke at last once more there be most terrible hullabaloo until foster mother recollected kitten in charcoal bunker whereupon one in turn flattened on floor reached in roy actually got head one shoulder in one must feel anything find out how big be anything about whereupon two woman began mutual recrimination men stood helpless when suddenly down appeared with kitten in mouth baby akbar who have evidently be comfortably asleep on blanket amid straw came crawling after new pet so far so good said foster father who noticing fallen piece of mortar at window sill have be carefully examining certain sign scratch without within if be not much mistaken one hath be through here night that be drugged ye must know if inside of mouth be like mine so have to thank heaven cat for escape so have though be sore trial once more to woman to have nothing guesswork to go upon wish knew murmured poor foster mother mournfully a watched baby akbar down kitten tumbu playing together before fire once more baby akbar be silent down told nobody unless be tumbu perhaps did know because allowed down kitten to play with tail chapter ix spring winter passed to spring spring to early summer yet certain news came of king humayon queen humeeda foster father almost gave up hope yet said little though took counsel with old faithful in turn consulted old mountain chief who at assemblage have be first to cry long live heir to empire old man shook head time be new said very few people remembered a did old way old king for sake of babar brave might always count on sword sabre of fifty more of follower so if worst came to worst be welcome to asylum in eagle eyrie of fortress where at rate must die together fighting for king what more did brave man want be not much consolation to foster father who felt that there be nothing to be done save by mean in power to curry favour with princess sultanum indeed little heir to empire made friend wherever went must not help liking frank little fellow who spoke to so freely with certain grave dignity of own for by time peach garden around kandahar lay like cloud of pink white about old domed city little prince akbar be in look way child of three even four so big strong be spoke perfectly in childish way with great emphasis curious soft burr over r h actually tried to wrestle with cousin ibrahim who be however rather puny boy despite fact that be three year older than little heir to empire with roy a playmate akbar began sort of game there be high walled peach garden not far from bastion where little prince used to be allowed to go there during long sunny hour rajput lad to whom such thing be curiously familiar taught child how to ride on tumbu back how to hold spear aye to take tent peg too peg being only soft carrot stuck in earth great game be shooting with bow arrow in before spring passed to summer pupil be match with teacher except in strength for from very beginning akbar showed steady straight a shot so be wonder grew up to be finest marksman in india must take too long to tell game played manly sport little prince learned without difficulty there be willow marble tank in middle of garden where took to water like duck must lie on back kick shout with laughter a tank got rough with wave till foster mother must beg not to drown a water splashed over high in air foster father always reproved for fear leave lad to learn king way said thank heaven rajput foundling be here to teach think must tumble head over heel in air water ride bareback standing on one leg indeed must reply head nurse who stifled terror from sense of duty none seeing thy figure friend must ask so much of thee then when akbar grew tired roy must sit leaning back against peach tree so a to make soft pillow for little master akbar must lean against listen to endless story while soft fresh breeze stole over garden wall sent shower of pink peach petal on boy sometimes little prince outwearied must fall asleep then roy must sit still a mouse gently flicking away with end of muslin turban blossom fell on little sleeper face thought must be busy wondering above other thing why be that do what must must not help when be alone at play sometimes calling heir to empire little brother be dreadfully wrong of of course head nurse must rightly cuff ear if overheard then akbar must wake call imperiously for favourite story a often a not must be tale of how rajah rasalu swung seventy maiden roy must reply submissively be ordered highness begin now rajah rasalu soft heart strong heard pitiful voice a rode along 'oh traveller traveller turn aside help god creature ' moaned cried so prince turned straight saw that fire have caught bush blazing higher higher while tiny cricket lay gasping for breath half scorched half choked nigh to death then rajah rasalu soft hearted put hand in fire snatched out cricket drew forth feeler said 'take preserver 'twill bring aid must thing ever prove troublesome burn in fire will come then rasalu laughed with great big laugh ' thank weakling none of chaff must

degree to morrow will see large enough for at rate to pas through so proved not next day day after not only roy mirak bija have managed to climb up to outer world by notch roy cut in snow wall be strange chill world saw far a eye must reach nothing snow air frosty sharp though sun be shining once more mirak be keen to snowball roy must not hear of snow be melting with faint heat of mid day sun said step might make frost film break down into powdery drift might go never to come up again so only stood looking about for few minute then prepared to go back take care lord take care cried roy a mirak who be preparing to descend leg foremost a have be told to do suddenly looked up with face full of mischief let go with hand pouf disappeared down slippery tunnel like pea in pea shooter burst of laughter from below told have arrived safely nothing must suit bija to do likewise roy being still too tight fit to slide quickly in fact child be eager to climb up once more do again head nurse said must not hear of clothes be wet enough a be besides be most unlady like for real princess day therefore did not pas so uncomfortably though pressing anxiety sat on foster father honest face time roy returned from climb up to outer air must ask if have seen anything nothing roy must reply snow waste little be so high up at last one night after child be asleep foster father summoned council of war must not be wise said to remain where be without making effort at escape until provision be exhausted then must be helpless now still have enough for two three day behooved to make push whither not back on step advised old faithful firdoos gita makani always said 'no retreat till there be advance ' besides see if go down snow will be melting give foothold at night frost will hold on pas be little farther to next shelter for see have come twice way from kandahar never other way back so memory of land mark if there be must be nothing on downward journey upward might come to life again upward there be le chance of missing way a valley converge to pas whereas downward spread out in different direction in fact there be so many point in favour of advance that decision be made for next night settled on for start there be not many preparation to make except for woman who have to bake what flour have into hearth cake have little wheat pulse too roasted tied up in corner of veil everything be heavy have to be left behind for knew that even unburdened might have difficulty in getting frost film on snow to bear weight be bright starlight night when snow tunnel having be enlarged by roy regardless of flooding shed whole party crept out stood on wide snowy expanse tumbu be first with joyful yap began to career about in circle curved like comma biting snapping at snow down came last meaowed piteously lifting up first one cold foot then shaking in disgust finally idea seemed to come into head made bound toward tumbu next moment be on back clawing onto fluffy black fur whereat everybody laughed so with many prayer for guidance little party set off old faithful leading way at first managed pretty well though men woman being heavy sank over ankle at step bija mirak even roy being light found surface hard enough to bear so ran on ahead chattered laughed whole business being to huge joke thus hour passed cheerfully enough then bija began to get tired foster father took in arm result sent heart into mouth with sudden fear sudden certainty that help must come way even slight additional weight sent almost waist deep into snow must scarcely move ere long heir to empire must doubtless weary also then what be to be done for hour after midnight must bring thawing sun nearer nearer might have to remain on pas till night brought frost again in case what must become of child then suddenly eye caught tumbu who be marching along sullenly down nestling fast clawed in broad furry back must dog carry child creature with four foot have greater purchase of foothold than one with two roy said turn cat off put heir to empire on dog back must be tired also mirak nothing loath climbed quickly to mount ere have settled on back tumbu have begun to sink slowly little lad weight be too much for even four foot there be struggle over went little prince tumbu have to be picked up set on leg again on fresh unbroken place foster father looked in despair at old faithful for minute one said anything then old man face lit up lo have forgotten utterly time place bring memory back firdoos gita makani who knew thing under sun have favourite horse strained falling into drift be for leaving to die did not suit firdoos gita makani who be kind to god creature so having read of like somewhere set to make sort of platform with lance blanket underneath poor brute so dragged over snow until reached place where there be water grass have lance said foster father there be wood looked around helplessly lord have sword put in roy eagerly so have faithful if be to tie crossway to scabbard have already thrown off skin coat be unwinding long muslin waistband to tear into strip to use a cord be worth trying friend foster father said old faithful unbuckling sword aye continued roy elated with idea tumbu can drag make mark on snow so will be smooth slippy curved scabbard will be like runner dexterous finger be hard at work binding long sword blade to place then strip of woollen shawl be fastened to a seat meroo turban served a harness in le time than must have be imagined quaint sledge be ready for trial mirak sat on first now then tumbu good dog said roy in flutter for fear of failure tumbu turned round looked at little master with broad grin of red tongue white teeth gave little grunt started sledge slid on over frozen snow quite easily now praise be to god cried foster father overjoyed grand dad said little prince who always listened to everything knew must help did bija want to go on thing too whimpered mayhap might support put in head nurse be featherweight there be plenty of room ere five minute be over little party greatly heartened up by finding unexpected way out of difficulty started once more roy encouraging tumbu who in truth seemed to feel task quite light one while foster father in relief gratitude allowed down cat to creep once more inside fur coat weight made sink little farther into snow be strong felt must have done more for sake of child safety on on went frost film giving firmer foothold on top of pas while chill always precedes dawn took away still more from difficulty of tumbu task in fact curved scabbard slipped over hard snow a if have be ice illustration ahead of shadow showed shambling shadow tumbu with bound be off full tilt after so went on till glimmer of dawn showed that summit have be reached downward slope begun still far near nothing snow be to be seen then suddenly ahead of shadow showed shambling shadow tumbu stopped dead sniffed then with bound be off full tilt after sledge with two child in flying behind for instant others be too much astonished to speak then roy with frantic cry to tumbu to come back be off after in vain a crested little rise saw by growing light big brown isabelline bear shambling along contentedly seeming to go pace at yet gaining steadily on sledge be giving chase will follow a fast a can panted rajput lad breathlessly a foster father meroo old faithful hampered by greater weight ran up be bear can not catch tumbu will tire then always come back follow on track with woman with be off like arrow from bow behind bear tumbu sledge heir to empire princess bakshee ban begum who by time have disappeared behind hilly horizon chapter xiv in valley roy ran ran ran until be breathless yet still ran until little by little recovered breath again a wild animal do moment hoped to see tumbu returning standing still panting waiting for others to come up saw nothing save stretching away a far a eye must reach smooth not over steep snowy slope so far there be little fear of sledge being overset then after have run long way paused for there be now two track instead of one mark of bear went up little side valley mark of sledge went down slope what must have happened have tumbu in haste missed bear trail be not likely having come so far have determined to go on be not likely unless child have urged forward knowing mirak bold adventurous spirit seemed possible roy heart sank started off running again knowing that matter what have happened must follow little master follow fast a ran downward downward frost film on snow became le le firm sun be rising now even earliest ray seemed to melt foothold began to sink at step sledge however appeared from faint mark left to have slid on without difficulty doubt thought because of child light weight because platform between sword scabbard supported be so large many time larger than own foot why even tumbu be four broad furry paw have sunk into snow little must doubtless have sunk more for pace at must have be going sledge be thing how clever be of old faithful to remember firdoos gita makani way of saving horse after when one came to think of thanks be due to babar brave for being real king kind hearted to animal now roy task became dangerous a well a hard for moment lessened firmness of ice film be now running down willow valley be completely blocked up by drift except in very middle where now again got glimpse of roaring torrent kept unfrozen by snowy covering hollowing way downward for most part be invisible only sign of being roar tremble beneath foot thus be a be on snow bridge of surface might at moment give way that meant certain death in dark pool below in one place indeed be lost however wild leap landed on safe ground with gasp of fear not for for child ahead of ran on comforted by sight of sledge track going on on after while have to cease running from sheer fatigue still plodded on telling that even hour must have made difference in snow where found danger child might have found safety always before track of scabbard sledge showed that so far at rate have gone well then a turned sharp curve in willow snow covered valley saw little below something made turn sick with fear be sledge empty deserted second glance however showed that be not overset who have be in must have left of own accord cause of be soon made clear within few yard snow ended rocky descent began down sledge must not have gone so either tumbu child have be wise be still in front of how far off who must tell sun be already high hour must have passed since first started in chase now that be on foot there be chance of overtaking before anything dreadful happened in hurry roy almost flung from rock to rock down descent have to pause to take off fur coat for in sheltered spot sun beat shadelessly snow melted a passed stone ran with moisture in cranny of rock young green thing be everywhere starting into growth past storm of bitter cold have ended winter spring have begun now rushing torrent escaping finally from snowy blanket dashed over boulder beside carrying with great block of melting snow on on went thinking descent must never end till at turn saw below tiny valley just sort of cup in hill through stream rushed sparkling in sunshine bank be still brown be patched with great bed of rose pink primula blue gentian yellow dog pansy on perfect carpet of sat three dark figure never in life be roy so overjoyed forgot fatigue ran on until must plainly see princess bakshee ban begum making cowslip ball out of pink primula heir to empire contentedly munching cold hearth cake giving bit of to tumbu who with head cocked on one side have evidently heard roy distant step next instant furious barking showed that be on alert to defend young charge roy have to call to again again before be satisfied that newcomer be friend why what long time have be coming said heir to empire calmly have have breakfast 'cos must wait longer ca have come a

father foster mother old faithful meroo down what have done with slave be half angry half ready to cry so roy though own heart failed a thought of danger of road have to soothe comfort by saying a cheerfully a must that must come before long must now that relief of finding child be safe be over poor roy began to see difficulty before if others did not come what must mere lad do how must care for little master mistress have have breakfast be true roy forgot have have none what must have for supper must not even think felt too giddy tired even to sleep so after have rolled fur coat into soft pillow for little prince princess who be drowsy for mid day rest covered over with own sat with head between hand eye closed wishing be not so stupid wishing must only think of something to do for in reality be quite wearied out if others did not come of course might come at moment yet moment passed to minute minute to hour while child slept in sunshine roy felt that be fool then something cold touched hand opened eye saw that be tumbu nose tumbu who have something strange in mouth something like rabbit yet like squirrel in reality be fresh killed young marmot animal life amid snow ice rock of very highest hill tumbu having handed over charge of child must have gone off on own hunting found colony of quaint creature a usual brought home bag roy did not in least know what marmot be

branch must not quite be avoided that one know be terribly sleepifying woke time however before fire be quite out hastened to send up flare of flame a did so last time be answered by hulloo from rock above shortly afterward meroo scullion blubbering voice must be heard a uttered thanks to heaven others asked roy anxiously a out of darkness meroo appeared cast at lad foot bellowing joy come come be short way back saw fire sight of warmed cockle of heart lo will cook once more will not die hungry in wilderness nay go not for roy be starting up true woman be nigh dead foster father hath finger

empire muttered lip almost refusing to form word heir to empire admired of world roy pointed to little tent there safe well asleep cried poor woman with sob sank a stood lay prone muttering long string of title before minute have passed foster father foster mother struggled into circle of light after word of question reply sank down also then there be long pause sign came of good old faithful tall gaunt figure at last roy spoke faithful asked in low whisper what of there be answer at first only foster father covered face with hand at last spoke gently be faithful to death be going first a ever cheering with saying of firdoos gita makani saw there one moment turning to tell word of wisdom next snow bridge have given way beneath foot be gone waited on bank of awful chasm for long time there be sound save roaring of stream below firdoos gita makani master have called peace be with chapter xv dearest lady for two whole day little party be too weary even to attempt move have provision with tumbu a good a word brought in more more marmot for being unaccustomed to dog be easily caught death of old faithful weighed upon spirit of for first twelve hour so heir to empire be inconsolable for loss of beloved cat for foster father have found impossible to carry down farther have remained behind in snow protesting piteously be terrible grief child have almost wept sick when to one surprise delight mistress down be seen walking sedately across flower bushy tail carried very high not one hair of silky white coat awry took notice of anybody passed to fire sat down beside with stiff dignity curled tail round paw yawned then began to purr gently be a if nothing have happened certainly be not hungry for turned up dainty nose at tumbu marmot bone cat said head nurse who have just awakened from long sleep of many hour be not to be counted a other beast having nine life must afford to lose one never do always fall on foot be way of world more have more get still be glad have returned wish there be chance of others turning up also added with sigh heir to empire looked up gravely faithful ca come back know went to help grand dad to help hark to innocent cried foster mother half in smile half in tear be true if ever poor mortal be watched over by saint in paradise be for part if ever get to kabul duty will be paid to tomb of firdoos gita makani on whom be peace amen added husband devoutly for memory of good man must not be here now be on third day that leaving meroo in charge for few hour foster father roy set off to explore be fortunate in finding shepherd hut within walking distance for even footsore woman returned ere nightfall with skin bag of fresh milk early next morning therefore set off roy girding on dead faithful sword from sledge be wanted more from moment feeling indeed bodyguard to heir to empire once have reached safety from starvation in shepherd hut great desire for rest came upon for three whole day did nothing eat sleep rejoice in early spring sunshine early spring flower for late snap of extreme cold have passed green thing be hurrying to be ahead of neighbour bija made endless cowslip ball out of beautiful rose pink primula while roy mirak following shepherd boy came back with hand full of young rhubarb shoot green fern crozier ate like asparagus sort of thing must not last long since be close to caravan route from kandahar to kabul sure enough sooner have snow on upland melted than traveller began to pas through thus news that little party have escaped death soon filtered from mouth to mouth till reached captain of escort ere long foster father found in care once more semi prisoner on way to cruel brother kumran more cruel doubtless because king humayon have already begun siege of kandahar believing little son to be still within wall now kumran be far cleverer fellow than brother askurry there be in love of deceit for deceit sake spoiled cleverness for made uncertain what must do in end indeed be always case with deceitful people know that what say do be not straightforward true so be like sailor without compass have fixed pole by to steer in addition kumran liked to be considered clever so be always outwardly very courteous very polite very charming what be within none must say for long thus foster father heart sank within when in distance down rocky ravine through kabul river dash along caravan road took high perched way saw battlemented wall of city cresting low hill on town be built be fully fortified town through river ran at extreme end commanding wider plain below stood citadel called bala hissar high fort to reach traveller have to cross iron bridge wend way through narrow bazaar such wonderful bazaar a be too crowded with tiny dark arched shop like cavern full to brim with persian silk carpet fur from north turquoise kind of precious stone from out of way place with unpronounceable name there be quantity of cat grey persian cat white one tabby black cat who sat on balcony stared at down a lay on horse chestnut broad wavy back for captain of escort have found out what excellent creature old pony be have brought along with high fort be huge place with great garden within battlement several separate palace here to foster father unbounded delight found that prince kumran be away having gone out with small body of men to kandahar frontier where king humayon arrival have aroused loyalty what be still more cheering be news that have left order for heir to empire sister to be handed over on arrival to charge of dearest lady foster father must hardly believe ear for dearest lady a be always called by family by nephew niece by grand nephew niece cousin one who be lucky enough to belong to be simply well what be not wise gentle good clever more be sort of dearest lady who lived so long in heart of who knew that year after be dead must say if there be difficult point to be settled wonder what dearest lady must have said be old of course for be babar brave elder sister sister to whom have be devoted who have always be to also dearest one now when come to think of boy girl be nice sort of fame to have to remain for let see how many hundred year nearly four dearest lady dearest gentleman to world dearest lady be of course heir to empire grand aunt mere sound of name be enough to calm foster father fear even head nurse though sniffed little said have heard tell that khanzada khanum be trifle careless of ceremonial be satisfied there be doubt that be highest born in land a for little prince akbar only opened big grave eye widely when tall white figure clasped closely in arm kissed hair softly so like grandfather murmured so like so like very hand very foot so strong so shapely in turn felt touch of soft old lip thou too small maiden continued kindly welcome to one who have never yet let be said in hearing that god made woman weaker than man thou shalt learn here to be proud thou wast born girl also nurse bring cooling sherbet slave while tell have happened then sat listened while head nurse told tale of what have happened faded gay old face flashed sparkled grew grave by turn where be tumbu interrupted where be down bring slave lo love animal a dear brother did laughed over doings wept over old faithful death while bija mirak sat cuddled up close beside listening also enjoying tale of own adventure a if have happened to other child surely said softly when head nurse ended dearest brother on whom be peace must have protected lo mirak bija for will call naught else since be sweet kindly name better than fine sounding title very afternoon ye will come with to garden loved where earthly form lie at rest lay flower on grave for thanks since loved flower a loved everything so that evening about hour before sunset time be carried in litter to garden of new year about mile beyond city be most peaceful lovely spot right up on hillside with splendid view from of valley mountain river fresh bubbling spring ran through beneath juda tree whose leafless branch be flushed with pink blossom stretched great carpet of spring flower pluck yonder tulip mirak said dearest lady with smile loved to count kind a wrote be 'yellow double scented like rose boy who be to grow to be greater man even than grandfather though must scarcely be more lovable one plucked posy of tulip laid on plain marble slab bore nothing word heaven be eternal home of emperor babar when bija with many little feminine ceremonial have deposited nosegay of sweet violet head nurse foster mother have offered up respect went sat down on grassy spot dearest lady who be always full of youthful curiosity concerning thing began to question roy who a mere lad have be allowed to come with a to what must remember of time before be picked up in desert hold hand child think said at last mayhap may come to thee then touch of kinship have power if mistake there be that in thy blood be in mine royalty so clasped roy slim long fingered hand held tight boy face changed eye grew startled shivered slightly said now do remember mother be like told have mark of kingship strong enough for rebel might say a spoke drew down loose garment there upon clear olive of breast just above heart showed small dark stain dearest lady bent close to look at what be't asked mother said be sign of uttermost truth that have replied speaking dreamily who be persisted dearest lady kind eye on lad just at moment however tumbu who have of course accompanied burst out with series of shrill short bark roy be on foot in second hand on old faithful sword lest newcomer might bring danger to little master a turned out tumbu be only excited by water rat same interruption prevented dearest lady question from being answered for spell be broken yea thou wilt be true to very uttermost of be sure said dearest lady half pleased half amused at young rajput quick leap to arm so long a have charge of heir to empire thou shalt be esquire so go call litter men boy be time returned must remember be gaoler a well a grand aunt chapter xvi cruel brother kumran if dearest lady be in truth gaoler be very kind one prison pleasantest prison in world must take too long to tell how happily next four month passed not only for two child for roy foster father head nurse foster mother even misshapen meroo in kitchen felt better for helping to cook khanzada khanum dinner for be one of dearest lady virtue always made people feel contented a if be doing right thing so even prince kumran when returned to kabul though frowned at big bold frank faced boy who claimed to be heir to empire own finger itched to have did not feel inclined to interfere with aunt truth being that like rest of family loved trusted beyond measure perhaps more than did of brother since have brought up a child in turn though knew fault though not only bewailed resented at time most fiercely must not forget that have be nursling must not forget above that be dear brother babar son thus went smoothly in bala hissar where young prince akbar now close on three year old looked talked acted like one of six same strength of be always getting into scrape with people who did not believe be so young knowing to be so young did not believe to be so strong played similar trick to one have played on cousin yakoob at kandahar on big cousin ibrahim prince kumran son be about fine kettledrum tasselled in royal fashion with gold silver that ibrahim father have given being selfish boy must not allow akbar to touch whereupon heir to empire after brief tussle carried off kettledrum beat loudly through palace kumran hearing of be very angry for beating of kettledrum be sign of empire keep that young fighting cock of thine in better order madam said to aunt will have to find sterner gaoler whereupon flashed out told fairly short of killing child for crime even be not prepared there be way of preventing heir to empire from being what be born king be way of quelling kumran by boldly setting aside thought of murder a impossible hoped to make so be not sure after kept mirak bija under control be not much good however when just a autumn be coming on news arrived from kandahar that humayon have at last succeeded in taking city disappointed in not finding son in palace be preparing to march on kabul then worst side of prince kumran showed at once like deceitful people be coward at heart cowardice made think of immediate revenge upon victorious brother of what use must even two victory be to if heir to empire be beyond recall so kumran charming polished manner vanished in instant one day without warning little mirak playing in garden be kidnapped by two stalwart abyssinian slave carried off howling horribly fighting with fist to palace where kumran wife lived tumbu who be with at time made gallant show of resistance actually bit one of kidnapper calf to bone when found confronted with whole regiment of armed men who ran out to assistance gave up hopeless fight flew off to tell roy what have happened roy missing little master fled to tell dearest lady face paled did not hesitate litter page cried drawing white veil closer round went straight to audience hall where kumran be receiving noble great age great nobility giving right even a woman to appear amongst eye turned to tall upright slim figure ear thrilled to tone of clear voice by what right asked have kumran nephew have nurtured stolen from care son of elder brother heir to empire babar brave gave dying into hand of humayon eldest son say there can be right if be wrong then will god curse light on man who undoes father work lo be worse than parricide for must kill that for father gave life now appeal be very strong one for story of how babar brave gave up own life to save of darling son humayon be one of most touching tale in indian history none of babar immediate family must even think of without strong emotion so be kumran turn to grow pale august lady replied evading question be matter of policy with woman have naught to do king humayon hath taken kandahar hath imprisoned degraded brother askurry for kumran challenge wherefore asked dearest lady boldly did not askurry deserve nay did not deserve death did not steal king of empire did not defy king did not send heir to empire away instead of returning to father keeping tell nephew kumran that father babar brave babar kindly babar generous babar just whom men loved for mercy must have given death for such fault given rightly will like fool court death also looked round assembly to see many sullen suspicious face understood that danger lay close at hand so resolution be taken in moment see went on nothing have be done yet to make forgiveness impossible well khanzada khanum old a be will go forth to meet king humayon plead thy cause will ask what boon wish promise will be yours humayon will give much in exchange for son none have ever denied anything will be so then seeing hesitation put in crafty word there will be time afterwards for anything kumran looked round noble then into own heart what saw there be such tissue of lie deceit that must find clear decision so a usual temporised be worth trial murmured might ask for much ask for everything said dearest lady who felt have gained point make one condition child must remain unharmed until return again kumran hesitated again looked in own heart again found clear cause for decision there so said doubtfully until return nay swear came high insistent voice say before 'by memory of dear father harm will come to child ere return ' half unwillingly kumran repeated word dearest lady gave sigh of relief have gained point now that have to face consequence of offer to go forth meet humayon heart sank within for be very old

summer passed in early autumn king humayon who have now wasted nearly whole year in amusement found necessary to quell rebellion in neighbouring province so governorship of kabul be made over to trusted noble of court one shurruf khan by name who be made a be regent for little prince akbar who be left with attendant in regal state at palace in bala hissar while queen humeeda went back to india taking bija with on visit to mother relation roy whose story have become known in court be now made equerry to young prince very handsome looked in chain armour with noonday sun rayed shiny in gold on breast in token that claimed to be sun hero a indeed seemed likely since afghan sentry old suryamer friend have tale about young rajah who have be kidnapped be supposed left in desert to die whether roy be young rajah not who must tell might send story to suryamer see what befell meanwhile roy be happy little akbar became more more like elder younger brother how much in after year prince owed to companionship of friend of childhood be impossible to say perhaps account for marvellous way in great emperor akbar ruled hindoo subject humayon have expected to return in month time luck be against king can not waste whole year in amusement so let wicked men have time to hatch plot without suffering for humayon did suffer have to march counter march with winter coming on apace until be struck down by sudden illness at first news caused alarm for be known to be strong healthy there came day when folk began to whisper that king be said to be lying unconscious that death might come moment news stirred whole city of kabul to depth have lately passed into hand of humayon there be not wanting many who preferred kumran kumran be in exile waiting opportunity that came with suddenness of summer storm one night gate of town be closed by regent shurruf khan in humayon name next dawn saw iron entry after brief scuffle opened in name of kumran there be rush of armed men through street of town murder two of loyal men in high authority then up at bala hissar foster father roused from sleep went in haste to regent expecting to hear bugle to find troop gathering for defence gate of fort be open shurruf khan be traitor have gone over to enemy ere hour be over kumran scowling walked up down royal apartment king once more biting lip frowning over something stood between perfect revenge foster father good old fool be back in dungeon in well where time must rot woman a change be walled up in tiny room where bread water being thrust in to might eat live starve die a chose heir to empire what of ah fool that have be to make promise to crafty old woman who have died in order to spite kumran anger rose fierce must have given anything to break oath must not be not strong enough even wickedness be not real short of death young heir must have shelter kumran flung into miserable cell close to iron gate thought more of now for faithful roy akbar must indeed have be in sorry plight have barely enough to eat roy stinted eating nothing hard half burned crust of coarse hearth cake excusing from even touching miserable mess of pea porridge on ground that did not like so grew thin brown deer eye have startled look indeed hardly slept at watched dozed beside little master night long yet be always cheerful always ready with story song when must not remember new old one took to inventing tale of people who be always in danger difficulty who took notice of who went on way trusting in truth for see must finish gravely who have truth need fear ruth so ever always hero came out of trial scathless by degree faith in final good grew deep into boy heart showed in very face by word said afghan sentry whom chance one day sent to guard ye be precious pair of king must admire though did not seem in least ashamed of having yet once more turned coat for be again on kumran side how time passed none of prisoner cared to count one day sudden roar of great gun told that city be once more besieged in truth humayon hearing while still on bed of sickness fatal news of shurruf khan treachery have strained nerve ill a be to come to rescue of little son be midwinter pass be blocked with snow troop have to meet endless hardship at last be before kabul once more camped on arkaban hill opposite iron gate artillery be brought into position first shot fired must take too long to follow varied incident of siege one thing be constant night after night recruit from inside town managed to scale wall join king humayon force be getting tired of kumran who unable to satisfy cruelty on little heir to empire vented on sundry day by day a number of besieged dwindled bit after bit of town fell into besieger hand until at last only bala hissar remained bala hissar be town in many time have withstood siege successfully now however be near to death there must be no more talk thought of escape kumran ever half hearted tried one night failed losing many follower in attempt after face hardened went about dreaming of revenge revenge on humayon even revenge on dearest lady who have tied hand till return dead folk can never return to worldly even memory come seldom save to pure in heart one night hit on plan fort be almost at last gasp day sumbal khan humayon famous artillery general have be pounding away at iron gate with deadly aim few more well sent shot must leave bastion crumbling then then must come assault through breach kumran knew must not face force be too small so about midnight door of akbar prison room be opened kumran with few armed men stood within roy startled from doze be on foot in second what want ye challenged fiercely let hindoo fool alone said kumran to who must have seized on rajput lad want be child take slave be quick about ere word be out of mouth stalwart man bent to lift sleeping heir to empire roy sword flashed same second held back by sneering men be helpless what want ye with say what want ye with panted poor lad a struggled madly kumran paused at door to turn icy cold look of cruelty upon what thou wouldst know then thou shalt have young idolater may cool thy hot blood will dress in dust colour like wall of kabul hang over battlement at dawn a mark for brother artillery then will see breach in citadel made then will see revenge will not be of making father will kill so with mirthless laugh followed men who be bearing away heir to empire still half awake roy stood for one second like stone too horror stricken for full belief echoing laugh convinced with wild cry rushed to narrow window shook fruitlessly at iron bar like wild animal when be newly caged be immovable yet something must be done something something thought of dawn be too dreadful beautiful calm peaceful april dawn shadowy grey just light enough to see outline of bala hissar just light enough to begin upon breach once more too dark to see what be in line of fire yes something must be done done swiftly not four hour left before eastern hill must begin to show dark against coming of day chapter xx escaped once more roy felt helpless hopeless before great task seemed to be laid upon alone out of little heir to empire guardian knew dire danger be in yet how must poor prisoned rajput lad save young prince still have to be saved must be saved there be time to be lost at dawn firing must recommence from arkaban hill at dawn helpless child must be in half breached bastion exposed to fire yes roy must get out somehow if must only loosen one bar of window so that must squeeze through then might be able to let down by rope twined out of long waist cloth turban thus might be able to get out of fort might be able to gain camp on arkaban hill before dawn so might be able to warn gun not to fire on bastion might be able to tell that heir to empire hung there what number of might be ables must be able even for first task took up sword began forthwith on iron bar mortar be hard must scarcely make mark upon still must be done in order to free arm better for work took off clothes save flimsy sleeveless waistcoat loin cloth be girt about buckled down steadily when more than hour have passed bar seemed a firm a ever a crouched down on window sill must see through to flat roof of neighboring palace for be bright moonlight night still though moon must be nigh to setting so thought crossed mind that if must only squeeze through might be able to reach one of roof since if remembered aright wide cornice ran just below paused for second in labour to see if be so craning head through crossbar yes cornice be there scarcely wide enough for cat to walk if got through in time must risk must risk must get through in time set to work again feverishly until suddenly familiar sound reached ear from outside sound of cat purring must be down have not found out in new prison if have happened to be on roof when looked out of window might have seen smelled yes there be white cat on cornice next moment down be on sill arching back purring away contentedly so have found at last not for heir to empire be not there have be stolen away roy must have leaned head on down soft fur cried heart out in despair at own helplessness set teeth instead dug harder with sword point must bar never loosen so minute passed without sound save grating of eager sword soft soothing purr of cat a sat beside watching indifferently then suddenly latter ceased down leaped swiftly to floor of cell doubtless heard something cat hear so many thing human hear seem to know so many thing human know so perhaps heard mouse far down arched passage even in next cell anyhow marched straight to door stood by miaowing to be let out ah if only must let out if door be only open thought poor roy a worked away at still immovable bar down ca murmured bitterly a cat miaowed more more insistently still miaowing went on down became quite plaintive then ill used finally leaped onto roy shoulder licked ear with rough red tongue a if to coax be back again at door asking to be let out why be so set on roy turned to look at half stupidly for moment forgot task forgot how rapidly time be passing forgot everything save down be asking to be let out so wearily passed to door scarcely conscious of what be doing laid hand on latch ca down said ca open broke off hurriedly for latch yielded door opened must never have be locked have forgotten having secured heir to empire have not cared what became of henchman latter most likely for there be sentry in arched passage along down have already disappeared second roy sword in hand have disappeared down also remembering a ran certain little fretted marble balcony gave on garden below for roy of course knew turn of bala hissar balcony opened onto unused gallery room to gain bolt heavy door behind so secure from interruption set to work twining rope from strip torn from turban waistband did not take long be good twenty minute before have knotted fast though while worked thought of nothing else of nothing somehow reaching garden once there must face next difficulty one be enough at time then when have made rope fast to one of marble pillar slid down proved too short swung with foot just touching topmost branch of blossoming peach tree there be nothing for to let go snatch at branch a fell trust to chance for safety found dropped to ground amid perfect shower of shed peach petal so stood for instant to consider what must come next gate aye farthest from point of attack must be best a there must be le vigilance there meant delhi gate meant also long round yet must be quick for already there be faint lightening of eastern sky moon have set shadow always darker in hour before dawn lay upon thing luckily knew turn of bala hissar garden knew point where danger might be expected so began to make way carefully dodged more than one sentry by creeping on through bush while man passed away from crouched among still a mouse while measured march came toward once have to run for bare life from shower of arrow company of soldier sent into darkness after suspicious rustling in bush mostly men on duty have too much to think of outside wall to trouble much about thing inside so with doubling turning came at last on delhi gate small round flat roofed building pierced by high archway be too dark for to see outline knew well paused against outside wall to consider what have to do next place seemed almost deserted glimmer of light from archway even tramp of sentry footstep told be not unguarded what be to do must be useless for to try steal past sentry a gate beyond must be locked at rate bolted barred must either therefore try overpower man else try to gain flat roof by stair of knew position trusting to find rope something of sort in upper room of gate let down into ditch outside now roy be well grown lad of nigh fifteen tall for age with light youthful sinew of iron might well be match for many man especially a purpose be like steel be ever battle there be chance of other soldier being within call might mean failure now must not be roy have to succeed must therefore roof be wiser safer plan must make for stair trusting to escape notice when sentry back be turned till then silence even a settled in mind fate be against a crouched in darkness something cold suddenly touched face next moment clamour of excited yappings joyful bark arose a something warm furry cold slobbery flung over tumbu must be nothing blundering bumbling tumbu made one useless effort to still dog then rose to foot feeling discovered prepared to run for be too late sentry lantern in hand roused by commotion barred way seemed lost ray of hope shone when familiar voice of afghan sentry unrepentant turncoat be heard a lantern waved in roy very face by word one of king how come hither at time o ' night friend voice be little thick a if owner finding quiet of delhi gate wearisome have sought amusement in skin of wine roy gave gasp be too confused for thought dog began aye dog be yours be mine jeered sentry so nosed out did know duty good dog tumbu know master now know who saved from starvation when be lurking about in gutter eh brute lunged kick at tumbu who retreated step looking from new to old master feeling in truth trifle confused for afghan sentry have certainly found homeless friendless dog have stuck by feeling that here at least be something vaguely connected with past life now stood doubtful expectant little ear pricked small eye watchful well continued sentry with half drunken laugh dog dog have business here so come along with king reached out heavy hand roy shrunk from a did so there came sound sent blood to roy heart with spasm of instant hope of possible escape be be low growl a realised that one wanted to touch old master that old master did not want to be touched at tumbu at good dog word came to roy in flash like flash great powerful dog leaped forward fur bristle white teeth gleaming next instant taken by suddenness of attack sentry lay on back half stunned by fall while tumbu on top of checked even cry by clutch at throat soft clutch so far one must tear through flesh if needful roy be on knee beside fallen man hist not sound dog will kill can give key want to get out of gate key do hear sentry tried to struggle warned by weight of dog on breast sharp teeth ready to close upon throat murmured hoarsely be only barred bolt be difficult if will let get up call off dog roy took heed of word keep there tumbu whispered a ran to gate bolted barred be in darkness of archway be hard to see for lantern have gone out in scuffle there be time to lose for already beyond archway showed faintly light one bar down sentry made faint effort to stir be answered by ominous growl from tumbu only one more bolt now roy long finger be at whole strength went to creaked groaned slid with sob of exultation roy felt fresh air of dawn in face a stood outside bala hissar have still much to do city must be skirted hill of arkaban gained already faint primrose streak in eastern sky told of coming light chapter xxi dawn upon arkaban hill artillery men be already at work in day gun be not what be now quick loading quick firing needed good hour to ram coarse powder down adjust round ball prepare priming to say nothing of task of aiming so long ere dawn glimmering light be seen about battery perched on hill gave on half breached bastion between two stretched open space of undulating ground sumbal master fireworker a be called in old history book be up betimes seeing to men with came grave silent man who though have interest in quarrel of humayon brother be a eager a to get within wall of kabul find what sought rajput lad of whom word have be brought to little half desert rajput state lying far away in jesulmer plain for grave silent man who showed so much knowledge of warfare who be keen to see everything new in weapon handling of be messenger sent by widowed mother to see if indeed must be long lost son of whom certain old trooper have spoken on return from kabul see said sumbal who be bit of boaster give time to aim will warrant 'thunder of god ' be name let in with gold on breech of gun will hit mark within yard time thou shalt see ere long there be sort of pigeon place on face of bastion where will aim thou shalt see splinter of spin shaded eye with hand looked piercingly into shadow be too dark to see yet so soon a show will let fly then then roy who have never stopped for breath yet in headlong race be at very moment rounding on bastion looking up saw what have feared to see little figure bound hand foot to framework of wood that hung close to what sumbal have called pigeon place seeming to form part of child be not cry perhaps be past that perhaps have never cried have taken last urgent danger a have taken others with grave dignity know be that hung there on wall that before very eye light be growing in east over in hill battery dozen men be sweating away to bring thunder of god into position roy gave gasp must call to little heir to empire let know that friend be near help might come perhaps did not realise danger be better to let be so gathering force for last effort dashed into open for final five minute run there must be dodging here loophole of bastion be knew crammed with matchlock of many marksman there be now worse luck little darkness to cover three minute more friend said sumbal boastfully thou shalt see what thou wilt see slave port fire quick will give signal lo what be up rattle of musketry rose on still air of dawn artillery man leaned over low embrasure to see better into intervening valley one escaping said with yawn for have be up night lo run like hare will have for sure quick called sumbal will silence noise portfire say will fire old thunderer man carrying flaming flashlight handed to superior in so doing by mischance dropped in dropping went out fool cried sumbal passionately be to stand insulted here without reply while thou fetchest put in iron sergeant bring light at once grave silent rajput be watching runner be boy said slowly yet see how run have hit for stagger yet come on must bring news friend for sure illustration stay hand while count ten more news echoed sumbal contemptuously have hundred such runaway coming in day be news that king humayon be better liked than kumran lo hast thou at last snatched portfire from sergeant went toward gun stay one moment friend said grave silent man with sudden command in voice moment hastiness may bring disaster discretion be better than valour yonder boy brings news wave arm shout stay at least till can hear what say sumbal laughed bah see stay hand while count ten more one two three four artillery men amused at race leaned over run well will win will lose climb like hill cat five six seven eight nine now unintelligible from sheer breathlessness roy voice be heard grave silent rajput leap out to meet ten sumbal hand swing portfire to breech roy see throw up arm wildly with cry bastion bastion heir to empire fall headlong into rajput arm what did say asked master fireworker pausing half surprised half angry rajput be too busy tearing aside roy flimsy bloodstained waistcoat to answer something about bastion heir to empire master said sergeant doubtfully mayhap 'twould be a well to wait till can see more clearly kumran added in lower voice must stick at naught sumbal hesitated then put down portfire walked over to fallen lad beside whom stranger be kneeling be not dead be not dead said grave silent rajput looking up face working tear streaming down bronzed cheek master be not dead who asked sumbal uncomprehending knew must be went on man exultantly even in grief none must do sort of thing save sun hero master king see here race mark on breast sign of uttermost truth master king roy did not hear called thus did not even know for day afterwards if have succeeded if have failed for wound just above heart close to sign mark of race very nearly carried off into shadowy land where thing be remembered yet be forgotten have succeeded have saved heir to empire life that dawn day two afterwards kumran daily more hated for cruelty have escaped soldier rejoiced to get rid of flung open gate of bala hissar thus ending prince akbar adventure when roy came to mirak be sitting beside down be purring on bija lap bija who have just returned from india with queen humeeda in time to console heir to empire for must have suffered during few day be left alone with cruel uncle kumran how much have suffered no one knew little fellow refused to say anything about be way have when luck went against so just a have remarked when have fallen down ravine when white cat black dog first came to that have tumbu down so now simply said that be very comfy that tumbu have come to see more than once be possible for may be sure once allowed afghan sentry to rise tumbu being wise dog never went near again therefore have to find old master foster father foster mother head nurse be there latter greatly subdued for time in gratitude to roy inclined to give of title be wont to bestow on little prince akbar for there be doubt that
