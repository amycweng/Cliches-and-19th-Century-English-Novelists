closed door run to bastion fling over parapet wall so find shelter in kwaja kwarka house holiest man in city thousand pity indeed that baisanghar have sunk so low aye dearest one be right one must condemn sin yet do justice to sinner yet there be lack of kingliness too be inexcusable to allow brother ali to escape also be perhaps to err on side of mercy to submit to be beaten by in battle immediately afterwards be distinctly unnecessary complicated matter too most dreadfully for here be baisanghar acclaimed by people more le imprisoned in city of samarkand ali mirza nominated by court beleaguering from bokhara side while khosrau shah relieved from necessity of defending hissar for nincompoop by withdrawal of sultan hussain back to khorasan be hastening all knew to put in oar for

young master coat of mail latter pored over memoir of great ancestor timur to see what wrinkle must pick up in regard to disposition of troop in real fine fight for being born general be dissatisfied with what have seen even with uncle hussain smart soldier only dearest one took interest in military preparation embroidered flag with crinkled gold sat on roof watched young king ride out in bravery then prayed god for safety also for safety of other one who deserved none for time prayer be answered summer passed on to winter still samarkand protected city have never really fallen sat gaily secure in wide suburb vast network of fortified garden scarcity indeed pressed harder outside wall than within then nincompoop whose only object apparently in advancing on samarkand have be to pursue mistress daughter of high court official succeeded in marrying so retreated thus babar found confronting baisanghar supported by populace ali by court waited looked at other for time then one morning after preliminary babar moved army twelve mile down right bank of river kohik ali mirza moved down left so with army behind though must seem somewhat helpless for support protection two young prince with five follower rode from own side to middle of stream with chill water just touching horse belly agreed that if summer came again must harry samarkand together after solemn ceremonial ali returned

raider shaibani khan be said to be on way with large force to intervene in quarrel danger have to be faced babar felt in view of first that must cantoon men set to work marking out ground for hut

that fully soldier be away seeking winter quarter babar put force have with in array marched out to meet enemy boldness met with reward shaibani withdrew after giving young king night of sleepless

practically given up kingship for sake of womenkind have have fair grip of samarkand even with thousand devoted follower of own to help hold must nay must have done so babar did not attempt to deny virtue never did be too frank to gloze over of action good bad have done right thing accepted fact gravely perhaps trifle pompously be nature in same way must not fail to see that what have placed in unfortunate position of having insufficient follower to hold samarkand andijan be error of judgment on part simply extreme unusual justice in refusing to grind down distressed inhabitant of former city for benefit of soldiery must only have shut eye to usual undisciplined plunder army must not have deserted wholesale be not introspective knew vaguely that have somehow have choice in matter have be born with strong sense of justice so must not help therefore despite recognition of own virtue slipped from like water off duck back leaving self conceit behind so welcomed loving woman quite whole

day of babar strict discipline be more than enough for wild men of desert very next morning moghul begs represented that having mere handful of men possible benefit must result to anyone from keeping of one miserable castle so there being truth in remark rode off to desert again unabashed leaving babar to return annoyed not despondent for at particular fortress there grew particular melon yellow

babar preferred laconic remark in great ancestor autobiography prince of india be at variance with one resolved to make master of indian empire did so be however more intimate personal experience old woman held by virtue of dead interest of hers fired babar imagination fragment of half forgotten past be not always to be got at long year of common round daily task have overlaid needed subtle touch upon instrument to make vibrate once more babar found key there be certain turkhoman ballad called maid of spring invariably unlocked old woman memory so often a sat over camp fire at night babar smiling to must say song song let sing 'the maid of spring ' together once more grandmother there be none sings a thou dost be true still toneless treble of old voice whining away like fine whing of

about see grandmother begin tell of young woman thy man met at lahore then thou wilt remember to nicety so summer passed until old isan daulet arriving from samarkand with news of dearest one set babar mind jogging once more over enemy shaibani there be nothing to be done in winter time such bitter cold winter too more than one man died of even babar admitted that after diving sixteen time in swift succession into river be only unfrozen in middle by reason of swift current extreme chilliness of water quite penetrated bone a well might then early spring brought great grief gave pause to energy nevian gokultash be done to death by scoundrel who be jealous of babar affection for who have temerity to say that faithful creature have fallen over precipice when be drunk nevian who adhered so strictly to law of islam nevian who have always sided for sobriety who have be to full a urgent a old kasim beg against king giving up to wine babar helpless to follow murderer felt deeply death of playmate in childhood companion of boyhood there be few person for whose loss must have grieved so much so long for week ten day thought of nothing else unbidden tear be ever in eye after great restlessness set in fostered by old isan daulet whose whole life have be one long succession of battle murder sudden death whose belief in moghul troop never wavered why suggested not go to uncle khan at tashkend mother have be ill must like to see once more if tongue be sufficiently careful amongst thirty two teeth might get substantial help for what gloomed babar to get back akshi lose andijan get andijan lose akshi 't be one in end not fine fighting child replied old lady craftily be same be in gehannum bihisht hell heaven be undoubtedly true there be good to be gained by rambling from hill to hill a have be doing so once more young adventurer gathered together very scanty band of follower for old kasim beg who till then have never left have come to word with isan daulet over same moghul refused to accompany say not sire remonstrated wise old soldier that men be bad soldier for be for most exalted who have idea of discipline besides care not to risk own neck for chance in obedience to most exalted command beheaded quite number of men in last campaign for marauding wherefore therefore must go amongst mourning relative will come if there be fighting then there be leisure little desire for private revenge blood can be let anywhere one corpse be a good a so kasim went with immediate adherent towards hissar babar set off to tashkend with rather heavy heart in somewhat didactic mood also for resting for day two beside spring in lower hill caused verse to be inscribed on stone slab formed one side of well where water gushed in from hill above to disappear into earth when have run through masonry trough many man have rested have drunk thy water like thee o spring have sunk swift to grave where lie forgot conqueror vanquished libertine monk be not however at home in rubai a have not at time studied with much attention style phraseology of poetry indeed one of first action on reaching tashkend be to submit of composition to khan who have pretension to taste who moreover wrote verse though ode to be sure be rather deficient in manner substance younger poetaster however did not get either explicit satisfactory criticism came to conclusion that uncle have great skill in poetic diction did not know for instance that in turkhi language be allowable by poetic licence to interchange certain letter for sake of rhyme will think thee nincompoop stormed isan daulet why didbet not show thy sword play may see that ere long quoth babar grimly went straight away to write first ghazel of six couplet ever composed have found faithful friend in world save own sad soul dear heart thou must give spend on thy confidence whole nightingale sings to rose rose give scent to bird dream one of thorny foe other of passion deferred exile must live apart to coffer none give lend banished one hold heart to soul a lover friend be quite pleased with effusion sang at festive party soon after with great gusto next morning found that golden clasp of girdle have be stolen by one of appreciative audience moghul again chapter x blow two then fighting end sword seek scabbard warrior wends through death wide door be not wiser then to sleep until retreat message sends so vaguely thought babar a life went on dully with family party at tashkend most of servant have left from absolute want one at most two attendant be that must muster when went to pay compliment to khan uncle once indeed accompanied latter on foray be useless sort of expedition khan took part beat enemy simply went out came back again young man spent much of time with mother who be convalescing slowly naturally after so many year of absence saw much of sister cousin most of elderly woman inclined to make much of handsome young king errant whose melancholy never must withstand faintest joke for babar at bottom of heart be utterly dissatisfied with world never since debacle at samarkand have found again light hearted intensely vital person who taking thing a came must yet turn to own us began to tell privately that rather than pas life a be now doing homeless purposeless must be better to retire into corner where might live unknown undistinguished that rather than exist in distress abasement far better be to flee away from sight of man so far a foot must carry in infancy remembered have always have strong desire to see china have never be able to accomplish wish because of being king having duty towards relation connection now no longer have throne now mother only tie left for ayesha wife have never returned to be safe with mother brother now therefore be time mother however knew well must not support proposition besides have still few follower who having attached to with very different hope must be bitterly disappointed at project must not bear to hurt anyone feeling so devised plan in order to get away quietly have never seen other uncle younger khan of outer moghulistan why must not go in slack time pay visit there seemed indeed reason against babar be on very point of starting when messenger arrived hot haste to say that younger khan be on way to see nephew nephew mother be blow babar plan be utterly disconcerted being like race full of family affection set off with ever so many elderly khanums with beautiful high sounding name to meet uncle meeting a be so many embracing kneeling yet more embracing ceremonious others quite without form decorum after great circle of cousin aunt uncle nephew sat down continued talking about past occurrence old story till after midnight younger uncle have according to custom of tribe brought babar complete dress of state cap embroidered with gold thread long frock of china satin ornamented with flowered needle work cuirass of fine chain mail chinese fashion with whetstone purse pocket from be suspended lot of little trinket such a woman wear including bag of perfumed earth looked very smart in indeed when returned to own tricked out in finery declared be only by voice recognised that have thought be grand young sultan life at rate did not seem quite so empty since two khan having got together began to propose joint expedition to recover andijan for babar being understood corollary so long a remained under influence of stern old isan daulet who ruled son in matriarchal fashion so set off with flaunting pennon kettledrum after manner of moghul army at first halt held muster of troop also in moghul fashion in group of three three horse tail standard be erected from centre staff of long strip of white cloth be fastened on loose end of stood foot of leader of division around in huge circle troop be drawn up then with many ceremonial sprinkling of mare milk spirit leader estimated total number of force final verdict being received with wild war shout then at full speed whole army galloped centre ward foremost trooper drawing bridle within foot two of standard on occasion babar looked with certain awe yet misgiving at le than thirty thousand wild horseman of desert have more certain aid than found that be not forgot in little valley at extreme limit of habitable world country people welcomed return with acclaim so a soon a must with curious distrust of moghul blood make name given to dynasty founded in india so quaintly ironical parted company with uncle force pushing on with such of own people a have come together sought for fine fighting got still reckless almost without definite aim followed swift on opportunity for skirmish when saw body of enemy advanced at full gallop without minding order array in nine case out of ten sheer daredevil clash succeeded enemy must not stand charge fled without exchanging blow sometimes ill luck with moghul pursued once when with staff be waiting outside andijan for return of messenger be about third watch of night of be nodding others fast asleep on horse when at once saddle drum struck up with martial noise hubbub few men who be with babar be seized with panic took to flight except three rest ran off to man in vain four galloped after fugitive in vain horsewhipped of exertion be ineffectual to make stand there be nothing for to try check pursuer a best must so four turned stood discharged flight of arrow until enemy

that man master of twenty thirty thousand retainer must in space of day without battle without contest be reduced to give up to needy fugitive like who have only two hundred tatterdemalion at back in greatest want that must no longer have power over own servant over own wealth even own life be wonderful disposition of omnipotent undoubtedly a enemy who be thus discomfited be le person khosrau man who have so treacherously caused prince baisanghar to be strangled be certain that lack of power over own life be sore temptation to babar man undoubtedly deserved death be indeed conformable to law human divine that such must meet with condign punishment agreement have be entered into so must be left free unmolested allowed to carry off a much of personal property a must for babar be promise

too good natured however to resist making everyone a happy a be especially after old isan daulet arrived with bride in pocket so before quite realised magnitude of affair be duly wedded to yet cousin half sister of dead prince baisanghar be year older than groom very very beautiful babar came out from bridal chamber with stern set mouth went straight to mother tell to say more of dearest one said briefly there will be trouble a well if left baisanghar in peace also loved doubtless so did voice softened over last word trouble however be not to be avoided babar made more complaint possibly because gave few opportunity for fresh injury mother wept scolded in vain that hurt for cousin wife cared not at all be proud must not understand woman petty spite especially when shown to good looking young king in zenith of success agree said gloomily lo be true what saadi saith 'in good man house cross grained wife make hell upon earth with ill tempered strife ' mayhap if part may come

after missive arrived from uncle sultan hussain begging for assistance at khorasan against arch enemy raider shaibani khan who threatened inroad babar felt pleased at what seemed order from fate especially a missive came by hand of rather quaint ambassador namely by son of uncle professional dreamer of dream to be sure cousin gharib have made fun of man pretension there be more in sort of
