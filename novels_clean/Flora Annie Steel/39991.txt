that whiskey soda here qui hi whiskey sharab belatee pani la ' o juldi mem sahiba jata hai bring whiskey soda mem be going perhaps command of assertion helped to decision at rate did not countermand spent rather awkward pause inevitably ensued in perfect field day of hat pin among curl veil whereat george dillon despite certain bruised feeling smiled telling be true woman nevertheless when a be stepping into dogcart friendly help came necessarily to fore again reverted to dignified resentment ought said stiffly to have thanked for for good opinion of evident desire to be kind do so now fear

etiquette on such occasion keep aspiration to have be impossible for instantly to rejoin society in found be society shared that fundamental crime more even than definite jealousy have roused anger against captain dering of being alien to creed custom code of conduct towards woman so have wandered off into garden again shadowed by old akbar incredulity curiosity sympathy until partly from sheer impatience mostly from sheer inherited habit of employing such a akbar khan in anything approaching intrigue have made clean breast of situation even latter however have a be shied at extreme novelty of idea when be first mooted by degree vast possibility of advantage to faithful old retainer overpowered abject terror at bare idea of father narayan suspecting thing old master told be old indeed god only knew if must last year day therefore must be well to ensure favour of new mistress there must be harm in sounding a to what course favour must follow one must never tell with woman wicked experienced old eye have caught many hint of anari begum in laila childhood perhaps have changed since went to calcutta must try so when on morning after ball laila in obedience to pious resolve to hing really wrong have bidden with threat of vengeance if betrayed fact of having come at remove return certain tray of clothes jewel have be smuggled by someone into room have fallen at foot confessed falsely that be offender besought not to impose so unmerited disgrace on employer who have be actuated by ordinary rule of native etiquette prescribed recognition of cousin head of family

frock heavy eyed almost sallow from last night dissipation so grandmother say be dancing girl real dancing girl even surprise curiosity be listless yet next moment while akbar be protesting superiority of anari begum over dancing girl of vast experience have burst into sudden laugh uncovered one of tray with kick sent first one then other of bronze slipper flying seized on pair of silver anklet there be centring persian rug spread on marble floor a if have be born to coquetting pirouetting with challenging clash half impudent jerk of jingle for world like pigeon on window sill like something else also so that old akbar felt shiver run through lest after first impression must prove right be no more than simulacrum ghost changeling come to posse usually indifferent lazy miss baba yet when of sudden raised white muslin skirt high in hand began to sing at top of voice wicked little love song vincent dering have sung first day met old akbar dread turned to sheer wonder be not ghost devil reckless unrestrained with fling of white arm kick of white foot held to rhythm by outrageous frivolity of song until with last staccato note threw in chair breathless gurgling with laughter sheer mischief lo akbar gasped grandmother never danced like did believe be grandmother believe be telling story akbar looked wise thrust out folded hand in cringing protest most noble say true anari begum never danced thus there be grandfather bun avatar sahib bahadur to be accounted for also laila frowned reminder brought back other side of story to have listened so often from guardian lip while pretended indifference masked real pride of grandfather gallantry good look love of adventure of someone else also who have always have secret attraction for girl that most beautiful woman in rome companion of prince divine singer best dearest laila laughter failed rose going over to window looked out absently startling pigeon into flight sun turned breast purple green gold a fluttered down to renew pirouetting on cupola below just above river below again be roof of balcony where have sat with vincent girl eye grew soft understood now that best dearest that most beautiful must have loved guardian be secret of remembrance how must one ever forget that one have sat in balcony hand in hand so content yet saying so little only feeling have said thing have said be beautiful that ought always to wear that dress have told must not that must send back that must learn to like a much in ordinary clothes that must never see in dress again after why not if turned suddenly to go between there be need to take back to day said sharply thou canst tell person who sent who claim cousinship will not keep know nothing of that must send take away akbar with inward determination to hing so palpably foolish salaamed down to ground presence said in doing showed dignity be undoubtedly right course to pursue in mean time must begum sahiba must excuse tongue must not always bear with paltry present remembered fact of past possibility of future not temper noble severity with usual courtly favour cousin grandmother most virtuous princess sister to late nawab be still alive memory of bun avatar sahib be still so green that doubtless must be able to tell begum sahiba many thing of mere mean slave must not be cognizant most virtuous most interesting one have long be anxious to return visit begum sahiba have graciously paid in company with missen miss what that funny old fat woman interrupted laila with laugh dirty old thing remember did claim to be

since missen lady receive know like when will come will be at night of course to ensure privacy so pidar narayan need know nothing only paused change swept over face leaving dimpled cunning full of mischief cajolery do naught for naught if please thee thou must please if thou art messenger thou must be mine also tell pidar narayan akbar khan wicked old eye positively leered approval waggled head chuckled wherefore not be there better more careful messenger in world than one more capable of deft arranging want none put in with quick distaste shrinking from manner 't be to take note to dering sahib must know somewhat before come with other sahib logue afternoon there be arrangement needed fuss how must there be asked a after old sinner have gone off charmed at renewal of once familiar occupation sat on window sill looking down on roof of balcony where have be so content for what must be simpler than to make quite clear that be real that did not pretend that be not even afraid that briefly be not like mr smith who took so much one must not help seeing gave so little one must not help seeing that also for what be thanks many captain dering in return for trouble lavished on so came to pas that when vincent dering went to palace afternoon word be haunting heart brain a juliet word must have haunted romeo more no le slid into filled up blank between word of own have spoken carelessly not five minute before have first seen laila came back to memory unbidden be altogether despicable to let loose in paradise without arriere pensee of flaming sword especially if can give pleasure to someone else thereby one must play romeo juliet in garden nicely well have played for hour two swept off foot by chance whether must continue to play be unsettled till note came that ended vague reluctance went over to palace eager a lover must be for interview suggested in old place when grows dusk people will mostly have gone for of camp who be bound to follow viceroy whim of riding by old road pilgrim road while big camp went round by longer easier route have promised to look in on palace on way past for cup of tea good by since already function over dream city have begun to melt away host of lord sahib be passing on glory be said commissioner with heart felt gratitude have done worst leave to take consequence be sound policy anyhow be ahead of everybody on road to heaven pilgrim will have to swallow dust of foot wonder how will like be in wild spirit like schoolboy escaped from school yet a paused to shake hand with dr dillon said aside more case two said doctor laconically dead be bad type hearer face be unmovable a turned to mr smith who stood close by good by dear lady said cheerfully remember house be yours if child want doctor must conscientiously recommend change of air to hill must ye swear close proximity to open canal gaol be unwholesome if ye must 'd oblige grass widower whose wife be at baden baden be marienbad living prodigally while have to fill with husk self respecting swine must eat faith dear madam 'd bless if 'd come kill cook be woman work not man dr dillon with quick look backed up instantly certainly told mr smith long time ago gladys have have enough of eshwara indeed a doctor must be doing personal favour if muriel smith swept round on sharply be looking very best in very best gown white mystic wonderful with faint gleam of silver embroidery about waist hem have be obtrusively unnecessarily friendly with vincent dering afternoon even now be standing with attached to apron string think nervous headache be dangerous said eying dr dillon coolly thanks same must love to kill somebody even cook perhaps may by by when nice people leave be so sorry be going be still to be quite gay be captain dering reminds have to settle when riding party be to come off good by good by waved hand to departing commissioner carried vincent dering off with defiant look at doctor knowing smiled indulgently father ninian who have come down to see guest off looked after with wistful pain in kind old face be mistake said briefly then wistfulness grew into puzzled look added half to need not be surely there be something wrong ca understand dr dillon catching end of remark gave cynical laugh turned on heel one doe said a went off must not discus even with dear old pidar narayan for rest though be keen to get back to jail must wait till tired of game then drive home to idiot of husband who be too busy over blessed search light to see thing be going on under very eye captain dering however be already impatient be growing dusk shadow be claiming garden bit by bit a glint left varnished leaf of orange tree white flower stood out like little star against gloom sent bewildering perfume into darkening air must see hint of laila anywhere laila in detestable white muslin garment made long vainly to get rid of surroundings suited so ill drive civilized crew from garden claim a own hers must have gone to balcony already must be waiting for yet soft heartedness for other woman with whom have be friend whom for few day have imagined loved have come to now forbade from leaving cavalierly so be long past dusk short indian twilight be hovering on edge of night ere made escape full of anxiety lest laila must have lost patience hope hurried down to wide archway so by turn riverwards to right into balcony most girl told must by time have taken offence be there a entered figure showed dimly against light beyond be afraid be awfully late began then paused for a turned there be faint clash of silver faint gleam of too heart gave great throb of glad recognition be laila laila indeed laila of dream last night have risked to please be said thought be late for took time wanted to be same always same to always always stretched hand to set aside took in arm kissed passionately yes laila always laila laila gave back kiss joyfully knew must come said love come to love know called juliet then many lover name took gave back again without reserve until a stood there someone passing outward from arched passage to garden paused to listen at half heard sound of voice for father ninian who have come down to own room for pair of foil wherewith to give lance carlyon lesson in addio del marito until captain dering must choose to come out of recess of garden allow of going back to fort together knew of none likely to use even to be aware of balcony so turned thither curiously then stood arrested so that clash of foil on stone a purposely lowered point came a warning to two that be observed laila with catlike noiselessness withdrew in second yard two away in deepest shadow stood leaning in careless easy attitude over balustrade only possibility of escape lay felt instinctively in showing desire to do so vincent for part turned to face old priest prepared to brazen out for blood be running like wild fire in vein yet scarcely so fast a heart blood have once leapt be even now leaping in old man who came forward facing also came forward slowly shortsightedly foil in hand if have held out one bade take button off fight for life vincent dering must scarcely have be surprised must almost have be pleased must have raised in own self esteem for knew perfectly well have right to be there that a yet be not sure of own footing pidar narayan did not paused a generally did few pace away slender straight shadow in black girt about with pale sash on on pale face such light a there be fell softly for there be anger in latter only almost passionate regret pity even so word startled young man who stood prepared for defiance oh captain dering said courteously be be have found pleasant place indeed scarcely very safe one for companion turned to faint gleam of white silver in arched shadow air grows chill madam so close to river continued voice taking tone almost of command be lightly clad will not be wise leave vincent surprise have passed by time into rush of vexation almost

harsh indeed know have have certainty be missionary of certainty to shame be said interrupted father ninian with curious return to worldly courtesy a removed spectacle have never tried to make convert therefore can scarcely hope to persuade if gentleman might be allowed to talk matter over with most sensible suggestion assented dr campbell looking round on younger le experienced colleague must be loth to act hastily give occasion to scoffer mamma will send tea into dining room pure practicality of last word seemed to relieve general tension vincent dering who have be looking horribly bored seeing piano open sat down to a dissentients moved off into cave of adullam began to play la donna e mobile saying with laugh cherchez la femme depend upon mr campbell there be woman at bottom of know from personal experience that be always fatal to peace pulse on road erda shepherd holding head very high crossed over to pour out tea whereupon vincent being mischievously inclined suddenly changed

nothing in world for tying hand o ' leevin like dead men disposition be just mortification indeed to ' concerned there be always something about good lady comfortable common sense made further discussion difficult talk wandered into le rugged path until time for leisure from erda duty a tea maker being close at hand lance went out deliberately into verandah overhung river rather spit of sand bank jutted out from turning point of city triangle on right wall set with temple spire trended away to meet bridge on left to join line of palace bathing step fort in front of a stood leaning over balustrade at western end of verandah lay dull streak of sand bright gleam of water beyond dim mysterious be great level plain of india on whose scarce distinguishable edge sun be setting behind bank of deep purple cloud be long low almost level bank outlined sharply against sea of golden green light above there be scarcely hint of sunset fire save in trailing chain of little fleecy golden flock stretched away from purple of cloud into deepening purple of clear sky overhead lance waiting watched that clear almost level outline until a cloud do when gazed at fixedly took shape for a body of dead warrior half covered by pall straight sweep yonder be shield still held upon arm peak of shadow below be mailed foot there be curve of throat head thrown back feathery plume of helmet whole world seemed bier star just trembling into sight watch light round do see asked a erda joined from great deep to great deep go recognized quotation though have come out full of determination to deny glamour of mutual comprehension claimed in second yes answered quickly pointing to trailing drift of cloudlets added bound by gold chain about foot of god turned to look at then forgetting fancy in

dead king of dead continued then that end so so far a be concerned remains a excuse for asking question miss shepherd why be going to marry cousin have known be coming for great many reason began boldly then paused wishing for first time that reason have be fewer feeling that possession of one must have made speech easier to begin with have be dream of life turned on with amaze be almost ludicrous what to marry frowned angrily to work to help to give sympathy to stand hand in hand with someone who a doe give a do to great work to someone whose life will be mine whom can respect admire love in best sense of word voice gaining confidence from own statement rose almost passionately lance looked at with clear eye nodded yes quite understand what have to do with marrying how will great work be furthered by having to look after house be a if must give help sympathy without marrying fellow even love at least think so now want to marry because yes said severely a paused felt glad to change place with in witness box because to begin with doe seem possible for to live life mean everyday life trying to rub along know without doing harm keeping thing going a a people have always kept unless help then paused again from first moment saw reminded paused so long time that faint wonder a to what be going to say next made heart beat a watched leaning over balcony looking dreamily at fading likeness of dead 'king of dead suppose anyone have happier jollier childhood than have said suddenly though be orphan lived at tregarthen know turned to a spoke smiled must have seen grandfather grandmother miss shepherd be like double christmas number of illustrated paper used to boast that never saw naughty child never did for dear old lady always walked out of room promptly when tried on remember used to take starch out awfully having audience be same in everything beat even boy to be really bad in house somehow yes have jolly time must have liked must like now turned swiftly held out hand come to come be lady carlyon a be people may say mean nothing mean everything to woman to be able to count on inheritance like for broke off a of others came out into balcony bending closer to went on in low voice have said nothing of love know think yes voice took note of certainty think like well enough there be something so truth compelling in face voice that felt thankful for tepid word like like very much sir lancelot said trying not to let voice betray absolute tenderness felt a told just now be reason why must marry be at least a good a yours for marrying broke in quickly at least have to do with with with happiness with mine at rate do remember when first told name world desire called woman with red gold hair red gold hem to garment red gold apple in hand be that to erda give heart desire voice low quick passionate thrilled through saw a have seen then yes have to do with with echoed desperately only two interrupted with more than surely in pause followed one vision faded in own wish that if ever have son might be a man came to make remember father ninian word can wish better wish for world father ninian must not have said so to must do better for world in other life other work very self sacrifice of attracted vague though sense of be a yet sir lancelot said at last be very sensible of honour for heaven sake interrupted be excuse bunkum felt glad of faint resentment came to aid be same continued be impossible perhaps if did not look forward a do perhaps if only sought happiness clasped hand tightly militant look came back to face be sworn to work noblest work of to bring light to sit in darkness lance gave odd little laugh full of bitterness leave out in black night anyhow said true enough in one way for quick dusk have closed in around a spoke great white shaft of light like moon ray shot almost a if in denial widening on way from shadowy stretch beyond river shot waveringly a if uncertain until focussing full on verandah turned dusk to day search light cried mr smith clapping daintily gloved little hand eugene will be so pleased must positively swallow mouthful at lunch because when thought be right something went wrong be why did come miss shepherd added for light have effectually joined scattered group into one positively must tear away made promise to turn thing on here if succeeded have be splendid mr campbell looked doubtful be just too much like last day comin unawares makin ' thing manifest for taste ' wonder what dr james will say to wonder what native will say to said vincent dering looking across at lance say echoed tart lady know what must say that of course know great deal more than do besides added new gushing voice be so beautifully suggestively true have light can light oh be bother came laila bonaventura full throated tone hate having to see thing care to see much prefer to have own candle have be finding dull work waiting for guardian return from dining room even though vincent have now again found opportunity for word look took advantage of one now to say will be pleasanter by by wo must settle time before leave what time asked muriel smith who happened to overhear undertone have be vaguely curious at apparent avoidance of other occasional lapse into familiarity ever since have challenged at viceroy party time echoed vincent coolly of new song of course come in miss bonaventura let decide about girl swept up long lash solemnly must think twelve beat must be best really be safer when there be so many accidental note face a led way to piano be study if have lived life in vaudeville at folie bergeres must scarcely have be more at home in intrigue yet absolute sincerity unconsciousness of wrongdoing be a palpable on whole felt vexed more so because vaudeville dialogue proved unnecessary since sudden concentration of party to hear verdict of adullamites who at moment came out of dining room must have given ample time for more dignified conversation erda be in front rank of eager little crowd hope enthusiasm heightened by deliberate choice have just made when dr campbell a recognized head began to speak have come unanimously to conclusion said that absolute revolt at late hour must be unwise whether father ninian bruce be justified by circumstance in adverse report be matter personally denied did propose that must sit down quietly under interference be only forbidden to preach in eshwara therefore have come again unanimously to resolution of leaving eshwara for time in body must be solemn protest must thus render to caesar to god since must preach at other pilgrim station on road must be noble protest be certain of proving blessed word roused little enthusiasm mingled with undoubted relief in most case erda standing beside cousin said in undertone did assent to david suggested answered in louder voice not without self satisfaction appeared to to meet exigency of case admirably will be very useful let tell at home will emphasize difficulty danger have to contend against will show meek reasonableness then looked round with jubilant smile seems to beautiful idea that only result of attempt to gag will be that thousand of poor benighted soul will have chance of hearing truth in many place instead of one erda voice broke in on hum of applause almost harshly filling room with defiance think cowardly must fight if be man must beat jean ziska drum laughed vincent dering rising from music stool where have be holding laila hand under cover of new song occupation always made feel a if wine of

dawn must show anyhow so hour by hour minute by minute tide of pilgrim set citywards till brimmed over with faith hope be dangerous thing when charity depends on there be antagonistic claim to alms so eshwara be restless over in gaol also by golden shod foot passed so closely with heart stirring cry seemed a if vincent dering thrumming following a did on heel of eugene smith success with search light have set what dr dillon called host of devil in commotion indeed that thrumming be still going on when george dillon have gone raging over to conjure experimenter with oath to turn off confounded bull eye at once prisoner must go out of judgment with thinking of number who must have to die night in order to keep up supply of brain power just too a have be congratulating that cholera scare be over seventy two hour not case be too bad eugene whom found on roof of house playing with coil battery accumulator have suggested eagerly that if there be real trouble might end by turning light bang on to gaol so reducing to paralysis of sheer terror dr dillon however have sworn violently that must not have poor wretch frightened unnecessarily especially when triumphant cry of who be free to defy devil by seeking sanctification before death reminded that must not that must die defiled helpless hopeless that fear be said in way dignified worthy of consideration did not anticipate trouble unless there be treachery inside out though perhaps might a precaution ask dering for extra guard when latter happened to come in a mr smith escort home while doctor be still there dr dillon apparently changed mind anyhow pooh poohed captain dering offer to send one saying more must keep gaol to yourself better for matter of anything else so with curt good night to mr smith went back to work leaving vincent to remark carelessly that dillon seemed in bad temper at muriel smiled there be something in air said conducive to bad temper felt must soon have quarrelled with doctor assumption of knowing better than anyone else so be a well have not stopped to dinner quarrelsomeness did not however extend to vincent who did indeed made so tenderly charming unconsciously friendly towards that began to accuse of having be too irresponsive of late fact of being in love did not preclude friendship for someone else if indeed be really in love with laila bonaventura in one way knew to be so idea of treating love of on conventional line be still repugnant to thought of a wife barely attractive so after time spent pleasantly enough for two eugene smith went off to coil accumulator battery half sulky half bored wholly ill used at having to switch off when have at least hour electricity ready stored for use be grumbling over fact when vincent called good night to before starting to drive back answered that for fool who be afraid of going to proper place might have given dering electric light on road thanks cried vincent gaily there be enough electricity in air to night

quick grasp of meaning when muriel have overheard remark about time such quickness in latter must have made revolt from with laila be different passionate gratitude to girl to whom fear remorse very possibility of change seemed unknown rose up claimed dear little girl be so absolutely single minded in love for how must anyone expect to forego luxury of such love yet awhile in thinking laila single minded vincent thought truth so far a be concerned if love passionate a juliet far more innocent in one way far more ruse in ever existed hers be that love nevertheless very integrity made curiously cunning in regard to anything threatened to disturb idyll in garden so at very moment when vincent looked up at window asserting absolute lack of pretence single mindedness be pitting wit against old akbar khan in manner worthy of grandmother anari begum since akbar far more than guardian be to be feared latter honest man went to bed beyond chapel at ten of clock precisely akbar who from ancient habit be given to prowling about at night napping in odd corner have many chance of discovery during last few day however when for own purpose have let talk have become so garrulous

inexpressible feeling have come to also laila trying to formulate that feeling slipping heel idly in out of dainty little bronze shoe a lounged suddenly remembered vincent song to tambourine laughed be golden foot upon golden stair expressed exactly two pair of foot going side by side up golden stair to golden gate so contented ah god how content seeking something claiming something yet still

tide of patient eager face drifting on back again aimlessly need not a matter of fact have feared further interference from vincent dering for latter being very tired after long day in sun having reason to know part of night time at rate be usually given to sleep must be employed in something better have after staving off hunger with what cook must produce at moment notice postponing dinner

compelling must sleep come not even in cool darkness be settling on eshwara despite curious hint of glow lingering in sky air be too electrical decided then erda have slept night before after have said good by so carelessly without realizing that good by be for ever have not have time to think day now at rest in cool darkness looking from lounge chair down river to other balcony did realize for ever yes that regret be in life for ever be so young only twenty five why have come to erda erda heart desire sat there voiceless sucking mechanically at cigar long since gone out be a much cry at

there ate missionary yes sometimes there be not much time left for sort of end what brute be when only thing that mattered be that must be happy content must be so went on on on controversy between that other self so that felt worn harassed dirty altogether undesirable when vincent about nine o'clock reappeared dapper scented a usual in mess kit expressed surprise at finding companion still undressed be hungry a hunter said besides wanted to have decent interval between dinner turning in must be early for have just heard from police authority though everything be quiet for night absolutely quiet thought must be safer to have pool guarded again at dawn in case of accident since none of pilgrim though apparently quite resigned have a yet gone on never do till next day pidar narayan told so commented lance crossly why must rake up at unearthly hour why ca let people have row if want one 'd like give fellow something to do in beastly hole went off to dress moodily wishing savage wish so adding perhaps to electricity in air vincent gave quota of desire also in reckless determination to regain paradise a be lost through woman that play of romeo juliet in scented garden

vincent have gone be left alone in balcony sleep began to assert found even despair becoming dreamy being obstinate tried to fight against fact result being that finally fell asleep in lounge chair

supported in vincent arm latter shook head go on without said sternly be failing fast there be one on old man finger one have never left since have be put there by saint in paradise took off now gave to man whom at moment hated despised more than man on earth so swiftly prayer went on old akbar paused in rockings to say amen with others have learnt thus much in latter day of grace last one came a step resounded down passage lance carlyon step a sought light have seen sought captain seemed to bring breath of fresh air into passion laden atmosphere solid reality into shadow vincent cried a caught sight of scarlet gold thank god be here trooper have seized fort paused suddenly horror struck at what have caught eye beg pardon did know be be hurt vincent stood up suddenly hush have nothing

electrical dust storm be in full blast realized with relief be at least real tangible almost too much so a hot wind charged with aspiring atom of earth met fiercely realized also that storm must fight against in effort to prevent worse from happening if indeed anything must be worse than what have happened worse than laila broke off in thought incredulous must not be true must come back to find better well that other dream be true men have risen one thing necessary therefore be to get to gaol before decided action took place realised still more clearly from lance curt explanation a ran down river step once there sight of canoe have left suggested feasibility of getting to gaol in personal influence might avail if failed must at least be able to save time by choosing suitable place for raft to come ashore great thing be to be on spot to be within reach of action at once to wait for raft meant needle delay so minute after faint splash of paddle be lost in rising hum of storm lance be left looking anxiously for sound sight of raft if have gone well must by now have started came so seeing from light have snatched up a passed through balcony that air be growing darker more impenetrable than ever shoved off strange craft to wait further out in stream where there be le chance of raft passing unseen unheard for reason also paddled up along wall bit into faint glow of light

will have to take up bed walk h be hope will have chance replied doctor dryly recovering breath be storm be going to try row smith just have wire from fort there be plot on to come here set prisoner free be dangerous so till troop come think 'd better bring mr smith gladys to gate be safest place have got everything ready may be much devil whoever be might turn rend especially if fail with eugene smith have dropped snail shell sat down on aghast in surprise be up again before doctor finished by jove said rapidly calmly a doctor be taking up one bed with vengeance will have 'em ready in jiffy anything else will rummage round till return one forgets thing to last sometimes will want remington such like know where to find moment after be striking match to light tall floor lamp in mr smith drawing room have turned out few hour before thinking a looked round room full of soft rose shaded light how pretty how cosey be have same air of refined security now everything down to copy of last 'queen lying on inlaid table by favourite chair be so exactly what one must have expected to find in room room of delicate cultivated civilized society woman now now delicacy culture civilization society security belonging to have be invaded in instant by what dust must almost see springing into air in sandy stretch have already settled thick over dainty furniture a dr dillon standing by table in pink glow of lamp asked question yielded to imperious fascination smooth sand surface have for humanity did not write name upon only idle answer to question god know writing lay upon table beside latest fashion staring up into pink paper shade after george dillon have passed rapidly to eugene office to choose other make into bundle with table cloth when returned to drawing room muriel smith be standing by writing in sand fragile figure in blue dressing gown frilled embroidered like picture in paper looked more forlorn than frightened forlorn pathetic be warm enough said doctor a entered dress mean there be storm on generally brings rain be flannel answered nodded there be excitement heroic only that writing on sand forlornness forlornness of delicate dresden shepherdess set to drive flock of real sheep to shamble needlessness pity of made dr dillon set teeth eugene will be here directly with gladys said thought best not to wake said have better start at once for see ca walk nearly so fast a doe there be trace of fear in voice there be none of resistance turned at door to look back with almost reproachful acquiescence poor room said softly seems so strange such pity suppose ca be helped turned to darkness again with little shiver went on vincent sent wire suppose did ask replied dr dillon curtly then repenting added suppose so will be here directly expect will take care of gladys a long a can know ca do more can smiled quite tenderly of course will be really not bit afraid except of being in way seemed to accept necessity of perhaps rightly for storm be joke in desert stretch where sand rose in choking cloud yet left enough to make step toil muriel stumbled along breathlessly so slowly that when husband joined striding along with gladys still sleeping wrapped in blanket in arm doctor bade come at leisure wait until gave signal before entering then ran on swiftly to gaol for there be time to lose though on other hand there be very little to be done le better if plan be to be successful since involved utmost quiet keeping of prisoner from knowledge of what be going on a long a possible a faced choking darkness hot blast of causeless wind blowing way at once george dillon reckoned up chance fairly storm must certainly make easier to keep such knowledge from within make more difficult for without to establish communication with former so far good on other hand amount of light at command must enable to see even from coign of vantage on gateway roof what be going on outside inside darkness be digger best friend while digging be recognized enemy of mud wall especially of inside wall divided gaol into section yet best only chance of keeping prisoner quiet lay in preserving segregation into company for gaol be of cart wheel pattern be huge circle of outside wall thick a earthwork felloe of wheel a be then small central cylinder of brick like lime kiln nave of wheel a be between two spoke spoke of twelve foot high mud wall dividing whole into seven wedge of prison absolutely distinct blank aperture le save for one heavily stanchioned door in apex of wedge leading into central tower exit entry be therefore impossible to six of wedge except through tower be citadel key a be of gaol proper seventh wedge however gave at wider end on entrance gate be square semi fortified building pierced by tunnel gated at end further protected by outside yard roofless porch also gated inmost of three gate opened on to small courtyard narrowed again into alley gave access to central tower briefly then whole gaol consisted of six wedge opening by door in narrow end into central cylinder seventh wedge split in two by alley leading between high mud wall from gateway to central tower key to position in two half of split wedge lay warder barrack solitary cell cook room hospital entry to be by door on side of little courtyard just beyond inner gate from corner of also rose outside stair leading to roof of square brick gateway thus fifteen hundred prisoner be broken up into company of about two hundred be absolutely without possibility of communication so long a central tower be in hand of authority unless there be time to undermine mud wall tool also wherewith to work of however there be none in gaol nothing even must be used to take place except in seventh section held executive of gaol there dr dillon meant to leave hand to use if must compass a pulled up to regain breath before walking up to gate giving countersign whole place lay quiet dark so far good there be risk however of plot being known of sentry refusing entrance be not however next moment calmly a if be merely on one of not infrequent round of unexpected night inspection dr dillon passed from outer porch to tunnel told sentry at inner gate to light lamp in little office room to one side call superintendent said to first man can tell be going to inspect solitary cell added because knew must give time since superintendent must be sure to give private look round first to see be in order remove possible trace of tobacco opium luxury out of so much money can be made by gaol official sooner however have first sentry gone through door to left section than sent second one on similar message to right where hospital lay then coast being clear rapidly unlocked private safe in office held set of key in case of accident locked right left door secure for moment therefore from interruption ran outside saw that tool room etc be closed gave signal to eugene smith hurried refugee up stair then after unlocking two door again on way back to office sat down in usual chair began to look over register be engaged in calm occupation when minute two after native superintendent big dignified person in blatant undress due largely to bulk arrived breathless darogah jee began dr dillon instantly mere tone of title made man quiver have have constantly to complain of tobacco opium smuggling be going on among warder mean to stop have have information to night will clinch business so take night guard rouse warder bring everyone here even on guard in section hospital orderly everyone in fact who be free to go out of gaol be to come at once time allowed for arrangement if be not here in five minute will think be in league with smuggler darogah fat flesh shook yet winked a went off if doctor sahib expected to find anything in fashion except maybe smell of forbidden drug be mistaken on night too when dust be in everyone eye well might have be worse for though knew nothing definitely of plot must not fail to know that there be more to excite men in gaol night than tobacco opium so went about summons with sigh of relief before five minute be over have posse of minor official together including file of unfettered prisoner with good conduct badge who be used a gang leader finally coming down alley with stupendous bunch of key followed by little group of night warder have collected from other section here asked dr dillon lighting cigar register please darogah will answer to name pas out through wicket into porch stay there until have tallied lot be going to have pakka time of men grinned looked uneasy few frowned obeyed though cuddled into blanket a slipped through wicket faced whirling swirling storm in open porch door of be barred not solid kishen rao came dr dillon voice after long series of name followed by brief present swift exit there be answer turned to darogah for explanation absent explained latter timorously little more decision might have saved quick question with without leave huzoor palpitated fat man went out to bathe in holy pool by permission morning be of utmost sobriety brahmin promoted by honour to a honour know general head ward keeper be not to be suspected leave till pm commented doctor looking over register mark down absent without leave go on so rapidly last man ducked under wicket be that lot everyone protector of poor protested burly official with smile prison be empty of unfettered then let remain so for present said dr dillon coolly a stepped forward closed wicket slid bolt to place turned on darogah in one swift sequence now then went on sharply have to settle bit of business key took out revolver laid on table beside key have duplicate triplicate everything be going to keep gaol for bit do understand huzoor bleated man helplessly putting big bunch on table dr dillon smiled sarcastically wo do friend want lot by list where be register when came ticked off rapidly by section b c warder duplicate where be that asked official grew green kishen rao began be of utmost dr dillon turned on like lightning be damned scoundrel sir what else be missing ran over rest swiftly then looked up suddenly with scowl made man literally collapse so be be duplicate of b c section missing duplicate of alley door pretty little game laughed sardonically kishen rao gurgled darogah by honour promotion of utmost wo play friend wo play went on doctor with curious elation hold thirteenth trump now go in there pointed to inner store room behind slip of office windowless place pitch dark where clothes in prisoner arrived awaited release in pile thank star be in such good quarter brief order go in there be spoken in english a sort of outlet for intense satisfaction be filling at own success so far next minute have turned key on darogah be up stair calling eugene smith in low voice to come down help to bolt bar to come a quietly a must have got rid of lot said joyously after have explained position in few rapid word there be soul in section except solitary cellers who of course be ironed few sick people assistant surgeon baboo jee be agnostic be so confoundedly afraid of possibility of future life that may be trusted to go into green collapse if hears shot fired so rapidly two men set to work undisturbed by more than protesting huzoor what will do from posse outside first gate low knocking at wicket there be double door here however of sort must need time to negotiate without powder will hold out for hour at least said doctor then there will be inner one after that alley door unless remembered kishen rao frowned be only weak spot in armour can count on hour half at least continued carefully allowing for worst longer perhaps now then smith for toughest job have got couple of crowbar here first six step eight if can of stair must come down there be enough of to hold so for fully quarter of hour sound be heard above curious vibration of storm except grinding crushing of brick a be rapidly eased out one by one from mud mortar light of one of office lamp set on ground showed by time sheer drop of eight ten foot eugene smith working above jammed crowbar into crevice of wall against step clung like swallow nest gave dr dillon who have be working below rope hand up latter set down key lamp have brought up with deliberately dusted knee of trouser there be done said must be better yes seems pretty safe assented eugene smith trifle dubiously safe echoed doctor enthusiastically have felt so safe for last fortnight hullo what be that be sudden bugle call doctor face fell what already did expect relief so soon however ca be helped will just go up tell dering what have done so that may be prepared for locked out one took light in hand crossed to outer parapet hello dering began peering down then couple of shot whizzed past head ducked at same moment a if roused by concussion first crackling thunderclap of dust storm sounding muffled through thick air followed like roll call reverberated dully sluggishly through black darkness when passed dr dillon voice rose quietly there will be relief smith be trooper be against so now have got to ourselves smith for time there be certain satisfaction at monopoly in voice chapter xxiii search light sound of two shot greeted vincent dering a after infinite difficulty owing to darkness fitful gust of wind sand bank drew up canoe against what knew must be high bank below off take of canal have only be by trusting stream to guide refraining at time from use of paddle that have managed to steer way at so knew be late felt indeed that must be too late to use influence with men yet despite knowledge keen disappointment filled when shot proved to be so since by long experience knew that once open resistance began there must be no more question of word what then be there for to do if in light canoe helped wherever possible by atom of strength arm possessed have taken so long to come down mile two of stream raft must not possibly arrive for half hour must not sit still for hour felt indeed a if must not sit still for minute passion to act to sweep away past to forget be upon have have time during strange journey so often idle perforce to realize position time to piece still stranger event preceding journey into reasonable sequence so that have by now arrived at fairly accurate guess a to cause of much that when happened have seemed causeless for instance laila dress given by someone joined to knowledge that be connected with late nawab family of roshan khan might with justice claim headship have brought latter action within bound of credibility jealousy revenge be potent cause laila then must have be playing with roshan pretension playing like child with toy playing rather like woman who hesitates at nothing for sake of man love have hesitated at nothing not even at to give pleasure to make thing match with passion thought remembrance made for moment feel inclined to fling up hand let canoe take where chose take down stream utterly then half choking yet wholly strenuous desire to escape from whole story wild instinctive effort for more wholesome atmosphere like of drowning man for breath of fresh air have sent canoe bounding on way way none other in swift obedience with rush have grasped that there be more in life that have allowed to be slave be past must shake together must forget thraldom of sex must forget past yet a cast about in mind for best method of applying half hour leisure remembrance of woman came to a if to mock at resolution muriel dear little gladys who called derin ' darling where be eye grew soft in remembrance stern at probability of being in danger why have not thought of before how must ever have paused wondering what to do set red light have taken from fateful balcony carefully in canoe though even must gust of rising wind not blow light out must scarcely be of use in outer darkness a signal to raft must by off chance drift past in absence then struck across sand in direction in knew smith bungalow must lie be little to rear of gaol storm a faced be so fierce that doubt rose inevitably if unwieldy raft must make way against if so then there must be help only thing must be to defend others until end came end must at least end past have almost to feel way darkness be so intense be relief to stumble against something knew must be low mud fence of muriel garden garden in tried to defy providence rear english flower knew foot must be crushing treasure a passed on towards faint glow red glow everything be not blackness of outer darkness to night seemed red blood red minute after with vast relief at silence solitude be in muriel pretty drawing room pink shaded lamp be still alight showing red through fog of dust passed to instinctively a did so noticed writing on table many earth atom have fallen on confession of ignorance since george dillon have made idly so a vincent dering bent quickly to see if by chance be message left for who might come after also have to frown say god know be possible that eugene wife be still asleep door stood open be to be expected at season of year unless someone have be awake to close against storm must make sure however there be one to be found in of room occurred to then that must have taken refuge in gaol told be fool not to have thought of before dillon must of course have seen to that vincent might have remembered so much at least might have remembered that be not only slave then gave odd bitter little laugh be never possible to get beyond woman apron string here be wasting time over question when ought to be doing something better what go back wait for raft on to gaol there be big tamarisk tree at end of garden only two day before have pointed out to muriel said that active man accustomed to trapeze work might swing from astride high mud wall of gaol so gain roof of gate dillon have denied have said laughingly that one ever tried to break into gaol only out of one curious still if have only be light must have be worth risking be impossible now in dark so suddenly remembrance came to search light be only last night have be dining here in house after bringing muriel home from mission where have seen that huge ray piercing shadow be only yesterday that have listened to eugene lamentation over unused electricity be sure said to vanish into space from rude contrivance be only yesterday that in obedience to pathetic look of martyrdom on muriel face still seemed to one part of vincent nature to call for instant sympathy have to appease honest inventor shown interest in search light be purely fictitious learned variety of fact about button stop cock have happened yesterday on purpose that to day when be in need of light be up on roof with thought if only blessed thing have go enough for a picked way rapidly through litter three four cigar end half finished whiskey soda seen by flash of hurricane lantern have sought out lit told that eugene must have be at work over new toy till late so much better for chance for everybody chance since signal like might make difference to raft difference to dillon in gaol george dillon be indeed beginning to realize almost triumphant mood have passed have come home to that unexpected revelation of trooper complicity in plot whatever be have changed whole aspect of affair now there be question of keeping gaol quiet until help must arrive be face to face now with fact that must not rely on aid at what have really happened must not guess for knew trooper pioneer might have risen killed officer killed everybody who must be likely to help aim now be to sell life hers a dearly a must in dead darkness like rat in hole what must be done except wait wait for wall to be dug through gate to be mined that poor eight ten foot drop at foot of stair scaled then rush still in dark greatest darkness of not even chance of shot have plenty of ammunition must at least have passed time to take pot shot at devil though must have brought retaliation there must have be need for exposure parapet wall be high enough properly loopholed so for few minute sat almost sullenly beside for whom alone now felt responsible in little turret a be always case in india rose at one corner of flat roof giving fair shelter for time in first hurried recognition have come with shot that not help attack lay outside have blown out light fearing lest eugene smith might also be exposed to similar attention so be pitch dark now almost constant reverberation seemed to send sand laden air in pulse beat on face deadened other sound into vague confusion knew that warder within porch trooper without be trying to force barred gate must not take long though two door blocking end of tunnel must be tougher job heard closer at hand sleepy whimper from child low comforting from mother voice sound made set teeth god if there be only light to kill withal then in second a if by miracle came great flood of shining light contemptuous at short distance even of outer darkness for be electricity against electricity house divided against first thing saw by be that fragile figure in dainty blue frill child golden head so naturally next instant found hand on rifle search light by be lucky well everyone have not be killed anyhow cried eugene smith killed echoed dr dillon savagely one have be killed yet wo be long before be be not for trooper engaged in staring stupidly at velvety black circle out of intruding light seemed to spring suddenly threw up hand swirled round fell face upwards in crumpled heap there be instant scare in crowd in hundred fifty more of trooper conspirator thrown into black white relief like shadow pantomime about outer gate then startled murmur of light dee puk rag be passing from lip to lip changed into yell fight have begun in earnest shoot straight remarked dr dillon few minute after sha have such good chance long gate be almost gone then most of game will be out of range too close to wall once get into tunnel will have to sound cease firing until come out on other side then ought to do decent damage if prisoner get at first paused shot on steadily till with hoarse shout attacker surged inwards then laid rifle aside remarking that must be a well to keep eye gaolwards in case of complication so far a must be seen in curious chequering of dense darkness sharp glittering light light be palpably intruder seemed absolutely apart from thing showed even from dust atom there be none a yet at least uppermost portion of vast wheel of wall stood out perfect unbroken roof of smith bungalow where light stood being however little higher than wall much of what lay below in section be necessarily hidden in shadow especially on side nearest light narrow alley leading up to central tower being in straight line with ray showed clear a daylight save just under citadel so did most of little courtyard with door opening to right left george dillon gave sigh of satisfaction at sight since whether foe elected when once inside gate to rush roof press on to liberate prisoner by six door in round tower there must be fair chance of good bag for straight shot even if convalescent in hospital be to set free solitary cell convict contingency have occurred to too late for plan of minimizing danger be to swarm into courtyard to help against last gate of course be partly barred from inside must settle hash also that now be one idea idea of brave men when find in tight place to kill before being killed a yet however there be sign of life even within vast wheel with rim spoke of light centre of shadow lay dim curiously still behind dust atom danced in ray like mote in sunbeam there be not sound not sign within only tumult of voice intermittent shot without rising above dull muffled hum in air stay that be something half way round circle where shadow of tall tamarisk tree in smith garden cut jagged gap in white rim of wall there be change something have not be there moment ago gap have moved have changed place form though for time air be still with one of breathless suffocating pause when dust above seems to sink on dust below fill one very lung now gap be back again a have be before have left something clinging for second to wall like limpet next astride safely reach over rifle smith said doctor briefly there be brute trying to sniggle along wall must have come up tree in garden wish 'd taken dering advice cut down thanks want to take eye off for fear mean to drop into section will shoot if seems game if not will wait till come closer leant over parapet waiting just below inner wall of gate against stair clung be prolonged into turret where muriel child be sheltering joined circular outside wall of gaol man thought dr dillon trusting to being occupied in front must be trying to steal march on slip down stair take in rear there be plenty of time to prevent that however muriel smith roused by sound of vincent name from sort of lethargy into have fallen since be not wanted either by husband doctor rose to knee peered over parapet cautiously from tree in garden said dreamily yes remember said must be done said one must ever want to do said must paused gave little cry be vincent gasped shoot doctor be vincent know feel knew must come if must vincent vincent what be up asked eugene still firing steadily at be to be seen only wife say man be captain dering by jove believe be right of course be right sobbed half hysterically knew must come knew must leave to die alone eugene smith laid down rifle crawled over in cover deliberately with odd look on face yes be dering plucky fellow be swung up always knew be nailing gymnast there be grudge in voice only curious challenge a looked at wife then laid big hand on shoulder keep more down please head showing will get here right never fear will lower rope to when come alongside must rather look 'd rather see anything happen moaned seems so unkind not to watch not to be there with be shivering over patient self control steady acquiescence even in own danger have be hers till then gone utterly george dillon felt great pity vast impatience so be right smith broke in hastily to cover sudden break down be killed now will have chance of knowing what be at bottom of foolery when five minute later vincent dering reached roof in safety doctor felt vaguely that explanation only added to general incomprehensibility that something be being kept back what asked impatiently have started show of course there be plot pidar narayan knew of a such thing generally did have seemed abortive what then have upset apple cart vincent gave gesture of despair what doe matter cried can think of if can think when be over if ca what doe matter can bet bottom dollar on one thing said eugene who in pause for council of war be methodically loading various weapon for future use be sex sin world must be paradise of peace if people did want virtue vice say be mind spoke suddenly harshly once more george dillon came to rescue a dering say doe matter fact that pioneer be staunch may be expected before long alters tactic bit smith must husband ammunition stick on a long a possible think so dering vincent kindly always have stooped to take little gladys who have crept over to in arm now child arm round neck be cuddling close to be so glad oo come derin ' darlin ' whispered so mum be 'oo dearest vincent unclasped soft little clinging hand almost resentfully pulled together yes said briefly have got to hold out so will be better to reserve ourselves try to keep gaol quiet will take brute time to force gate unless get help from within then there be alley door still will want minute for unless storm lessens carlyon will scarcely get raft here before dawn be awful on river be indeed even be ma have lost utterly while lance after paddling drifting shouting after dozen false hope be still a far from finding raft a ever what must have become of have started sooner than have expected passed down before have found vincent have never started at have men after left turned round on fear have come to early in search have felt inclined then there to paddle back to fort satisfy be not so thought of face if allowed care for to cause delay have kept to task steadily till must no longer doubt that something have gone wrong what what be to do then in flash have come back word after have bidden think hard must go down to spit cut across by mission house get round if can to police camp have be verdict involving being left to take chance now either raft relief for gaol have started have not if former might of course by stern chase overtake be there vincent must meet must do without if have not started what then then matter be exactly a have be when have bidden leave so with feeling that if be so cared little what happened steered so far a must judge for sand bank of spit to right be ma on contrary steered instinctively to left towards high bank deepest stream must at least float log to destination be something king have come gone battle have be won lost log have always have to go down river happened among men also apathy seemed to have settled a drifted on on in dark erda crouching in dry spot beside ammunition alert to uttermost for least hint of lance realized from very tone of voice a talked under breath to other felt instinctively that inaction darkness lack of leader be lessening value of twenty men minute if lance must only turn up what must have become of time seemed interminable felt sure that must already have drifted past gaol began to wonder if be ma be not playing false for darkness uncertainty have grip on also be like horrid nightmare to drift on on hearing muffled drumming of storm feeling strange vibration in air sharp sand tingling on face to know nothing nothing at save that be there be ma cried sharply at last certain of one thing that must act believe have passed gaol steer to right do hear laugh not exactly insolent tolerant came from group of men ti easy to give order missy baba said voice not so easy to obey when lord be against side sends darkness erda heart gave great throb not of fear comprehension be beginning minute two more men must be out of hand be ma called again do what tell remember child remember have dee puk rag laugh came from men if have dee puk rag send now need light for sure voice ended in gasp for be there long ray of light showing that be indeed just opposite gaol be ma came erda voice again there be hush yet triumph in to right steer to right raft edged slowly towards ray soldier still crouched inactive awed yet not certain then suddenly that quick crack of george dillon first shot echoed over river then yell then answering shot following on heel rapidly came stir among crouching figure one of stood up excitedly have begun see prag lehna give boatman hand lo do a miss baba bade thee quickly son of pig steer for light have begun erda gave sigh of relief that danger be over chapter xxiv beyond shadow fact that quarrel have begun did not however have same effect upon roshan khan in first tempest of rage hate sight of laila vincent in balcony have roused in have simply let go have not thought at have revolver held other cartridge must have gone on shooting at vincent pidar narayan at everybody till must shoot more have run mak curious phase of oriental mind when once oversteps hard fast line of custom in move breathes have being very fact that revolver did not contain more possibility for death that have other weapon emphasized wild revolt be helpless impotent before stranger who have stolen everything everything save bare existence thought a burst into open into lurid darkness of new come storm have made laugh bitterly for be only that bare existence wished to steal might keep rest that must claim from somehow in fair exchange time be ripe for such exchange too for fair exchange epithet fair haunted trying to still keen remorse for shot in dark for one part of knew to have be cowardly yes useless plot with foolish mischief hidden in heart to have just be listening with loyal intent to frustrate must be made to serve purpose without delay men must follow anywhere have to say word word so many of wanted then thief of made life worth living must learn lesson must fight win of course lesson without such men a men whom thwarted repressed at turn must not rely upon regiment must have to be learnt in learning one thief must learn something else so without more thought than desperate clashing of jealousy despair have dashed through crowd of pilgrim who be waiting for dawn gone back to fort given word in excitement followed spreading swiftly from own have not be typical of man that did not forget lance carlyon friendliness more equal friendliness than of most there be need to drag into quarrel more so because disloyalty of sikh pioneer be doubtful might complicate matter at beginning so have locked barred into inner courtyard out of way captain dering knew be outside let be alone with trooper a roshan must be alone with let try influence let try conclusion on term be fair first step however necessitated others original plot with waiting for dawn cumbrous mechanism of key pilgrim god know what be not to liking meant to fight if a conspirator have asserted of warder be friend hand foot men must crack nut of gaol in hour sooner better pidar narayan knew have recognized be fox for wiliness then captain dering must be after even now dillon sahib might be on alert time so coup de main must come at once a to what might follow might be after fashion of meerut in ' not who must tell end of anything beginning must be opportunity for fair fight between thief once more epithet fair scorched shrivelled with vague remorse not for laila be woman woman who have played false who deserved worst for shot in dark for there be two roshans warring fiercely in heart brain then after mad reckless ride to gaol first reality have come to in sight of dr dillon standing with light in hand to welcome friend in sound of two snap shot proclaiming foe why question have come swiftly what quarrel have with dr dillon with eugene smith whose tall gaunt figure showed behind other eugene smith who must have brought wife child with horror terror of what might come through quondam prize pupil of mission school horror terror in remembrance of great mutiny be ala legacy of wrong to young india tie hand foot make who be worthy of name shrink instinctively from anything may rouse underlying savagery unavoidable savagery of countryman must hold trooper must be sure have come to curse be too late to bless then memory of laila whole hateful tale be irrevocable struck hopeless be damned utterly must not escape sat rigid a statue on horse for second then with wild fury gave order for trooper to dismount force gate slave nawab sahib have come answer making smile proudly that at rate must not be stolen from now now must fight die in what must have be real position yet once more when search light have come to throw group of excited men hacking hewing at door closed by authority into significant black white relief that doubt have returned that desire to be on side once more of men like dr dillon whose bold resolve to be alone responsible for gaol warder tale revealed filled with admiration sudden throwing up of trooper hand that sidelong stumble into death have left roshan cruel a death for man thus killed have be to a brother so have gone on with fresh impulse towards revenge for time found forgetfulness in excitement action for though first gate one giving on open sort of porch have yielded almost at once to trooper outside warder within second barring arched tunnel be tougher job be not until have given way attacking party be completely sheltered from fire of little garrison on roof that there be leisure for thought to return what be doing why be doing man may be said broadly ever fight without feeling that battle be appeal to tribunal beyond roshan did not feel then remembrance of woman child upstairs came persistently burdened by weight of past tragedy in india be impossible to forget be woman who have always be courteous to child to whom have given toy what be doing men be at work on last strongest gate with tool must find not many for dr dillon forethought have left before barred door everywhere delay have already be great must be greater must be close now on line of original plot at roshan have laughed for dawn be showing faintly mere promise of light to come in east storm be passing dull reverberation of faint thunder be lost now in cry blow of at work trying to batter down iron bar sudden distaste more than regret repentance came to roshan a stood silent watching blow after blow sudden doubt be right man worth calling man ever fight for anything else man worth calling one fight for be right men hacking hewing little garrison upstairs there be such searchings of heart there at rate question a to what be doing though at exact moment be engaged in trivial occupation of drinking tea muriel smith have made at dr dillon suggestion against very pause cease firing have foreseen in making of have used continental tea basket more than once have be companion on brindisi route dr dillon have laid hand on in foraging a have boiled kettle rush roar of train racing through peaceful french champaignes have seemed to be in ear instead of rush roar of blow shouting be now rising from part of gaol though prisoner be still helpless for evil in section so three men haggard anxious drank tea in silence hastily yet with curious insistence a if triviality gave hold on thing familiar thing beyond midsummer night dream of madness child chattered a munched biscuit chattered of charm of strange picnic on woof in dark with oo ' s'ippers only unconscious little voice struck chill to men heart woman smiled a mother can do when wish to guard blessed unconsciousness to last unconsciousness of be guardian by right be doing a well a must be expected remarked dr dillon suddenly with quaint professional reminiscence then added wish to god though knew what prisoner be up to solitary cellers be on mind believe convalescent must dig out with cook room platter ladle ought to have thought of a say be doing very fairly well light dering be godsend eugene smith looked up sharply almost a if meant disclaimer then gave brief assent yes will be more of godsend still be dawn pointed to faint promise of light in east vincent dering eye followed hand with doubtful look of one sick to death a watch long weary night merge once more into long weary day of certain pain there be utter hopelessness in yes echoed slowly be dawn carlyon said attack be planned for dawn did asked doctor deliberately helping to lump of sugar deliberately trying to keep pulse beat of around a near normal a might be there have be something beyond in vincent voice must have meant to use key brute kishen rao made off with wonder what be that started show prematurely do think be premature why put in eugene smith must have have of townspeople of pilgrim otherwise perhaps storm began vincent doctor shook head if have meant to come must have come of course now with wind blowing straight off ca possibly hear paused listened for sudden silence have fallen on turmoil beneath out of came too familiar sound clank of leg iron of prisoner therefore have managed to break out of dormitory be solitary cellers wish carlyon must turn up muttered almost petulantly be only chance there be to be for from below voice rose loud clear dr dillon have desire to hurt yours warn that if persist be not responsible open gate will have safe conduct for for everybody george dillon be on foot at once captain dering stopped eye ablaze what will tell dillon said sharply will take order from be in charge man be under mine what will say dr dillon gave one glance at woman child tell to be universally damned answered eugene smith husband father nodded acquiescence roshan khan be standing in full view a vincent dering stepped up to parapet face be raised there be almost appeal in atom of atom almost of humanity vanished a recognized captain hand went instinctively to revolver then thought seemed to come to drew up proudly

without fool there be plenty of wise men left plenty put in mood be different see how wander be true crowd have broken into group from pilgrim singly in smaller group be drifting after lessening sound of chanting voice not so much from belief in pidar narayan not even because of lead over because be old way way worn by foot of father father father so jogi gorakh nath who now coast be clear have sprung aloft on old gun once more attempting to regain empire failed egregiously crowd passed by till big countryman with lumbering jest asked if be sure have picked up right skull to put on own

usque in saeculum echo of footstep behind filled up blank chapter xxvi foiled on gaol pool of immortality lay hope of whom pidar narayan have so far discomfited by arrogant claim to stand between heaven earth in other word to be in personal relation with great awarder of gaol immortality forgiveness punishment star in course hidden though have be by storm darkness have used that very darkness to due maintenance of law order a wheeled serenely to meet coming dawn when lance for instance heart torn in twain by desire to follow erda fate at cost knowledge that if be to do best for others must leave to face alone have struck down stream on be ma strange craft sole intention have be to rouse police camp secure what help must for gaol darkness set task for after drifting past spit whence have meant to cut across by land to bridge of boat so creeping past city find camp beyond have lost absolutely in maze of sand bank willow channel when river be low a be now lay like network between deep stream of hara deep stream of hari lost so utterly that realizing own bewilderment have called fool for having lost curious discouragement came to yet made more dogged persistent even while hopelessness of finding way grew second surely thought must not be such fool a to fail sometimes sudden belief that really have have faint indication of bearing must make put young strength into paddle until once more soft yielding yet irresistible impact came to tell that have failed again that be on sandbank dull concussion of seemed to pas into brain found fumbling on almost aimlessly despite doggedness mind busy with imagining thing might be happening in dark around for knew close by there lay sting be suffocating to be set a be in solid darkness like thought of fly in bird have

before certainty that mission must inevitably be useless unless must fulfil more expeditiously made resolve on trying conclusion with river at first hand be good swimmer a told first pulse of gratitude have ever felt for big bully who have chucked small boy in first term at harrow into ducker to take chance came to for few minute of despairing effort have taught more than mere swimming have taught to trust in water more at rate than in beastly contrivance made of bed football with stem stern devilish habit of spinning in eddy like teetotum mere condemnation of be ma craft being prelude to better thing raised spirit flung off clothes knowing must not hope to keep revolver dry improvised waistcloth out of silk sash wore instead of waistcoat in to stick hunting knife be only other weapon a did so thought of deer knife have killed a men think idly irrelevantly of such triviality when attention be really concentrated on something be a yet outside experience lance a slipped into water knew prepared to swim wade knew nothing else so doggedly a before infinitely quicker went on through darkness sometimes feeling in cool water sometimes finding foot on warm sand sometimes parting way knew not where through low tamarisk high grass marking island if must have guessed island even known way face be set light swishing touch might have be guide knew nothing until after time faint far glow mere suspicion of something not outer darkness showed on left even so must not guess whether meant gaol side city side of river if former must gaol have be fired by devil thought made set teeth dry sand being beneath foot run on recklessly towards glow only for yard two however then pulled up short amazed to find that be not far near that came from ground from leaping fire of tamarisk branch within stone throw of step two more in fact showed cooking pot remains of food familiar fishing net chrysalis looking figure wrapped in blanket half buried in sand one of fisher folk by be lucky if anyone must tell must be only slender stem of tiger grass snapped under foot noise be sufficient sleeper sprang to like wild animal blanket falling from one lithe arm making for long spear stuck in sand beside gu missing gu gu lance have back in sand bed before hand spear met there be struggle gu gu knowing helpless lay limp slack muscle proclaiming capitulation in so far showing something le than wild animal struggle till dy reckless of odds in truth gu gu with certainty of speedy extinction before due to cursed ghost have given in to fate utterly round death must come when

throttling abject jelly by way of emphasis know about business of course now have found will have to do mine will kill do understand now way be town gu gu pointed in direction whence lance have come latter frowned realizing that be impossible to know if brute spoke truth unfortunately must be trusted then get up said curtly taking care to keep jelly within reach of knife show way there will give hundred rupee if do if gave yielding flesh explanatory prick doe huzoor mean pool of immortality asked gu gu affably word made lance remember that fruitless waiting for water ah did manage swindle did replied savagely of course be camping out of way see want to go there yet to bridge so quick march swim can tell about other a go along may be useful prick with knife held in one hand while other clutched firmly on gu gu hemp strung waist belt of blue bead started so went on till sand grew colder le resistant changed to water beneath foot then lance two hand knife came down on gu gu bare back strike out said briefly will help two pair of leg one pair of hand forged ahead into darkness none le rapidly because second pair of hand be resting with something in on yielding fact indeed something else seemed to make gu gu confidential if huzoor said with shameless comprehension made lance inclined to use knife then there wanted to give alarm at police camp be taking long road to gu gu must show shorter if huzoor must trust for second lance hesitated must not see man face there be sort of cunning anxiety in tone be doubtful then remembering that short long be equally at man mercy if chose to brave result though there seemed to be reason why must said quietly told to take shortest huzoor can dive asked gu gu must since swim so strong dive echoed lance yes why because short way gu gu explained be by underground passage must be only reached from river undoubtedly huzoor be right passage have to do with miracle there must have be more than one miracle in old day since there be quite network of canal cave must be more le flooded at will all river people knew of few ventured in there be nothing to be gained by doing so a rule dive to reach passage be long awkward if huzoor must trust go ahead broke in lance sharply have to trust time meant everything besides even in diving must have revenge on sleek yielding back for answer gu gu altered course with almost suspicious alacrity though once more lance must see reason for treachery hundred rupee be big bribe to man who evidently have personal interest in matter else why must have be on island instead of in row then lance did not know of call to death so through dark one pair of hand two pair of leg forged ahead till sudden arrest of former gave lance dull shock once more time gu gu voice came quite cheerfully city wall huzoor slave must feel if go up down apparently be up after few minute of crablike edging gu gu voice came again tunnel be below protector of poor let most noble take longest breath ever breathed then strike down till mean one leg cease moving most noble one must cease also rest will dust like one accomplish save breath be in huzoors own keeping therefore let take time for filling when be ready let signal slave with with knife prick if chooses cool grasp of position made lance smile though situation knew be grave enough that breath to be drawn might be last more reason why must have wished le full of sand for storm be now at fiercest even here out on river over water air seemed solid have vibration must be felt on bare skin a drew in long breath before trusting to unseen man whom held within reach of grim signal something sharper must there be sign of treachery lance told that water must scarcely be more suffocating than air then sleek skin under hand shrinking from knife prick two pair of leg one pair of arm struck down be almost relief at first to get rid of stinging dust in one face almost relief not to breathe when after few second leg in front of grew rigid nothing be left to be done save to hold on desperately to waist belt of blue bead one own breath at same time sense of suffocation returned question how much longer seemed to throb in brain gripped everything have to grip tighter own body seemed to grip mind tighter still must feel clutch of vein whole corded network of must see corded pulsing network edged with prismatic light sending star into darkness beating time to singing in ear to fierce duel between desire to gasp determination to hold on beating time to confused rush of thought ended in one be drowning made clutch tighter gu gu at least must drown too be last conscious thought merged into frantic insistent clamour for air air air till something cold hit full on face forced into quick gasping cry left senseless when came to a

surely rock hand moved to feel brought blue bead with unresistingly gu gu where be gu gu gone knife too have be used to sever hempen string of belt curious might have be used for different more deadly purpose must never count on fellow must do even when be treacherous lance thought dreamily before realized more than fact that be alive not drowned then sat up hastily faced truth that be alone once more alone in network of underground passage cave of gu gu have spoken be there chance of getting out of not by dive certainly without help be impossible set to remember what guide have said in reply to question with have be purposely plied first a to light if gu gu be to be trusted material for must be close at hand lance rose cautiously felt about ledge on lay wall of rock about ere long came on what sought flint steel box of tinder bottle of oil rag torch hung in old bit of fishing net to peg be driven into crevice so far good after minute enabled to see that be in sort of vaulted well half hewn out of rock half built in with brick be filled to three foot so with water except in one corner where flooring shelved down to archway there be deeper must be opening of tunnel through have dived through doubtless gu gu have escaped for be not likely to have braved intricate passage without light thought made lance look to see how much oil bottle contained there be only mere driblet at bottom plainly therefore must pause no longer so instantly without further thought waded across pool ran along only passage led from have to stoop a ran from feel to foot guessed that passage led upwards first then downwards apparently too in perfectly straight line river therefore must be behind tried to make point fixed one so a to give notion of bearing after hundred yard so emerged into second cave chamber also nearly waist deep in water from several passage opened too small to admit of man passing through then must be canal of gu gu have spoken one of possibly that must have supplied pool with immortality memory of crowd of eager patient face disappointed by such miserable trick made lance feel pitiful then pity brought sudden practical suggestion why not open sluice whatever be now give miracle must at least keep of crew quiet when came at dawn dawn might be so fatal to quiet dawn must surely be close at hand raised torch saw close beside foot two above present level of water clumsy closed stone conduit with iron handle be rude primitive tap doubt by level must be raised without further thought turned smiled to find right a water poured out filling vaulted chamber with sound then without further pause passed on down biggest of passage leading from chamber since seemed most likely one after while however passage narrowed seemed in danger of ending altogether so harked back there be longer sound in chamber when returned to level of water have risen almost to floor of passage in stood wondering of other outlet have best try choice be case of sheer chance of course told mere backing of one luck a paused to make something cold struck on foot causing to look down in sudden surprise water be still rising must be stopped anyhow unless be to be drowned out like sewer rat stuck torch into cleft in rock beside hung net to swam over to conduit be already submerged handle have turned so easily be stiff now possibly because of pressure of water possibly because there be other rude mechanism of be unaware anyhow after few trial realized that be helpless until water have found own level what be who must tell must rise rise rise till filled whole place who must tell be not fear clutched at heart only vague self pity almost amused wonder that immortality for others might bring death to looked up into vaulted arch above then to a yet dry passage must

in search for death for annihilation bore witness also a came cursing who stood in way horse slithering among stone in effort to obey whip spur sending dry clangour of hoof beat through little stony valley to startle sleepy snake coiled on distant rock drive back to cranny with hiss so instant distance lessened between old man young one weary of life be broad daylight now though sun be still low

akbar khan indeed saw utilizing one of tall taper a pipe light before casting on ground to suck contentedly at screwed banyan full of tobacco have gathered by claiming pinch in return for loan of same light to others with curious shame roshan avoided passed on in search among jostling crowd continuous babel of trivial talk for be resting time when men woman must be men woman forget that be on pilgrimage when must even dream back in village under familiar shelter of village tree asking more than familiar round of life above babel came now again insistent clang of bell telling that new petitioner be seeking favour of god making golden oriole sat in green leafage flit to bower with sudden fluting note full joyful mellow what dost seek musulman cavilled saint drawing back from roshan shadow a gabbled invocation knew on rosary ere solacing with pipe disciple have prepared if 't be madman god hath gone yonder pointed to side track be short cut to road above roshan flung from horse without word followed distance lessened at step now for old priest breath failed at steepness of rise still must not delay long told to take one look at soft white cloud generally hid goal of pilgrimage before turned back over hill a best must to find what task remained for in world might have one look surely so reaching summit of first bulwark of unattainable sat down breathlessly beside

marigold dry basil leaf about base to tell that be fragment of older faith than of temple below faith sterner purer founded on clearer perception of what humanity needed in search for lost paradise on closer memory of cause lost laid one hand on stone almost caressingly a holding pyx in other sat down facing distant peak there be cloud upon day have dawned clear still a sat looking wistfully over valley on valley hill on hill lay bathed in light between cradle of god sunbeam still slanting from curved edge of eastern plain caught jewelled star of what held stayed there be peaceful beyond word hurry strain not only of long eventful night of whole long eventful life seemed over thing seemed behind passion pride courage manhood thing have made ninian bruce what ninian bruce have be where be

laughed wildly for what taught fair play favour mean to have in fierce excitement pressed closer flourishing rapier pardon came cold courteous voice did not teach that method of assassination surely thought desired fair play if so might allow to meet on equal term roshan drew back with flush from figure have stood ground looked at with bitter disdain scarcely seemed to recognize wonder for be ninian bruce ninian bruce a might have spoken to over hasty antagonist in day when be most reckless swordsman in rome when world held body soul year very priesthood have slipped from beg pardon sir muttered roshan standing aside there be savage satisfaction in heart man be not old odds be equal there be enough fire passion here to please opponent so after pause to lay aside pyx found strange resting place on blunt summit of upright black stone slim still elegant figure divested of priestly robings took stand back to hill face to world still upright still active with black soutane caught up tucked into sash to give free play to limb now sir came courteous voice be ready something in proud grace of bearing reckless contempt made roshan follow suit sun will be in eye said let fight lengthwise to ridge will by by came that icy voice a speaker without moving stood on guard can omit salute if be ready be for instant roshan hesitated realizing what life that meant to take have be what man whom meant to kill have be be man whose figure stood out like black shadow against distant blue of hill a realized fine fibre of enemy sense of powerlessness to touch to harm kept roshan motionless will count five give start question came with shrug of shoulder taunt told roshan pulled together stood on guard also sense of powerlessness be intolerable lowered rapier for word more word to raise own self esteem warn said haughtily that sun be in eye have learnt more than ever taught that be to death must scarcely be anything else must came instant reply in voice vibrated harshly like harpstring struck to fullest with dead woman between engage devil will kill a stand roshan gave short sharp cry like wild beast next instant curious hiss of two meeting blade sliding along other be only sound be strange sound to listener onlooker seems to say hush to whole world hush hush sh sh then short sharp a cry of roshan came sound beaten baffled clash when steel meet steel instead of flesh roshan with inward curse gripped rapier closer have almost be disarmed disarmed in first encounter strange that must have forgotten foe forgotten deadly insistence of master blade slack a snake

passion of youth drove roshan back step one step down faint slope on have counted fierce lunge two swift parry then then inch beyond safety given purposely yielded room for riposte sought from that other rapier came with quick cry of triumph a roshan felt that thin cold steel slide silently on through dull faint resistance cry ended in gasp a hand held rapier dropped for second then flung upwards for pidar narayan have given reprise l'addio del marito have done work so for instant held upright by lingering force of old man hand two stood within sword face glaring at other stern implacable one in death other still in life then strength life ebbed balance between death wavered ninian bruce overborne by enemy dead weight sank to knee then backwards hand still gripped rapier so
