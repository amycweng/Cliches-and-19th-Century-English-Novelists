far down where water showed like huge round dewdrop so time went on until sootullians showed blossom bud dhropudi cut first tooth on one same day perhaps excitement of double event be too much for

below where voice of two woman ceased to be articulate for be one thing to beat wife of bosom in order to correct trifling indiscretion to deny attendant right of subsequent abuse so smoked pipe placidly amused with polishing well beloved sword kept in defiance of arm act poorer woman of village nodded at other a shrill clamour floating over high encircling wall reached well where came to

house must have kept safe enough jewel doubtless so war of word begun on top story of faizullah house found way into narrow village street thence into many mud walled courtyard where woman set down

of border bravo remained ready for emergency on whole however afforded beautiful example of civilising effect of agriculture a such figured in many report having a object glorification of british rule consequently be watched with jealous eye by district police official who felt sheet anchor of reference must be gone did serious crime occur to throw discredit on converted community despite constant care village might have be situated in moon for authority knew of pretty intrigue hope fear formed mainspring of life even ordinary human interest of inhabitant be too low in tone insignificant to secure alien sympathy so haiyat bibi peeping eye delhi made jewel be disturbing element unknown to who signed monthly criminal report with placid self satisfaction at own success in securing virtue even when egged on by family best looking male cousin made bid for possession of charm in various underhand way consequent employment of faizullah khan marital discipline did not resound so far a hakm

murder dropped into comparative insignificance indeed detail of crime be meagre in extreme though evidence of previous jealousy on husband part even to point of grievous hurt be copious did family of murdered woman late husband hesitate to accuse blood relation of deliberate attempt to seduce from path of virtue in order to bring about poisoning of bold faizullah subsequent transference of affection jewel to more suitable husband inquiry indeed opened up such vista of conflicting rascality that district officer be fain to draw decent veil over by accepting result namely that on certain specified night between certain specified hour faizullah khan not content with having beaten wife to verge of death during day have stealthily completed devilish work dragged corpse of victim mile two from village stripped of ornament left to be devoured by jackal hyena in support of statement gruesome remains found be said day after woman disappearance be produced sworn to vociferously by relic of

unfamiliar that opened eye in fright relieved to find in unmistakable flood of sunshine doe not exist out of india briefly felt thought felt kiss upon lip now smith jones like most well trained unemotional english boy have strong dislike to kiss lumped with many other thing under generic term bosh confined to reserved peck at forehead of mother sister aunt occasional very occasional cousin

by occasional sudden turn modulating tone into higher lower key in accordance with spirit of story from musical point of view there be nothing remarkable in performance save absolute want of vibration

sportsman be crawling on stomach to certain long low pool much frequented by teal mallard in rear gleaming white through caper bush showed usual cloud of witness filled with patient amazement at unnecessary display of energy yet for counting shrewdly on good temper likely to result from good sport so much so that sudden uprising into bad language of huzoor sent forward prodigal of apology sight met eye dried up fountain of excuse nuttia stark naked stood knee deep in very centre of pool catching small fry with bag net ingeniously constructed out of manchester veil punchaiyut sat again to agree that child who must not only destroy sport of guardian of poor must also drag village honour through mud despite munificent inducement toward decency must be possessed of devil so nuttia be solemnly censed with red pepper turmeric until yell struggle be deemed sufficient to denote casting out of evil spirit be not in slow brained calm hearted peasant of india to be unkind to child so
