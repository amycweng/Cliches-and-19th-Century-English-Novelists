into one so a to include inspection work before turning at right angle along canal owing to good sport on way one have started by daybreak through bar be to say hard waste land dotted with tuft of grey caper bush stunted tree just high enough thick enough to prevent one seeing more than twenty thirty yard in direction since beyond that clump became continuous hedge shutting out world colonel tweedie immediate staff having ridden on in haste shooting party beguiled by prospect of bustard have spread through jungle on one side of track followed by horse groom mr boynton however preferring such road a there be have be walking horse along in expectation of being rejoined when sudden firing of unseen gun made arab bolt first along track then missing at bend beast have swerved into bush where thorny branch have caught in long tail making perfectly unmanageable after mile more have apparently broken into track again sobered down to walk much to delight then solitary native traveller have passed assured a imagined that be right for sahib logue camp so have trotted on until fearing might lose track once more have be foolish enough to walk horse back on trace thus completely losing bearing finally at fork in almost invisible path have be forced to confess that have not least idea in direction destination lay north south east west sun therefore being of little use to a guide here pretty smile growing trifle tremulous made george profusely indignant with desert then regaining head remembered to have heard mr fitzgerald who a mr keene must know have of course joined camp on entrance into division say that more open country lay eastward so have ridden a straight a must into shadow that being best chance of steering aright here george grew clamorous over courage nevertheless have almost failed said when on sudden great silver streak of canal have appeared from among bush have ridden along bank till came to treeless waste with big mound looming in far distance

while be writing note for camel sowar george slipped away to give instruction to factotum bedroom must be swept garnished thing pitched away anywhere drawer must be re papered towel put on dressing

heap of other thing so perhaps 'd better say good bye have told servant about lunch sort of thing trap will be here before dark ' very nice boy indeed thought mr boynton showed thought so george went over to palace feeling quite intoxicated because have be instructed without fail to dine in own house after have settled about quarter with dalel have ridden off on fictitious tour of inspection dug spur into pony out of sheer lightness of heart went sailing away over desert careless even of direction in went dalel meanwhile have repaired to shadowy arch in state of boastful superiority friend keene be coming over to stop in palace must play card be jolly drink lad always carried key of sluice gate on watch chain 'it be chance indeed said chandni with queer look then after time broke in on dalel vapourings by snatching banjo from wall breaking into respectable plaintive love song thou hast thy way have mine ' laughed recklessly 'let see who succeeds best ' so slipping on decent white domino set off for palace turned down dark passage leading to woman apartment doubtless be chance must not be neglected between desire not to disturb mr boynton kindness too early dislike to becoming prey to dalel at palace george in end have to gallop pony last four mile then found with ten minute in to dress dashed up narrow stair leading to odd little arcaded room placed at disposal by diwan

recognition inside be more wonder in table set out with flower mr boynton coming forward to greet with bouquet of jasmine maidenhair amid soft ruffle of white dress be humiliating yet still amusing having to confess came not from courtesy factotum sense of duty then very sight of man in spotless raiment lording over mr boynton kitmutgar be pure comedy in fact when dinner being over george be left face to face with three napkin swathed black bottle hung with foolscap ticket of port sherry claret engrossed in village schoolmaster best hand gave one look at mr boynton before exploding into laughter while vowed to keep menu to dying day if only to show folly of allowing fact to interfere with fancy by by when coffee came in factotum diffident over breakfast cup triumphant over under footman with hot milk sugar on dinner plate laughed again yet laughter brought moisture to george keene merry grey eye in vague way boy knew what have happened knew that most beautiful woman in world

of view seek to give variety to question by importing into female friend reminds ' said a listened to hope that be fairly comfortable george tacked on to good night 'you have most fascinating blue pot

being laid for at least might tell come what might must see ay must see a ought to be seen be not very safe interruption for george to have found awaiting in long moonlit shadow of arcade have be in same mood a girl not even though plotting scheming must have seemed incredibly absurd to at time in mood indeed even by dim light of cook room where factotum be putting away copy of menu among certificate a proof positive of acquaintance with appetite of ruling race chandni snare must have met with derision deserved in dark intricacy of palace politics seemed simple enough especially to one of vile experience a so happened george never went near palace sat on canal bridge till dawn smoking one pipe after looking aimlessly dreamily at dark window of bungalow one must have foreseen not even lad have intention of out watching star when balmy air feeling of measureless content first tempted to pause set aside forgetfulness of sleep for time must have be sleep when be in desert alone with god know what ruffian about rage grew up in at thought of dalel kind until palace became distasteful so almost before realised that be on watch gurglings of many camel thud of mallet told that

engrossed in novel sight of canvas city rising like magic from bare sand first came autocrat with measuring tape peg mapping ground into square then one by one in appointed place great ghost of thing flapping white wing against purple sky to rise stiff square above fringe of even silvery rope be not until saffron coloured glint in east startled into thought that be confounded as george out of sheer lightheartedness ran way back to palace stumbled up steep stair threw into high lacquered bed to fall asleep before saffron have faded into daylight perhaps be a well since even hodinuggur sun have be at work since beginning of thing might have stared to see masher in dress clothes knocking into moghul palace with milk stared instead at more familiar sight at girl face down on bare string bed in woman quarter sobbing a if heart must break chapter vi naturally enough george overslept naturally also woke to feel hustled bustled for be due to meet incoming camp at border of district at certain hour feeling proceeded to vent on factotum for being late with early tea that worthy have have carried over from bungalow in odd little procession tailing off to of large eyed village lad lass learning betimes custom of ruler in addition george have promised mr boynton answer about ayodhya pot now even by hurrying loathed must scarcely find time to seek azizan in old place still did hurry

'gordon sahib salaam deta ' triviality yet rose quickly thrusting letter into pocket so have come already have known well enough that must miss that must come to seek be soon indeed gave permission to

from delhi must be more difficult for to refuse note down on table besides george keene leave must be over must have returned to hodinuggur possibility of confidence given under influence of strong excitement must be over for gwen have not failed to notice strong friendship growing between two in way be vexed at what seemed to childish almost absurd deference to lad opinion on dan part dan who be superior in possible way be to say if chose to be reasonable last of delay meant closer proximity to annual flight to hill must provide with safe retreat so set idea aside for time became cheerful over respite george having tea with next day thought if possible gayer brighter more charming than ever especially when talk turned on hero dan fitzgerald now one have ever heard mr boynton say unkind word of neighbour indeed peculiar cachet gave to personality made remembered in after year by admirer not so much a beautiful a perfectly gracious woman to george accustomed chiefly to high spirited freedom of sister virtue seemed divine more so because world generally disapproved of dan of recklessness want of reverence gwen boynton on contrary found nothing to regret save mr fitzgerald be not finest man out of service instead of in since a mr gordon said be too good to slave among men year junior whereupon george young face full of importance informed a dead secret that reason dan stuck to colour be that girl have promised to marry whenever got promotion must be in next spring at latest since a george keene be in charge of sluice prejudicial contretemps must possibly occur gwen with actual smile at mystification so many woman dearly love reminded that even when folk did best slip came between cup lip lad laughed joyously 'oh venture to stand sponsor for young woman of course only meant that dan must get promotion if depends on gate being kept shut carry key about with like hare did in pair of spectacle be peculiarly inconvenient of course a say on surrey side villain who must reach must pas over dead body ' gwen who have fine taste admired determination underlying jest mr fitzgerald said be lucky in such friend nevertheless might be doubtful kindness since loss of promotion might induce to seek fairer fortune elsewhere insisted on argument even with yet heart beat uncomfortably fast when delay having be extended to limit of possibility sat awaiting dan arrival in pretty room be so like in softness solid attention to comfort beneath delicate tasteful ornamentation three thousand rupee in note be ready for use in pocket long letter from hodinuggur in george fine bold handwriting lay on writing table beside bouquet of flower lewis have sent from garden that morning from next room came sound of ayah dusting out box against immediate packing up gwen excuse for delay have vanished yet found hard a ever to face one man confidence confidence showed in glad greeting forced into beginning remotely half affectionately by regret over want of tact at delhi conference have not be unqualified success so far a dan departmental popularity went how must when have deliberately savagely attacked wisdom of elder true under secretary have sniggered in describing scene even mr gordon have laughed amid vexation saying that none knew better than what confounded as colonel tweedie must be when confronted in public with new idea at same time have be needle almost brutal on fitzgerald part seeing have right on side that alone must have made temperate of course once method have be suggested other be open to one out of lunatic asylum more reason for mercy in bringing fact home so gwen in soft voice attempted to convey blame to sinner who with hand in coat pocket stood before trying to look penitent only succeeding in looking provokingly debonnair 'but sure be blatant stupidity of world be greatest crime ' protested ' remember mother saying to oh child mind being naughty can whack for will not have ye stupid gwen laughed who must help over picture of home training so utterly unfit for one recipient at least indeed be conscious of wish that companion be more dull le full of eager vitality made that inevitable task so hard 'dan began desperately

in short with covert hint have forced to rivet chain bound to deceit at least so told then be proficient in art of playing thimble trick on own mind a often a not be really incapable of saying where motive power of own action lay so a sat in wicker chair waiting for george keene felt quite virtuous over sacrifice of own honourable instinct on shrine of friendship even if anything did happen real

last night crumb relaid by wife cousin with superfluity mark new zeal in india tried to think of what have thought said done since first caught sight of silver streak steering southward where streak

carefully what saw there clinging to inner surface of ward changed heaven for in twinkling of eye even a silver streak of water have changed world be very simple thing only piece of wax how long sat there staring at did not realise yellow haze outside grew ruddier with sinking of sun water carrier shadowed by white robed aspirant to dead factotum duty hovered about verandah expectantly 'what do want fool ' bawled george looking up surprised at own anger surprised that anything must touch save thought that have known must have known that have done must have done man edged in through screen signing to white robed one to follow example 'only to bring huzoor began noisily 'only to bring proof of honesty to foot of justice lo be found even now by man with foresight quickness to be commended

upon new world a far a hodinuggur be concerned where desert have stretched thirsty dry lay shoreless sea where streak of silver have split round horizon into half double line of canal bank looked like

elsewhere well whoever have done be watchman diwan deserved something at hand of department be past record bad one not act must have reward just reward if must compass ten minute after have driven chattering servant from room grief stricken yet convinced into sort of calm acceptance of inevitable have lifted poor lad body tenderly to bed scarcely even thought of reason for tragedy perhaps there be none for dan in rough ready life have seen thing before have known useless search for adequate cause be there not cause enough here for sudden loss of balance that race down from paradise to purgatory intolerable journey horrible homecoming then cursed bottle have left remembrance sent whole mind into useless regret if have only ridden faster if somehow must have be there in time to

mechanically to pick up revolver round boy dead hand have still be closed felt that given necessity for sudden return rest might be inferred then beside revolver saw open locket with gwen smiling face staring up at gwen great god what did mean own locket of course yet sat down at table white a death looking first at pretty face then at still figure on bed now decently shrouded from glaring light of day by degree colour returned to cheek must not be so be not cruel only careless ah what grief must be to besides george be not one to put life long regret of sort into friend life so pondering realised that among other incident of home coming have be that of learning who sweetheart really be that then did not happen at simla so must not have be cause of lad sudden return why then have come new lock key lying on table gave clew quick wit suggested danger to gate then came to in flash confusedly almost irrationally that have be done for sake hers be on knee by bed in minute george george why did do ' so with answering silence came decision impulsive yet immutable such blame a must be taken must take one must know dream of failure one must ever say 'ah poor fellow shot must have be something wrong know ' rapidly counted cost possibility of silence hodinuggur separated from by impassable stream must not be taken into account so must accept risk there must not be much if servant tale be true that have only discovered master death when storm began have done no more than send word to palace one then must have seen body save four five servant who loved master worshipped rupee above desired peace quiet not dangerous rakings up of past always followed on advent of police then for department what have said in ignorance be true whether george have opened sluice when a servant said went out in middle of day whether palace folk have done department in case owed opener debt of gratitude if latter moghul must be glad to keep silence if former even if set up claim for compensation for damage must have be due so much have dan arrived in time to carry out order thus injustice must be done so hour afterwards one of servant started along path to outer world with telegram to headquarters that evening when flood have subsided little dan chose out driest spot must find in sandy compound read church service over friend body one told must know truth except day perhaps gwen when came there a wife then must tell pity needlessness of yet needlessness have virtue in that made concealment possible for flood have swept away error if error there have be telegram

anyhow a rose tweedie with pretension of utter indifference to sentiment well poor girl be face to face with reality now for have certainly cared good deal for george even to extent of trying to keep from gwen wile poor george fine young fellow who for one thing have be saved bad heartache have intended passing on a quickly a possible to hodinuggur being delayed by necessity for settling endless requisition for repair have barely reached rajpore ere dan fitzgerald returned reporting that there be reason for to go out permanent repair be impossible till rain must be over a lesser flood must run down channel cut out for by deluge everything to ensure further safety of palace have be done barring diwan tower there have not after be much damage a jewel treasure in vault below have be saved besides bumper crop must follow on inundation must more than compensate for loss there be however certain anxiety in dan face a said 'well even if be to claim ' replied lewis complacently 'the saving of sunowlie bank must be dirt cheap at few thousand cost over two lakh be in awful funk about thinking must be too late tried to intercept poor george with wire knowing must take order quicker a be already on way dan whole soul leaped towards possibility got after be wondering ' paused angry at own imprudence 'wondering what ' asked lewis impatiently ' be going to say missed then did see how must possibly get there in time by way when did get wire ' 'about hour after sent off ' said dan uneasily did not care for lewis gordon sharp practical eye on detail be say ten o'clock on morning of

trifle of course have better stamp on inaccuracy show be on watch will go on to cooking generally ' 'yes replied dan slowly simple difficulty in concealing discrepancy of time have escaped before be fully alive to now most men in place must have set question aside at cost for further consideration risked possible consequence of evasion dan mind be of finer temper must trust to thrust home at moment be true test of power be only second thought of commonplace be better than first so took advantage of occasion calmly knowing man 'but be right did not open gate believe george did even of be not sure however will judge for ask for confidence of course have right expect will give same then boldly plainly yet with one reservation told tale of what knew what surmised george have shot of that

two men sat looking at other across office table littered with paper thought unknown to other flew to one woman memory brought tear to dan dark eye left lewis hard a nether millstone in conviction that gwen be at least morally responsible for george keene death came to a certainty yet contemptuous tolerance came with have not meant of course woman never did to play fast loose with boy head yet have done so have spent too much money have be careless honest perhaps though even might not be so one must tell why then must try to find out now when be irrevocable when harm must come out of

despicable that world can not get on without who insist in breath in unworthiness necessity gwen said to after dan have gone be very woman capable of ruining man in week if chose then being sorrowfully surprised at result still must be unkind to wound needlessly by telling result more so because must certainly tell other people rose tweedie might break heart over even if pigeon holed mistake be found out might get up fiction about telegram having reached george after compensation might have to be given even in case must see need for raking up mud since claim must be just one

have also suggested girl in picture be in league with chandni did not look that sort did look a if rose glanced from pure oval of cheek fine long curve of mouth to mr boynton tear stained face frowned beome one have pearl said 'and george memory must be saved somehow chapter xxiii 'come in ' word be given in impatient tone for lewis gordon be busy hated being disturbed especially when a now have

curved top of forest of young deodar day be bright a morning in rainy season can be bright by very contrast between brilliant light shadow in earth sky bright a rain cloud when sun shine on fresh breeze came in with rose tweedie through opening door blew paper off table beg pardon ' came in duet a lewis fumbled blindly for coat eye glass having deserted in surprise after manner of eye glass a did so felt injured not that be such crass idiot a to be outraged by pair of shirt sleeve in others knew quite well that man can look dignified when struggling even into lounge coat liked to be dignified especially with rose tweedie irritation however hid under different cloak be to say annoyance at most unusual intrusion perhaps read expression of in face for first word be excuse ' came here to office mean because want to ask something did want to feel hampered not a friend know ' eye met in confidence of being understood so far at rate gave rather stiff little bow 'you be very welcome wo take chair chair perhaps ought to say have be sitting morning will be glad of change unless require time if so will send 'no thanks prefer standing also ' interrupted with quick flush only wanted to ask question be about george keene ' 'yes replied coldly unsympathetically yet be noting anxious eye haggard face with sort of angry wonder why must make so unhappy rose finger held nervously to edge of table by stood 'have reason mean be there officially reason to suppose that hodinuggur sluice be opened before flood came down before mr fitzgerald ' paused with eye on lewis face have lain awake almost night thinking of chandni threat hint with clear sight have seen that worth unworth depended largely upon official report of what have actually happened at hodinuggur to father must not go without danger from want of judgment there remained lewis who be always just always to be trusted in such matter heart gave quite throb of dismayed surprise at question forced by contrary into still greater chilliness of manner `` m afraid ca quite see right to ask question a yet perhaps if must give reason yes can give reason interrupted with ring of scorn in voice 'though think might credit with good one where george be concerned surely only if have to tell have better send for chair thought perhaps must understand for once ' bitterness of tone did not escape accentuated annoyance a handed chair leant negligently against table hand behind told that be in for mauvais quart d'heure with girl man like must expect to know womanlike must expect sentiment to outweigh official integrity thought did not serve to soften heart towards dead lad even at beginning a story unfolded face grew sterner sterner hers lightened be infinite relief to have advice help told so frankly even while appealed for 'you need even answer question mr gordon ' went on earnestly 'you will know so much better than do what have best be done thought of going to see woman ' 'you did go hope ' put in lewis hastily made up mind to ask first see if there be truth in truth 'that be unlikely warn ' interrupted lewis 'these woman really miss tweedie if follow advice much a may pain at time will leave business alone absolutely alone be not one with excuse for even alluding to fact girl such a be must meddle unfortunately men have to face thing be not pleasant even for ' 'you speak a if thought george be guilty ' said rose hotly 'what right have to do ' may have more right than suspect believe miss tweedie be heartily sorry especially for so far a be compatible with fact will do best to avoid official esclandre must matter really crop up in meantime be afraid must decline to interfere in what mr boynton tell stigmatised a impudent attempt at blackmailing have fault doubt like everybody else have excuse for saying so more knowledge of world than have in fact must scarcely do better than take advice on point ' girl with frown on face rose from seat slowly refuse to find out truth be content to let suspicion lie upon upon upon cousin ' lewis smiled 'that be rather far fetched miss tweedie surely idea of suspicion with be simply absurd a for gwen well know be ready to admit have fault have called claim impudent blackmailing must excuse if incline to believe 'and for george keene do suspect be going to allow memory to be smirched have told will do best for rest must take consequence of own act be afraid indeed be sorry very sorry ' added hastily impelled to by look on rose tweedie face have grown ashen pale yet stood steadily before eye on unflinchingly there be truth in have better tell must be kinder to tell if can ' perhaps after must perhaps if scandal have to come to light must be better must be prepared even if did not be not wiser must know real truth about george keene so be able to judge fairly not bad boy of course that talk of bribery be doubt false have done no more in other way than hundred of boy in like position even at simla have only run wild bit for that be not only one responsible still when be said done have shot that alone made task of whitewashing impossibility if woman chose revenge 'yes there be truth in ' said gravely 'if will sit down again will tell everything know then can judge for must like to understand however that in spite of appearance believe george lent to anything more than what must not perhaps most of must expect in young fellow of age position life be be rather intoxicating to to of ' so leaning against table told truth trying to do task calmly kindly yet beset by certain impatience at still figure seated in office chair elbow among file coil of beautiful hair showing beyond hand in face be hidden what business have there what business have thought of pain to come so close to closer even than

finger dan fitzgerald who be seated close beside have evidently be last to speak be now leaning towards eye fixed with kindly encouragement sympathy on face lewis gordon apart from others elbow resting on table looked half regretful half resentful look of man who know must take initiative in singularly disagreeable duty at last through silence came rose tweedie voice reluctantly yet with sort of challenge in ' suppose be settled that can none of suggest other reason why must delay longer have told before ' broke in mr boynton have reason to believe that action will be taken by woman that will never court inquiry ' ' did not mean that ' replied rose still with same note in voice ' meant that if none of have further knowledge beyond what have already discussed then mr gordon plan for private yet open inquiry with father knowledge seems best for one have none know nothing absolutely nothing in favour of delay nothing must prevent possible danger to george keene memory ' lewis

loosely against lintel lewis gordon mechanically turned page of book lying beside on table tension be over relief of decision even of helpless decision held silent in silence for moment have done best have played part in strange play then suddenly out of mist came quavering chanting voice 'it be woman seeking something through day night ' cried dan face ablaze rose hand went up again to picture

breath of relief rose seemed lost in thought 'no not everything ' said absently half to herself 'it doe not tell why george shot ' scarcely knew spoke aloud have forgotten everything dead boy word came back to in sort of cry what do mean what doe mean ' gwen stood a if petrified before regretful face then a truth struck at beating down shield of self deception turned at last forgetful of else

of other surprise thank heaven ' semi cynicism of word did not sit ill on rose recognised that have certainly chosen most dignified way out of difficulty at same time left free unexpectedly free to

soon a possible there seemed need for word situation explained even lewis looking at rival eager face must not help acknowledging that dan be more likely to give gwen support evidently needed than be besides sudden change for future seemed lost sight of in opportune arrival of ayodhya pot have on present on chandni impudent claim be of course clear evidence against truth of story so far a gwen be concerned whether must prevent woman raking up true fact of george keene death out of sheer wanton malice be thing lewis felt rather helpless before phenomenon of such nature a hers confessed a much when dan came racing back breathless excited after seeing mr boynton safely home for council of war brought quick decision intuition with sluice have be opened by treachery of course now that be free to speak of engagement dan told story of open locket to seemed proof positive that george have voluntarily taken blame on when thrown off balance by discovery that happiness of man woman loved best in world depended on dan getting promotion how sluice have be opened be matter chandni have always said by mean of key made after impression sent from simla be manifestly impossible unless servant have done indeed have never paid much attention to assertion for woman in making have contradicted more than once evidently have definite story a to how impression have be secured in own mind have decided that key have be stolen from boy while slept so heavily that knowledge that be so have have lion share in bringing about self sacrifice so that even if real fact came out nothing beyond carelessness must be laid to george charge now that potter be there to prove that azizan have have ayodhya pot time that be there to prove that pearl have remained in pot so much for chandni only possible cause of further action woman wanton cruelty for rest old diwan be dead khush hal seemed to be out of dalel have everything to lose nothing to gain by scandal finally intrigue be always a house of card remove

refused to say on return from bazaar asked for whisky soda hot bath to take taste of out of soul body yet returned triumphantly with written declaration signed by chandni stating that have stolen key from george while slept be true of course ' said dan with rueful look at lewis 'but upon soul one must tell if be not mind seemed vast cobweb with line going everyway into outside world beginning in

curse into tale of azizan birth seemed have be strong card potter eye have played one against other till wormed story out of enemy while old man waited below ready if dan failed to be told truth to

parted on best of term offered cinnamon tea fritter took a sign of peace ' said dan with shudder now must be off tell poor gwen 't be settled for ever lingered moment a rose to add with half shy half happy smile very much surprised old man havery ' replied lewis with dignity dan still lingered ' wonder what on earth colonel will say remarked apprehensively after pause then lewis laughed must not

asked to do too much for foolish fancy about being keeper of dan conscience of latter have told have be too much for dear dear lad kind sensitive heart then terrible home coming after pleasure spoiling be not that enough more than enough to upset balance be so insistent on point lewis have to confess assent to finally went away feeling that have more heart than have given credit for in past that might even be in measure responsible for not having appealed to better nature while have chance dan seemed to have done successfully for have evidently given up thought of mercenary marriage understood said plaintively knew fault yet loved while lewis must excuse for saying so have always treated a if have heart sentiment have always committed unpardonable mistake of making remember that did not love of course have behaved abominably to everybody far worse than must allow for be too good for in future must have dan who be tower of strength to in fact like many woman of type many man also gwen boynton have taken refuge from greater remorse in lesser one if indeed there be greater one if indeed real limit of sinning have not be that over confidence to have confessed not in detail

when have got thus far remorse be once more in clear open channel where must spread out lose chill under sunshine of dan kind consolation thus really turned out that after person most upset by unexpected denouement of affair be colonel tweedie 'engaged for year said angrily in reply to daughter information 'well be surprised most extraordinary proceeding er er complicates er if have said of

innocent lewis show clearly that altered situation have made change in yet be not expected to make change in only by mean must show be really truth that past avowal of interest be not mere sentiment lewis for part also tackled position with boldness have denied to while be still engaged to cousin still smarting under curiously mixed sensation knowledge of girl real feeling have aroused then have felt bound to conventional mode of thought to tell truth have be more le afraid lest on inquiry sentimental love for rose might pop up somewhere like jack in box for confession have affected in perfectly incomprehensible way only other explanation of have be loth to admit since ran counter to pet theory what feeling must there be between man woman save one feeling warmth at heart when

belonged outwardly to faction yet in heart strenuously resented old fashioned theory that marriage be larger half of man life whole of woman truthfully though be three twenty have never felt slightest desire to marry anybody not even lewis felt in consequence proportionally grateful to for behaving at rate a if believed fact yet even so sometimes found other out a for instance one day when came back from cousin full of unexpected news dan fitzgerald have sent in resignation to department accepted offer of employment from australia `` m a glad ' said lewis heartily if have have chance partly because must make anything of brown be man who have wired for be out here contracting one of big railway bridge bloated mechanic began life a riveter sort of fellow with knack of making money keen eye

hodinuggur profuse promise that in future must be abode of civilised virtue khush hal beg appeared have died of apoplexy brought on doubt by unrestrained orgy with fat man have celebrated accession in

thinking that if rose must only see man only hear might not be quite so disdainful of might acknowledge that be bad good in essence feeling did step into man life for time claim body soul to detriment of by by said dan suddenly `` ve be meaning to ask for long time be sure if 'd like now that be going away for good ca get out of being best man will risk when be going to marry miss tweedie ' replied lewis firmly roused into instant resistance 'what put fancy into head now 'now dan face be study in tender humour be in head for last year in yours too told gwen so remember before went to hodinuggur time must see by manner thought so also ' lewis looked at with odd expression 'then be mistaken be ' fitzgerald if be quite done talking about have lot of work to finish old chap dan laughed 'well will go be true gordon what be more like one can see ' true absolutely true lewis knew right well none better remembrance of affection have given unasked filled a ever with glow of intense satisfaction yet have to confess that be not happy that idyllic month spent in other company have be charming fortnight of absence have be reverse what felt now be something very different from calm contented confidence in mutual friendship remained thank heaven untouched by new passion for be that nothing else have felt before for other woman moody restless selfish desire of appropriation if rose must not marry must probably feel again for one else in half hearted way almost regretted that must have obtruded in most perfect idyl of life yet call hard name must there be palpable factor in future rose be best of friend be also very charming girl into whose company have be thrown have fallen in love with naturally enough only complicated matter gave queer little grimace began to add up column of figure telling that doubt must get over a have got over similar attack before at rate must wait see anything seemed better than risk of paining rose by letting think that after have failed to understand absolute unconsciousness of regard for that might think so seemed more than likely since with experience knowledge be only just beginning to realise that passionate love be indeed thing absolutely apart from affection for so much so that almost seemed to that must have be easier to tell of former if latter have not hedged in with reverence tenderness came to with smile indeed in truth must have be easier have be able to send barber round with proposal to father in native fashion after there be immense deal to be said for side of question then in careful methodical fashion began to add up column of figure again time total be different trifle to be easily set right yet be not used to such aberration of intellect annoyed did again time allowing thought of rose anything else to obtrude new set of figure rewarded perseverance laid pen aside faced resolutely yes have be doing atrocious work of late have be thinking of rose day long have not be able to settle steadily to anything unless must be stopped sooner took advantage of many change in department consequent on dan going usual cold weather return from furlough in order to give up present position better there be nothing like breaking loose from one surroundings at once be due promotion if have to do rose ought to know reason why must live in fool paradise why must not face fact of life a well a if have be like other woman have known must have made love to proposed a matter of course be not like others rather what did know of matter save that never by word look sign have shown knowledge even of most

affection regard have given apart from felt for still have to be done in common fairness to to must tell that be fool that life be quite unendurable without must tell if only because there be other earthly reason why must give up secretaryship if have to be if have to tell then there be time like present when necessity for action seemed clear to so ten minute after walked into room where rose sat making wedding favour a for dear life surrounded by perfect chevaux de fry of white satin ribbon bow blossom window be set wide open on to verandah where great basket of white flower lay awaiting final visit to church on table stood lotus lily offering with note from gwen to say be too good to be trodden on must rose see pretty thing be put on altar where must look quite sweet girl in white dress with brisk hand flying about scissors needle thimble mind busy with coming marriage seemed like surroundings in unsympathising connection with purpose perception made say discontentedly a paused

beauty there be beside on table take care be almost sitting on smell be real orange blossom ' there be apparently not vacant chair in room be occupied with white wreath true lover knot with cross here there be glad to see so continued to lean against table smelling perfunctorily at own favour thinking of utter inconsequence of feminine mind until certain irritation came to aid ' wish must put that work down for minute rose said quietly have something want to say to ' hand paused arrested among white ribbon mind on one word for have never before called by christian name so sat looking at doubtfully with light from window behind edging great coil of hair with bronze ' have come to tell that be fool began almost argumentatively 'at least suppose be foolish be quite ready to admit if

have because have nothing to do with question besides there be degree in friendship have taught that so think may admit that understand question be if will understand ' paused rose kind shadowless eye noted with sudden shrinking back from sight that usual calm be broken by palpable effort to steady voice felt indeed that have not least clew to girl mind that be absolutely taking leap in dark that what have to say now be in reality so foreign to single word have ever said to other before even if consented to marry must not be sure if meant if really understood difference saw so clearly 'rose ' went on 'the fact be that have fallen in love with with if really want to marry have better go away must take out district for time have have enough perhaps too much secretary work ' seemed to take refuge in detail from main point why must go away asked rose in low voice 'we be very happy be ' eye have sought hand among white satin bow came back to face anxiously almost fearfully 'why ' echoed passionately a went on word voice manner trembled in fine balance between humour of thing gravity rose be question because be fool say because be man say because love rose because think of when ought

will never understand dear thank god ' said at last in undertone then went on in different voice 'it be little confusing rose must admit time ever since told that ' interrupted quickly eagerly 'ah be totally different thing altogether 'totally different ' echoed meekly 'yes of course then paused again with eye on hers suppose must rather did kiss ' began irrelatively with half smile of infinite tenderness mind ' put in hastily doe really matter if wish only talk nonsense lewis please do hate so make feel inclined to put head in bag 'then wo ca afford to lose sight of dear face just now ' 'lewis 'but if say that sort of thing what be to talk about ' asked only half in jest 'the weather news not very interesting subject of to man when girl love have just promised to marry for have
