old hand trembling with work fierce old eye ablaze garment stained bloody beyond white pile of tomb red flare of burning roof tree told tale now again uproarious outburst of horrid menace still more horrid laughter came to hint that work be not complete yet overhead star shone peacefully a ever above city pale radiance of death feast showed serene remembrance of festival duty came to old man mind in great pulse of satisfied revenge tomb be again nay not saint of whose foot be dust saint who must visit world night sat for instant staring over way towards own hovel then rose slowly showing in

there be anger also in voice a thou wouldst have done also clerk though thou art if yea know know interrupted hoshyar impatiently if have not emptied bag so often 't be pity to let money lie idle time when thou hadst sum needed for journey must have gone meant to have gone swear leave failed thou wouldst not surely have have give up post then ere leave came money have gone instead can never keep lying idle so raheem anger faded leaving nothing pain what use be there in finishing sentence in reproaching sinner with having done far worse than let good money lie idle fact only made pilgrimage

bag back into box with chink turning key upon salvation yes be what really meant to raheem meant salvation for one soul for after brother have gone asked question for hundredth time asked almost feverishly ought to trust to chance be likely that must have time ere life ended that life have always be so uncertain to make provision for hoshyar in death must not do to trust hoshyar with money raheem must make pilgrimage for be likely when rupee came so slowly went so fast that hoard in bag must be complete for year ought not then to make over a according to canon must do if chose virtue of

at work on scented comb whenever finished one spent of scanty rest in toiling over to imambarah bazaar paying over fairly earned price to swell deposit secured to one of limited supply of ticket finally on one night very night before day of starting packed up comb complete took price of last one over to moulvie received in return neat little booklet full of incomprehensible printed paper felt almost afraid of new possession with gay tie to keep everything in place within cover supposing lost something found stranded broke out at thought into cold sweat hunted hurriedly for extra ticket moulvie have told be to be used to junction since railway passed through town be not on direct line found ordinary third class ticket tucked away safely fright made resolve on keeping separate hanging precious remainder in bag round neck empty money bag must do better still there be bit left yet of hoshyar little coat of brocade ticket deserved fine holder a sat stitching away at familiar fragment however by flicker of cresset certain remorse assailed at having seen so little of brother during past month true hoshyar for various reason preferred coming to see ever since eed raheem have be dimly conscious that something seemed to have come between soul meant to save be that knew in heart ought to be already saved there be longer need however for such question so soon a bag be finished must go

quickly set aside money for thee hoshyar though thou camest not be here five rupee hoshyar looked at little pile with queer expression leaving plinth came within reach of whisper will not serve to night said quietly must have thirty thirty echoed raheem have not thou hast in box see here brother thou hast told always that money be mine for salvation well need must have spoke almost carelessly a one who have certainty of succeeding in truth thought so once before raheem have almost emptied bag to save from ruin have calculated deliberately on being emptied again when have bought yasmeena new dress out of office fund must have to be replaced at end of month raheem must not have given pice for purpose of course with detection disgrace staring brother in face must be different besides money be for salvation listen raheem went on summoning up penitential tone brother interrupted swiftly sort of dread in dark hollow eye there be naught in box now brother said with catch of fear in voice

turned back to bazaar be thou art fool said yasmeena with yawn after hoshyar have raged for quarter of hour of ill luck of brother foolery of extravagance why didst not take ticket must be worth something surely then sudden interest came to languid eye where vice seemed weary seest thou beloved have idea old deena drum player be for ever talking of second hand salvation hath forty rupee saved

slept heavily also perhaps because seemed not to have care left in world after hoshyar have retracted reproach bidden go in peace peace what else must remain in man heart after renunciation in dark deserted mosque upon homeward way have left raheem conscience clear at last left without wedding garment yet content now with ticket to junction duly snipped bundle in one hand other assuring of booklet safety in brocade bag passed down platform in rear of rush from waiting shed looking diffidently for seat in close packed carriage with iron bar struggling occupant looked like cage of wild

disappointed pilgrim be simplicity even to raheem never thought of connecting ticketless cover with deena coverless ticket fact that chance be gone absorbed utterly have lost salvation for very thought of taking back gift to hoshyar be impossible to be outcome of so sat patiently waiting for train to come in sat patiently after have found place in waiting for to go on so absolutely absorbed

sunshine air of modest importance forming halo round old rickety figure a with one hand clung to plane table old rickety a with other to one of large eyed keen faced indian boy who seem to have be sent into world in order to take scholarship old man on contrary be of monkey type of race small bandy legged inconceivably wrinkled with three day growth of grey beard frosting brown cheek only wide set brown eye have certain wistful beauty in in front of appealing eye sat ruddy faced englishman backed by white wing of office tent deep in calf bound book red taped file on table before on side discreetly drawn apart so a to allow central group full picturesque value be tall figure massive in beard wide turban in falling fold of dingy white indigo blue massive also in broad capable feature made broader still by capable approving smile over old man boy plane table so standing be typical group of jat peasantry appealing with confidence to english justice for observance of indian custom then head men be satisfied with ad interim arrangement asked palpably foreign voice semicircle of writer subordinate official on striped carpet beyond table moved head like clockwork figure to circle of peasant a if giving permission to speak chorus of guttural voice rose in assent then after village fashion one voice prolonged in representative explanation will be for three year so shelter of world be aware that field can not run away old tulsi know how to make three legged one work thus there be fear speaker thrust declamatory hand in direction of plane table chorus of assent rose once more so matter be settled matter being briefly appointment of new putwari in other word official who measure field prepares yearly harvest map showing area under cultivation on land revenue have to be paid in other word again man who stand between india bankruptcy in particular case recently defunct incumbent have left son who be a yet over young for hereditary office head men have proposed putting in boy maternal grandfather a substitute until former must pas through necessary modern training in accountant college at head quarter proposition be fair enough seeing that gurditta be sure to pas a be already head of queer little village school elder viewed with incredulous tolerance to tell truth doubt be not without reason for on very day when englishman be inspecting first class have bungled over simple revenue sum one must do in head with aid of course of ten god given finger without usurer must indeed be king master have explained mistake by saying that be fault of rule only arose because boy have forgotten be bigger of two number that in be something over to chuckle under breath nudge other on sly ari hai lad must be forgetting next end of plough to hold share handle purumeshwar be praised only upon slate must forget since true born jat hand must never lose such knowledge footnote universal god footnote monkey god so underlying manifest convenience of not allowing stranger finger in pie elder of village have secondary consideration in pleading for old tulsi ram appointment desire namely to show world at large presence in particular that there have be putwaries before came to cast mantle of protection over poor besides old tulsi though looked like monkey might be sri hunuman in wisdom necessary for settling thousand petty dispute without village must be so dull then be real saint to boot more saintly because be willing to forego preparation for world in order to keep place warm for grandson in after be only for three year tulsi three legged one must surely manage map for so long if not well be great matter since field must not possibly run away so went off contentedly in procession tulsi ram clinging ostentatiously to plane table by reason of straighter longer leg looked for world a if be taking charge of not of looked still more in possession a stood decently draped beside old man a worked away at long column of figure for mapping season be over nothing remained addition subtraction division at of old tulsi be adept have not indeed dipped far into euclidus in salad day when be favourite disciple of renowned anchorite at janakpur gurditta by time be away at college kishnu widowed mother a cooked millet cake in other corner of courtyard wept salt tear at thought of unknown danger be running deadly danger be for have not father be quite healthy until government have insisted on using three legged one then have not gone down wrestled with on low misty level of newly reclaimed land by river side caught chill of have eventually died thus when rainy season came on plane table still decently draped be set aside for shelter in darkest corner of hovel looked to poor kishnu like malevolent demon ready to spring out upon little household so naturally enough when tulsi went to fetch out for first field measurement found garlanded with yellow marigold set out with little platter of curd butter kishnu have be propitiating with offering old man looked at in mild superior reproof thou art ignorant woman daughter said be devil device of learned of much use to such a who make map thou shouldest have known that true god be angered by false worship therefore counsel thee to remember great mahadeo day lest evil befall so passed out into sunlight bearing plane table in debonair fashion leaving abashed kishnu to gather up marigold baba ji told be brave have not to bustle about house day with shrouded thing glowering from corner however since for gurdit sake be wise to propitiate everything took platter of curd butter over to mahadeo red stone under big banyan tree nevertheless felt triumphant that evening when old tulsi came in from field dispirited professing appetite for supper have in fact discovered that studying text book making practical field measurement be very different thing especially in treeless formless plain where only land mark be mud boundary cone be set to verify therefore can not ought not to be considered fixed point however managed at last to draw two imaginary line through village thanks to purumeshwar big green dome of mahadeo banyan tree swelling up into blue horizon indeed felt so grateful to latter for showing clear even over plane table that sneaked out when kishnu back be turned with platter of curd of own for great many armed trunk of course be very different from making oblation to trivial plane table that evening spent lingering light in decorating border of map be yet to come with finest flourish just a told kishnu to show protector of poor that have not committed putwari ship to unworthy hand yet two day afterwards replied captiously to daughter anxious inquiry a to what be matter there be naught wrong only one of three leg have sense of duty must get carpenter to put nail to despite nail however anxiety grew on face when nobody be looking took to tramping over plough surreptitiously dragging primeval chain measure after in occupation looked like monkey who have escaped from owner plane table with old man mantle draped over pugree placed on top have very dignified appearance in corner of field for be hot work dragging heavy chain about old tulsi who be too proud to ask for aid so disclose fact that have have to fall back on ancient method discarded clothing must after have to give in gurdit father did field by field said head men carelessly when sought advice fret not baba ji 'twill come right thou art better scholar than ever be field by field echoed tulsi aghast book prohibits seeing that there be not verification since none can know if boundary be right broad chuckle ran round circle of elder be that sri tulsi cried head man be soon settled jat know own land warrant man of will verify field seeing never before have have such settling day a thine not error not injustice purumeshwar send gurditta to be a good putwari when come nay 't be gurdit who be putwari already replied tulsi uneasily therefore must there be mistake so will do field by field peradventure when be drawn on paper may seem more like book where thing move then can begin again by rule there be quite pleasurable excitement over attested measurement of field old munnia parcher of corn said be almost a good a fair to trade man clanked chain round own boundary while neighbour stood in now sprouting wheat to see fair play talk over past history of claim tulsi ram meanwhile squatting on ground drawing away a for dear life even child went forth to see show munching popped corn sidling gingerly past three legged one to say sooth looked gigantic with spare clothes of community piled on to indeed village woman peeping from afar declared kishnu to have be quite right urged further secret oblation a prudent if not absolutely necessary so took to hanging marigold again taking care to remove ere old man rose in morning result be eminently satisfactory for a put one field plan after away in portfolio tulsi ram face cleared be so beautifully green far greener than in book so surely there must be mistake ala when came to try fit together a must be on map resolutely refused to do anything of kind be judgment felt for having disobeyed text book so next morning rose at peep of day determined to have out legitimately with three legged one lo be garlanded with marigold set out once more with platter of curd butter thou hast undone ignorant woman said with mixture of anger relief now be clear true god in despite of thy false worship have sent devil into thing to destroy so despite kishnu terror tear threw offering into fire dragged plane table out into field with ignominy even protestation failed poor old tulsi one vast wrinkle of perplexity be obliged once more to refer to circle of head men gurdit father managed thou hast twice mettle replied vaguely interested sure devil must indeed be in seeing that land can not run away of hath not run away said tulsi dejectedly there be not too little too much of too much land idea be at first bewildering to jat peasant then sent into open laughter here be mistake indeed yet lust of land so typical of race showed in eye a crowded round map tulsi ram spread on ground be model of neatness field be greener than greenest wheat right in middle of be white patch of man land trra rolled broadest of party after instant stupefaction that settle be mistake for look 't be next field if 'twere there plough must have be in long ago sigh of conviction relief passed through circle for mere suggestion have be disturbing nevertheless since gurdit father map have never indulged in white spot tulsi must be purged from also look said one of youngest 't be a when child make puzzle of torn leaf have fitted askew so let cut own field out of paper set aright then ensued hour of sheer puzzledom since if white spot be driven from one place re appeared differently shaped in devil be in said at last somewhat alarmed since who brought land might be reasonably suspected of power of taking away must offer scapegoat meanwhile old tulsi need not talk of calling in aid of new putwari in next village for be one of new fangled sort empty drum making big noise a likely a not must make pay double if there really be extra land because have not come into schedule before must ask schoolmaster first since have experience in finding excuse for mistake be trust unfounded for master not only have excuse in something called reasonable margin of error also remedy declared late putwari have always adopted briefly snip here bulge there general fudging with old settlement map elder clapped old tulsi on back with fresh laughter bidding not try to be cleverer than others so sent back to drawing board long after dusk have fallen that evening old man sat staring stupidly at great sheet of blank paper on have not drawn line be business of what gurdit father have done seeing that too be of old school inwardly if not outwardly gurdit when returned must allow of such dishonesty tulsi be in boy place there be time yet month at least before inspection in to have out with plane table so when wild goose from mudbanks came with first streak of dawn to feed on wheat found old tulsi attendant demon there already at work on dewy field when sunset warned grey crane that be time to wing flight riverwards left tulsi three legged one still struggling with margin of error then must sit up of night plotting planning till dim dazed look came into bright old eye have to borrow pair of horn spectacle from widow of dead friend be getting old told kishnu who be in despair a men must get old matter how many marigold ignorant woman wasted on false god for have taken boldly unchecked to oblation again in end inspection day found that white bit of land white a ever nay whiter against dark finger pointed at accusingly since a ill luck must have only native may call black judge be inspecting officer most admirable young bachelor of art from calcutta university full to brim of solid virtue utterly devoid of sneaking sentimental sympathy with quip crank of poor humanity lichen of life make rough rock water worn boulder so beautiful to seeing eye must not occur said speaking after manner of alien in english to clerk in order to enhance dignity be gross negligence of common order write a warning that if better map be not forthcoming locum tenens loses appointment with adverse influence on hereditary claim adverse influence on hereditary claim word translated brutally a only clerk can translate sent poor old tulsi into agony of remorse resolve month afterwards kishnu spoke to headman three legged one hath driven putwari crazy said remove from will die justice justice so be removed hidden away with obloquy in outhouse whereupon sat cried that have ruined gurdit gurdit light of eye heed not bengali said at last in sheer despair be fool thou shalt come with to big sahib will understand seeing that be more race than other be how came to pas tulsi ram sat on stucco step of englishman house pointing with trembling truthful finger at white spot among green while circle of bearded jat informed presence sri hunuman be not wiser better than putwari how do account for mean what do think be asked foreign voice curiously wrinkle on tulsi forehead grew deeper bright yet dim eye looked wistfully at master of fate 't be over large margin of error huzoor owing to lack of control over plane table be what book say be what gurdit will say what do say how do think that bit of land came into village tulsi hesitated gained confidence somehow from blue eye unless purumeshwar sent bit of world suggested meekly englishman stood for moment looking down on wizened monkey like face truthful finger accusing white spot think have said at last go home tulsi colour blue will pas a bit of paradise so year there be blue patch like tank where tank must be upon village map old putwari conscience found peace in correct total of column of figure added together while three legged one released from durance vile at special request stood in corner garlanded with marigold of thanksgiving perhaps be reason why next mapping season patch of paradise have shrunk to half original size perhaps be that really have more control over plane table at rate treated more a friend by spreading leg very wide apart covering with white cotton shawl so using a tent when sun be over hot yet when on gurdit return from college with first class surveyor certificate paradise became absorbed in legitimate margin of error there be certain wistful regret in old tulsi pride said that being ignorant old man be time returned to find paradise in way thou shalt not leave for wilderness a before swore jat in council lo gurdit be young hasty thou wilt be needed to settle dispute so will give thee saintly sitting of thy very own in village tulsi objected field be field said house be house only led to difficulty to put odd bit of land into map must be quite satisfied to sit

for future when govind education must be over be free to follow hereditary trade a writer father have found ancestral level oddly enough in compiling sanitary statistic in english office until cholera added one to mortality return by carrying off a victim after interest of life to inhabitant of little courtyard slip of roof govind called home centred in clever boy who must only follow father trade

enhancement of delight have be omitted boy went through countless ceremony tending towards apotheosis of sens with certain shy dignity perhaps sight of master ji doing wedding guest in copper coloured alpaca coat gave confidence by reminding even learned stoop to folly be pale partly from turmeric bath be supposed to produce complexion favourable to feminine eye partly because really felt sick after unusual sloth sweet of last few day so much for physical state of mental condition much may be presaged that if inherited instinct acquired conviction have reality must have be chaos more chaotic than ever when far into night after endless test trial nihali mysterious bride proved beautiful a a well fact be sure only comparison remained doubtful inherited instinct said peri acquired conviction angel will be observed denizen of world then there be more other world than one master narayan chand hath sent to remind that school re open next week said govind mother when nigh two month

nihali despite awful lapse looked sweet good enough to fill heroine part in novel look did not belie past two month have be fever of delight to govind with curious apathetic resignation to limitation of custom so noticeable in clever indian lad whose brain be full of theory have accepted marriage in spirit of forebear only to find love with big l such a have read of in book be actually within reach to be sure in book object be chosen by lover what did matter in end so used up stock in trade of sentimental novelist for little nihali benefit listened to rhapsody on perfect marriage twin soul

hardly known whether to be pleased pained at discovery that after hearing read over few time knew repetition better than did yet shy of own exploit only replied to laughing reference to holiday task by timid squeeze of hand still holding hers mother in law broke knot with snap habit with determined little woman who thereinafter must twirl end together a if nothing have happened one twist of thumb

guilty pair must only hold other hand like babe in wood feeling lost miserable afternoon went over to public library for first time since marriage spent hour hunting up precedent on subject only to return discomfited hopeless nihali must revolt of course if bade follow lead how must bear to have finger of scorn pointed at by unacquainted with theory of perfect marriage twin soul night when rest of little household retired from roof leaving luxury of fresh air to younger people nihali sat down under star on still flower strewn bed cried like child be so with awful swiftness dawn came when govind have to put on pale pink turban proclaiming first class middle student set off to school with book under arm book on whole le disturbing than amor vincit omnia congener nothing further have be

appearance in very place where little bride have sat on lacquered bridal stool squatted mother piecing two broken strand of skein together a if nothing have happened nothing out of common have happened whose fault be if govind flung on face wept like baby for what be beyond reach mother have expected so much when planned coup d'etat continued to cry did not expect for something more complex than simple passion have be aroused in boy of might have be ashamed in gloried be not in short legitimate subject for self glorification so wept sick in subdued docile sort of way finally master ji called one day in consternation to say that though painstaking a ever poor govind must not remember simplest problem while a for rider just sat looked at scholarship be thus in danger tried scolding boy in good set term met reproach with invulnerable superiority before stood aghast what be to be done perhaps spiriting away of bride in order to avoid scene have be error be that reason why must be requested to return to begin with must be appalling breach of etiquette then there be risk of consequence much to be deprecated between such very young people whole household including master ji puzzled over difficulty seemed more puzzling because be so uncalled for boy having be married at fifteen sent to school again afterwards since time began without fuss then boy have not read amor
