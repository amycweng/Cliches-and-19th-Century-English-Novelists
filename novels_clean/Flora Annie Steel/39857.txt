old lord marrion more to still thought than from necessity have set task of clearing up making tidy one showed duke handwriting half mechanically have reached down to pick up then woman a rule have not nearly so hard fast rule of conventional honour a men on such point so have smoothed out read evidently memorandum made to help out memory excellent in way random careless write for room at cross key order trap from crow copse by avenue gate drew in breath considered thought punctuated by rapid beating of heart cross key be inn where south coach stopped where ferry road branched off must almost see from window across estuary on edge of moorland what did marmaduke want with room there trap from crow be little inn down in back purlieu of town for whom be trap wanted why not order from big posting hotel a usual then in instant solution flashed upon marmaduke have not really gone by afternoon coach if have so far be to return night to cross key trap be to take fantine le grand to by bridge road beating of heart steadied folded up paper put in pocket vehement determination somehow to frustrate plan almost forgotten for time in wonder at chance have brought to knowledge paper must have fallen out of pocket of coat andrew have be packing up how easily might not so have fallen how easily might not have noticed facile wonder obscured real thought a usual in such sudden crisis concrete determination hid under one general determination to frustrate machination of enemy if possible did not even ask how be to be done told be that must be done so rousing to sense afternoon be passing to evening that be time for to be in attendance at castle went thither feeling vaguely that if be necessary to kill woman even must be done sooner than must be allowed to hamper marmaduke young life fantine le grand have not yet come up from daily duty of amusing lord drummuir so marrion mechanically began a usual to prepare for evening toilette found valuable gone from jewel case after hasty search discovered in tiny valise ready packed hidden away behind lace ribbon in drawer so have be right fantine le grand meant to give slip ere have time to consider fretful voice came

much a be necessary replied marrion steadily heart be hard a nether millstone waited in boudoir till soft regular breathing told fantine be asleep then giving order in passing that mistress did not wish to be disturbed made way back to own room at keep house in order to mature further plan in be hampered by ignorance a to what have to frustrate must have be easy to walk down to crow countermand trap for aught knew to contrary marmaduke might be awaiting mdlle le grand there so judged better to adhere a far a possible to what did know pointed to someone taking trap a ordered whether to cross key not mattered little meeting very idea stirred blood of course must do must go beg nay force to reconsider action must for ever ruin with father colour came back to face light to eye with decision mind be busy at once with precaution cross key knew be held by new people who must not be likely to know still must do best to avoid recognition to begin with must secure retreat looked down estuary

silk stocking little lace furbelow two big black silk cloak go far in semi darkness be to be found in mother wardrobe having time to spare indeed marrion spent half eagerly half reluctantly in seeing how near must bring to daintiness of modern fashion so far succeeded that a went away from looking glass face showed radiant a of girl going to first ball unconfessed thought be there that marmaduke must see so possibly in discarded brocade worn by own mother in youth anyhow in garment of own class so with ample cloak round hood drawn over shining hair piled in latest fashion made way to copse by

chilliness foretelling coming storm flame of crackling wood danced on wall making two lighted candle on table unnecessary half mechanically blew out with sombre almost stern face stood watching blazing stick suddenly cheerful well known voice rose below puppy much better mr mctavish what wife have come that be right wife for instant marrion head whirled be too late confused memory of what in scotland constituted irregular marriage sent flood of crimson to face a realised that duke have unwittingly acknowledged a wife before witness footstep coming up stair two step at time steadied what followed shook to very foundation unheeding of feeble duke a opened door be across room holding in arm passionately kissing averted face neck hair be good whispered now for splendid honeymoon for second yielded then wrenched from faced fairly be making mistake captain muir said sharply be only marrion paul must have liked to add friend dared not at moment knew be far more than marmie echoed stupidly marmie at first be too surprised for more then drew up stared at angrily what deuce be doing here said at last adding hastily a possibility struck did send be ill in long drive girl have gone over over coming interview settling what must say sudden solicitude of tone swept preparation away did then really care if so nothing naked truth must be use replied calmly only tightly interlaced finger showing tension of mind body be quite well gave double dose of sleeping drop to prevent coming came instead because wanted to speak to flickering firelight showed sheer anger on young man face sheer brutal anger because wanted to take place eh gave little sort of sob what must not have given to take very intensity of desire made pas insult by be use being angry said quietly came to try make hear reason may a well listen ca come to night surely meanwhile can sit down talk over a friend used to be friend admit replied coldly if be going to presume on friendship a appear to have done sooner

one must have dared to do wo do marmie understand that old man wo call father marmie wo give two thousand pound for majority fantine le grand have shown how to get paused in sober truth now came to think of plan for so getting le appealed to marrion waited second then said how there be reason why must have answered categorically did perhaps at back of mind be desire to know what thought of gave forced laugh be to dance for oh know stuff be talked about dancing men woman must go abroad must get leave of absence for six month on urgent private affair one must be bit worse must commented marrion briefly there be world of scornful criticism in word oh dash cried marmaduke man ca always ride high horse have put in deuce of hole though suppose meant well see ca wait for now a must see pringle tomorrow can come back again added complacently will then mean to to marry woman put in marrion rose angrily began to pace up down room in sober truth once more now that be away from fantine

cloak ran downstairs night be dark moon shone fitfully between rift in cloud rain coming in gust with wind have ceased for moment drew hood of cloak over head ran swiftly past lighted window of bar thinking have escaped moment after heard swift step following own turning to look saw marmaduke hatless coatless in pursuit instinct of chase awoke in in second doubled off white road behind shelter of low beech copse marmie marmie stop tell be little fool easy to say that be be fool not if kept in such cover a there be might reach boat before must in old day have run a quick a knew where boat be did tucked petticoat high above knee like leezie lindsay ran a for dear life if have failed in mission have must not fail here that last double have be successful cry of marmie marmie be so foolish

jumped lightly from hag to hag sparing time to look round for figure behind though knew must be perilously near for instinct of chase be a strong in perhaps stronger than be in cheek be flushed eye be bright heart beat high despite breathlessness knew that did so also briefly have forgotten everything save determination to have own way marmie little devil stop tell came voice close behind then splash loud damnation told that have missed hag must give time redoubled speed raced to shore not pausing to unfasten boat waded through water almost swimming last bit to where rode at anchor on outgoing tide clambering over side set to work at once to unknot rope from bow ring not second too soon for marmaduke after minute delay due to flounder unavailing search for shore ring have found got cried joyfully spoke too soon rope undone gave easy way to strong pull boat with marrion laughing in bow drifted slowly out from shore stood looking at useless rope in hand by light of moon now riding serene overhead for brief summer storm have passed zenith now lay to south dense bank of black quivering now again with throb of summer lightning must see tall white for cloak have long since be flung aside heart whole admiration possessed marmie cried hold up by god will swim after want to speak to took oar stopped way by holding on to one of submerged seaweed covered rock of boat pier waited why did run away why must stop gave truth squarely fairly because must have passed a wife if have chosen might hesitated relieved by low whistle by jove said slowly almost absently did think of hesitated in turn thought marmie said loved voice lingered lowered in altogether distracting fashion turned hastily to other oar let blade drop into water with splash aye said be why for see have got to be lord drummuir word silenced watched scull away dark shadow in darkling water then voice rang out to a be from very far off flash light to marmie dear when get to other side will wait till see be safe

remembrance people who play providence gave moan turned face to wall chapter xi when marrion arrived in england just before christmas found white world of snow seemed to not so white so pure so chill a soft pall have lain on marmaduke muir grave on balkan height when stopping at varna on way home on purpose to visit have found unrecognisable under heavy snow for winter of ' ' be severest on record even in southern mountain there have seemed no room there for tear remorse pitiful plaint to be forgiven for trying to play providence so have come away more stunned than ever after long year of self sacrifice to find step have taken be mistake be bitter indeed to realise that if child lived time meant to ensure that there must be ransom of life must have deprived child of birthright be agony yet there be escape even if andrew fraser have be forthcoming news of have come since alma height be won still must not have made claim be over done with have promised old man none must be made have persuaded duke to do same must stand by word brooded brooded over until once more self sacrifice became obsession with not even for sake of child must duke honour be smirched besides might be girl then must not matter so much besides clinched question even with andrew must be hard to prove marriage for during few short year have not troubled to act a wife knowledge that be married have be enough for duke have always be known a mr marsden lawsuit must be dreadful be unthinkable must hing to rectify past mistake must dree weird must not get away from past in a in thing else doctor have be right when time came nearer must follow advice go to edinburgh to man who have invented chloroform doctor forsyth have said be kind must tell story beg to let die save child meanwhile there be gold snuff box meant more to now than when be given meant that there must be someone kin to child someone who perhaps if life be taken a toll must look after must try while there be yet time be first charge set to work at once therefore to arrange for visit to poland extraordinary likeness to father of have spoken doctor forsyth have noticed also have seen be too valuable asset to be wasted yes must go over to ancestral house give gold snuff box into safe keeping ask even beg for recognition even if father have be widower one of son might be married there might be woman with pitiful heart to listen sympathise ere went must write to peter muir to begin with must assure that brother have be well looked after then have nothing positively nothing of marmaduke peter knowing care have lavished on year might give something ring have always worn be what craved most in long ago day though there be not so very much difference in height what wore on little finger have fitted second have be too large for third when have wanted to wear in place of plain gold band so have bidden wear instead little tender memory seemed so precious now so wrote in fine slanting caligraphy of day somewhat stilted little letter asking for what wanted a favour not demand since though have claim have right in reply received friendly note dear marrion if will come see will give ring something else have sent letter to peter club be dated from house in palace yard so went there be fine old house footman opened door butler advanced to meet majordomo out of livery stood way up stair very different from old day when two brother have be more le out at elbow time now of course peter be heir to estate found looking wretchedly ill in most luxurious study weak face lit up at sight of in friendliest of fashion sit down in comfortable chair said there be querulous note in voice really in time like when a paraphrase run 'days be dark friend be few 'gathering cloud be normal outlook be duty to be comfortable bring up average when marmaduke be be here be for ever at for extravagance hated jew used to borrow from old jack jardine instead paid off something not be afraid pitt virtuous pitt owed thousand however a be saying be duty nowadays to be comfortable so have amount of post obit out to say nothing of kite be always coming back wanting longer string new tail care old man may outlast anyhow ca live long so be short life merry one looking at hectic flush with damp cold of hand fresh on touch of hers marrion did not feel inclined to combat easy philosophy father asked peter shrugged shoulder a usual only more so paused spoke more seriously of course marmaduke death cut to quick wo speak of ca be only one believe be same with baron showed in anger wo see hear of yet 'd do best for 'pon soul that old man have be curse of life marrion sat silent in way be true old spider have enticed more fly than knew of into net for desire that marmaduke must not fall foul of father way lay madness be beginning to learn that must scarcely trust own judgment whole thing be so pitiful that reason seemed impossible may have ring asked in order to change venue can have good deal more besides replied peter muir giving queer look a rose to go to despatch box lay on table marrion recognised a marmaduke when thing came home continued searching in oh here be ring handed to thrilled at touch of a must have thrilled to touch of man who have worn did not look over paper very carefully have heart when be looking for ring yesterday found something interest held out envelope took indifferently few thing really interested nowadays be addressed to major muir at club vague wonder a to what must contain crossed mind a took out paper contained then sat silent staring at helplessly for be duke counterpart of marriage bond thought have seen burnt to ash on night when marmaduke have said have made feel like scoundrel how idle how unreal world be must one be sure of anything must one be certain that everything be not dream peter voice roused of course doe make much difference to now marmaduke left very few pound third a wife must amount to anything there be portion when peer dy ca see why young oaf of cousin who will come in eventually must have for even if outlive father will have enough for time be well be brick to marmaduke to too always denied marriage have notion be only denial there be reason therefore why must use be proof positive of marriage if be must be only survivor therefore have action besides must annoy old man extremely upon soul deserves all can get have struck wrong chord to marrion absorbed in one enthralling question a to whether marmaduke have known of survival whether have not suggestion that be sole arbiter came a shock agreed said slowly to annul marriage thought know thought paper have be burnt doe make difference to intention that be then promised promised father claim must ever be made because duke be dead be that reason rose suddenly walked to fireplace threw envelope content on fire be what duke meant muttered to herself helplessly peter muir watched with half cynical half admiring smile well know best dear of course personally must never let come to want capable woman looked at incapable man with wondering tolerance still must say be disappointed must like to have seen governor face when sprang upon remember be villain of piece a said deserves everything can get may be replied marrion ca see be at fault have to pay for must ca get rid of past said word over over to be not till reached lodging that realised fully that past have claimed future yet what else must have done if have only known what duke must have said have found out paper have not be that reason why in short ten day of heaven have never never never alluded to past yet that heavenly present have become past too have stretched out into future have be taken by surprise have made mistake threw on bed cried quite foolishly until perforce being physically unable to cry more mind reasserted thought came again one thing seemed clear must not possibly tell what duke knew did not know must not be sure what must have thought must have more of trying to impose view on that being so only person who have say in matter be lord drummuir for sake of heir might absolve of promise child might be girl might not live finally began to cry again softly silently tear count for utter soul weariness in truth be weary one thing seemed clear being that have failed that have mismanaged everything that everything seemed in hopeless tangle be in sober truth very near limit of perfect sanity when with passport secured through peter muir vienna influence started for krakowitz village on russian side of carpathians near pauloffski estate lay be difficult journey one have judged rightly have better be undertaken at once change did good be almost again before came to conclusion yet a sledge with tinkling bell four horse toiled up last hill two felt depression come upon again outlook supremely beautiful be still melancholy to degree snow snow everywhere towering peak valley pine forest burdened with like marmaduke grave have be light burden so cold so deathly cold a sledge dashed up steep narrow drive pine tree swept snow layered branch overhead of burden fell in soft mass on marrion fur driver turned round with smile said in russian be absolution from sin excellency curious answer to thought with answer came remembrance though sin be a scarlet will be a white a snow remembrance brought confidence perhaps after tangle consequent on playing providence might be going to be straightened out front door of unpretentious tower with building like barn built on to that stood magnificently on little plateau overlooking valley with faint glimpse of plain beyond be wide open at standing against not leaning upon pilaster be most striking figure of woman marrion thought have ever seen extreme old age have set mark on lined face with thin white hair drawn under lace lappet figure be that of girl of twenty extraordinarily tall massive in proportion upright a dart with activity in curve line lady gave dignified bow a marrion still closely veiled a protection from bitter cold came up step princess pauloffski asked tentatively in french for be impossible to think figure of servant be princess pauloffski be dignified reply in slightly guttural french might speak with for few minute continued marrion nervously princess smiled ah be english son paul be long time in england scotland replied in better english than french must be cold come in take off wrap few rapid word in country dialect sent driver sledge round to stable while marrion with unforeseen thrill of pleasure recognised that beautiful old princess must be grandmother be looking for son daughter who be dead said hostess quietly a led way into house dead always come back with snow have so many despite warmth of wide passage heated by huge stove marrion felt slight shiver run through how have grandmother learnt to speak of dead a if be alive a passed on to sitting room where great fire of pine log be burning on open hearth marrion removed veil threw off heavy fur cloak so a came out of dark passage into sunlight streamed through sitting room window stood revealed effect be not nearly a startling a have anticipated be far more overwhelming old face lit up with sudden pleasure thin old hand be stretched out sacha said darling after year never came before paul did be twin though have only just gone sacha have wanted so often tear sprang to marrion eye dear lady said taking outstretched hand holding chilliness of age in warm clasp be not sacha be paul daughter princess pauloffski drew back passed hand over eye excuse forget live so much alone dead come to see so often when there be snow if be not sacha took step forward scanned visitor narrowly say be paul daughter english daughter did then marry over there for be true be daughter even twin be not more like come sit down child tell how come by paul pauloffski face be almost incredible marrion a obeyed grandmother gesture felt inexpressible relief here there be haggling questioning be taken literally on face value be haven of rest together sat on quaint old settle a if have known other for year while marrion told tale produced golden snuff box with glittering monogram laid in old princess lap merely glanced at chilly old hand be busy detaining hand have laid there hand be still alive yes paul be dead murmured half to herself sacha died first when be so beautiful like paul wife died now two son be gone there be none left be very old now come tell more child marrion went on with story be like dream to be sitting there in streaming sunlight heart to heart a be with someone of whose very existence have be unaware one short half hour before be commoner noble asked old princess quickly when marrion mentioned marriage have title then began latter old finger tightened curiously protecting clasp then be still princess pauloffski be glad be interrupted with satisfaction of house change name when marry beneath a did for dear soil waved other hand in embracing gesture be father father father husband be good kind man loved go on child marrion went on now god be praised god in high heaven be praised cried old princess exultantly here braving cold spending life seized little brazen bell lay on table beside rang violently very old maid servant appeared be addressed volubly in patois that many order be given marrion judged by frequent bob curtsey of domestic who finally trotted out in great haste not one word more darling cried old woman forgetful of everything save abounding sympathy quick to fire toast foot so lean back on cushion make quite comfortable remember have to think of someone besides dragged armchair closer to hearth with strength of youth bustled cushion to shape removed marrion hat finally kissed softly on forehead with murmured god bless both be too much marrion dissolved into slow quiet tear for first time since doctor forsyth have told why must go home felt really that be blessed amongst woman yea amongst woman like one know half sobbed have looked to see may be impostor not with face dearie beamed old princess cry on tear will warm heart have be cold expect little one thrive when heart above be cold ah here come magda with posset marrion drank something hot spicy delicious while mistress discoursed to old serving maid old serving maid finally fell at marrion foot positively worshipped be so bewildering so unexpected that marrion just lay back let slow tear trickle down cheek in quiet orderly fashion puzzledom regret of last few month seemed to vanish for while in stress of new emotion forgot even grief for duke a two woman old young one sat talked after sledge have be sent away marrion have be simply commanded to remain for at least week to rest there be enough of grief to spare in conversation besides marmaduke death over princess be vaguely sympathetic since though have be british soldier have by decree of providence not drawn sword a enemy marrion have be a angel of mercy healing jew turk infidel heretic without distinction have not closed eye of own father knew that be dead said firm old voice though be only reported a missing for came back a child of old house always do come back to see once more alexis danish came also be fine young fellow wept when news came died a pauloffskis must die fighting for master have wept dear heart how have wept to think that never again must real son of real race rule over barren acre for see there be near collateral pauloffski men die young fighting a son grandson died now clasped hand ecstatically now there will be heir supposing be girl suggested marrion half laughing half cry old woman swept hand out in indignant unconcern what matter child be ever child ever chip of old block ever fresh root of old race have salic law here in russia princess be a prince mayhap better for old acre a doe not spend so much money marrion accustomed to rigid rule made by men listened amazed interested indeed word fell from princess pauloffski lip seemed to tighten bond between have often wondered when found a have done so often at loggerhead with milieu whether be like father now knew that have inherited even fault from strange weird old woman who lived lonely life amongst pine forest who saw dead people yet ruled domain with absolute despotism marrion have never have really intimate woman friend before found one here a if by magic doubt fear vanished there be one thing kept to herself be possible difficulty might arise in proving future little prince princess pauloffski title if legal proof of parent marriage be not forthcoming be only possible difficulty for knew in land where woman seemed to stand equal with men right coming to child through mother might be inalienable did not know did not care to ask for time being be happy a never before in life have be happy ten day paradise with duke have not be of world even so have be restless happiness have be felt here one did not think did not feel one be content so wandered with old princess grandmother who though be past eighty still walked like girl through pine wood visited peasant cottage where after voluble discoursings woman always fell at foot worshipped came back to frugal meal quiet evening when princess must discourse over subject under sun for be great reader brought shrewd feminine wit to bear on most problem most startling thing about be that never for one instant did admit slightest inferiority due to sex men think so must say be wrong by nature be hunter fighter thinker be woman who manage affair will be better for world when be recognised in day be rank heresy even marrion hesitated to admit truth most remarkable thing about grandmother be stable youthfulness of outlook nothing seemed to affect death made way for strong personality so day passed to week week to more than month marrion still lingered very different heritage from storm set cliff rich field of aberdeenshire different ancestress from wild wicked old man spinning spider web round very child must after go ask to let break promise for sake of heir must not be better to let heirship of evil slip choose heirship of good question be still undecided when after many delay set foot on english ground again then first thing to meet eye in newspaper be death of marmaduke sixteenth baron drummuir there be whole column about many virtue vague reference to sprightly youth summing up vice article ended thus title descends to late peer third son peter who regret to learn be in very delicate state of health none of late lord son having issue heir presumptive be distant cousin etc marrion felt vaguely relieved unless andrew fraser turned up knew if saw be child must move heaven earth to establish claim to title be quit of drummuir have right to be quit of old argument for against came back began to worry over once more especially when verdict of edinburgh specialist to whom told tale with passionate assurance that child life be always more valuable than woman came succinctly to point in case dear lady question doe not appear to to enter with care see reason why must not survive be something of shock for materialised many doubt many difficulty chapter xii spring have passed to early summer when marrion with little son in arm sat in sheltered nook among cliff on aberdeenshire coast looking northward over curved sea line towards promontory fifteen mile away on knew old castle of drummuir stood a have stood for century must not see with physical eye even in mental one bulked little for great protective possession of motherhood have overwhelmed very regret remembrance of marmaduke only made hug child closer a hers at first when realised that life spread before little marmaduke have agonised over thought that by own act have deprived of birthright by degree became more content a persuaded that fateful envelope must scarcely have remained in marmaduke despatch box without knowledge yet have never mentioned if have repented of action at time have said made feel like scoundrel must have amended have not done so never never have breathed one word to show that held whom have so tardily learnt to love a wife here in chain of reasoning always stopped for knew how must help knowing that if have lived if if always that if if life have to be lived must be set aside life have to be lived brought back to child in arm dreamt happily enough of future be not a if boy have home a long a princess pauloffski ruled over pine wood quaint homely farmhouse devoted peasant little marmaduke must have more than welcome for week brought ecstatic letter from that entrancing personality have already made mark on marrion character in way felt that have never understood own womanhood until have met with embracing femininity of brave wise old mind seemed to hold grip of whole world in very isolation solitude yes child must have better home even when commanding lovable figure passed might be that must remain a heir so marrion be in fever to have child there yet at back of mind be vague regret have chosen little aberdeenshire fishing village a place for convalescence because from must see view of childhood girlhood see right away to rattray head beyond north pole be not afraid of being recognised fifteen mile in country effaces familiarity kept much to herself taking child down with day after day to sheltered sandy nook where in hot june weather must sit dream rather idly must be confessed for sheer delight of living to have living child have absorbed mind so day passed until for last time carried down to favourite beach dry warm sand be perfect cradle for child scraped little hollow in at foot laid treasure down sat on boulder beside in absolute worship wave always restless on north sea tinkled lullaby on rock hard by be roused by sound of footstep so few folk ever passed that looked up surprised then gave glad cry stood up holding out hand for be andrew fraser also held out hand for one empty sleeve of coat be pinned to breast came rapidly towards seemingly unobservant of child till within few foot of then stopped dead stared at what lay at foot didna know said brokenly at last didna say god be glad marrion oh marrion be glad then without waiting to greet knelt down for closer look be real drummuir went on ecstatically be drummuir ah added trifle irrationally that colonel must have ' lived to see little lord drummuir something gripped at marrion heart let speak of now andrew said hastily want to know everything poor arm andrew for time being be entranced be said be wanting to know how old will be why did doctor fellow tell when tauld aboot be not easy to beguile from subject bit by bit marrion got from sparse account of how have be russian prisoner how have lost arm have be exchanged a disabled in balaklava have come across doctor forsyth who have given address in edinburgh where must be sure to hear of marrion how be doctor fellow who have be too busy to do more than supply with name of village whither have come to find here marrion recognising that road must lead to one point took heart of grace said gently child have made very happy andrew be so glad found to day for be going away to morrow andrew stood up goin ' whaur asked sharply tae drummuir why be ye not there now because have right there andrew replied feeling tremble despite boldness of word ye may have nane woman broke in sternly child have right to be ye gain tae steal frae ' be foolishness tae talk way ye ken fine that before god man ye be colonel wife may be retorted a told long ago there be legal proof of choose have settled what think right can have interference ' be what wish be tae take birthright from innocent wean canna speak for burst in andrew passionately tell marrion that colonel god rest for brave gentleman have right tae order yon poor scrap o ' god makin ' tell ye be born to be drummuir o drummuir drummuir o ' drummuir will be till last trump paused breathless with anger resentment while marrion stood babe between lying placidly asleep andrew began helplessly will thole continued whole ugly face aflame with emotion made almost beautiful see here marrion muir for be have lived life thinkin ' ye be abune will be beneath if ye steal very name from poor bairn ye sall not do will awa to peter muir tell threat roused turned on can do a like andrew will be use ca do anything without wish must be reasonable listen promised colonel promised promised promised other ye have na right tae promise interrupted fiercely ' will hear nae mair o ' woman clatter yon babe master son ' lord drummuir sae doff ma cap to did in stateliest fashion then stalked away without word leaving marrion confronted with host of new difficulty lifted child up carried back to lodging feeling must hing to save situation there be little hope of getting andrew to listen to not to reason have long ceased to have part in strange catalogue of mistake to listen to what have to say what have to say mind began laboriously on past counting own mistake why have done why have done that be fear that have made do everything fear of old man who sat like spider in web old man whom own son have wished to anger because have be throughout villain of piece must have be so if have given chance be sorry little chap died must have be game memory of parting word stung to quick what fool have be why have not gone at once to lord drummuir told truth have meant to do so have be too late too late well there be use cry over spilt milk so sat going over over whole thing again yet again until late in evening little lassie of lodging brought message that man who be lying at mistress mcmurdo be feelin ill must like to see just for little child being asleep slipped over to cottage to find andrew fraser once more prey to old enemy tropical fever quaint insistent enemy after lying low for year will seize advantage of disturbance of mind body to reassert so there be a have seen before trembling shaking with glitter in eye flush on face lying huddled up under military cloak on sofa once again slipped foot apologetically to ground a saw essayed to stand straight pathetic sight body weak mind strong so strong be sorry ma'be said with studied ceremony if be over heated day for be master wife be oorsels ye see be just providence ' daurna play providence be dangerous work sae
