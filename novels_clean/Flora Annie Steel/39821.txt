of hoard in truth position be awkward saint might recover speech then if found that suttu have be violently used might resent make away with treasure if however by starving out suttu must be induced to break vow marry hussan must doubt get appointed guardian of shrine so have opportunity of searching where chose task be not difficult one since people around be easily led to believe that way work

suttu slapped kazi son matter be approaching crisis round even hussan prowling about graveyard in vague disquiet beset after fresh excavation of soil made up mind to bolder game a picked way through short mud mound sort of thrill shot up leg at thought that might be treading on gold for hope of buried treasure take possession of men body soul found one in reed thatched hut savory smell of curried bean from fire place showed that mistress must soon be back to supper so went over to tomb where saint lay on wooden bed under dome in faint breathing of old man swelled to murmuring echo like swarm of bee hussan stood beside bed full of rage malice greed if must only crack bald old noddle pick out kernel suddenly thought came that perhaps now moment next be one appointed from eternity in speech

ghastly have risen from dead great moment be upon thought came first to spectator be too uncultured to conceal tell where cried suttu a stood yea tell ere die echoed accountant a lay not very warm welcome back to life old man though raised head at cry understood nothing dim eye passed covetous face rested on familiar landscape darkening beyond door of tomb then nerveless hand slipped from resting place on knee slipped slipped till with clink roll rattle given back thousand fold by dome coin fell upon stone floor gone whispered gone yea gone forever look of life in face have carried suttu back to childhood arm be already round failing figure a turned such fierce forbidding on companion that shrank back silent be last chance whispered after time care not suddenly bald head fell back on suttu breast chance be over sat through night waiting for sign none came before dawn broke old saint secret have gone together into darkness hussan a walked cityward felt that fate have done good a well a ill turn have made compact with suttu now that grandfather be out of way must sue for guardianship at once unmask battery have be keeping in reserve shahbash disconsolate over cold curry
