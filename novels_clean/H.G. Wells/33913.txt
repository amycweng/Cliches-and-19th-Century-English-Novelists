flash like waving of sword sound of mighty harping advent of angel with polychromatic wing swiftly dexterously a reader must admit wing have be clipped halo handled off glory clapped into coat trouser angel made for practical purpose man under suspicion of being lunatic impostor have heard too at least be able to judge what vicar doctor curate wife thought of strange arrival further remarkable opinion be to follow afterglow of summer sunset in north west darkens into night angel sleep dreaming back in wonderful world where be always light everyone be happy where fire doe not burn ice doe not chill where rivulet of starlight go streaming through amaranthine meadow out to sea of peace dream seems to once more wing glow with thousand colour flash through crystal air of world from have come so dream vicar lie awake too perplexed for dreaming chiefly be troubled by possibility of mr mendham evening talk have opened strange vista in mind be stimulated by sense a of something seen darkly by indistinct vision of hitherto unsuspected wonderland lying about world for twenty year now have held village living lived daily life protected by familiar creed by clamour of detail of life from mystical dreaming now interweaving with familiar bother of persecuting neighbour be altogether unfamiliar sense of strange new thing there be something ominous in feeling once indeed rose above other consideration in kind of terror blundered out of bed bruised shin very convincingly found match at last lit candle to assure of reality of own customary world again on whole more tangible trouble be mendham avalanche tongue seemed to be hanging above like sword of damocles what might not say of business before indignant imagination came to rest while successful captor of strange bird

angel causing anything of kind morning xxii vicar going to call angel found dressed leaning out of window be glorious morning still dewy rising sunlight slanting round corner of house struck warm yellow upon hillside bird be astir in hedge shrubbery up hillside for be late in august plough drove slowly angel chin rested upon hand did not turn a vicar came up to how be wing said vicar 'd forgotten said angel be that yonder man vicar looked that be ploughman why doe go to fro like doe amuse be ploughing be work work why doe do seems monotonous thing to do be admitted vicar have to do to get living know to get food to eat kind of thing how curious said angel do men have to do do oh doe for doe share why asked angel oh in return for thing do for know go in for division of labour in world exchange be robbery see said angel with eye still on ploughman heavy movement what do do for seems easy question to said vicar really be difficult social arrangement be rather complicated be impossible to explain thing at once before breakfast feel hungry think do said angel slowly still at window then abruptly somehow ca help thinking that ploughing must be far from enjoyable possibly said vicar very possibly breakfast be ready wo come down angel left window reluctantly society explained vicar on staircase be complicated organisation yes be so arranged that do one thing that lean bent old man trudge after heavy blade of iron pulled by couple of horse while go down to eat yes will find be perfectly just ah mushroom poached egg be social system pray be seated possibly strike a unfair be puzzled said angel drink be sending be called coffee said vicar daresay be when be young man be puzzled in same way afterwards come broader view of thing black thing be called mushroom look beautiful other consideration men be brother of course be younger brother so to speak there be work requires culture refinement work in culture refinement must be impediment right of property must not be forgotten one must render unto caesar do know instead of explaining matter now be yours think will lend little book to read chum chum chum mushroom be well up to appearance set whole thing out very clearly violin xxiii after breakfast vicar went into little room next study to find book on political economy for angel to read for angel social ignorance be clearly beyond verbal explanation door stood ajar what be said angel following violin took down play said vicar angel have bow in hand by way of answer drove across string quality of note made vicar turn suddenly angel hand tightened on instrument bow flew back flickered air vicar have never heard before danced in ear angel shifted fiddle under dainty chin went on playing a played eye grew bright lip smiled at first looked at vicar then expression became abstracted seemed no longer to look at vicar through at something beyond something in memory imagination something infinitely remote undreamt of hitherto vicar tried to follow music air reminded of flame rushed up shone flickered danced passed reappeared did not reappear air like unlike shot up after wavered vanished then same not same reminded of flaring tongue palpitate change above newly lit fire there be two air motif be thought vicar knew remarkably little of musical technique go dancing up one pursuing other out of fire of incantation pursuing fluctuating turning up into sky there below be fire burning flame without fuel upon level space there two flirting butterfly of sound dancing away from up one over swift abrupt uncertain flirting butterfly be be vicar thinking of where be in little room next to study of course angel standing in front of smiling into face playing violin looking through a though be only window motif again yellow flare spread fanlike by gust now one then with swift eddying upward flight other two thing of fire light pursuing one again up into clear immensity study reality of life suddenly faded out of vicar eye grew thinner thinner like mist dissolve into air angel stood together on pinnacle of wrought music about glittering melody circled vanished reappeared be in land of beauty once more glory of heaven be upon angel face glowing delight of colour pulsated in wing vicar must not see can not tell of vision of great spacious land of incredible openness height nobility for there be space there like time a know must need speak by bungling metaphor own in bitterness after one have failed be only vision wonderful creature flying through aether saw not a stood there flew through a one might pas through whisp of mist vicar lost sense of duration sense of necessity ah said angel suddenly putting down fiddle vicar have forgotten book on political economy have forgotten everything until angel have done for minute sat quite still then woke up with start be sitting on old iron bound chest really said slowly be very clever looked about in puzzled way have kind of vision while be playing seemed to see what did see have gone stood up with dazzled expression upon face will never play violin again said wish must take to room keep play to again did not know anything of music until heard play feel a though have ever heard music before stared at angel then about at room have never felt anything of kind with music before said shook head will never play again angel explores village xxiv very unwisely a think vicar allowed angel to go down into village by to enlarge idea of humanity unwisely because how be to imagine reception angel must receive not thoughtlessly be afraid have always carried with decorum in village idea of slow procession through little street with inevitable curious remark explanation pointings be too much for angel might do strangest thing village be certain to think peering face who be got now besides be not duty to prepare sermon in good time angel duly directed went down cheerfully by still innocent of most of peculiarity of human a distinguished from angelic turn of mind angel walked slowly white hand folded behind hunched back sweet face looking way that peered curiously into eye of people met little child picking bunch of vetch honeysuckle looked in face forthwith came put in hand be about only kindness have from human being saving only vicar one other heard gustick scolding that granddaughter of hers a passed door brazen faggit said gustick trumpery baggage angel

know that mr gustick have suddenly become aware of existence be scrutinizing appearance through window blind abruptly door flew open stared out into angel face strange apparition grey dusty hair dirty pink dress unhooked to show stringy throat discoloured gargoyle presently to begin spouting incomprehensible abuse now then mister began mr gustick have ye nothin ' better to do than listen at people

then off up there to tell great fat faced tale bearin ' silly billy 'd be ashamed to come poking peering round quiet people house angel be surprised to find that inexplicable quality in voice excited most disagreeable sensation in strong desire to withdraw resisting stood listening politely a custom be in angelic land so long a anyone be speaking entire eruption be beyond comprehension must not perceive reason for sudden projection of vituperative head out of infinity so to speak question without break for answer be outside experience altogether mr gustick proceeded with characteristic fluency assured be gentleman enquired if called one remarked that tramp did a much nowadays compared to stuck pig marvelled at impudence asked if be ashamed of standing there enquired if be rooted to

somethin will move gentleman disappeared with ferocious slamming of door interval struck angel a singularly peaceful whirling mind have time to analyse sensation ceased bowing smiling stood merely astonished be curious painful feeling said angel almost worse than hungry quite different when one be hungry one want to eat suppose be woman here one want to get away suppose might just a well go turned slowly went down road meditating heard cottage door re open turning head saw through intervening scarlet runner mr gustick with steaming saucepan full of boiling cabbage water in hand 't be well went mister stolen breech came voice of mr gustick floating down through vermilion blossom come peeping prying round yer cottage again will learn ye manner will angel stood in state of considerable perplexity have desire to come within earshot of cottage again ever did not understand precise import of black pot general impression be entirely disagreeable there be explaining mean

something said presently still perplexed xxv then angel came in sight of forge where sandy bright brother be shoeing horse for carter from upmorton two hobbledehoy be standing by forge staring in bovine way at proceeding a angel approached two then carter turned slowly through angle of thirty degree watched approach staring quietly steadily at expression on face be one of abstract interest angel became self conscious for first time in life drew nearer trying to maintain amiable expression on face expression beat in vain against granitic stare hand be behind smiled pleasantly looking curiously at to incomprehensible employment of smith battery of eye seemed to angle for regard trying to meet three pair at once angel lost alertness stumbled over stone one of yokel gave sarcastic cough be immediately covered with confusion at angel enquiring gaze nudging companion with elbow to cover disorder none spoke angel did not speak so soon a angel have passed one of three hummed tune

distantly hurried past curate did not care to be seen talking to angel in village until more be known about there came from one of house sound of child screaming in passion brought puzzled look to angelic face then angel reached bridge below last of house stood leaning over parapet watching glittering little cascade from mill begin just little while then end said weir from mill water raced under bridge green dark streaked with foam beyond mill rose square tower of church with churchyard behind spray of tombstone wooden headboard splashed up hillside half dozen of beech tree framed picture then angel heard shuffling of foot gride of wheel behind turning head saw man dressed in dirty brown rag felt hat grey with dust who be standing with slight swaying motion fixedly regarding
