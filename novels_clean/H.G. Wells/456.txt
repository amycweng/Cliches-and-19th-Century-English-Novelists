experience between other consecutive memory of boyhood there be gulf time came when seemed impossible must ever speak of wonder glimpse again asked obvious question said dont remember that ever attempted to find way back to garden in early year seems odd to now think that very probably closer watch be kept on movement after misadventure to prevent going astray wasnt until knew that tried for garden again believe there be periodincredible a seems nowwhen forgot garden altogetherwhen be about eight nine may have be do remember a kid at saint athelstan rather didnt show sign did in day of

street to goal one day got entangled among rather low class street on other side of campden hill began to think that for once game must be against must get to school late tried rather desperately street seemed cul de sac found passage at end hurried through with renewed hope will do yet said passed row of frowsy little shop be inexplicably familiar to behold there be long white wall green door led to enchanted garden thing whacked upon suddenly then after garden wonderful garden wasnt dream paused suppose second experience with green door mark world of difference there be between busy life of schoolboy infinite leisure of child anyhow second time didnt for moment think of going in straight away see for one thing mind be full of idea of getting to school in timeset on not breaking record for punctuality must surely have felt little desire at least to try dooryes must have felt that seem to remember attraction of door mainly a obstacle to overmastering determination to get to school be immediately interested by discovery have made of coursei went on with mind full of itbut went on didnt check ran past tugging out watch found have ten minute still to spare then be going downhill into familiar surroundings got to school breathless be true wet with perspiration in time can remember hanging up coat went right by left behind odd eh looked at thoughtfully of course didnt know then that

inattentive that morning recalling what must of beautiful strange people must presently see again oddly enough have doubt in mind that must be glad to see must have thought of garden that morning just a jolly sort of place to one might resort in interlude of strenuous scholastic career didnt go day at next day be half holiday may have weighed with perhaps too state of inattention brought down imposition upon docked margin of time necessary for detour dont know what do know be that in meantime enchanted garden be so much upon mind must not keep to myself toldwhat be namea ferrety looking youngster used to call squiff young hopkins said hopkins be did not like telling have feeling in way be against rule to tell did be walking part of way home with be talkative if have not talked about

further away saw others then more at point in wall be long lax line of men in open order presently man have first seen stood up shouted command men came tumbling down wall into high weed towards temple scrambled down with led came facing towards when saw stopped at first have watched men with mere curiosity when have seen meant to come to temple be moved to forbid shouted to officer must not come here cried be here be here with dead stared then shouted question back to in unknown tongue repeated what have said shouted again folded arm stood still presently spoke to men came forward carried drawn sword signed to to keep away continued to advance told again very patiently clearly must not come here be old temple be here with dead presently be so close must see face clearly be narrow face with dull gray eye black moustache have scar on upper lip be dirty unshaven kept shouting unintelligible thing question perhaps at know now that be afraid of at time did not occur to a

saw sort of exultant resolve leap into themdelight then suddenly with scowl swept sword backsoand thrust stopped abruptly became aware of change in rhythm of train brake lifted voice carriage jarred jerked present world insisted upon became clamourous saw through steamy window huge electric light glaring down from tall mast upon fog saw row of stationary empty carriage passing by then signal box hoisting constellation of green red into murky london twilight marched after looked again at drawn feature ran through heart be with sort of astonishmentno fear painbut just amazement that felt pierce felt sword drive home into body didnt hurt know didnt hurt at yellow platform light came into field of view passing first rapidly then slowly at last stopping with jerk dim shape of men passed to fro without euston cried voice do mean there be pain no sting smart amazement then darkness sweeping over everything hot brutal face before face of man who have killed seemed to recede swept out of existence euston clamoured voice outside euston carriage door opened admitting flood of sound porter stood regarding sound of door slamming hoof clatter of cab horse behind thing featureless remote roar of london cobble stone came to ear truckload of lighted lamp blazed along platform darkness flood of darkness opened spread blotted out thing luggage sir said porter be end asked seemed to hesitate then almost inaudibly answered mean couldnt get to be there on other side of temple then yes insisted yes nightmare cried nightmare indeed god great bird fought tore cone night be hot overcast sky red rimmed with lingering sunset of mid summer sat at open window trying to fancy air be fresher there tree shrub of garden stood stiff dark beyond in roadway gas lamp burnt bright orange against hazy blue of evening farther be three light of railway signal against lowering sky man woman spoke to one in low tone doe not suspect said man little nervously not said peevishly a though too irritated think of nothing work price of fuel have imagination poetry none of men of iron have said sententiously have heart have not said turned discontented face towards window distant sound of roaring rushing drew nearer grew in volume house quivered one heard metallic rattle of tender a train passed there be glare of light above cutting driving tumult of smoke one two three four five six

strangethat must have come into life like thisto open paused to open said wonderful world hesitated spoke still more softlythis world of love to then suddenly door clicked closed turned head started violently back in shadow of room stood great shadowy figuresilent saw face dimly in half light with unexpressive dark patch under penthouse brow muscle in rauts body suddenly became tense when must door have opened what have heard have heard what have seen tumult of question new comer voice came at last after pause seemed interminable well said be afraid have missed horrocks said man at window gripping window ledge with hand voice be unsteady clumsy figure of horrocks came forward out of shadow made answer to rauts remark for moment stood above woman heart be cold within told mr raut be just possible might come back said in voice never quivered horrocks still silent sat down abruptly in chair by little work table big hand be clenched one saw now fire of eye under shadow of brow be trying to get breath eye went from woman have trusted to friend have trusted then back to woman by time for moment three half understood one yet none dared say word to ease pent up thing that choked be husband voice broke silence at last wanted to see said to raut raut started a spoke came to see said resolved to lie to last yes said horrocks promised said raut to show fine effect of moonlight smoke promised to show fine effect of moonlight smoke repeated horrocks in colourless voice thought might catch to night before went down to work proceeded raut come with there be pause did man mean to take thing coolly did after know how long have be in room yet even at moment when heard door attitude horrocks glanced at profile of woman shadowy pallid in half light then glanced at raut seemed to recover suddenly of course said promised to show work under proper dramatic condition odd how must have forgotten if be troubling began raut horrocks started again new light have suddenly come into sultry gloom of eye not in least said have be telling mr raut of contrast of flame shadow think so splendid said woman turning now to husband for first time confidence creeping back again voice just one half note too high that dreadful theory of yours machinery be beautiful everything else in world ugly thought must not spare mr raut great theory one discovery in art be slow to make discovery said horrocks grimly damping suddenly what discover stopped well said nothing suddenly rose to foot promised to show work said to raut put big clumsy hand on friend shoulder be ready to go quite said raut stood up also there be pause of peered through indistinctness of dusk at other two horrocks hand still rested on rauts shoulder raut half fancied still that incident be trivial after mr horrocks knew husband better knew that grim quiet in voice confusion in mind took vague shape of physical evil very well said horrocks dropping hand turned towards door hat raut looked round in half light thats work basket said mr horrocks with gust of hysterical laughter hand came together on back of chair here be said have impulse to warn in undertone must not frame word dont go beware of struggled in mind swift moment passed got said horrocks standing with door half open raut stepped towards better say good bye to mr horrocks said ironmaster even more grimly quiet in tone than before raut started turned good evening mr horrocks said hand touched horrocks held door open with ceremonial politeness unusual in towards men raut went out then after wordless look at husband followed stood motionless while rauts light footfall husband heavy tread like bass treble passed down passage together front door slammed heavily went to window moving slowly stood watchingleaning forward two men appeared for moment at gateway in road passed under street lamp be hidden by black mass of shrubbery lamp light fell for moment on face showing only unmeaning pale patch telling nothing of what still feared doubted craved vainly to know then sank down into crouching attitude in big arm chair eye wide open staring out at red light from furnace flickered in sky hour after be still there attitude scarcely changed oppressive stillness of evening weighed heavily upon raut went side by side down road in silence in silence turned into cinder made by way presently opened out prospect of valley blue haze half dust half mist touched long valley with mystery beyond be hanley etruria grey dark mass outlined thinly by rare golden dot of street lamp here there gaslit window yellow glare of late working factory crowded public house out of mass clear slender against evening sky rose multitude of tall chimney many of reeking few smokeless during season of play here there pallid patch ghostly stunted beehive shape showed position of pot bank wheel black sharp against hot lower sky marked colliery where raise iridescent coal of place nearer at hand be broad stretch of railway half invisible train shunteda steady puffing rumbling with run ringing concussion rhythmic series of impact passage of intermittent puff of white steam across further view to left between railway dark mass of low hill beyond dominating whole view colossal inky black crowned with smoke fitful flame stood great cylinder of jeddah company blast furnace central edifice of big ironwork of horrocks be manager stood heavy threatening full of incessant turmoil of flame seething molten iron about foot of rattled rolling mill steam hammer beat heavily splashed white iron spark hither thither even a looked truckful of fuel be shot into one of giant red flame gleamed out confusion of smoke black dust came boiling upwards towards sky certainly get fine effect of colour with furnace said raut breaking silence have become apprehensive horrocks grunted stood with hand in pocket frowning down at dim steaming railway busy ironwork beyond frowning a if be thinking out knotty problem raut glanced at away again at present moonlight effect be hardly ripe continued looking upward moon be still smothered by vestige of daylight horrocks stared at with expression of man who have suddenly awakened vestige of daylight of course of course too looked up at moon pale still in midsummer sky come along said suddenly gripping rauts arm in hand made move towards path dropped from to railway raut hung back eye met saw thousand thing in moment that eye came near to say horrocks hand tightened then relaxed let go before raut be aware of be arm in arm walking one unwillingly enough down path see fine effect of railway signal towards burslem said horrocks suddenly breaking into loquacity striding fast tightening grip of elbow while little green light red white light against haze have eye for effect raut fine effect look at furnace of mine how rise upon a come down hill to right be petseventy foot of packed he boiled away cheerfully with iron in gut for five long year ive particular fancy for line of red therea lovely bit of warm orange youd call rautthats puddler furnace there in hot light three black figuresdid see white splash of steam hammer thenthats rolling mill come along clang clatter how go rattling across floor sheet tin rautamazing stuff glass mirror be not in when stuff come from mill squelchthere go hammer again come along have to stop talking to catch at breath arm twisted into rauts with benumbing tightness have come striding down black path towards railway a though be possessed raut have not spoken word have simply hung back against horrocks pull with strength say said now laughing nervously with undernote of snarl in voice why on earth be nipping arm off horrocks dragging along like at length horrocks released manner changed again nipping arm off said sorry taught trick of walking in friendly way havent learnt refinement of yet then said raut laughing artificially again by jove im black blue horrocks offered apology stood now near bottom of hill close to fence bordered railway ironwork have grown larger spread out with approach looked up to blast furnace now instead of down further view of etruria hanley have dropped out of sight with descent before by stile rose notice board bearing still dimly visible word beware of train hidden by splash of coaly mud fine effect said horrocks waving arm here come train puff of smoke orange glare round eye of light in front of melodious rattle fine effect furnace of mine used to be finer before shoved cone in throat saved gas how said raut cone cone man cone ill show one nearer flame used to flare out of open throat greatwhat be itpillars of cloud by day red black smoke pillar of fire by night now run off in pipe burn to heat blast top be shut by cone youll be interested in cone now then said raut get burst of fire smoke up there cone not fixed hung by chain from lever balanced by equipoise will see nearer else of course thered be way of getting fuel into thing now then cone dip out come flare see said raut looked over shoulder moon get brighter said come along said horrocks abruptly gripping shoulder again moving suddenly towards railway crossing then came one of swift incident vivid so rapid that leave one doubtful reeling halfway across horrocks hand suddenly clenched upon like vice swung backward through half turn so that looked up line there chain of lamp lit carriage window telescoped swiftly a came towards red yellow light of engine grew larger larger rushing down upon a grasped what meant turned face to horrocks pushed with strength against arm held back between rail struggle did not last moment just a certain a be that horrocks held there so certain be that have be violently lugged out of danger out of way said horrocks with gasp a train came rattling by stood panting by gate into ironwork did not see coming said raut still even in spite of own apprehension trying to keep up appearance of ordinary intercourse horrocks answered with grunt cone said then a one who recovers thought did not hear didnt said raut wouldnt have have run over then for world said horrocks for moment lost nerve said raut horrocks stood for minute then turned abruptly towards ironwork again see how fine great mound of mine clinker heap look in night truck yonder up above there up go out tilt slag see palpitating red stuff go sliding down slope a get nearer heap rise up cut blast furnace see quiver up above big one not way way between heap go to puddling furnace want to show canal first came took raut by elbow so went along side by side raut answered horrocks vaguely what asked have really happened on line be deluding with own fancy have horrocks actually held back in way of train have just be within ace of being murdered suppose slouching scowling monster did know anything for minute two then raut be really afraid for life mood passed a reasoned with after horrocks might have heard nothing at rate have pulled out of way in time odd manner might be due to mere vague jealousy have shown once before be talking now of ash heap canal eigh said horrocks what said raut rather haze in moonlight fine canal said horrocks stopping suddenly canal by moonlight firelight be immense effect youve never seen fancy that youve spent too many of evening philandering up in newcastle there tell for real florid effectsbut will see boiling water a came out of labyrinth of clinker heap mound of coal ore noise of rolling mill sprang upon suddenly loud near distinct three shadowy workman went by touched cap to horrocks face be vague in darkness raut felt futile impulse to address before must frame word passed into shadow horrocks pointed to canal close before now weird looking place seemed in blood red reflection of furnace hot water cooled tuyeres came into fifty yard upa tumultuous almost boiling affluent steam rose up from water in silent white wisp streak wrapping damply about incessant succession of ghost coming up from black red eddy white uprising made head swim shining black tower of larger blast furnace rose overhead out of mist tumultuous riot filled ear raut kept away from edge of water watched horrocks here be red said horrocks blood red vapour a red hot a sin yonder there where moonlight fall on drive across clinker heap be a white a death raut turned head for moment then came back hastily to watch on horrocks come along to rolling mill said horrocks threatening hold be not so evident that time raut felt little reassured same what on earth did horrocks mean about white a death red a sin coincidence perhaps went stood behind puddler for little while then through rolling mill where incessant din deliberate steam hammer beat juice out of succulent iron black half naked titan rushed plastic bar like hot sealing wax between wheel come on said horrocks in rauts ear went peeped through little glass hole behind tuyeres saw tumbled fire writhing in pit of blast furnace left one eye blinded for while then with green blue patch dancing across dark went to lift by truck of ore fuel lime be raised to top of big cylinder out upon narrow rail overhung furnace rauts doubt came upon again be wise to be here if horrocks did knoweverything do what must must not resist violent trembling right under foot be sheer depth of seventy foot be dangerous place pushed by truck of fuel to get to railing crowned place reek of furnace sulphurous vapor streaked with pungent bitterness seemed to make distant hillside of hanley quiver moon be riding out now from among drift of cloud halfway up sky above undulating wooded outline of newcastle steaming canal ran away from below under indistinct bridge vanished into dim haze of flat field towards burslem thats cone ive be telling of shouted horrocks below sixty foot of fire molten metal with air of blast frothing through like gas in soda water raut gripped hand rail tightly stared down at cone heat be intense boiling of iron tumult of blast made thunderous accompaniment to horrocks voice thing have to be gone through now perhaps after in middle bawled horrocks temperature near thousand degree if be dropped into flash into flame like pinch of gunpowder in candle put hand out feel heat of breath why even up here ive seen rain water boiling off truck that cone there damned sight too hot for roasting cake top side of three hundred degree three hundred degree said raut three hundred centigrade mind said horrocks will boil blood out of in time eigh said raut turned boil blood out of in dont let go screamed raut let go arm with one hand clutched at hand rail then with for moment two men stood swaying then suddenly with violent jerk horrocks have twisted from hold clutched at horrocks missed foot went back into empty air in mid air twisted then cheek shoulder knee struck hot cone together clutched chain by cone hung thing sank infinitesimal amount a struck circle of glowing red appeared about tongue of flame released from chaos within flickered up towards intense pain assailed at knee must smell singeing of hand raised to foot tried to climb up chain then something struck head black shining with moonlight throat of furnace rose about horrocks saw stood above by one of truck of fuel on rail gesticulating figure be bright white in moonlight shouting fizzle fool fizzle hunter of woman hot blooded hound boil boil boil suddenly caught up handful of coal out of truck flung deliberately lump after lump at raut horrocks cried raut horrocks clung cry to chain pulling up from burning of cone missile horrocks flung hit clothes charred glowed a struggled cone dropped rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out burned round in swift breath of flame human likeness departed from when momentary red have passed horrocks saw charred blackened figure head streaked with blood still clutching fumbling with chain writhing in agonya cindery animal inhuman monstrous creature began sobbing intermittent shriek abruptly at sight ironmasters anger passed deadly sickness came upon heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to nostril sanity returned to god have mercy upon cried o god what have done knew thing below save that still moved felt be already dead manthat blood of poor wretch must be boiling in vein intense realisation of agony came to mind overcame other feeling for moment stood irresolute then turning to truck hastily tilted content upon struggling thing have once be man mass fell with thud went radiating over cone with thud shriek ended boiling confusion of smoke dust flame came rushing up towards a passed saw cone clear again then staggered back stood trembling clinging to rail with hand lip moved word came to down below be sound of voice running step clangour of rolling in shed ceased abruptly moonlight fable there be once little man whose mother made beautiful suit of clothes be green gold woven so can not describe how delicate fine be there be tie of orange fluffiness tied up under chin button in newness shone like star be proud pleased by suit beyond measure stood before long looking glass when first put on so astonished delighted with that must hardly turn away wanted to wear everywhere show to sort of people thought over place have ever visited scene have ever heard described tried to imagine what feel of must be if be to go now to scene place wearing shining suit wanted to go out forthwith into long grass hot sunshine of meadow wearing just to wear mother told told must take great care of suit for never must have nearly so fine must save save only wear on rare great occasion be wedding suit said took button twisted up with tissue paper for fear bright newness must be tarnished tacked little guard over cuff elbow wherever suit be most likely to come to harm hated resisted thing what must do at last warning persuasion have effect consented to take off beautiful suit fold into proper crease put away be almost a though gave up again be always thinking of wearing of supreme occasion when day might be worn without guard without tissue paper on button utterly delightfully never caring beautiful beyond measure one night when be dreaming of after habit dreamed took tissue paper from one of button found brightness little faded distressed mightily in dream polished poor faded button polished if anything grew duller woke up lay awake thinking of brightness little dulled wondering how must feel if perhaps when great occasion might be must arrive one button must chance to be ever so little short of first glittering freshness for day day thought remained with distressingly when next mother let wear suit be tempted nearly gave way to temptation just to fumble off one little bit of tissue paper see if indeed button be keeping a bright a ever went trimly along on way to church full of wild desire for must know mother did with repeated careful warning let wear suit at time on sunday for example to fro from church when there be threatening of rain dust anything to injure with button covered protection tacked upon sunshade in hand to shadow if there seemed too strong sunlight for colour always after such occasion brushed over folded exquisitely a have taught put away again now restriction mother set to wearing of suit obeyed always obeyed until one strange night woke up saw moonlight shining outside window seemed to moonlight be not common moonlight night common night for while lay quite drowsily with odd persuasion in mind thought joined on to thought like thing whisper warmly in shadow then sat up in little bed suddenly very alert with heart beating very fast quiver in body from top to toe have made up mind knew now that be going to wear suit a must be worn have doubt in matter be afraid terribly afraid glad glad got out of bed stood moment by window looking at moonshine flooded garden trembling at thing meant to do air be full of minute clamor of cricket murmuring of infinitesimal shouting of little living thing went very gently across creaking board for fear that might wake sleeping house to big dark clothes press wherein beautiful suit lay folded took out garment by garment softly very eagerly tore off tissue paper covering tacked protection until there be perfect delightful a have seen when first mother have given to hima long time seemed ago not button have tarnished not thread have faded on dear suit of be glad enough for weeping a in noiseless hurry put on then back went soft quick to window looked out upon garden stood there for minute shining in moonlight with button twinkling like star before got out on sill making a little of rustling a must clambered down to garden path below stood before mother house be white nearly a plain a by day with window blind own shut like eye sleep tree cast still shadow like intricate black lace upon wall garden in moonlight be very different from garden by day moonshine be tangled in hedge stretched in phantom cobweb from spray to spray flower be gleaming white crimson black air be aquiver with thridding of small cricket nightingale singing unseen in depth of tree there be darkness in world only warm mysterious shadow leaf spike be edged lined with iridescent jewel of dew night be warmer than night have ever be heaven by miracle at once vaster nearer spite of great ivory tinted moon ruled world sky be full of star little man did not shout sing for infinite gladness stood for time like one awe stricken then with queer small cry holding out arm ran out a if must embrace at once whole warm round immensity of world did not follow neat set path cut garden squarely thrust across bed through wet tall scented herb through night stock nicotine cluster of phantom white mallow flower through thicket of southern wood lavender knee deep across wide space of mignonette came to great hedge thrust way through though thorn of bramble scored deeply tore thread from wonderful suit though bur goosegrass havers caught clung to did not care did not care for knew be part of wearing for have longed be glad put on suit said be glad wore suit beyond hedge came to duck pond at least to what be duck pond by day by night be great bowl of silver moonshine noisy with singing frog of wonderful silver moonshine twisted clotted with strange patternings little man ran down into water between thin black rush knee deep waist deep to shoulder smiting water to black shining wavelet with hand swaying shivering wavelet amid star be netted in tangled reflection of brooding tree upon bank waded until swam so crossed pond came out upon other side trailing a seemed to not duckweed very silver in long clinging dripping mass up went through transfigured tangle of willow herb uncut seeding grass of farther bank so came glad breathless into highroad be glad said beyond measure have clothes fitted occasion highroad ran straight a arrow fly straight into deep blue pit of sky beneath moon white shining road between singing nightingale along went running now leaping now walking rejoicing in clothes mother have made for with tireless loving hand road be deep in dust that for be only soft whiteness a went great dim moth came fluttering round wet shimmering hastening figure at first did not heed moth then waved hand at made sort of dance with a circled round head soft cried dear moth wonderful night wonderful night of world do think clothes be beautiful dear moth a beautiful a scale silver vesture of earth sky moth circled closer closer until at last velvet wing just brushed lip next morning found dead with neck broken in bottom of stone pit with beautiful clothes little bloody foul stained with duckweed from pond face be face of such happiness have seen must have understood indeed how that have died happy never knowing cool streaming silver for duckweed in pond diamond maker business have detained in chancery lane until nine in evening thereafter having inkling of headache be disinclined either for entertainment further work so much of sky a high cliff of narrow canon of traffic left visible spoke of serene night determined to make way down to embankment rest eye cool head by watching variegated light upon river beyond comparison night be

believe even when tell so that be fairly safe to tell will be comfort to tell someone really have big business in hand very big business there be trouble just now fact be make diamond suppose said be out of work just at present be sick of being disbelieved said impatiently suddenly unbuttoning wretched coat pulled out little canvas bag be hanging by cord round neck from produced brown pebble wonder if know enough to know what be handed to now year so ago have occupied leisure in taking london science degree so that have smattering of physic mineralogy thing be not unlike uncut diamond of darker sort though far too large being almost a big a top of thumb took saw have form of regular octahedron with curved face peculiar to most precious of mineral took out penknife tried to scratch itvainly leaning forward towards gas lamp tried thing on watch glass scored white line across with greatest ease looked at interlocutor with rising curiosity certainly be rather like diamond if so be behemoth of diamond where did get tell made said give back to replaced hastily buttoned jacket will sell for one hundred pound suddenly whispered eagerly with suspicion returned thing might after be merely lump of almost equally hard substance corundum with accidental resemblance in shape to diamond if be diamond how came by why must offer at hundred pound looked into one anothers eye seemed eager honestly eager at moment believed be diamond be trying to sell yet be poor man hundred pound must leave visible gap in fortune sane man must buy diamond by gaslight from ragged tramp on personal warranty only still diamond size conjured up vision of many thousand of pound then thought stone must scarcely exist without being mentioned in book on gem again called to mind story of contraband light fingered kaffir at cape put question of purchase on one side how did get said made have heard something of moissan knew artificial diamond be very small shook head seem to know something of kind of thing will tell little about perhaps then may think better of purchase turned round with back to river put hand in pocket sighed know will not believe diamond beganand a spoke voice lost faint flavour of tramp assumed something of easy tone of educated manare to be made by throwing carbon out of combination in suitable flux under suitable pressure carbon crystallises out not a black lead charcoal powder a small diamond so much have be known to chemist for year one yet have hit upon exactly right flux in to melt up carbon exactly right pressure for best result consequently diamond made by chemist be small dark worthless a jewel now know have given up life to problemgiven life to began to work at condition of diamond making when be seventeen now be thirty two seemed to that might take thought energy of man for ten year twenty year even if did game be still worth candle suppose one to have at last just hit right trick before secret got out diamond became a common a coal one might realize million million paused looked for sympathy eye shone hungrily to think said be on verge of here have proceeded about thousand pound when be twenty one thought eked out by little teaching must keep research going year two be spent in study at berlin chiefly then continued on own account trouble be secrecy see if once have let out what be doing other men might have be spurred on by belief in practicability of idea pretend to be such genius a to have be sure of coming in first in case of race for discovery see be important that if really meant to make pile people must not know be artificial process capable of turning out diamond by ton so have to work alone at first have little laboratory a resource began to run out have to conduct experiment in wretched unfurnished room in kentish town where slept at last on straw mattress on floor among apparatus money simply flowed away grudged everything except scientific appliance tried to keep thing going by little teaching be not very good teacher have university degree very much education except in chemistry found have to give lot of time labour for precious little money got nearer nearer thing three year ago settled problem of composition of flux got near pressure by putting flux of mine certain carbon composition into closed up gun barrel filling up with water sealing tightly heating paused rather risky said yes burst smashed window lot of apparatus got kind of diamond powder nevertheless following out problem of getting big pressure upon molten mixture from thing be to crystallise hit upon research of daubrees at paris laboratorie de poudres et salpetres exploded dynamite in tightly screwed steel cylinder too strong to burst found must crush rock into muck not unlike south african bed in diamond be found be tremendous strain on resource got steel cylinder made for purpose after pattern put in stuff explosive built up fire in furnace put whole concern in andwent out for walk must not help laughing at matter of fact manner did not think must blow up house be there other people in place be in interest of science said ultimately there be costermonger family on floor below begging letter writer in room behind mine two flower woman be upstairs perhaps be bit thoughtless possibly of be out when came back thing be just where left among white hot coal explosive hadnt burst case then have problem to face know time be important element in crystallisation if hurry process crystal be smallit be only by prolonged standing that grow to size resolved to let apparatus cool for two year letting temperature go down slowly during time be now quite out of money with big fire rent of room a well a hunger to satisfy have scarcely penny in world can hardly tell shift be put to while be making diamond have sold newspaper held horse opened cab door for many week addressed envelope have place a assistant to man who owned barrow used to call down one side of road while called down other once for week have absolutely nothing to do begged what week be one day fire be going out have eaten nothing day little chap taking girl out gave sixpenceto show off thank heaven for vanity how fish shop smelt went spent on coal have furnace bright red again thenwell hunger make fool of man at last three week ago let fire out took cylinder unscrewed while be still so hot that punished hand scraped out crumbling lava like mass with chisel hammered into powder upon iron plate found three big diamond five small one a sat on floor hammering door opened neighbour begging letter writer came in be drunkas usually be nerchist said youre drunk said structive scoundrel said go to father said meaning father of lie never mind said gave cunning wink hiccuped leaning up against door with other eye against door post began to babble of how have be prying in room how have gone to police that morning how have taken down everything have to saysiffiwas gem said then suddenly realised be in hole either must have to tell police little secret get whole thing blown upon be lagged a anarchist so went up to neighbour took by collar rolled about bit then gathered up diamond cleared out evening newspaper called den kentish town bomb factory now can not part with thing for love money if go in to respectable jeweller ask to wait go whisper to clerk to fetch policeman then say can not wait found out receiver of stolen good simply stuck to one gave told to prosecute if wanted back be going about now with several hundred thousand pound worth of diamond round neck without food shelter be first person have taken into confidence like face be hard driven looked into eye must be madness said for to buy diamond under circumstance besides carry hundred of pound about in pocket yet more than half believe story will if like do come to office to morrow think be thief said keenly will tell police be not coming into trap somehow be assured be thief here be card take that anyhow need not come to appointment come when will took card earnest of good will think better of come said shook head doubtfully will pay back half crown with interest daysuch interest a will amaze said anyhow will keep secret dont follow

beginning be small machine larger one be new smaller machine made reasonable noise strap hummed over drum now then brush buzzed fizzled air churned steadily whoo whoo whoo between pole one be loose in foundation kept shed vibrating big dynamo drowned little noise altogether with sustained drone of iron core somehow set part of ironwork humming place made visitor head reel with throb throb throb of engine rotation of big wheel spinning ball valve occasional spitting of steam over deep unceasing surging note of big dynamo last noise be from engineering point of view defect azuma zi accounted unto monster for mightiness pride if be possible must have noise of shed always about reader a read must tell story to accompaniment be steady stream of din from ear picked out first one thread then there be intermittent snorting panting seething of steam engine suck thud of piston dull beat on air a spoke of great driving wheel came round note leather strap made a ran tighter looser fretful tumult from dynamo over sometimes inaudible a ear tired of then creeping back upon sens again be trombone note of big machine floor never felt steady quiet beneath one foot quivered jarred be confusing unsteady place enough to send anyones thought jerking into odd zigzag for three month while big strike of engineer be in progress holroyd who be blackleg azuma zi who be mere black be never out of stir eddy of slept fed in little wooden shanty between shed gate holroyd delivered theological lecture on text of big machine soon after azuma zi came have to shout to be heard in din look at said holroyd wheres eathen idol to match im azuma zi looked for moment holroyd be inaudible then azuma zi heard kill hundred men twelve per cent on ordinary share said holroyd thats something like gord holroyd be proud of big dynamo expatiated upon size power to azuma zi until heaven know what odd current of thought incessant whirling shindy set up within curly black cranium must explain in most graphic manner dozen so way in man might be killed by once gave azuma zi shock a sample of quality after in breathing time of labourit be heavy labour being not only own most of holroydsazuma zi must sit watch big machine now then brush must sparkle spit blue flash at holroyd must swear rest be a smooth rhythmic a breathing band ran shouting over shaft ever behind one a one be complacent thud of

have seen at rangoon yet not motionless living great black coil spun spun ring ran round under brush deep note of coil steadied whole affected azuma zi queerly azuma zi be not fond of labour must sit about watch lord of dynamo while holroyd went away to persuade yard porter to get whisky although proper place be not in dynamo shed behind engine moreover if holroyd caught skulking got hit for with rod of stout copper wire must go stand close to colossus look up at great leather band running overhead there be black patch on band came round pleased somehow among clatter to watch return again again odd thought spun with whirl of scientific people tell that savage give soul to rock treesand machine be thousand time more alive than rock tree azuma zi be practically savage still veneer of civilisation lay deeper than slop suit bruise coal grime on face hand father before have worshipped meteoric stone kindred blood may be have splashed broad wheel of juggernaut took opportunity holroyd gave of touching handling great dynamo be fascinating polished cleaned until metal part be blinding in sun felt mysterious sense of service in doing must go up to touch spinning coil gently god have worshipped be far away people in london hid god at last dim feeling grew more distinct took shape in thought at last in act when came into roaring shed one morning salaamed to lord of dynamo then when holroyd be away went whispered to thundering machine that be servant prayed to have pity on save from holroyd a did so rare gleam of light came in through open archway of throbbing machine shed lord of dynamo a whirled roared be radiant with pale gold then azuma zi knew that service be acceptable to lord after that did not feel so lonely a have done have indeed be very much alone in london even when work time be over be rare loitered about shed then next time holroyd maltreated azuma zi went presently to lord of dynamo whispered thou seest o lord angry whir of machinery seemed to answer thereafter appeared to that whenever holroyd came into shed different note came into sound of dynamo lord bides time said azuma zi to iniquity of fool be not yet ripe waited watched for day of reckoning one day there be evidence of short circuiting holroyd making unwary examinationit be in afternoongot rather severe shock azuma zi from behind engine saw jump off curse at peccant coil be warned said azuma zi to surely lord be very patient holroyd have at first initiated nigger into such elementary conception of dynamo working a must enable to take temporary charge of shed in absence when noticed manner in azuma zi hung about monster became suspicious dimly perceived assistant be up to something connecting with anointing of coil with oil have rotted varnish in one place issued edict shouted above confusion of machinery dont ee go nigh that big dynamo more pooh bah take thy skin off besides if pleased azuma zi to be near big machine be plain sense decency to keep away from azuma zi obeyed at time later be caught bowing before lord of dynamo at holroyd twisted arm kicked a turned to go away a azuma zi presently stood behind engine glared at back of hated noise of machinery took new rhythm sounded like four word in native tongue be hard to say exactly what madness be fancy azuma zi be mad incessant din whirl of dynamo shed may have churned up little store of knowledge big store of superstitious fancy at last into something akin to frenzy at rate when idea of making sacrifice to dynamo fetich be thus suggested to filled with strange tumult of exultant emotion night two men black shadow be alone in shed together shed be lit with one big arc light winked flickered purple shadow lay black behind dynamo ball governor of engine whirled from light to darkness piston beat loud steady world outside seen through open end of shed seemed incredibly dim remote seemed absolutely silent too since riot of machinery drowned external sound far away be black fence of yard with grey shadowy house behind above be deep blue sky pale little star azuma zi suddenly walked across centre of shed above leather band be running went into shadow by big dynamo holroyd heard click spin of armature changed what be dewin with switch bawled in surprise hant told then saw set expression of azuma zis eye a asiatic came out of shadow towards in moment two men be grappling fiercely in front of great dynamo coffee headed fool gasped holroyd with brown hand at throat keep off contact ring in moment be tripped reeling back upon lord of dynamo instinctively loosened grip upon antagonist to save from machine messenger sent in furious haste from station to find out what have happened in dynamo shed met azuma zi at porter lodge by gate azuma zi tried to explain something messenger must make nothing of black incoherent english hurried on to shed machine be noisily at work nothing seemed to be disarranged there be however queer smell of singed hair then saw odd looking crumpled mass clinging to front of big dynamo approaching recognised distorted remains of holroyd man stared hesitated moment then saw face shut eye convulsively turned on heel before opened so that must not see holroyd again went out of shed to get advice help when azuma zi saw holroyd die in grip of great dynamo have be little scared about consequence of act yet felt strangely elated knew that favour of lord dynamo be upon plan be already settled when met man coming from station scientific manager who speedily arrived on scene jumped at obvious conclusion of suicide expert scarcely noticed azuma zi except to ask few question did see holroyd kill azuma zi explained that have be out of sight at engine furnace until heard difference in noise from dynamo be not difficult examination being untinctured by suspicion distorted remains of holroyd electrician removed from machine be hastily covered by porter with coffee stained somebody by happy inspiration fetched medical man expert be chiefly anxious to get machine at work again for seven eight train have stopped midway in stuffy tunnel of electric railway azuma zi answering misunderstanding question of people who have by authority impudence come into shed be presently sent back to stoke hole by scientific manager of course crowd collected outside gate of yarda crowd for known reason always hovers for day two near scene of sudden death in london two three reporter percolated somehow into engine shed one even got to azuma zi scientific expert cleared out again being amateur journalist presently body be carried away public interest departed with azuma zi remained very quietly at furnace seeing over over again in coal figure wriggled violently became still hour after murder to anyone coming into shed must have looked exactly a if nothing have ever happened there peeping presently from engine room black saw lord dynamo spin whirl beside little brother driving wheel be beating round steam in piston went thud thud exactly a have be earlier in evening after from mechanical point of view have be most insignificant incidentthe mere temporary deflection of current now slender form slender shadow of scientific manager replaced sturdy outline of holroyd travelling up down lane of light upon vibrating floor under strap between engine dynamo have not served lord said azuma zi inaudibly from shadow note of great dynamo rang out full clear a looked at big whirling mechanism strange fascination of have be little in abeyance since holroyds death resumed sway never have azuma zi seen man killed so swiftly pitilessly big humming machine have slain victim without wavering for second from steady beating be indeed mighty god unconscious scientific manager stood with back to scribbling on piece of paper shadow lay at foot of monster be lord dynamo still hungry servant be ready azuma zi made stealthy step forward then stopped scientific manager suddenly stopped writing walked down shed to endmost of dynamo began to examine brush azuma zi hesitated then slipped across noiselessly into shadow by switch there waited presently manager footstep must be heard returning stopped in old position unconscious of stoker crouching ten foot away from then big dynamo suddenly fizzled in moment azuma zi have sprung out of darkness upon first scientific manager be gripped round body swung towards big dynamo then kicking with knee forcing antagonist head down with hand loosened grip on waist swung round away from machine then black grasped again putting curly head against chest swayed panted a seemed for age so then scientific manager be impelled to catch black ear in teeth bite furiously black yelled hideously rolled over on floor black who have apparently slipped from vice of teeth parted with earthe scientific manager wondered at timetried to throttle scientific manager be making ineffectual attempt to claw something with hand to kick when welcome sound of quick footstep sounded on floor next moment azuma zi have left darted towards big dynamo there be splutter amid roar officer of company who have entered stood staring a azuma zi caught naked terminal in hand gave one horrible convulsion then hung motionless from machine face violently distorted im jolly glad came in when did said scientific manager still sitting on floor looked at still quivering figure not nice death to die apparentlybut be quick official be still staring at body be man of slow apprehension there be pause scientific manager got up on foot rather awkwardly ran finger along collar thoughtfully moved head to fro several time poor holroyd see now then almost mechanically went towards switch in shadow turned current into railway circuit again a did so singed body loosened grip upon machine fell forward on face core of dynamo roared out loud clear armature beat air so ended prematurely worship of dynamo deity perhaps most short lived of religion yet withal must at least boast martyrdom human sacrifice country of blind three hundred mile more from chimborazo one hundred from snow of cotopaxi in wildest waste of ecuador andes there lie that mysterious mountain valley cut off from world of

greatest precipice how built night shelter amidst snow upon little shelf of rock with touch of real dramatic power how presently found nunez have gone from shouted there be reply shouted whistled for rest of night slept more a morning broke saw trace of fall seems impossible must have uttered sound have slipped eastward towards unknown side of mountain far below have struck steep slope of snow ploughed way down in midst of snow avalanche track went straight to edge of frightful precipice beyond everything be hidden far far below hazy with distance must see tree rising out of narrow shut in

amidst softening heap of white mass have accompanied saved came to with dim fancy that be ill in bed then realized position with mountaineer intelligence worked loose after rest so out until saw star rested flat upon chest for space wondering where be what have happened to explored limb discovered that several of button be gone coat turned over head knife have gone from pocket hat be lost though have tied under chin recalled that have be looking for loose stone to raise piece of shelter wall ice axe have disappeared decided must have fallen looked up to see exaggerated by ghastly light of rising moon tremendous flight have taken for while lay gazing blankly at vast pale cliff towering above rising moment by moment out of subsiding tide of darkness phantasmal mysterious beauty held for space then be seized with paroxysm of sobbing laughter after great interval of time became aware that be near lower edge of snow below down what be now moon lit practicable slope saw dark broken appearance of rock strewn turf struggled to foot aching in joint limb got down painfully from heaped loose snow about went downward until be on turf there dropped rather than lay beside boulder drank deep from flask in inner pocket instantly fell asleep be awakened by singing of bird in tree far below sat up perceived be on little alp at foot of vast precipice sloped only little in gully down snow have come over against wall of rock reared against sky gorge between precipice ran east west be full of morning sunlight lit to westward mass of fallen mountain closed descending gorge below seemed there be precipice equally steep behind snow in gully found sort of chimney cleft dripping with snow water down desperate man might venture found easier than seemed came at last to desolate alp then after rock climb of particular difficulty to steep slope of tree took bearing turned face up gorge for saw opened out above upon green meadow among now glimpsed quite distinctly cluster of stone hut of unfamiliar fashion at time progress be like clambering along face of wall after time rising sun ceased to strike along gorge voice of singing bird died away air grew cold dark about distant valley with house be brighter for that came presently to talus among rock notedfor be observant manan unfamiliar fern seemed to clutch out of crevice with intense green hand picked frond so gnawed stalk found helpful about midday came at last out of throat of gorge into plain sunlight be stiff weary sat down in shadow of rock filled up flask with water from spring drank down remained for time resting before went on to house be very strange to eye indeed whole aspect of valley became a regarded queerer more unfamiliar greater part of surface be lush green meadow starred with many beautiful flower irrigated with extraordinary care bearing evidence of systematic cropping piece by piece high up ringing valley about be wall what appeared to be circumferential water channel from little trickle of water fed meadow plant came on higher slope above flock of llama cropped scanty herbage shed apparently shelter feeding place for llama stood against boundary wall here there irrigation stream ran together into main channel down centre of valley be enclosed on side by wall breast high gave singularly urban quality to secluded place quality be greatly enhanced by fact that number of path paved with black white stone with curious little kerb at side ran hither thither in orderly manner house of central village be quite unlike casual higgledy piggledy agglomeration of mountain village knew stood in continuous row on side of central street of astonishing cleanness here there parti coloured facade be pierced by door not solitary window broke even frontage be parti coloured with extraordinary irregularity smeared with sort of plaster be sometimes grey sometimes drab sometimes slate coloured dark brown be sight of wild plastering first brought word blind into thought of explorer good man who did that thought must have be a blind a bat descended steep place so came to wall channel that ran about valley near where latter spouted out surplus content into deep of gorge in thin wavering thread of cascade must now see number of men woman resting on piled heap of grass a if taking siesta in remoter part of meadow village number of recumbent child then nearer at hand three men carrying pail on yoke along little path ran from encircling wall towards house latter be clad in garment of llama cloth boot belt of leather wore cap of cloth with back ear flap followed one in single file walking slowly yawning a walked like men who have be up night there be something so reassuringly prosperous respectable in bearing that after moment hesitation nunez stood forward a conspicuously a possible upon rock gave vent to mighty shout that echoed round valley three men stopped moved head a though be looking about turned face way nunez gesticulated with freedom did not appear to see for gesture after time directing towards mountain far away to right shouted a if in answer nunez bawled again then once more a gestured ineffectually word blind came up to top of thought fool must be blind said when at last after much shouting wrath nunez crossed stream by little bridge came through gate in wall approached be sure that be blind be sure that be country of blind of legend told conviction have sprung upon sense of great rather enviable adventure three stood side by side not looking at with ear directed towards judging by unfamiliar step stood close together like men little afraid must see eyelid closed sunken a though very ball beneath have shrunk away there be expression near awe on face man one said in hardly recognisable spanish man isa man spiritcoming down from rock nunez advanced with confident step of youth who enters upon life old story of lost valley country of blind have come back to mind through thought ran old proverb a if be refrain in country of blind one eyed man be king in country of blind one eyed man be king very civilly gave greeting talked to used eye where doe come from brother pedro asked one down out of rock over mountain come said nunez out of country beyond therewhere men can see from near bogotawhere there be hundred thousand of people where city pass out of sight sight muttered pedro sight come said second blind man out of rock cloth of coat nunez saw be curious fashioned with different sort of stitching startled by simultaneous movement towards with hand outstretched stepped back from advance of spread finger come hither said third blind man following motion clutching neatly held nunez felt over saying word further until have done so carefully cried with finger in eye found thought that organ with fluttering lid queer thing in went over again strange creature correa said one called pedro feel coarseness of hair like llama hair rough be a rock begot said correa investigating nunezs unshaven chin with soft slightly moist hand perhaps will grow finer nunez struggled little under examination gripped firm carefully said again speaks said third man certainly be man ugh said pedro at roughness of coat have come into world asked pedro out of world over mountain glacier right over above there half way to sun out of great big world go down twelve day journey to sea scarcely seemed to heed father have told men may be made by force of nature said correa be warmth of thing moisture rottennessrottenness let lead to elder said pedro shout first said correa lest child be afraid be marvellous occasion so shouted pedro went first took nunez by hand to lead to house drew hand away can see said see said correa yes see said nunez turning towards stumbled against pedros pail sens be still imperfect said third blind man stumble talk unmeaning word lead by hand a will said nunez be led along laughing seemed knew nothing of sight well all in good time must teach heard people shouting saw number of figure gathering together in middle roadway of village found tax nerve patience more than have anticipated that first encounter with population of country of blind place seemed larger a drew near to smeared plastering queerer crowd of child men woman woman girl be pleased to note have of quite sweet face for eye be shut sunken came about holding on to touching with soft sensitive hand smelling at listening at word spoke of maiden child however kept aloof a if afraid indeed voice seemed coarse rude beside softer note mobbed three guide kept close to with effect of proprietorship said again again wild man out of rock bogota said bogota over mountain crest wild manusing wild word said pedro did hear that bogota mind have hardly formed yet have only beginning of speech little boy nipped hand bogota said mockingly aye city to village come from great worldwhere men have eye see name bogota said stumbled said correastumbled twice a came hither bring in to elder thrust suddenly through doorway into room a black a pitch save at end there faintly glowed fire crowd closed in behind shut out faintest glimmer of day before must arrest have fallen headlong over foot of seated man arm outflung struck face of someone else a went down felt soft impact of feature heard cry of anger for moment struggled against number of hand clutched be one sided fight inkling of situation came to lay quiet fell down said couldnt see in pitchy darkness there be pause a if unseen person about tried to understand word then voice of correa said be newly formed stumble a walk mingles word mean nothing with speech others also said thing about that heard understood imperfectly may sit up asked in pause will not struggle against again consulted let rise voice of older man began to question nunez found trying to explain great world out of have fallen sky mountain such like marvel to elder who sat in darkness in country of blind must believe understand nothing that told thing quite outside expectation must not even understand many of word for fourteen generation people have be blind cut off from seeing world name for thing of sight have faded changed story of outer world be faded changed to child story have ceased to concern with anything beyond rocky slope above circling wall blind men of genius have arisen among questioned shred of belief tradition have brought with from seeing day have dismissed thing a idle fancy replaced with new saner explanation much of imagination have shrivelled with eye have made for new imagination with ever more sensitive ear finger tip slowly nunez realised that expectation of wonder reverence at origin gift be not to be borne out after poor attempt to explain sight to have be set aside a confused version of new made being describing marvel of incoherent sensation subsided little dashed into listening to instruction eldest of blind men explained to life philosophy religion how that world meaning valley have be first empty hollow in rock then have come first inanimate thing without gift of touch llama few other creature have little sense then men at last angel whom one must hear singing making fluttering sound whom one must touch at puzzled nunez greatly until thought of bird went on to tell nunez how time have be divided into warm cold be blind equivalent of day night how be good to sleep in warm work during cold so now for advent whole town of blind must have be asleep said nunez must have be specially created to learn serve wisdom have acquired that for mental incoherency stumbling behaviour must have courage do best to learn at people in door way murmured encouragingly said nightfor blind call day nightwas now far gone behooved everyone to go back to sleep asked nunez if knew how to sleep nunez said did that before sleep wanted food brought food llama milk in bowl rough salted bread led into lonely place to eat out of hearing afterwards to slumber until chill of mountain evening roused to begin day again nunez slumbered not at instead sat up in place where have left resting limb turning unanticipated circumstance of arrival over over in mind now then laughed sometimes with amusement sometimes with indignation unformed mind said got sens yet little know theyve be insulting heaven sent king master see must bring to reason let think let think be still thinking when sun set nunez have eye for beautiful thing seemed to that glow upon snow field glacier rose about valley on side be most beautiful thing have ever seen eye went from inaccessible glory to village irrigated field fast sinking into twilight suddenly wave of emotion took thanked god from bottom of heart that power of sight have be given heard voice calling to from out of village yaho there bogota come hither at that stood up smiling must show people once for what sight must do for man must seek not find move not bogota said voice laughed noiselessly made two stealthy step aside from path trample not on grass bogota be not allowed nunez have scarcely heard sound made stopped amazed owner of voice came running up piebald path towards stepped back into pathway here be said why did not come when called said blind man must be led like child can not hear path a walk nunez laughed can see said there be such word a see said blind man after pause cease folly follow sound of foot nunez followed little annoyed time will come said youll learn blind man answered there be much to learn in world have one told in country of blind one eyed man be king what be blind asked blind man carelessly over shoulder four day passed fifth found king of blind still incognito a clumsy useless stranger among subject be found much more difficult to proclaim than have supposed in meantime while meditated coup detat did what be told learnt manner custom of country of blind found working going about at night particularly irksome thing decided that must be first thing must change led simple laborious life people with element of virtue happiness a thing can be understood by men toiled not oppressively have food clothing sufficient for need have day season of rest made much of music singing there be love among little child be marvellous with what confidence precision went about ordered world everything see have be made to fit need of radiating path of valley area have constant angle to others be distinguished by special notch upon kerbing obstacle irregularity of path meadow have long since be cleared away method procedure arose naturally from special need sens have become marvellously acute must hear judge slightest gesture of man dozen pace awaycould hear very beating of heart intonation have long replaced expression with touch gesture work with hoe spade fork be a free confident a garden work can be sense of smell be extraordinarily fine must distinguish individual difference a readily a dog can went about tending of llama who lived among rock above came to wall for food shelter with ease confidence be only when at last nunez sought to assert that found how easy confident movement must be rebelled only after have tried persuasion tried at first on several occasion to tell of sight look here people said there be thing understand in once twice one two of attended to sat with face downcast ear turned intelligently towards did best to tell what be to see among hearer be girl with eyelid red sunken than others so one must almost fancy be hiding eye whom especially hoped to persuade spoke of beauty of sight of watching mountain of sky sunrise heard with amused incredulity presently became condemnatory told there be indeed mountain at that end of rock where llama grazed be indeed end of world thence sprang cavernous roof of universe from dew avalanche fell when maintained stoutly world have end roof such a supposed said thought be wicked so far a must describe sky cloud star to seemed to hideous void terrible blankness in place of smooth roof to thing in believedit be article of faith with that cavern roof be exquisitely smooth to touch saw that in manner shocked gave up that aspect of matter altogether tried to show practical value of sight one morning saw pedro in path called seventeen coming towards central house still too far off for hearing scent told a much in little while prophesied pedro will be here old man remarked that pedro have business on path seventeen then a if in confirmation individual a drew near turned went transversely into path ten so back with nimble pace towards outer wall mocked nunez when pedro did not arrive afterwards when asked pedro question to clear character pedro denied outfaced be afterwards hostile to then induced to let go long way up sloping meadow towards wall with one complaisant individual to promised to describe happened among house noted certain going coming thing really seemed to signify to people happened inside of behind windowless housesthe only thing took note of to test byand of must see tell nothing be after failure of attempt ridicule must not repress that resorted to force thought of seizing spade suddenly smiting one two of to earth so in fair combat showing advantage of eye went so far with resolution a to seize spade then discovered new thing about be that be impossible for to hit blind man in cold blood hesitated found aware that have snatched up spade stood alert with head on one side bent ear towards for what must do next put that spade down said one felt sort of helpless horror came near obedience then have one backwards against house wall fled past out of village went athwart one of meadow leaving track of trampled grass behind foot presently sat down by side of one of way felt something of buoyancy come to men in beginning of fight more perplexity began to realise that can not even fight happily with creature who stand upon different mental basis to far away saw number of men carrying spade stick come out of street of house advance in spreading line along several path towards advanced slowly speaking frequently to one ever again whole cordon must halt sniff air listen first time did nunez laughed afterwards did not laugh one struck trail in meadow grass came stooping feeling way along for five minute watched slow extension of cordon then vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic stood up went pace so towards circumferential wall turned went back little way there stood in crescent still listening also stood still gripping spade very tightly in hand must charge pulse in ear ran into rhythm of in country of blind one eyed man be king must charge looked back at high unclimbable wall behindunclimbable because of smooth plastering withal pierced with many little door at approaching line of seeker behind others be now coming out of street of house must charge bogota called one bogota where be gripped spade still tighter advanced down meadow towards place of habitation directly moved converged upon ill hit if touch swore by heaven will ill hit called aloud look here im going to do what like in valley do hear im going to do what like go where like be moving in upon quickly groping yet moving rapidly be like playing blind man buff with everyone blindfolded except one get hold of cried one found in arc of loose curve of pursuer felt suddenly must be active resolute dont understand cried in voice be meant to be great resolute broke be blind can see leave alone bogota put down that spade come off grass last order grotesque in urban familiarity produced gust of anger ill hurt said sobbing with emotion by heaven ill hurt leave alone began to runnot knowing clearly where to run ran from nearest blind man because be horror to hit stopped then made dash to escape from closing rank made for where gap be wide men on side with quick perception of approach of pace rushed in on one sprang forward then saw must be caught swish spade have struck felt soft thud of hand arm man be down with yell of pain be through through then be close to street of house again blind men whirling spade stake be running with reasoned swiftness hither thither heard step behind just in time found tall man rushing forward swiping at sound of lost nerve hurled spade yard wide of antagonist whirled about fled fairly yelling a dodged be panic stricken ran furiously to fro dodging when there be need to dodge in anxiety to see on side of at once stumbling for moment be down heard fall far away in circumferential wall little doorway looked like heaven set off in wild rush for did not even look round at pursuer until be gained have stumbled across bridge clambered little way among rock to surprise dismay of young llama who went leaping out of sight lay down sobbing for breath so coup detat came to end stayed outside wall of valley of blind for two night day without food shelter meditated upon unexpected during meditation repeated very frequently always with profounder note of derision exploded proverb in country of blind one eyed man be king thought chiefly of way of fighting conquering people grew clear that for practicable way be possible have weapon now must be hard to get one canker of civilisation have got to even in bogota must not find in to go down assassinate blind man of course if did that might then dictate term on threat of assassinating butsooner later must sleep tried also to find food among pine tree to be comfortable under pine bough while frost fell at night andwith le confidenceto catch llama by artifice in order to try to kill itperhaps by hammering with stoneand so finally perhaps to eat of llama have doubt of regarded with distrustful brown eye spat when drew near fear came on second day fit of shivering finally crawled down to wall of country of blind tried

steep seemed to that before splendour blind world in valley love be more than pit of sin did not turn aside a have meant to do went on passed through wall of circumference out upon rock eye be always upon sunlit ice snow saw infinite beauty imagination soared over to thing beyond be now to resign for ever thought of great free world that be parted from world be own have vision of further slope distance beyond distance with bogota place of multitudinous stirring beauty glory by day luminous mystery by night place of palace fountain statue white house lying beautifully in middle distance thought how for day so one might come down through pass drawing ever nearer nearer to busy street way thought of river journey day by day from great bogota to still vaster world beyond through town village forest desert place rushing river day by day until bank receded big steamer came splashing by one have reached seathe limitless sea with thousand island thousand of island ship seen dimly far away in incessant journeying round about greater world there unpent by mountain one saw skythe sky not disc a one saw here arch of immeasurable blue deep of deep in circling star be floating eye began to scrutinise great curtain of mountain with keener inquiry for example if one went so up gully to chimney there then one might come out high among stunted pine that ran round in sort of shelf rose still higher higher a passed above gorge then talus might be managed thence perhaps climb might be found to take up to precipice came below snow if chimney failed then farther to east might serve purpose better then then one must be out upon amber lit snow there way up to crest of beautiful desolation suppose one have good fortune glanced back at village then turned right round regarded with folded arm thought of medina sarote have become small remote turned again towards mountain wall down day have come to then very circumspectly began climb when sunset came be not longer climbing be far high clothes be torn limb be bloodstained be bruised in many place lay a if be at ease there be smile on face from where rested valley seemed a if be in pit nearly mile below already be dim with haze shadow though mountain summit around be thing of light fire mountain summit around be thing of light fire little thing in rock near at hand be drenched with light beauty vein of green mineral piercing grey flash of small crystal here there minute minutely beautiful orange lichen close beside face there be deep mysterious shadow in gorge blue deepening into purple purple into luminous darkness overhead be illimitable vastness of sky heeded thing no longer lay quite still there smiling a if be content now merely to have escaped from valley of blind in have thought to be king glow of sunset passed night came still lay there under cold clear star
