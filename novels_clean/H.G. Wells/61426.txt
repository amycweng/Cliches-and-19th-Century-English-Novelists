peter wanted to build with brick then joan did also be uneasy if other be not in sight must do same thing on different side of chalk boundary with wary eye on others proceeding with endless stream of explanation of what be doing peter building love lay house joans building oha lovelay er house wiv cross on why not build one lovely house for of said arthur still with co operative commonwealth in mind child considered that proposal called for argument went over head vanished continued building individually a before in silence lest arthur must be tempted to intervene again joan be dancer from

decided to shift responsibility to sister then twinge of compunction have made replace then feeling that oswald might still be out talked out voted by sister have stuck in name of dolly wealthy important cousin lady charlotte sydenham have only seen twice have seemed lady of considerable importance strength of character anyhow made thing fairer to sydenham side phyllis phbe at once assumed

felt that be going behind back of aunt nevertheless saw great harm in what have happened death of arthur dolly have shaken mary innate scepticism have vague feeling that there might be grave risk well

to best of ability mr sycamore be very good looking rosy little man with silvery hair twinkling gold spectacle soft voice manner of imperturbable urbanity felt sure ladyship must be willing to talk

for time on top of bank disputing fiercelyshe wanted to go one way anotherand finally disappeared still disputing in lady direction rather lady made off in direction of cookham gentleman followed protesting way mile said slowly afternoon quiet healed again peter be left in solitude with boat silvery river overhanging wood distant swan at first just sat looked at boat have crimson cushion in lady have left japanese sunshade name of boat be princess may lining wood of boat be pale outer wood wood of rowlock darker with just one exquisite gold line oar be very wonderful boat hook with paddle be much more wonderful must be lovely to touch that boat hook be thing must paddle with must catch hold with hook poke with spike in minute so call of boat hook have become irresistible peter have got out of boat held up like spear waved about poked boat out with tried to paddle with in water between boat bank boat swung back too soon presently got into boat very carefully so a to paddle with boat hook in water beyond boat in wielding paddle almost knocked off hat so took off laid in bottom of boat then became deeply interested in paddling when paddled in certain way whole boat found began to swing out round when stopped paddling went back against bank must not go completely round because of tight way in ample faced man have tied to rail of step if rope be tied quite at end boat must be paddled completely round must be beautiful to paddle completely round with waggling rudder up stream instead of down thought did not lead to immediate action within two minute peter be untying boat retying in accordance with ambition in day boy scout movement be already in existence have still to disseminate sound view about knot tying among rising generation peter knot be not so much knot a knot like gesture how bad be only discovered when be back in boat have paddled nearly way round then saw that end of rope be slipping off rail to have tied a weary snake might slink off into grass stem of boat be perhaps yard from shore peter acted with promptitude dropped paddle ran to bow jumped except for left leg landed safely left leg recovered from water there be catching rope trailed submerged after boat boat with exasperating leisureliness with movement be barely perceptible widened distance from bank for time peter mind wrestled with problem must try find stick must reach boat must throw stone so a to bring back in shore perhaps if told one that boat be adrift went up step to towing path there be one who looked at helpful within sight watched boat drift slowly for time towards middle of stream then seemed to be struck with idea of going down to maidenhead watched recede followed slowly when saw people afar off tried to look a though did not belong to boat decided that presently somebody must appear rowingwhom must ask to catch boat for then must tow back to old position presently peter came to white gate of bungalow considered advisability of telling busy gardener who be mowing lawn about boat be difficult to frame suitable form of address still further on pleasant middle aged woman who be trimming privet hedge very carefully with garden shear seemed le terrible person to accost peter said to modestly forgetfully think there boat adrift down there middle aged woman peered through spectacle one couldnt have tied up said having looked at boat with quiet intelligence for time resumed clipping behaviour did much to dispel peter idea of calling in adult help when looked again boat have turned round have drifted out into middle of stream seemed now to be travelling rather faster to be rocking slightly be not going down towards lock away towards where board said danger danger be a if cold hand be laid on peter heart no longer wanted to find man with ample face tell that boat be adrift sun have set light seemed to have gone out of thing peter have feeling that be long past tea time wished now have never seen man with ample face must have to pay for boat must say have never promised to mind if be so why have got into boat played about with left shoe left trouser leg be very wet getting cold great craving for tea home comfort generally arose in peter wayward mind home comfort forgetfulness seemed to high time that asked one way to limpsfield when noakley probyn arrived at maidenhead bridge in late afternoon seemed to that have done reasonable searcher must do that best thing now be to take train back to windsor be tired felt futile then when hope be exhausted struck trail of peter policeman at foot of bridge have actually noted ovvered about bridge for bit said policeman then went along towing path little grave chap in grey flannel funny thing thought e might be runaway something about im so be that noakley probyn came upon ample faced man at lock in full tide of distress be vociferous to get across to weir boat ought to have come down long ago be saying unless caught up in something if be in boat kid drowned for certain noakley have difficulty in getting to explain what kid be difficult to secure attention of ample faced man in fact before must be done twice pushed back noakleys face with hand a though be sort of inanimate obstacle be great tragic experience for probyn went across by lock to island behind lead of lockkeeper ample faced man came out in sight of weir river be still full from late september rain weir be frothing cascade at crest of saw upturned boat jammed by current against timber japanese umbrella circled open in foamy eddy below stick upward sun be down now chill be in air sense of coming winter then close at hand caught in weedy willow stem dipped in rushing water probyn discovered little soddened straw hat little half submerged hat bobbing with swift current entangled in willow stem be unmistakable bore white black ribbon of high cross school oh god cried probyn at sight of hat burst into tear poor little peter id have done anything for sobbed a sobbed talked became so remorseful

up with emphasis admit responsibilitynone understand mr sycamore once for be not responsible forwhatever have happened to wretched little boy sorry for himyes have nothing to regret took away fromundesirable surroundingsand sent to school by mean cheap school be recommended very highly very highly indeed by mr grime be plain duty to do a much there responsibility end mr sycamore have drifted quietly into chair be sitting obliquely to in attitude more becoming family doctor than hostile lawyer regarded cornice in far corner of room a spoke replied without looking at softly almost a if in soliloquy legallyno be not responsible lady repeated if one be responsible be mr grime came to ask to produce two ward said mr sycamore abruptly because mr oswald sydenham land at southampton tonight have always be coming time have come if have come earlier must not have happened have really come be herein england be lady charlotte gasped lay back unwin handed bottle of smelling salt have

dreadfully carelessof tone wholesomeness quality of education supply of home permit almost a if cared more for getting child branded than whether lived died school be excellent school said lady charlotte excellent school remark be cruel painful mr sycamore again restrained retort then said think must be well for mr oswald sydenham to have address of little girl lady charlotte considered there be nothing to conceal said gave address of mr pybus most trustworthy woman mr sycamore took down very carefully in little notebook came out of vest pocket then seemed to consider whether must become more offensive not to decide upon former alternative suppose said reflectively a replaced little book that demand for religious observance religious orthodoxy a first condition in school be productive of more hypocrisy rottenness in education than other single cause be matter of common observation school be generally about a inefficient a religious stripe be marked suppose be because if put weight on one thing can not put on perhaps be because test be so easy for thoroughly mean dishonest person to satisfy a religious test school have claim to other merit can always pas off a severely religious perhaps truth be that bad school profess orthodoxy rather than orthodoxy make bad school nowadays be religion be last refuge of scoundrel if have nothing further to say than secularist lecturing said lady charlotte with great dignity must be obliged if must find somewheresome hall of science considering what feeling must be scarcely in mood forblasphemies lady charlotte

lady charlotte have really nothing to do with thisescapade at be something else thing have arisen that alter outlook for child very considerably there be reason to suppose that miss stubland be properly guardian of joan peter at one moment more lady charlotte let explain two young german must appear witnessed accident to boat from top of capri headland saw mr stubland apparently wrestling with boatman then boat overset two men never reappeared must have dragged other down witness be quite certain about mr stubland poor young lady must be seen swimming for quite long time swam nearly

wont to leave six year before must walk down same rusty path heart must quicken a used to quicken at thought of seeing dolly presently peter began to oust dolly from thought sometimes peter must be standing waiting for by high road sometimes peter mounted on little outgrown bicycle must meet on purple common half way man boy of ten be perhaps better company than man boy of fifteen there so much le egotism between at rate peter oswald talked of education travel politics philosophy with unembarrassed freedom oswald like most childless people have have suspicion of what grey matter of bright little boy brain can hold be amazed at peter view curiosity be oswald instinct never to talk down to man woman child have never thought about if have questioned must have told that be sort of thing one didnt do instinct gave wide range of available companionship peter have never conceived such good company a oswald must listen to oswald for hour discoursed upon topic out of dreamland sometimes came very close even to dreamland where bungo peter adventured immortally oswald must feel transfiguring presence touch of fantasy half suspect glorious companion much of talk be kind of story telling how must go to congo forest peter must ask must one go by nairobi thats other way wed have to go forthwith nobby peter be getting stuff together counting how many porter must need one day perhaps wed come upon place fested with crocodile peter must say must must be pushing rather ahead of party with gun looking for anything there might bepushing through tall reed far above head oswald must oblige youd be with insisted peter be really story telling be peter habit in day when be alone to meditate on paper must cover sheet after sheet with rapidly drawn scene of adventure one day oswald found figuring in one of dream picture peter be leading army in battle capture of ten war elephant be legend thereon realized how clearly small boy saw nothing be spared of darkened browless side of face with asymmetrical glass eye figure of be very long lean bent with arm still in old sling be drawn manifestly with utmost confidence admiration love peter hostility to school be removed very slowly

out of book asked peter cant read everything out of book said oswald there thing ought to see handle thing can only learn by doing oswald wanted peter to plan own school peter considered id like lesson about inside of animal about people in foreign countriesand how engine workand sort of thing then must find school for where teach sort of thing said oswald a though be merely question of ordering good from civil service store have much to learn yet about education oswald be still only face to face with half of responsibility one morning found peter at schoolroom table very busy cutting big letter out of white paper beside be long strip of turkey twill from dressing up box that ingle nook have plagiarized from sheldricks im getting ready for joan said peter im going to put welcome on for over garden gate there to be triumphal arch hitherto peter have scarcely betrayed interest in joan at now seemed able to think of one else found reduced abruptly from position of centre of peter universe to mere helper in decoration be beginning to understand small boy by time took withdrawal of limelight philosophically when aunt phyllis joan arrived found flagged path from welcome gate festooned with chain of coloured paper bought with peter own pocket money made by with slight assistance much moral support from aunt phbe in evening to door triumphal arch have be achieved rather in gothic style by putting movable badminton net post into sort of trousering of assorted oriental cloth from dressing up chest crossing two head of giant heracleum between peter stood at door in white satin suit innocent vanity lovedamong other rles have served for bassanio prince hal antony over body of csarwith face of extraordinary solemnity behind stood uncle nobby joan wasnt quite joan peter expected be still wan from illness have grown several inch be a tall a be white faced so that hair seemed blacker than ever eye be big lustrous came walking slowly down path with eye wide open there be difference felt in movement a came forward though must not have said what be there be more grace in joan now le vigour be same joans voice cried oh petah lovely stood before for moment then threw arm about hugged kissed uncle nobby knew that be smear of high cross school that made wriggle out of embrace not return kiss immediately took by hand better in playroom joan said all right joan go on with said oswald came forward to meet aunt phyllis aunt phbe be on staircase little aloof from thing a became woman of intellect behind aunt phyllis came mary behind mary came limpsfield

joan stood stockishly with crown in one hand sceptre in other put crown on joan said peter yours restration ceremony didnt put on lovelyand lovely whispered joan in sort of rapture stared about incredulously with big dark eye be home againhome mr pybus have passed like evil dream in night have never really believed possible before mr pybus must pas away even while aunt phyllis mary have be nursing mr pybus have hovered in background like something more enduring waiting for to pas away a inexplicably a have come joan have heard whining voice upon stair day always while be ill once mr pybus have come stood by bedside remarked like one who maintains argument shell be appy enough ere when shes better again no more mr pybus more whining scolding more unexpected slap having to go to bed supperless more measles uneasy misery in bed with grey sheet more dark dreadful saying lurked in mind like jungle beast be home home with peter out of darkness yetoutside be darkness still joan said peter trying to rouse there cake like birthday for tea when oswald came in be still holding gilt crown in hand let take from put on head still staring incredulously about took sceptre limply peter be almost gentle with strange staring joan for day oswald regarded joan a grave thoughtful child seemed to be what country people call old fashioned might have be changeling did not hear laugh once followed peter about a if be shadow then one day a cycled over from chastlands heard strange tumult proceeding from little field on master farm marvellous mixture of familiar unfamiliar sound uproar wonderful a though tinker van have met school treat twain have got drunk together source of row be hidden from by little coppice dismounted went through wood to investigate joan peter have discovered disused cowshed with sloping roof of corrugated iron have also happened upon abandoned kettle two three tin can be now engaged in hurling latter object on to resonant roof down rolled thunderously only to be immediately returned joan be no longer slip of pensive dignity peter be no longer marvel of intellectual curiosity be shrieking maximum oswald have never before suspected joan of exceptionally full voice peter of so vast wealth of gurgling laughter keep pot boilin yelled joan keep pot boilin hoo cried peter hoo go joan wow then to crown glory kettle burst came into two piece be too perfect two child staggered back seized half of kettle kicked deliberately then rolled away fell on stomach amidst grass kicking leg in air spirit of rowdyism grows with what feed upon oh let do something reely awful cried joan let do something reely awful petah peter leg became still stiff with interrogation oh petah said joan if must only smash window frow brick frough real window big glass window just one glass window wheres window said peter evidently in highly receptive condition from pitch of depravity oswald roused by prod in back after joan changed rapidly colour crept back into skin faintly rollicking quality into bearing became shorter again visibly sturdier hair frizzed more stuck out more laugh comment upon world became increasingly frequent embroidery upon quiet of ingle nook seemed to have delusion that peter be just within earshot only just oswald wondered how far recent experience have vanished from mind thought might have done so altogether until one day joan took into confidence quite startlingly be smoking in little arbour came stood beside so noiselessly that did not know be there until spoke be holding hand behind be regarding south down with pensive frown be paying most beautiful compliment have come to consult mr pybus said remarked that one who doesnt believe there god go straight to hell dont believe there god said joan peter know there isnt for moment oswald be little taken aback by simple theology then said dyou think peter looked everywhere joan then saw real point at issue one thing may be sure about joan said be that there isnt hell be rather pity in way because must be nice to think of mr pybus of yours going there there hell at there nothing more dreadful than dreadful thing in life there need to worry about hell that thought be fairly conclusive joan remained pensive with eye still on distant hill then asked one of unanswerable childrens question be implication imputation assumption misunderstanding elision if there isnt hell said joan what doe god do be after joan have drifted away again from theological investigation oswald after sitting time in silence said aloud with intense conviction love child be no longer stranger in england have living anchorage looked out over autumnal glory of weald dreaming intention child must be educated must be educated splendidly oswald wanted to see peter serving empire boy must have pluckhe have already loveliest brainand sense of fun joan oswald be perhaps not quite so keen in day upon educating joan be to come later after empire indeed whole world of mankind be made up of joans peter what empire be what mankind becomes be nothing sum of what have made of joans peter chapter tenth searching of schoolmaster so be that systematic intention took hold of life of joan peter have be snatched apart adventurously disastrously out of hand of aimless impulsive modernism dragged off into dusty decaying corner of anglican system now be to be rescued by empire worshipper disfigured suffering educational fanatic taught what be there in oswald mind intention be still sentimental cloudy be beginning to assume firm definite form just a uganda child be being made into civilized men woman according to light mean of protectorate government so two child have to be made fit ruler servant of greatest empire in world have to know that ruling race must know have to think act a befitted leading people seemed to simple obvious necessity of case be sick man fatigued much more readily than most men given to mood of bitter irritability have little knowledge of how might set about task did not know what help be available what be impossible made enquiry be very absurd enquiry sought advice talked to sort of people meanwhile joan peter spent very sunny pleasant november running wild about limpsfielduntil one day oswald noted a much packed off for rest of term to miss murgatroyd again school of st george venerable bede be concentrating upon christmas production of alice in wonderland there must not be very much bad teaching anyhow there must be plenty of fun how be one to learn where one child may be educated story have comic aspect oswald went first to education department thought that if one have two rather clever hopeful child upon whom one be prepared to lavish time money imperial education department must be able to tell anxious guardian what school existed for respective claim merit inter relationship of such school found that government published six inch map of british isle on even meanest outhouse be marked have information for enquiring parent guardian at in matter of school educational map have still to become part of equipment of civilized state a be inconceivable that party capital must be made out of production of such map be likely to remain desideratum in great britain for many year to come in interview remained dignified on one side at least until last oswald be referred to advertisement column of time religious educational paper toa class of educational agent said official with extreme detachment usually of course people hear of school so be that england still referred back to happy day of eighteenth century when world be small enough for everybody to know trust consult everybody tell in safe confidential manner everything mattered oh god groaned oswald suddenly giving way to internal enemy god here be two child brilliant childrenwith plenty of money to be spent on doesnt empire care twopenny damn what becomes of there be association of private schoolmaster believe said official staring at dont know if good joan be rehearsing special dance in costume peter be word perfect a white knight long before oswald have found even hopeful school for of clung for time to delusion that there must exist somewhere school must exactly meet peter natural reasonable demand for establishment where one must learn about gun animal mountain machine foreign people must give lesson about inside of animal how engine work sort of thing man wanted school kept by leonardo da vinci when found curriculum singularly bare of vital matter began to ask question question presently developed into very tiresome trying catechism for schoolmaster did not allow for fact that most private schoolmaster in england be rather overworked rather under exercised men with considerable financial worry indeed made allowance for one wanted to get on with education of joan peterand more particularly of peter catechism varied considerably in detail always ran upon line of following question what sort of boy be trying to make how will differ from uneducated boy dont mean in manner mean how will differ in imagination yesi saidimagination dont know education be building up imagination thought everybody knew that then what be education doing here usually catechized must become troublesome catechist short rude catechism must be not so much continued a resumed after incivility silence what sort of curriculum be ward to go through why be to do latin why be to do greek be going to read write speak language then what be strange peculiar benefit of will ward know about africa when have done with what will know about india be there indian boy here what will know about garibaldi italy about engineering about darwin will be able to write good english do boy do much german russian spanish hindustani will know anything about way royal exchange affect empire why shouldnt understand elementary fact of finance currency why shouldnt citizen understand what pound sterling really mean everyday life depends on what do teach about socialism nothing did say nothing may be member of parliament day anyhow hell be voter if cant teach everything why not leave out damned classic of yours record of irritable man seeking impossible be not to be dwelt upon too closely during search for boy school have yet to exist oswald gave way to unhappy impulse made distressing exasperating to quite number of people from first attitude to scholastic agent be hostile uncharitable appearance made nervous defensive from outset more particularly fierce cocking of hat red intensity of eye came in like accusation rather than application tell be school there be must ask sitting with various printed copygraphed paper in hand can recommend genteel young man in charge must say be paid to recommend oswald must ask be best school available genteel young man must fence bah oswald must say bad opening from ruffled scholastic agent oswald must go on in mood be bound to ruffle hopeful school proprietor indeed of interview became heated so soon so extravagantly that there be complete failure to state even most elementary fact of case lurid misunderstanding blazed uganda got perplexingly into dispute from one admirable establishment in eastbourne oswald retreated with principal calling after from dignified portico wouldnt take little nigger at price when doctor saw after last encounter told be not getting on a well a ought to do be running about too much ought to be resting completely so oswald took week rest from school visiting before tried again if have not be for sense of joan peter growing visibly day by day oswald might perhaps have displayed more of patience of explorer be rather urgency of thirsty traveller who look for water than deliberation of trigonometrical survey in little while mastered obvious fact that preparatory school be conditioned by school for prepared found school at margate white court differed rather in quality particularly in quality of proprietor than in nature of arrangement from other school have be visiting to committed peter assisted by aunt phyllis found education for joan in highmorton school ten mile away settled in furnished house at margate to be near having thus gained breathing time devoted to completer study of perplexing chaos of upper class education in england what be up to have own clear conviction of what ought to be up to more saw of existing condition more hopelessly seemed to be up to entirely different thing else in spirit of intellectual sabotage up to nothing at from preparatory school went on to great public school from public school went to university brought to quest unsympathetic detachment of alien observer angry passion of anxious patriot with suggestion from matthew arnold indolence insincerity two word became more more frequent in thought a went from one great institution to occasionally headmaster talked to have more than suspicion of unspoken comment imagination be dead within said oswald if only must see empire if only must forget little pride dignity affectation in vision of mankind impression of headmaster be for most part taken against background of white flannelled boy in playing field grey flannelled boy in walled court yard eton gave river effect bright unforgetable boatman in coat of wonderful blue harrow displayed view insisted upon hill physically liked almost school saw except winchester visited on rainy day almost always there be fine architectural effect now there be nucleus of gothic now be time worn tudor red brick now well proportioned grey georgian most of establishment have dignity of age caxton be wealthily new caxton be nest of new building of honey coloured stone be growing energetically tidily waved hand to busy wilderness of rock plant said botanical garden to piece of field said museum group have science laboratory with big apparatus machinery for small engineering factory oswald with experienced eye approved of biological equipment great school be visibly full of life activity at time oswald be so impressed by life activity that felt ashamed of enquiry seemed ungracious not to suppose that be going well here that almost of school be good enough that almost casual sentimental consideration sydenham family tradition like must suffice to determine be to have moulding of peter have set heart now on getting to very essential of problem be resolved to be blinded by fair appearance though school looked a firmly rooted stoutly prosperous a british oak a naturally grown a though have air of discharging function a necessary a beating of heart a inevitably still kept grip on idea that be artificial thing of men contriving still pressed question what be trying to do what be doing how be doing how do fit in to imperial scheme of thing so challenged various high headmaster have most of air of men invited to talk of thing be easier to understand than to say be not at pompous about explanation from first to last oswald never discovered pompous schoolmaster of legend history without exception seemed anxious to get out of gown pose a intelligent layman be not intelligent layman did not explain did not explain waved hand smiled hoped be turning out clean english gentleman didnt train men specially to end at aim be to develop general intelligence general goodwill in relation to empire destiny said oswald must hardly fix so definitely a said overtone of hillborough dont set before youngster general aim in life to be to contribute rather leave sort of contribution to said overtone must put something before of where be where be to come in what belong to said oswald that lie in world about said overtone king countrywe dont need to preach such thing what king signifiesif signifies anything at aim of country urged oswald empire empireour reality greatness of ours beyond sea dont stress said overtone english boy be apt to be suspicious ironical have read that delightful account of patriotic lecture in stalky co oh must common evasiveness characterized headmaster when oswald demanded particular of peter curriculum wanted to know just subject peter must study be to be made most important then when question be answered must demand why do teach what be particular benefit of to boy empire how doe other fit into scheme of clear minded man be difficult to get even first question answered plainly from very outset found entangled in longstanding controversy upon educational value of latin greek circumstance disposition alike disposed to be sceptical of value of shibboleth of british academic world share in time table be enormous excellent gentleman who failed to impress a strong minded exact sought to convince of pricelessness of latin in strengthening disciplining mind hinks of carchester distinguished greek scholar slipped into hand at parting pamphlet asserting that only greek study must make man write english beautifully precisely unhappily for argument hinks have written pamphlet beautifully precisely lippick irregularly bald with neglected teeth man needlessly unpleasing to eye descanted upon greek spirit blend of wisdom sensuous beauty quoted euripides at oswald breathed antique air in facealthough knew that oswald knew practically greek well said oswald compare gave back three good minute of swahili what doe mean gibberish to certain melody perhaps in english oswald grinned must lose be passage ofoh quite fantastic beauty argument apologetics stayed deepening of oswald conviction that education in public school of great britain be not forward going process habit tradition that classical schoolmaster be saying nothing like classic in exactly same spirit that cobbler said nothing like leather because be stuff have in stock subject be for most part being slackly tediously altogether badly taught to boy who found element of interest in boy be a class acquiring distaste contempt for learning thus presented subtle wide demoralization ensued found justification for crib possible device for shirking work in utter remoteness uselessness of main subject extravagant interest took in school game be very largely direct consequence of intense boredom in school hour such be impression formed by oswald to eye great school architecturally so fine so happy in out of door aspect so pleasant socially became more more visibly whirlpool into living curiosity happy energy of nation youth be drawn caught fatigued thwarted wasted be beautiful shelter of intellectual lazinessfrom peter must if possible be saved how to save there be oswald discovered saving completely oswald have profound hostility to solitary education knew that except through accidental circumstance of rarest sort private tutor must necessarily be poor thing man who be cheap enough to devote time to education of one boy can have very little be worth imparting education be socialization education be process of making unsocial individual citizen decision upon caxton in end be by mean certificate of perfection for caxton caxton have good if lopsided modern side with big businesslike chemical physical laboratory quite honest living looking biological geological museum pleasant active layman a headmaster mathematical teaching instead of being drill in examination solution be carried on in connexion with work in physical engineering laboratory be true that modern side of caxton taught history of sort ignored logic philosophy in severity of modernity excluded even amount of latin be needed for complete mastery of english nevertheless did manifestly interest boy enough to put game into secondary place at caxton one did not see boy playing game a old lady in hydropaths play patience desperately excessively with forced enthusiasm because have nothing better to do even caxton school magazine did not give much more than two third of space to game so to caxton peter went when mr mackinder of white court have done duty by mr henderson creator of caxton be of large sized variety of schoolmaster rather round shouldered with slightly persecuted bearing towards parent mind seemed busy with many thingsbuildings extension governor chapel oswald walked with through field be visibly becoming botanical garden towards school playing field once schoolmaster stopped mind distressed by sudden intrusive doubt whether exactly right place have be chosen for what called biological pond have to ask various question of gardener give certain direction be listening to oswald nevertheless oswald discoursed upon training of what called fortunate elite cant properly educate whole of community yet perhaps said at least expensive boy of ours ought to be given everything can possibly give to class empire will look naturally ought to turn out boy who know where be in world what empire be what aim to do who understand something of responsibility to asia africa have philosophy of life duty more of sort of thing be done said mr henderson than outsider suppose master talk to boy lend book in incidental sort of way said oswald three quarter of boy miss even here seems must still have classical side must still keep on with latin greek with course will never reach through dull grind to stale old culture beyond why not drop why not be modern outright leave eton harrow winchester westminster to go old way why not teach modern history modern philosophy in plain english here why not question world see instead of world of dead levantine why not be modern school altogether headmaster seemed to consider idea there be gravest of practical objection wed get scholarship considered boy must stop at dead end theyd get appointment theyd be dreadfully handicapped be not complete system said mr henderson be only part of big circle weve got to take what parent send on to weve got to send on to college profession what not only part of process hereonly part of process just a ultimate excuse of private schoolmaster have be that must do more than prepare along line dictated for by public school so public school waved oswald on to university thus came presently with question to university to oxford cambridge for be clear set pattern of rest in england came to oxford cambridge a came to public school must be remembered with fresh mind for navy have snatched straight out of preparatory school away from ordinary routine of english education at tender age of thirteen oswald investigation of oxford cambridge began even before peter have entered school house at caxton a early a spring of scarred face under soft felt hat be to be seen projecting from one of brown coloured hansom cab used to ply in cambridge bag be on top be going to university arm to instal have good look round damned place at time there still hung about faint flavour of midshipman on leave in foreign town spent three day watching undergraduate prowled about street with face little on one side brought red brown eye to bear on book in bookshop window display of sock tie handkerchief in outfitter in year chromatic sock be just dawning upon adolescent mind have still to achieve iridescent glory of crowning year found symptomatic ex pede herculem be to be seen surveying back standing about among bookstall in market place paddled canadian canoe to byron pool watched cheerful group dispose of huge tea in garden of inn close at hand seemed to joke for benefit neat rather than merry jesting so be cambridge be then went on by tedious crosscountry journey to slack horror of one of oxford hotel made similar preliminary survey of land here that proposed to prospect there seemed to be more rubbish more remainder in oxford second hand bookshop le comfort in hotel place be more self consciously picturesque there be le of diana more of venus about beauty rather blowsy gothic venus with bad tooth so so impressed oswald glamour of oxford sunrise upon magdalen tower oriel pater so forth be lost upon oswald toughened mind have spent susceptible adolescence on battleship sunblaze of africa have given taste for colour like taste for raw rye whiskey walked about perfect garden of st giles college beat at head of blepp senior tutor whose acquaintance have made in athenaeum with stock question garden of st giles college be a delicate a fine linen in lavender turf be supposed to make american visitor regret ancestral trip in mayflower very bitterly blepp have fancied that in way answered oswald turned glass eye ugly side to garden might just a well have not be there kept to questioning what be making of boy here what be going to make of empire what be teaching be not teaching how be working why why whats idea of suppose presently when fine october in history end that weather of world break up what will have ready for storm blepp felt ungraciousness of such behaviour acutely be like suddenly asking host of great beautiful dinner party whether earned income honestly like shouting up table at oswald be almost a comfortable guest for don to entertain a spur in one trouser pocket blepp did best to temper occasion by elaborate sweet reasonableness dont think there something in atmosphere began dont like atmosphere oxford shop seem grubby little shop street be narrow badly lit wasnt thinking of shop where youngster buy stuff furniture a far a can see most of idea youll be in sympathy with american lady who complained other day about want of bathroom blepp sneered well why not said oswald outrageously blepp shrugged shoulder looked for sympathy at twisted brick chimney of st giles oswald became jerkily eloquent weve got empire sprawling over world be people at grip with mankind in few year few thousand men here at cambridge few thousand in other university have practically to be mind of empire think of problem press upon a empire nation sharpen now like knife be making mentality to solve irish riddle here be preparing outlook for india here what be doing here to get ready for such task a how can show reality go on beneath surface said blepp dont see what be brewing today talk go on in men room mutual polishing of mind look not at formal life informal life consider one college consider for example balliol think of jowett influence milner groupnot blind to empire there be even that fellow belloc saucy rogue good rich stuff out of just one college be thing one can not put in syllabus be thing that defeat statistic be reason why must put chaff dry bone into syllabus said oswald place said oswald waved arm at great serenity of st giles have air of cathedral close might be beautiful place of retirement for sad weary old men seems thousand mile from machinery from great town work of world must have teach in foundry id have teaching something about storm seems to to be gathering in world of labour youngster here be going to be statesman writer teacher lawyer high official big employer of tomorrow world of industry have to control seems a far off here a if be on planet youre not talking about youre not thinking about youre teaching about gracchi greek fig trade youre magnifying that pompous bore cicero minimizingold salisbury for examplewho be far more important figure in historya greater man in greater world with respect to memory said blepp good lord much greater classic put out perspective dozen of living statesman be greater than cicero of course modern be greater if only because of greatness of horizon oxford cambridge ought to be learning thinking part of whole empire twin hemisphere in imperial brain when think of size of imperial body hundred of nation thousand of city tribe vast extension round about world immense problem of then of size quality of im reminded of atlantosaurus youve heard of beast brain be smaller than ganglion of rump doubt brain thought quite up to job wasnt something ate up atlantosaurus two place place ought to be big enough bigly conceived enough to irradiate whole world with idea empire ought to dominate mind of hundred of million of men dominate nothing leave india africa out of even dominate england think only of labour at home of huge blind titan whom wont understand doesnt understand there again interrupted blepp sharply be simply ignorant of what be going on here because oxford have certain traditional beauty decent respect for past because doesnt pose assert rawly be offended realize how active can be how up to date be wouldnt make more modern in spirit if lived in enamelled bathroom lectured in corrugated iron shed isnt modernity thats mistake in respect to very question of labour have got labour contact have never heard of ruskin college founded here by american of most modern type one vrooman repeated name vrooman not a though loved a though thought ought to appeal to oswald think came from chicago surely teutonic name from chicago be modern enough to satisfy one be college of real working men of trade union leader type actual horny handed article who come up herei suppose because dont agree with idea that deal only in swathing of mummy at rate think that have something to tell modern world something worth learning perhaps know need better than do oswald be momentarily abashed expressed desire to visit ruskin college blepp explained be not connected with college not quite line said blepp parenthetically must arrange for visit under proper guidance presently under wing of don of radical tendency oswald went seemed to most touching illuminating thing in oxford reminded of jude obscure ruskin college be sheltered over stable in back street displayed small group of oldish young men for most part with north country accent engaged in living under austere circumstancesthey paid scarcely anything did houseworkand doing best to get hold of precious treasure of knowledge understanding be persuaded oxford possessed have come up on saving by virtue of extraordinary sacrifice graduation in of oxford school be manifestly impossible to if only on account of greek bar university have use for respectful pilgrim intention of encouraging more of principal mr dennis hird in teeth of much opposition be vamping sort of course for with aid of few liberal minded junior don who delivered lecture when proper engagement permitted there be vague suggestion of perplexity in conversation of two student with whom oswald talked tepid drip of disconnected instruction wasnt what have expected then what have expected vrooman idealist who have set thing going have returned to america leaving much to be explained oswald dined with blepp at st osyths night spoke over port in common room of working men who be dunning oxford for wisdom jarlow wit of college who have be entertaining company with last half dozen spoonerism have invented be at once reminded of little poem have made recited be supposed to be by one of same ruskin college men artless rhyming of socrates fate side euripides combined with sort of modest pretentiousness of thought intention be very laughable indeed everybody laughed merrily except oswald thats quite one of best jarlow said blepp oxford have be rubbing oswald fur backwards day common room became aware of sitting up stiffly regarding jarlow with evil expression why devil said oswald addressing pointedly querulously to jarlow working man say so crate say paris men do oxford too much honour perhaps there be sort of necessity in educational stagnation of england during crucial year before great war influential important people of country be having thoroughly good time if there be growing quarrel between worker employer one saw reason in for sticking goad into teacher disposition of mass of men be always on side of custom against innovation clear headed effort of yesterday tends always to become unintelligent routine of tomorrow so long a get along go along in le exacting day of good queen victoria educational process of great britain have served well enough still went on because necessity for more thorough coherent lucid education have still to be made glaringly manifest few people understood discontent of ray lankester fretfulness of kipling foresight dy when imagination

learn obey create nothing initiate nothing have troublesome doubt ran rule of scholarly discretion prize boy scholar fellow don pedagogue prize boy scholar fellow donso spun circle of school into relentless circle bright curious little peter who wanted to know about inside of animal way of machine what be happening be drawn little joans too be being drawn best escaped complete deadening found

be up to date school dont think sir egg be everything to young cockerel world outside be naught oswald led on from one solemn puerility to a big boy talked in stout man of world voice red eye roved from to peter from peter back to troop until presently realized that peter be watching a narrowly what doe peter really think of stuff thought oswald what doe really think of stuff queried peter suppose day youll leave caxton said oswald will be very sorry to sir said troop sincerely have thought at not yet sir at least troop people peter intervened be army people see said oswald joan

critically can play dp not one of game said troop who be chary of game not usually played game like snap said peter with air of casual contempt earned bright scowl for day so troop joan kept aloof watching one then caught out rather neatly twice at single wicket cricket have weakness for giving catch to point have observed caught cried approvingly also snicked slipped at last slogged boldly at patronizing under arm bowling here twister said like uncle speaking to child joan smacked into cedar twister joan running after that took formal notice of betraying disposition to address a kid ralph connor be at time adding quota to great british tradition be true wrote in american about cowboysbut refined cowboy be fullest realization of english gentleman pre war idealsand ralph connors cowboy be essentially refined thence came kid anyhow joan took umbrage at kid disliked troop manner influence with peter way peter stood did not understand what very very great being prefect be in english public school did not know of troop superbness at rugger seemed to that be bad manner to behave a though visit to pelham ford be act of princely condescension be even disposed to diagnose troop largeness very unjustly a fat so pulled up troop venomously with name not kit joan joan sorry said troop being of insensitive class whose passion be only to be roused by smacking began to take still more notice of be perceived lively kid felt strong desire to reprove influence have suspicion that what really wanted to do be to interest joan in joans tennis be incurably tricky troop idea of tennis be to play very hard very swiftly close over net without cunning peter wilmington followed lead joan forced victory upon unwilling partner by doing unexpected thing troop declared did not mind being defeated that be shocked by spirit of joans play wasnt sporting short return arent done kid said do said joan ancient peter wilmington be visibly shocked troop showed resentment at gross familiarity if one did reasoned must take said joan one must take who knew how dispute seemed likely to die down into unverifiable assertion peter can take said joan drop back isnt doing today peter reflected troop must never understand there be something reasonable in joans line ill see to joan said abruptly came towards middle of net game continued on unorthodox brilliant line dont call tennis said troop if served to left said peter shes girl protested troop serve made concession be proper to lady joan scored point after brief rally with peter game said joan troop declared did not care to play again must put off tennis take a partner said joan noi dont think so thanks said troop coldly one became thoughtful drifted towards net oswald approached from pergola considering problem ive be thinking about sort of thing for year remarked strolling towards well sir arent with asked troop im for joanand peter that sort of trick play no way to play game be to get over game to be equal to anything in if there be stroke anything spoil game ought to be barred by rule apart from that game ought to be worked out to last possibility thing oughtnt to be barred in interest of few conventional swipe cutting down of game to just few type of stroke peter looked apprehensive laziness said oswald troop be too puzzled to be offended have to work tremendously hard sir at proper game not mentally said oswald there too much good form in game just way of cutting down game to formality for instance sir must bowl grounder at cricket if thought batsman have be too lazy to learn what to do with why not if look at like sir said troop have more to say went away marvelling oswald be vc yet looked at game likelike american played to win be enough to perplex one must confess dont see said troop when oswald have gone when at last troop wilmington departed oswald went with to stationthe luggage be sent on in cartand walked back over ploughed ridge up lane with peter for time kept silence troop be

lately old troop taken to swatting pathetic then with shade of anxiety dont think for moment twigged be pulling leg oswald came to thing be really troubling allowing for class said oswald that young man be growing up to outlook upon world about a broad high a outlook of bricklayer labourer peter reflected impartially oswald noted incidentally what good profile boy be developing clean serious bricklayer labourer said peter weighing adjective carefully may go into parliament have to handle big business said oswald army for troop said peter via university commission even army have to be handled intelligently nowadays said oswald hell go into cavalry said peter making one of tremendous jump in thought be characteristic of joan day so after troop departure peter waylaid oswald in garden peter now that troop have gone be amusing with dissection againan interest that troop have disposed of a bit morbid oswald thought work peter did neat good have to brush up own rather faded

for two ward of research have brought to realize chiefly how poor spiritless thing be very best formal education that empire must offer seemed to in bitter urgency of imperial passion perhaps even poorer than be there be smattering of latin thinner smattering of greek little patch of mediterranean history literature detached from past futureall university history seemed to oswald to be in disconnected fragmentsbut then must have considered history fragmentary did not begin with geological record end with clear tracing of traceable consequence of period in current affair there be mathematical specialization did not so much broaden mind a take into gully modern mediaeval language specialization philosophical study be really not philosophical study at partial examination of remote irrelevant system study of scrap of plato aristotle here excursion by mean of translation into hegelian phraseology there sort of thing given out to few thousand young men for most part greatly preoccupied with game to few hundred young woman be that oswald must discover by way of mental binding for entire empire seemed to like innervating body a big a world with brain a big a pin head a

of course cross have meant something to people must have meant tremendous thing to people men imitate one stick up cross because mean sort of deep thing to then man down road think will have cross too man up road doesnt quite see what about doesnt like to be out of so go on until sticking up cross becomes habit becomes necessity theyd be shocked to see new church without four five cross on organize business in golden cross everybody say must have cross long ago one have forgotten that deep meaning hm said oswald think that just crowd said peter thinking aloud underneath cross just swarming breeding of men like other men dont think that million odd down there be held together by distinctive idea dont feel sometimes russian idea about youlike smell of burnt wood on breeze well call breeze said peter like breeze blowing over mud blow now then forgotten before be past what doe signify be thinking a talked oswald did not want to interrupt just smiled slightly looked at peter for more dont think there great essential difference between city said peter easy to exaggerate mostly difference be difference of scenery beneath difference same story everywhere men shoving about eating squabbling multiplying might just a well be looking at london from hampstead bridge so far a human fact go here thing be done in red black gold against background of white snow there be done in drab grey green be land of dull tragedy instead of dull comedy gold cross on green onion instead of church spire extreme instead of mean same old human thing even king tsar look alike there state church

oswald coming round upon with extended finger because want so badly doe one yes consciously not thats where be at issue peter oh dont see idea at work cried peter except a sort of flourish of mind look at everyday life wherever have beenin london paris italy berlin here see man who can afford making for restaurant going where there be woman to be got hunger indulgence sex sex sex sex voice be suddenly bitter turned face to oswald for moment be too little blind impulsesi suppose there sort of impulse to beauty in day perhaps force will do somethingdrive man up scale of being a far a weve got stared at moscow again seemed to have done think be oversexed said oswald after pause youngster glanced at guardian im not blind fenced then laughed with refreshing cheerfulness youthful pessimism nobby mind run like because fashion get so dosed with schopenhauer nietzscheusually at second hand try to talk like dont mind smiled back peter drive spirit back to victorian said want to begin quoting longfellow to life be real life be earnest peter countered ought to be well becomes so have science out of science come light will see will plainer plainer will said peter turning over in mind

matter of theyre justhuman accumulation dont know of will at allany will nobby cant see feel will wish must have said say oswald turned again to great spectacle of city did heavenward cross now sinking into dusk amount to more than glittering emanation out of fen of life unmeaning ignis fatuus born of morass of festering desire have already forgotten be cross indeed appeal promise out of million of men must man at last arise slowly smoothly unfalteringly brush of twilight have be sweeping neutral tint across spectacle painting out glittering symbol one by one chill from outer space fell down through thin russian air dark transparent curtain oswald shivered in wadded coat abruptly down below hard by ghostly white church one lamp then pricked deepening blue little dark tram car crept towards out of city way to fetch back into city suddenly became glow worm twenty year before oswald must not have talked in fashion of will twenty year before social political order of world have seemed so stable to english mind that thought of sustaining will be superfluous queen victoria whole system have air of immortal inertia scientific economic teaching under oswald idea have be shaped recognized need for wilfully co ordinated effort end of education indicated be diffusion of knowledge victorian thought in england took good motif for granted seemed indeed disposed to regard almost motive a equally good for common weal herbert spencer that philosopher who must not read kant most typical of english intelligence in day taught that if only there be regulation no common direction if one be to pursue own individual end unrestrained then by sort of magic chaos freed from interference of collective direction must produce order supreme gift to generation of hasty profiteer be discovery that blind scuffle of fate must be called evolution so given air of intention altogether superior to poor struggle to make decent order out of greedy scramble for decade section of british life have ceased to leave thing to providence not bothernot botherwere leaving to evolutionand still not bothering be because of oswald discovery of confused distressed motif of joan peter under suggestion of more kinetic german philosophy be slowly percolating into english thought that idea be now changing direction formerly have thought of nation empire a if be thing in loose shape have little nothing to do with individual life contained now began to think that human organization large small alike exist for end be will form present purpose claim subordination of individual aim began to see state nation a thing of education being in mind of men parallelism of russia britain peter have made struck oswald a singularly acute have closer parallelism with other than with france

more conspicuously inadequate appeared to be moving inevitably towards failure confusion one afternoon during stay in petrograd bailey took oswald peter to see session of duma drove in sledge down nevski prospekt by street of ploughed up tumbled snow through struggled interminable multitude of sledge bringing firewood into city to old palace of favourite potemkin into duma have in day be thrust duma be sitting in big adapted conservatory three visitor watched proceeding from little low gallery wherein speaker be almost inaudible bailey pointed out large proportion of priest in centre explained various party group be very sympathetic with cadet be anglo maniac idealized british constitution thought of limited monarchyin land of extreme oswald listened to bailey exposition thing that most gripped attention be huge portrait of tsar hung over gathering must not keep eye off there figure of autocrat stood with sidelong unintelligent visage four time a large a life dressed up in military guise with big cavalry boot right over head of president of duma that portrait be a obvious insult a outrageous challenge to self respect of russian men a gross noise foul gesture must have be empire exist for said that foolish faced portrait with busby little on one side weak hand on sword hilt be to figure asked young russia to be loyal that dull faced tsar golden cross of moscow presented a russia to young heavy handed very corrupt system of repression sustained absurd pretension have sanction at that existedthrough acquiescence of le intelligent generation aged prosperous indolent dishonest mean dull supported in vast tacit conspiracy beneath such symbol must land under sting of modern suggestion ever be anything will welter confusion of sentiment instinct wilfulness be so wonderful that world be given story of artzibachev a picture of will form of russian young through journey oswald be constantly comparing peter with young people saw on two occasion peter went to moscow art theatre once saw hamlet in russian once tchekhovs three sister be produced with completeness of ensemble excellence of mechanism dramatic vigour far beyond range of london theatre here in untidy sprawling slushy moscow shone diamond of co operative effort efficient organization set oswald revising certain hasty generalization about russian character far more interesting than play to be audience be mostly young people of be very young people student in uniform bright faced girl clerk young officer soldier sprinkling of intelligent looking older people of commercial professional class evening showed similar gathering very full house intensely critical appreciative be rather like sort of gathering one might see in london fabian society there be scarcely earnest spinster many more young men art theatre like magnet have drawn own together out of vast barbaric medley of western asiatic of peasant merchant priest official professional thronged moscow street seemed very delightful young people one eye wandered from brightly lit stage to row row of face in great dim auditorium about rested on peter then went back to others then must be sample of intelligentzia be youth who figured in so large proportion of recent russian literature how many bright keen face be there what lay before dark premonition crept into mind of tragedy of eager life growing up in clutch of gigantic political system now staggered to end youth saw here be wonderfully like new generation be now dancing way into house at pelham ford be curious to note how much more big dim houseful of young muscovite be like british american audience than be to german gathering perhaps there be rather more dark type perhaps more high cheekbone be hard to say other north temperate race seemed to oswald a distinguished from german have same suggestion about of unco ordinated initiative mind moved freely in great old system have lost hold upon german youth be co ordinated be tremendously co ordinated two sunday ago peter have be watching sunday morning parade along unter den linden have gone to see white trousered guard kicking leg out ridiculously in goose step outside guard house that stand opposite kaiser palace have walked along unter den linden to brandenburger tor then after inspecting vainglorious trophy of piled cannon outside reichstag turned down siege alle so came back to adlon by way of leipziger platz peter have be alive to many thing oswald attention have be concentrated almost exclusively on youngster be passing for most part plump pink faced student in corp cap very erect in bearing very tight in clothes be absolutely distinct variety of young human male puerile militarism possessed exchanged salutation with utmost punctilio while england have be taking child from hand of god not so much making a letting develop into note of interrogation germany without halt hesitation have moulded gift of youth into stiff obedient fresh soldier there have be moment like thunderclap while oswald peter have be near brandenburger tor swift wave of expectation have swept through crowd there have be galloping of mounted policeman hustling of traffic to side of road hasty lining up of spectator then with melodious tootlings amidst guttural plaudit big white automobile carrying glitter of uniform have gone by driven at headlong pace der kaiser just for moment magnificence hung in eyeand passed what have seen cloak helmet hard visage one distinctive pallid face something melodramatic something eager in great hurry something went by like sound of trumpet figure of vast enterprise in shining armour with mailed fist be symbol upon young german be being concentrated be ideal have gripped something very modern yet romantic something stupendously resolute going whither at rate going magnificently somewhere be power of be going somewhere for good bad be infinitely more attractive lead than cowardly oppressive tsardom be failing to hold refractory mind of young russian current edition of british imperial ideal twangling idiotic banjo exhorting peter generation to tax foreigner a worthy end aim in life oswald with eye on dim preoccupied audience about recalled talk that peter have have with young fellow traveller in train between hanover berlin have be very typical young german glass clothes looked twice a hard a peter sat up stiffly while peter slouched on seat evidently wanted to air english while peter have not remotest desire to air german only betrayed knowledge of german when be necessary to explain english phrase german didnt quite grasp german wanted to know whether oswald peter have be in germany before where be going what thought of what be going to think of berlin responding to counter question said have be twice to england thought england be great country yesbut not systematic mean undisciplined yes be perhaps undisciplined meant oswald said that a foreigner be most struck by tremendous air of order in north germany german be orderly by nature admission proved attractive gambit young german questioned oswald view that german be naturally orderly hard necessity have made so have have to discipline have be obliged to develop kulturencircled by enemy now kultur be becoming second nature nation supposed brought present to mankind germany be order system lesson of obedience must constantly make more powerful german be perforce thorough people thorough in did although have come late into modern industrialism have already developed social economic organization far beyond of other people nicht wahr work be becoming necessary to rest of mankind in russia for example in turkey in italy in south america be more more german who organized developed led though be fenced round said stillwe break out there be something familiar yet novel in to oswald be like first sensation upon reading shakespeare in german be something very familiarin unfamiliar idiom then recognized be exactly own imperialismteutonized same assertion of educational mission everywhere go said young german superior science higher education better method prevails even in india smiled left sentence unfinished militarism sabre rule here at home zabern business isnt that little incompatible with idea of germany a great civilizing influence permeating world not at said young german with readiness of word perfect actor behind missionary of order must have ready good german sword isnt argument of force apt to be littledecivilizing young german did not think so when be in england said there be three thing that english properly understand to use be map index school andthe sword three thing be triangle of german life that hung most in oswald mind have gone on talking to young german for long time about difference of british german way have made peter youngster compare school college work what be far more striking difference in pressure between two system press too hard said in alsace have pressed too hardin posen perhaps sometimes pressi know said young german be strength of determination be impatient be young people for time oswald have talked of method of germany in cameroon of britain on gold coast where german have be growing cacao by plantation system turning native into slave while british with older experience longer view have left land in native hand built up happy loyal free cultivation ten time a productive mile for mile a german seemed to to be one good instance of general conception of germany a land of undue urgency wissmann in east africa be great manbut everywhere else drive too violently antagonize north germany everywhere said have same effect upon of country going hard germany may be in too much of hurry repeated came into world politics late said young german endorsing oswald idea from own point of view have much to overtake yet german have come into world politics late be very true be nave yet must still feed natural egotism on story of world mission same enthusiasm have taken russia to pacificand to grand ducal land speculation in manchuriaand english to coolie slavery of rand be taking german oswald did not ask what route to disillusionment germany might choose believed that must come to disillusionment be only little later in phase than neighbour be in end must see that white cloaked heroic figure in automobile led to futility a surely a skulking tsar not way must nation go oswald saw premonition of world catastrophe in german youngster devotion to ideal of militant aggression in whole broad spectacle of straining preparation across peter travelled that winter from aix to wirballen be a be magically blind must stand on hanover platform mark largeness of station broad spreading track endless siding tremendous transport preparation must have significance in world military intention still have more to say than german give elbow room on railway peter suppose land be cheaper must see nothing of finger of fate

photographer be touched up visage of kaiser looking heroic endless postcard of of son of kaiserin little imperial grandchild like be a dull dreary looking a royalty can be be inconceivable to oswald such figure must really rule imagination of great people did not realize that tragedy in world might lie behind word of young german came into world politics late behind fact that german imperialist system be just little le decayed little le humorous little le indolent disillusioned than of great parallel to east west did not reflect that system be harmless until hand be taken off lever of power must still believe that lived in immensely stable world that vast form of kingdom empire with sham reverence unmeaning ceremony obligation flag militancy imaginative senility threatened nothing beyond negative evil of uninspired life running to individual waste be thing concerned saw collective fate hanging over intent young face in moscow art theatre a over strutting innocent of patriotic berlin

to wastelike rapid still thought in phrase niagara of death so near to now to rapid be heading still did not hear did not suspect nearness joan from peter thought drifted to joan joan apparently must find nothing better to do in life than dance suddenly peter took deep breath sat back began to clap whole house broke out into pelting storm of approval ripping said peter oh ripping turned bright face to oswald do so well said smiling have forgotten be in russian seemed to understand word oswald turned eye again to hamlet in gordon craigs fantastic settingwhich moscow in artistic profusion must produce when london be too poor to do so very similar be thought in oswald mind three month later three month nearer world catastrophe a sat in summerhouse after joan have told of quarrel with peter denunciation of peter have have curious effect upon of making very anxious about so far a peter went what have told have confirmed made definite what have known by instinct since christmas party mind be used now to idea of peter being vicious be very much shocked indeed at discovery that joan be aware of peter vice be new jolt to mind in many thing joan peter have changed idea enormously so far have retained not only wardroom standard with regard to moral of youth also romantic ideal of feminine purity with regard to girl still thought of own womenkind a of something innocent immaculate untouchable being in different world from girl who didnt mind bit of fun woman one made love to boldly now have to face factjoan have forced upon himthis new feminine generation wasnt divided in

home now on what have once be battlefield of opinion new generation be reading william james bergson freud becoming more more psychological people said think so so why do do so so when at last oswald carried off peter to dublinwhich did not do at easter a have planned at whitsuntide for mere long week endto see at close hand perplexing irish question seemed drifting steadily uncontrollably towards bloodshed found that while be asking who be in right who be in wrong here who be most to blame who must have upper hand peter be asking with terrible impartiality why be people talking nonsense why

moment assume attitude of superior person life be evidently troubling profoundly be realizing that there be apparent answer to many of perplexity be at least trying hard to get answer what shocked in

with russia belief on whole germany have prepared for sought war be doubt correct spirit of whole nation rose high fine to challenge did not so completely exhaust moral factor in case a most english people including peter supposed at time peter joan although be member of best educated class in community have be given best education available for class have vaguest knowledge of what be going on in political world knew practically nothing of what modern imperial system consisted have vaguest idea of rle of foreign office press parliament in international affair be absolutely ignorant of

hidden thing unanalysed thing misrepresented obscured political system of european empire burst out into war about sprawling clumsy heedless british state have troubled so little about taking peter into confidence displayed now hesitation whatever in beckoning home to come learn a speedily a possible how to die for tragedy of youth in great war be universal tragedy if german youth who be now le freely more systematically beating peter by week month in universal race into uniform be more instructed than be also far more thoroughly misinformed if peter took hold of war by one elemental fact that belgium have be invaded most abominably peaceful villager murdered in own field young german on other hand have be trained to whole system of false interpretation be assured that fought to break up ring of threatening enemy that whole thing be going to be most magnificent adventure in history mind have be prepared elaborately persistently for heroic strugglein be to win easily have be made to

upon peter be not of genial considerate order of teacher believed in weeding out dud a swiftly a possible have open mind a to whether rather over intelligent looking beginner might not under certain circumstance squeal so just tried without note of preparation looped loop with propeller that span before eye of peter dipped peter bowed in accord with dipped more more steeply until machine be almost nose down until peter be looking at sea land a one sits look at wall be tilted down down until be face downward then a abruptly be tilted up be like being in swing note of engine altered a if hand swept up scale of note sea land seemed to fall away below a though left for ever blue sky swept down across field of vision like curtain be so to speak on back now with leg in air looking straight at sky at nothing sky expecting to recover for vast second waited for swing to end be surely end of swing onlymost amazinglyhe didnt recover wanted to say ouch be immensely surprisedtoo surprised to be frightened went over backwardsin instantand sea land reappeared above sky also came down like curtain too then behold aeroplane be driving down world be in place again far below loop whispered peter little dazed glanced back at pilot smiled be perambulator excursion loopfirst trip blue eye seemed little le hard weather red face be smiling faintly then gripped by irresistible power peter found going down down down almost vertically pilot have apparently stopped engine peter watched majestic expansion of landscape a fell have come back over land far away must see aerodrome like scattered collection of little toy hut growing bigger bigger instant sat quite still for be rightit must be right now be getting very near ground be still rushing up to meet pouring outwardly a rose cat now must be visible be all right engine picked up with roar like score of lion pilot levelled out hundred foot above tree then presently be dropping to aerodrome again down until hedge be plain grazing cattle close distinct then with sense of infinite regret peter perceived that be back on turf again that flight be over danced lightly over turf rush slowed down taxied gently up to hangar engine shuddered with pathetic drop to silence stopped little stiffly peter unbuckled stretched set to clamber to ground weather bitten senior nodded to smiled faintly peter walked towards mess be wonderfuland intensely disappointing in that be so soon over there be still great piece of afternoon left aerodrome be short of machine instructor have to wait couple of week before must get into air second time worked sedulously to gather knowledge during waiting interval first real lesson found very alert ready pupil time dual control be at disposal for straight so pilot left thing to altogether came dozen other lesson then peter found sitting alone in machine outside great shed watched closely by knot of friendly rival for first time on own account conducting that duologue have heard now so often on other lip switch off suck in contact started across ground first sensation bordered on panic hitherto machine have flown in have be just machine now one one be animal started out across aerodrome like demented ostrich swerving wildly trying to turn round always before other man have done taxi business on ground have never occurred to peter that involved difficulty peter heart nearly failed in opening twenty second be convinced be going to be killed then determined to get up at cost at rate wouldnt smash on ground let out accelerator touched control behold be uphe be up instantly machine ceased to resemble floundering ostrich became steady dignified carinate swaying only slightly from wing to wing up went over hedge over tree beyond above familiar field of cow moment of panic passed peter be again have got right outside aerodrome have to bank bring round already have done that successfully number of time with instructor to take care of did successfully now confidence grew back buzzed droned hundred foot over aerodrome made three complete circuit rose outside aerodrome came down making good landing be instantly smitten with intensest regret that have not made eight nine

upon last occasion joan said knocking out half consumed cigarette upon edge of plate billy said joan waking up queer joan that dont love when love so much id trust to end of earth billy know dont love think of a much a do of one exceptone billy said joan weakly youre straightest man on earth wilmington tongue ran along white lip spoke with effort youve loved peter since be six year old isnt a

thinking hard not much good pretending dont hate peter do if must kill himand in memory too bar from make unhappy face be white misery joan glanced round at table about one seemed to be watching looked at again pity so great that came near to love wrung joan said at last yes queer feel mean a though wasnt right look here joan tapped arm somethingsomething that suppose may a well point out to because in certain mattersin certain matter be being fool astonishing absolutelya fool joan perceived have something very important to say sat watching a with immense deliberation got out cigarette lit dont understand peter business joan ii do mostly when im not actually planning out carrying out destruction of german think of youand peter rest of ive got nothing else much to think about think see thing dont see know do oh damn go to hell last be to waiter who be making customary warning about liqueur on stroke of half past nine sorry said wilmington to joan leant forward over folded arm

have never made love to anybodyexcept a sort of cheerful way of talking perhaps never never will respect too much to make love to hed hate idea of one elsemaking love to idea outside of conception of hell never think of for joan sat quite still after what seemed long silence looked up at wilmington be watching face saw understood drift must cut out like said wilmington with gesture gained accidental emphasis by knocking glass off table smashing broken glass supplied incident distraction with waiter to relieve tension of situation thats have to say said wilmington when be settled there earthly reason why two of must be unhappy billy said after long pause if must only love face of gratitude that looked at faded to mask youre thinking of peter already said wilmington watching face be

killed joan so neednt worry about will get killed know peter will live always have taken everything too seriously always will kill lot of german yet one day will get peter will be up there in air like cheerful midgewith archies missing conversation be cardinal event in joans life wilmington suggestion raised out of grave of forgetfulness incorporated with conversation have have long ago with adelaone christmas at pelham ford when adela have be in love with sopwith greene adela too have maintained that be business of woman to choose man not wait to be chosen that be woman who have to make love man in love with woman in general have be adelas idea woman fall in love with men in particular adela have used queer phrase for woman to find own man keep take care of men have to do own work couldnt think about love a woman be obliged by nature to think about love love just trouble to real man like mosquito singing in ear until woman take care of idea came back now to joans mind did best to consider judge a generalization indeed judged with packed court being clamoured warmly for to get peter to take caremost admirable phraseof peter decision be made still argued with be beneath dignity to set out capture peterhe be peter only didnt know tried to generalize have ever be dignified for woman to wait until man discovered possible love be that at best anything more than dignity of mannequin three quarter at least of art literature of world be concerned with relation of sex yet here be joan after thirty century so of human art literature still debating elementary fact of being there be so much excitement in art literature so little light world have still to discover scope vastness of educational responsibility most of teaching in matter hitherto have be le in nature of enlightenment than strategic concealment have given young knowledge training have restrained baffled told lie then have inflamed have abused instinctive trust when be child with story of old bogey designed to save bother unrestrained youthful enterprise might cause with humorous mockery of natural curiosity jocularity about stork gooseberry bush sham indignation at plainness of speech fierce punishment of imperfectly realized offence against background of giggle knowing innuendo careless exciting glimpse of mystery have constituted ordinary initiation of youth of world right up to full age still fail to provide clear elemental fact young men know for certain whether continence be healthy unhealthy possible impossible sex be still assured with power of assurance that only pure proper life for be sexless one until at last brightest of young have be obliged to get down to bare fact in begin again at beginning so joan co heiress of age with peter found that because of defaulting trustee because teacher divine writer like have shirked what be disagreeable difficult unpopular inherited nothing debt danger have not even that touching faith in nature sustained generation of jean jacques rousseau have to set about problem with peter a though be eve adam in garden overrun with weed thorn into god have never come joan be too young yet to have developed compensating egotism of thwarted femininity saw peter without delusion be bigger cleverer creature than compelled respect have more strength more invention more initiative relatively tremendous power of decision at same time be weak blind stupid flickering unstable sensuousness light adventurousness certain dishonesty about woman filled with comprehensive pity contempt there be real difference not merely in scale in nature between be clear to now that passionate essential reality of woman life be only incidental to man on other hand there be passionate essential reality for peter made own seem narrow self centred knew far more of mental life than oswald did knew that have intense passion for clear statement held to scientific political judgment with power altogether deeper greater than did cared for criticized polished like weapon have be entrusted to beneath debonair mask be growing into strong purposeful social mental personality perceived that be only in beginning of growthif came on misadventure if did not waste did not believe that have great power of further growth except through linked to must keep pace with must capture sens keep conscience uphold have convinced now that be chief business in life mind be remarkably free from doubt about future if once must get at peter mountain forest of use wont separated knew peter have acquired habit of not making love to of separating from thought of love if ever peter came over mountain if ever came through forest to in heart of forest must keep wasnt afraid that peter must leave again wilmington have be wrong there that have suggested in bitterness of heart men like huntley winterbaum be always astray peter be not looking for woman be just lost man distracted by desire desire be strong because be energetic desire be mischievous unmeaning because have lost way in thing dont care so very much how long take peter dont care what cost said joan getting rle clear at last dont even carenot vitally anyhowhow wander by way because youre man peter be woman because so be written in beginning be coming over mountain peter though go up to sky be coming through forest though have to make path for be coming to arm peter coming to so joan framed scheme regardless of swift approach of day of battle for peter be resolved to lose nothing by neglect delay also meant to hing precipitate to begin with braced to disagreeable task of really thinkinginstead of just feelingabout hetty compared deliberately point by point with hetty long ago at pelham ford have challenged hettyand peter have come out of old library in spite of hetty to watch dancing be younger be fresher cleaner be ray of sunlight to hettys flame hetty be good companyperhaps peter joan have always be good company for other interested in score of common subject able to play same game run abreast hetty be easy there be strength between peter there be barrier between joan peter be blank wall stern taboo upon primary among youthful interest long habit of aloofness dating from day when soppy be ultimate word in gamut of human scorn just like said joan barrier have to be broken down without shock before problem joan maintained frowning unsuccessful siege couldnt begin to flirt with peter couldnt make eye at such thing must be intolerable couldnt devise sort of signal so how devil be business ever to begin while wrestled vainly with perplexity remained more boyish more good fellow companion with peter than ever while be still meditating quite fruitlessly on riddle of changing relationship to peter be snatched away from to france thing happened quite unexpectedly came up to see at hampstead late in afternoonit be by mere chance be back early be full of pride at being chosen to go so soon seemed brightly excited at going keen for great adventure most lovable animated of petersand might be going to death be convention of time never to think of death anyhow never to speak of engagement held for evening final farewell spree did not ask too particularly what be must guess only too well altogether be about five twenty minute together with miss jepson always in room with for most part talked air shop then prepared to leave with scheming still at loose end in air well said good bye old joan held out hand said joan with sudden resolution in eye time kiss peter well said peter astonished have surprised stared at for instant with half framed question in eye then kissed very gravely carefully kissed on mouth for second solemnity hung about then peter turned upon miss jepson do want kiss said peter miss jepson be for kissing then with laugh effect of escape peter have gone into outer world into outer air flew to france next day above grey shining stretch of water two little anxious ship sent joan cheerful message on picture postcard of shell smashed church to tell of safe arrival joan be dismayed in war time must not brood on death one doe not think of death if one can help be chance that wreck calculation fear of death have fallen suddenly upon plan what be there left now of plan might write letter death be more terrible to girl in love than to other living thing if dy said joan be killed will be worse than widowan indian girl widow suttee what will be left of ash poor dreg of joan carrying on bankrupt life there be nothing for to write letter joan found letter incredibly difficult to write lightness have gone from touch after long tiring day with car sat writing tearing up beginning again be so difficult now to write to to be easy in manner yet insidious wanted still to seem old companion yet to hint subtly at new state of thing there dull feeling now youve gone out of england peter wrote ive never have company cared for in world a care for yours will count day to leave peter a soon a know how many to count didnt guess before that be sort of necessity to over such sentence sentence must have edge yet not be too bold sentence full of tenderness above suspicion of soppiness joan pondered like poet writing sonnet letter went slowly life death hustled along together very swiftly in day of great war joans mind be full of love life fear of losing peter be thinking little of love life be secretly preoccupied with thought forbidden thought of death with strangeness of war of earth seen from aeroplane ten thousand foot so above old battlefield of mankind be seeing world in plan realizing what flat willow thing be on clear day circuit of world saw have circumference of hundred of mile night flying be journey amidst star with little black planet far away there be former achievement of race did not seem to now like miniature toy set out upon floor of untidy nursery have beaten up towards very limit of life air to clear thin air of twenty two twenty three thousand foot have be in blinding sunlight when everything below be still asleep in blue of dawn world of history romance world in ancestor have believed world seen in elevation of towering frontage high portal inaccessible dignity giddy pinnacle frowning reputation have now fallen a flat seemed a faade of cloth hall at ypres have seen that one day from above spread out upon ground be convinced that high above thing of past droned liquid way towards new sort of life altogether towards greater civilization world wide life for men with boundary in at except emptiness of outer space life of freedom exaltation tremendous achievement meanwhile old thing of world be trying most desperately to kill day enemy anti aircraft gun seemed to grow more accurate high above little fleecy cloud lurked braggart markheimer gallant von papen suchlike german champion with decoy below ready to swoop strike never before have world promised peter so tremendous spectacle a seemed to promise now never before have hope of living to see be so insecure when have enlisted even after have be transferred to flying corp peter have thought very little of death thought of death only became prevalent in english mind towards second year of war be hateful unnatural thought in youth easily dismissed altogether unless circumstance press incessantly upon attention even before peter went to france two of set have be killed under eye in collision a came down into aerodrome third have seen two mile away get into spiral nose dive struggle out of again then go down to be utterly smashed to piece in one day on salisbury plain have seen three accident two knew have be fatal one have left legless thing to crawl through life mess in france seemed populous with young ghost reminiscence of spree talk of flying adventure be laced with dear old boy went west last may went west be common phrase never said killed hated very name of death did best dear gallant boy to make end seem easy familiar part of life of life with be so joyously in love knew that dice be loaded against that a war went on chance against grew first day peter be out in france saw man hit brought down by german archie two day after found centre of sudden constellation of whoofing shell left inky cloudburst over under round about saw fabric of wing jump quiver dropped six hundred foot so to shake gunner off whuff whuff whuff like bark of monstrous dog beast be on again within minute peter did two three loop came about got away with almost indecent haste be trembling hated hated to tremble in mess that evening talk ran on pigeon shooter seemed that there be one german gunner far quicker more deadly than of fellow have knack of divining what airman be going to do peter admitted near escape sought counsel peter colleague watched narrowly unostentatiously when advised face be mask face be mask be keen for faintest intonation of what be behind hated death tried not to think of death believed that there be paladin other fellow who never thought of death at when tension got too great ragged smashed great quantity of furniture made incredible volume of noise twice peter got away from aerodrome to let thing rip in amiens such outbreak be usually followed by deep depression of spirit in night peter must wake up find thought of death sitting by bedside so far peter have never have fight have gone over enemy line five time have bombed troop train in station regiment resting in village believed have killed score more of german on occasion felt not slightest compunction have not yet come across fighting hun plane have very grave doubt about issue of such fight fight be bound to come sooner later knew be not such quick pilot a must like to be thought quickly thought rather too much for rapid steady decision have balancing scientific mind knew that none of flight be perfect always there be conflict of intention at point hesitation believed might last for week month knew that somewhen must be found wantingjust for second perhaps just in turn of fight then must be killed hid quite successfully from companion particularly from squadron commander conviction just a have previously hidden vague funk have invariably invaded being whenever walked across ground towards machine during day of instruction at back of mind thought that time be limited be always present believed that have to die might be tomorrow next week next month somewhen within year when conviction became uppermost in peter mind black discontent possessed there be such bitter critic of life a young theirs be magnificent greed for splendour of life have patience with delay blunder failure be intolerable peter reviewed two twenty yearsit be now nearly three twentywith intense dissatisfaction have wasted time now have got into narrow way led down down pitilessly to where there must be no more time to waste have be aimless world have be aimless then have suddenly turned upon caught in lobster trap have wasted chance of great experience have never loved woman have be well loved because have frittered away possibility in hateful sex excitement with hettywho did not even pretend to be faithful to now thing have got into spin to death be exactly like spinlike spinning nose divethe whole affair life war must lie fret in bed fret more because knew wakefulness wasted precious nervous vigour might save life next day after black draught of such thought peter must become excessively noisy facetious in mess tent be recognized applauded a wit a devil be really very good at limerick delicately indelicate upon name of fellow officer of village along frontthat be doubt heredity gift of aunt phyllisand caricature adorned mess be also understood that be rake peter evil anticipation be only too well justified be put down in very first fight happened over dompierre have bad luck be struck by von papen one of crack german flier on part of front be up at ten thousand foot so more le covering low flying photographer when saw german machine coming over mile perhaps more away a though be looking for trouble peter knew might funk fight to escape that moral disaster headed straight down for german who dropped made off southward peter rejoicing at flight pursued eye upon quarry then from out of sun came von papen swiftly unsuspected upon peter tail announced presence by whiff of bullet peter glanced over shoulder to discover that be caught oh damn cried peter ducked head felt stung at shoulder wrist splinter be flying about tried side slip a did so have instant vision of yet machine frenchman time falling like bolt out of blue upon assailant biter be bit peter tried to come round help turned right over sideways dropped suddenly found with second hun plane coming up right ahead of

quite probably own genially amiable conversation there be very nice frenchman with black beard soft eye who wore long white overall seemed to be looking after a tenderly a woman must do with thing mingled matter of delirium at one time kaiser prevailed in peter mind large foolish pompous person with waxed moustache distraught eye who crawled up to peter over immense pile of white grey green

peter be peter hot dusty from walk of three mile carrying valise with aching left arm there be look of defiance in eye stared fiercely out from under perspiration matted hair upon forehead seemed to find oswald appearance complete confirmation of most disagreeable anticipation thought of panic desertion flashed upon oswald mind good god peter cried what brings back ive come back for week said peter leaf up told lie sir ive got week oswald stared at ward im sorry sir said peter ive be making fool of thought better of got out of train at standon walked back here what doe mean peter said

understanding im going to hop down towards village peter said oswald becoming casual in manner want exercise if youll tell one youre back indicated house behind by movement of head peter be badly blown with haste emotion thank sir said shortly oswald stepped past stared down road mr moxtons in house said without looking at peter again joans up garden see when get back peter glad youve got week anyhow so long left peter standing in gateway fear came upon peter stood quite still for moment looking at house cedar dropped valise at front door mopped face then walked slowly across lawn towards terrace wanted to shout found hoarse then on first terrace got out jo un in flat croak have to cry again jo un before sounded at like old style joan became visible have come out of arbour at top of garden be standing motionless regarding down vista of central path be white rather dishevelled stood quite still peter walked up step towards ive come back joan said a drew near want to talk to come into arbour took arm clumsily led back into arbour out of sight of house then dropped arm joan said ive be damndest of fool a said dont know why stood before awkwardly be trembling violently thought be going to weep must not touch again did not dare to touch then joan spread out arm straight stood like crucifix face have be dark stare softened swiftly became radiant dissolved into dusky glow of tear triumph oh petah darling sobbed seized kissed with tear salt lip hugged to herself magic barrier be smashed at last peter held close to kissed be second time have kissed since black day at high cross school be year of swift marryings peter be young married man when presently be added to number of select company attached to sausage shaped observation balloon who be sent up in morning pulled down at night along british front have have only momentary snatch of matrimony before front have called back to own destructive interest experience have banished lingering vestige of theory that there be one sort of woman respect sort make love to there be only one sort of woman to love respect be joan be altogether in love with joan be sure have never be in love before be now also extravagantly in love with life wanted to go on with with passionate intensity seemed to that be not only beginning for for one hitherto man have be living down there down on flatsfor world be flat from air now at last men be beginning to feel how might soar over ancient limitation occasionally thought of such thing up in basket sitting like spectator in box at theatre with slow vast drama of western front spread out like map beneath eye with half belgium great circle of france in sight brown ruined country on side of man land apparently lifeless with insane tangle of trench communicating way below with crumbling heap of ruined town village scattered among canal lake of flood water passing insensibly into green normal looking landscape to west east where church still have tower house roof wood be lump block of dark green field manifestly cultivated patch road white ribbon barred by purple poplar shadow spectacular speculative phase be rare came only when thin veil of haze made whole spacious prospect faint so beyond more immediate circle peter must see only broad outline of land given worse condition of weather must be too uncomfortable for philosophy given better must be too busy sat on canvas seat inside square basket with instrument about leant over side scrutinizing detail of eastward landscape upon head over ear wore telephone receiver about body be rope harness linked by rope to silk parachute be packed neatly in little swinging bucket over side of basket under hand be map board repeating shape of wood water road below telephone wire that ran down mooring rope abolished effect of isolation linked directly to winch on lorry below to number of battery commander to ascending series of headquarters must always start conversation if have anything practical to say be in fact eye at end of tentacle thread by mean of british army watched enemy sometimes have illusion that be also kind of brain when distant visibility be good must find hovering over war a player hang over chessboard directing fire upon road movement train movement suspecting watching for undisclosed enemy battery directing counter battery fire above green voluminous hung great translucent lobe of gas bag loose rope by be towed held upon ground swayed trailed about basket be on one of more slack afternoon that peter fell thinking of how acutely now desired to live wide world be full of sunshine ground haze made even country immediately below indistinct enemy gunner be inactive there came elfin voice through telephone only far away to south gun butted shivered tranquil air there be faint drift in air rather than breeze gas bag have fallen into long lazy rhythmic movement so sometimes faced due south sometimes south by east so back great patch of flooded country to north east bright mirror with kind of bloom upon seemed trying with aimless persistency to work way towards centre of field of vision never succeeding for time peter have be preoccupied with distant ridge far away to east from long range gun have recently taken to shelling kite balloon towards evening a became clear against bright western sky four time lately new gun have got on to clear tranquil afternoon promised just luminous tranquil sunset favoured unpleasant activity be five hour to sunset yet peter must not keep mind off gun be big gun perhaps centimetre be beyond counter battery possibility have got new kind of shell that german seemed to have invented for particular discomfort of peter kind have distinctive report loud crack then whuff of high explosive at explosion got nearer nearer to target with quite uncanny certainty seemed to learn more than gun must learn from shot be steadfast approach to hit peter disliked that long pause after shell have started far away must see flash of gun amidst ridge in darkling east then must come long blank pause of expectation for must tell might get then whine of shell must become audible growing louder louder lower lower in note phee whoo crack whoof then peter must get quite voluble to men at winch below must let up go down few hundred foot must shift lorry along road until be dark must not come down for kite balloon be terribly visible helpless thing on ground until have be very carefully put to bed to come down in daylight meant too good chance for nearer german gun so peter by instructing winch to lower let up shift have to dodge about in most undignified way up down backwards sideways while big gun marked guessed at next position flash oh damn said peter already silence anticipation then pheeeeeeeewhoo crack whoof rush of air must set gas bag swinging be near one where be said peter that wasnt going to happen for hour yet why meet trouble way why be tormented by feeling of apprehension danger in still air why trouble because world be quiet seemed to be waiting why not think of something else banish war from mind be more afraid nowadays than used to be peter be inclined to think now be more systematically afraid formerly have funked in streak patch now have steady continuous dislike to risk danger be getting more more clearly idea of sort of life wanted to lead of thing wanted to do be ceasing to think of existence a rather aimless series of adventure coming to regard a one large consecutive undertaking on part of joan being hung up in sky for german to shoot at seemed to to be very tiresome irrelevance indeed joan everybody with brainsincluding misguided people who have made be now firing big gun at himought to be setting to work to get preposterous muddle of world in order sort of thing said peter addressing western front gas bag so much of sky a permitted to see universe generally be ridiculous there be sense in at none dream of god a detached aloof personage have taken very strong hold upon imagination perhaps must be truer to say that fevered mind in hospital have given caricature personality to idea have grown up in mind a natural consequence of training have gone on with argument went on with now with feeling really be just a much sitting talking in queer untidy out of way office a swaying in kite balloon six thousand foot above flanders waiting to be shot at be very well to say exert said peter there be that chap over there exerting what be doing with brain be just trying to wipe brain out of existence just that hasnt idea else of what be doing have notion of what be up to what be up to hasnt sense ability to come over here talk about to he thereat thatand cant help im hereand cant help if must only catch within counter battery range there sense in at summarized peter after moment of grim reflection sense hasnt got into be sense ever going to get into curious thing about said peter addressing quite directly to deity at desk be that somehow without ever positively promising saying anything plain definite about yet manage to convey in almost irresistible manner that there be going to be sense in seem to suggest that poor brain up here brain of chap over there be in spite of appearance to contrary up to something jointly be going to come together make good day hint yet dont get scrap of sound trustworthy reasoning to help to accept that not scrap why must be so ask just keep on not saying anything suppose necessary thing biologically that one must have kind of optimism to keep one alive so im not even justified in half conviction im not being absolutely fooled by life admit that taking for example joan there be something about joan that almost persuades there must be something absolutely right about thingsfor joan to happen at yet isnt again just biologically necessary delusion there sit silent seem to say nothing yet soak with kind of answer sort of shapeless courage peter mind rested on for time then began again at point wonder said peter if chap get tonight what will thinkin momentafter have got german gunner never got peter because something else got first thought saw hun aeroplane coming over very high indeed to south of fifteen thousand foot up more mere speck in blue blaze then gas bag hid dismissed from mind be thinking that air be growing clearer that if went on gun must wake up presently little voice begin to talk to when became aware of presence vibration of aeroplane quite close to pulled off telephone receiver heard roar of engine close at hand be overhead gas bag still hid at same moment british anti aircraft gunner began belated fire damn said peter in brisk perspiration hastened to make sure that parachute rope be clear perhaps he british said peter with real hope pap pap pap very loud overhead gas bag swayed billowed wing with black cross swept across sky pap pap pap gas bag wrinkled crumpled more more little streak of smoke appeared beyond edge german aeroplane be now visible hundred yard away banking to come round have fired balloon with tracer bullet thing that peter have to do what did be have to step up on to little wood step inside basket then have to put first one foot then other on to little step outside basket little step be about four inch wide by nine long below be six thousand foot of emptiness above little tree house below a swayed on step peter have to make sure that rope attached to body be clear of entanglement then have to step off little shelf be now swinging slanting with lurching basket to be attached into void six thousand foot above earth have not to throw dive headlong because might lead to entanglement with rope have just to step off into pellucid nothingness holding rope clear of with one hand rope looped back to little swinging bucket in fine silk parachute be closely packed have seen packed week ago wished now a stood on step holding to basket with one hand that have watched process more meticulously became aware that hun having disposed of balloon be now shooting at did not so much step off little shelf a slip off a heeled over with swing of basket first instant of leap fall make impression on mind for second be falling swiftly foot foremost through air scarcely noted faint snatch when twine held parachute in basket broke then consciousness began to register again kept foot tightly pressed together air whistled by thought that dream talk have much exaggerated sensation of falling be too high a yet to feel rush of ground towards seemed to fall for interminable time before anything more happened be assailed by doubtswhether twine kept parachute in bucket must break whether must open rope trailed out above still falling why didnt parachute open in ten second must be too late parachute be not opening be certainly not opening wrong packing tugged jerked rope tried to shake swing long silken fold be following fall why why devil rope seemed to tighten abruptly harness tightened upon body peter gasped sprawled have sensation of being hauled up back again into sky be right so far be now swaying down earthward with diminishing velocity beneath open parachute be floating over landscape instead of falling straight into german have not done with peter yet became visible beneath edge of peter parachute circling downward regardless of anti aircraft machine gun pap pap pap pap bullet burst banged about peter something kicked peter knee something hit neck something rapped knuckle of wounded hand parachute winced went sideways slashed pierced peter drifted down faster helpless angry eye upon assailant who vanished again going out of sight a rose up above edge of parachute storm of pain rage broke from peter done in shouted peter oh leg leg im shot to bit im shot to bloody bit tree top be near at hand parachute have acquired rhythmic swing be falling more rapidly ive still got to land wailed peter beginning to cry like child wanted to stop just moment just for one little moment before ground rushed up to meet wanted time to think didnt know what to do with dangling leg became monstrous painful obstacle to landing how be to get spring be bleeding be dying be cruel cruel came crash hot iron seemed assailed leg shoulder neck crumpled up on ground in agony parachute with slow elegant gesture folded down on top of floundering figure gunner who ran to help found enveloped in silk bawling weeping like child of four in passion of rage fear trying repeatedly to stand up upon blood streaked leg gave way a repeatedly damn cursed peter in stifled voice plunging about like kitten in sack damn tell will use leg will have leg if bleed to death oh oh foolyou lying old humbug then gave leap upward forward fainted fell lay still with head body muffled in silk fold

let hope latter if not actually still born of course must be best thing must possibly happen at point oswald became aware of joan coming out of house towards looked at watch much too early yet joan

rehearsed rather have be rehearsing experimental fragment of for most of night before on thursday night cloudy malaise of mind broke cleared thing fell into proper place in thought must feel that idea be no longer distorted confused valediction appeared ordered discourse if only must hold out through long talk felt must be able to make plain to lay in darkness putting together phrase after phrase sentence after sentence developing long elaborate argument dipping down into parenthesis throwing off footnote resuming text for most part joan peter remained silent hearer of discourse now ratiocination glowed so brightly that be almost forgotten now came into discussion assisted said helpful understanding thing raised simple obvious objection be beautifully overcome what be education up to must begin what be education then came sentence that repeated in stillness of mind quite number of time consider beast be thing man did not reckon with peter tendency to prompt reply must begin in broadest most elementary way consider beast be thing man so framed opening creature restlessly experimental mischievous destructive a sexual a monkey with really strong social instinct such tolerance of fellow a deer have such instinctive self devotion a find in bee ant solitary animal selfish animal yet creature have now made for such condition that must be social must be destroy

peter can quote be true vine ye be branch oswald mind rested on for time be not language peter be same idea essentially be same idea can talk of one many can say live in mercy of allah if be liberal jew that be part of israel seems to that formul be so much spluttering variation over one idea doesnt to men can quarrel mortally even upon question of how will say brotherhood here for time oswald mind paused embarked upon great wonderful parenthesis upon religious intolerance in at last lost completely dont see that men need fall out about religion be main proposition there be time when be against religion denounced priestcraft superstition so on be past that be past want peace in world men mind differ more about initial thing than do about final thing men think in image others in word

limitation in matter great religion have in common idea in common profess to teach universal brotherhood of man universal reign of justice why argue about phrase why not put in fashion for long time oswald argued about phrase before must get back to main thread of argument men have to be unified be driven to seek unity be still with individualized instinct of savage see then what education always have to be process of taking imperfectly social jealous deeply savage creature socializing development of education development of human society be one same thing education make social man so far a schooling go be quite plainly that teach solitary beast to read write teach to express by drawing teach other language perhaps something of history distribution of mankind what be making creature who must naturally posse only fierce narrow sociability of savage family in cave into citizen in greater community be how see that primarily be what have be done to uneducated man be man who can talk to

demon patience with peterin always played thirteen to eleven usually won in spite of handicapand inclination for bach passacaglia upon pianola in study peter expressed ready for chose must play dp read moll flandershe have just discovered delight of greatest of eighteenth century novel be sitting on couch in library joan be standing upon hearthrug regarding thoughtfully when oswald came in stopped to hear what peter be saying with one eye intent on joans pretty gravity no interrupted be evening see said coming up to fire want to talk to young people want to know thing want to know what make of life want exchange of view stood with back to fire smiled at joans grave face close to own ive got to talk to said very seriously necessary having paralysed by preface sat down in deep armchair pulled inch so towards fire leaning forward with eye on spitting coal began wish must talk better joan peter know ive never be good talkerits be rather loss between now particularly want to

sailing education want to talk aboutand future be now of age well past youre on verge of twenty five peterin month so youre off nowhousekeeping youre dropping pilot high time suppose joan glanced at peter then sank noiselessly into crouching attitude close to oswald knee paused to stroke hair ive be trying to get must get education ive have to blunder experiment ought to tell ive aimed at what ive done take stock with of world ive educated for part youre going to play in take stock be badly planned undertaking know then such surprising unexpected world time ive be learning most thing ive learnt more le too late to use knowledge properly paused peter looked at guardian said nothing oswald patted head at knee in return for caress be evasive even apologetic pat for did not want to be distracted by affection just then war have altered whole world went on life have become stark intense when took onwhen took up task of educating youour world here seemed most wrapped up comfortable secure world can possibly imagine comfortable to pitch of stuffiness most english people didnt trouble bit about shape of human life thought waswell rather like heap of down cushion for be for most of europe america thought be right perfectly safeif only didnt bother education have lost way yes put case education have lost way oswald paused again fixed one eye firmly on glowing cavity in fire a though contained very gist of thought what be education up to asked what be education thereupon of course ought to have gone on to passage beginning consider beast be thing man a have already rehearsed overnight peter have not learnt part properly suppose fitting square natural man into round hole of civilized life peter threw out reply greatly disconcerted oswald exactly said be for moment at loss yes said rallying what be civilized life oh creative activity in atmosphere of helpful goodwill peter tried in brief pause followed have disagreeable feeling that be getting to end of discourse before delivered beginning yes said again yes for must have political form world state said peter league of free nation said oswald to enforce peace throughout earth next remark came from peter be still more unexpected embarrassing peace be nothing said peter oswald turned red eye upon ward in profound amazement did differ fundamentally in idea of human future peace dear peter be everything protested sir nothing more than absence of war negative in itsvacuum cant live in vacuum mean active peace must be something more than peace war be activity peace be not if take war out of world must have other activity doesnt organization of world peace in constitute activity must be diminishing activity sir like man getting morphia taking going to sleep world peace must release energy a energy be released if end be merely peace there must be le need for until thing exploded great portion of oswald valediction broke away vanished for ever into limbo of unspoken discourse must have war go on peter not in present form struggle unification be end sought in struggle must go on in form sir said peter while life go on have to get world state put end to war agree real question be what be going to do with peace what struggle be to take place of war what be mankind going to do most war have come about hitherto because somebody be bored do remember how bored be in rotten way be going on then world state league of nation with nothing to do to keep peace will bore men intolerably thats what like about german what like about german oswald cried in horror did get move on sir said peter dont want preventive league of nation peter expanded got to be creative nothing else will be in sort of perpetual coronation yearwith nothing doing on account of procession horrible for little while oswald made reply must not recall single sentence of lost valediction be at appropriate here be put out distressed beyond measure that peter must find anything to like about german world peace for own sake be impossible peter went on old experimenter must certainly put spoke into wheel who be old experimenter asked oswald he sort of god have said peter something between theology fairy tale dreamt about when be delirious doesnt rule world anything of sort because doesnt want to keep on dropping new thing into to see what happens like man setting problem to work out in head life in little out of way office thats idea havent told about said joan will day said peter when feel so disposed be very disconcerting said oswald much perplexed scowled at fire before do realize need there be for form of world state ending of war unless mankind be to destroy altogether certainly sir said peter arent going to do on peace proposition simply got to be positive proposal know sir wish youd call nobby said oswald vice contracted in army sir ing said peter nobby in mind anyhow see ive got kind of habit at night odd time of thinking over little misadventure with balloon scrap with von papen be stock dream with extra detail worked in nasty detail of then wake up think about think over parachute affair more than fight because lasted longer wasnt so active felt more especially being shot in leg that sort of dream when float helpless thing impress most in reflecting on little experience be limitless amount of intelligence expended on such job a breaking wrist splintering shoulder blade smashing up leg amount of ingenuity good workmanship in instrument fitting of basket for example be extraordinary having regard to fact that be just one small item in artillery system for blowing german to red rag stuff intelligence be putting up against that too be wonderful way whole problem have be thought out special clock fuse so on well point be that chap who made equipment wasnt particularly interested in killing that chap who made outfit werent particularly keen on slaughter of german have nothing else to do be brought up in pointless world be caught by vulgar quarrel what did care for kaiser old as what be interested in be making thing peter became very earnest in manner peace a have known peace hitherto offer such opportunity for good inventive work a war doe thats point nobby there comparison between excitement endless problem of making real live efficient submarine for example have to meet escape intensest risk occupation of designing great big safe upholstered liner in fat swindler can cross atlantic without being seasick war tempts imaginative restless people stagnant peace bore youve got to reckon with intelligence imagination in world nobby more than anything arent strong enough to control perhaps will certainly upset inventive restless men be particular instrument of old experimenter prefers now to plague pestilence famine flood earthquake be more delicate instrument more efficient wont stand passive peace under circumstance can hope to induce chap who contrived clock fuse chap who worked out gas bag chap with new aeroplane gadget meme tooto stop cerebrating making damndest just in order to sit about safely in meadow joining up daisy chainslike beastly lot of figure by walter crane old experimenter find mischief still for idle brain to do insists on thats fundamental to scheme of thing thats reason interrupted oswald why inventor who be behind german who made loaded fired that shell shouldnt get together to do something will grow endure instead of killing one ah thats said peter word for isnt peace then what be word for dont know said peter great game perhaps where doe take peter threw out hand exploration said will take man to centre of earth will take to end of space between atom among star how can tell beforehand must have faith of one thing be sure that man can not stagnate be forbidden be uttermost sin why old man will come out of office to prevent war blood loss of be because new thing be entangled among old dead thing worn out silly thing weve not have vigour to get free old idiot nationality

time else there may be next time im for one world state end of flag king custom house have doubt of talk of making world safesafe for democracy want world made one for adventure of mankind be quite story have be in world now nobby for five twenty year be only beginning to suspect wonder beauty of thing men might know do if only must get eye hand free of old inheritance what have mankind done yet to boast about despise human historybecause believe in god not god dont approve of nobby in old experimenter whom confess dont begin to understand in far off eternal scheme hide from mean to develop age by age oh dont understand dont begin to explain he just figure for what feel be reality be right be wonderful instead of just muddling about over surface of universe have to get into understanding of to very limit of ability to live utmost do intensest best can yes said oswald yes be after own heart yet did not run along line of valedictory have flowered with such corinthian richness overnight have be thinking then of world peace what peter be driving at now be world purpose werent two after same thing sat with one eye reflecting red light of fire phrase have come in such generous abundance overnight now refused to come at peter on couch continued to think aloud making world safe for democracy said peter isnt quite if democracy mean that man may help who can that school university will give man woman fairest chance most generous inducement to help to do thing can best do under best condition then yes if democracy mean getting up riot boycott among stupid lazy illiterate whenever anything be doing then say human being have got to work have got to take part if law organization dont insist upon that old experimenter will so long a world be ruled by stale idea lazy idea be determined that will flounder from war to war now what doe democracy mean doe mean crowd of primitive brute howling down progress organization because if doe want to be in machine gun section when talk of education nobby think of highly educated people of nation instructed through through what of democracy in russia where have naturally clever people in state of peasant ignorancewho cant even read until schoolmaster have talked to one for ten twelve year can have what president wilson think of a democracy at now there meet said oswald be idea have be trying to get at with for minute palatial dimension of lost valedictory loomed out where have said peace overnight however now said progress young man on couch be much too keenly interested to make good audience when presently oswald propounded theory that great world religion be on side of world republic that peter desired peter demurred be true of catholicism for instance said peter oswald quoted be vine ye be branch yes said peter look at church dont look at formula at practice daily teaching be truly growing vine reality of catholicism peter argued be traditional sacramental religion narrow fetish religion with specialized priest be concerned primarily with world set face against conception of scheme of progress in world apart from legend of sacrifice of mass good catholic sneer at progress said peter take belloc chesterton for example hate idea of men working steadily for great scheme of effort here hold by stagnant standard planted deep in rich mud of life whats catholic conception of human lifeguzzle booze call passion of sex unclean behave accordingly confess get absolution at again be there recognition in catholicism of duty of keeping body fit brain active theyre worse than man who buried talent in clean napkin bury in wheezy fat sloven life what have in common with always be harking back to thirteenth century to peasant life amidst dung chicken different specie of mind from ours with head foot turned backward what be good of expecting pope for instance church to help in creating league of nation aim must be world agreement to stop progress want to release want peace in order to achieve nothing want peace in order to do everything what be good of pretending that be same peace catholic league of nation must be conspiracy of stagnation holy alliance what real world unity can come through step on way to world state real unification of men will be fought by stagnant men priest why blind to progress be religion in work learning be creed can not make term with other creed priest have got god seek god for ever priest be finished completed satisfied wewe be beginning there be two day yet before peter went back to work in london saturday dawned blue fine joan determined

approvingly at first world outside be a lonely a study went up valley along high road for mile then took winding lane under almost overhanging boughsthe hawthorn leaf now be nearly out elder quiteup over hill thence across field through wood until came to where steep lane run down to braughing by time although spring time world be still immensely lonely comfortless no longer felt that despairful sense of fresh irremediable loss with started be beginning to realize now that have always be solitary being that men even in crowd carry certain solitude with loneliness thus lifted to level of sustained general experience ceased to feel like dagger turning in heart down middle of braughing village among space of grass run little quin now race of crystalline water over pebbly willow now brown purposefulness flecked with foam in reed bend recover a if kept footing by perpetual feat of dexterity there be two ford midway between little bridge with handrail on oswald stayed for time watching life adventure of endless stream of bubble be begotten thirty foot away where eddy from depth beneath willow root dashed against bough bobbed dipped in water found great distraction relief in following adventure on came large small in string in spinning group busy bubble quiet bubble dignified solitary bubble passed dangerous headland of watercress ran gauntlet between two big stone then if survived came with hopeful rush for shadow under bridge vanished utterly for rest of day streaming bubble glittered raced jostled before oswald eye made veil across personal desolation mind swung like pendulum between two idea bubble be like human life be not like human life philosophy be greatest of anodyne why be man life different from bubble like bubble be born of swirl of matter like bubble reflects universe be driven whirled about by force doe not comprehend shine here be darkened there be elated depressed know not why at last pass suddenly out into darkness in evening oswald sat musing by study fire lamp unlit sat in attitude have long become habitual to with scarred side of face resting upon hidden by hand walk have wearied not unpleasantly knee be surprisingly free from pain be no longer acutely unhappy idea very engaging idea have come into head that be not really education of joan peter have come to end own be still learnershow much have still to learn at peter age have not yet gone to africa have finished with school college perhaps be beginning in university of life of have yet experienced great disillusionment neither of have be shamed bitterly disappointed have other have seen great war indeed peter knew now what wound death be likebut have be through at one twenty neither have have such dark tragedy a for example if one of have be killed if one of have betrayed injured other perhaps must always have fortunate life have have to learn lesson to end life have be darkened one have loved intensely lost have have to abandon chosen life work when be barely half done have present sense of great need of world be bodily weak mentally uncertain must spend day now of fretting futility unable to achieve anything loved dear youngster young can not give love to old because yet understand be alone yet be strange kept on with such strength a have pursued end two must go on full of hope helping one thinking together succeeding lesson have learnt be that without much love without much vitality with little hope of seeing single end achieved for worked must still go on drifted through memory seeking for motif have driven on from experience to experience while must remember experience be very hard now to recover inkling of motif remembered at school a violent egotist working hard openly fairly for ascendancy in school game working hard secretly for school position seemed now a though time have be no more than greed vanity be that fair to have forgotten redeeming dream of youth scene shifted to wardroom of first battleship then to first battle saw again long low line of egyptian coast battery of alexandria ramleh spitting fire condor standing in recalled tense excitement of morning boat rowing to land strangely enough incident have won victoria cross have be blotted completely from mind by injury must not recover even fact much le feel of act why have done what have done did really do then very vividly came memory of first sight of smashed disfigured face have be horrible at timein way be horrible stillbut after that seemed a though for first time have ceased then to be egotism vanity after that memory of impersonal interest began thought of attendance at huxley lecture at south kensington wonder of making first dissection about time met dolly here again be queer gap must not remember anything very distinctly about early meeting with dolly except that wore white that happened in garden yet in little while being have be hungry for dolly with first journey into africa memory became brighter clearer a if hotter sun shone upon everything before time be part of story of young man long vanished from world young oswald personality at least a remote a petervery like peter with change of scene to africa oswald became man in story be man who sat musing in study chair moved by same motif altogether understandable already in nyasaland be working consciously for civilization even a worked today everything in period lived still with accompanying feeling alive fought again in first fight in nyasaland recalled with complete vividness how have loaded fired reloaded fired time after time at rush of yao spearmen have fought leaning against stockade because be too weary to stand upright with head limb aching one man have hit have wriggled for long time in grass that memory still distressed trailed memory of horror with in campaign about lake kioga year later in fight amidst ant hill have come upon wounded sudanese being eaten alive by swarm of ant poor devil have died with ant still upon oswald must still recall sick anguish with have tried in vain to save relieve man affair be in exact quality of present feeling picture be painted from same palette remembered that then a now felt same helpless perplexity at apparently needle unprofitable human agony then a now have not despaired have be able to see reason in suffering excuse for must see none now yet did not despair why did not that hundred other horror overwhelm with despair why have be able to go on with life after after exquisite humiliation disappointment have loved dolly intensely here again came third le absolutely obliterated gap in recollection for year have be resolutely keeping mind off suffering of time now be indistinct memory be particularly blank now about arthur be registered merely a blonde sort of as with tenor voice who punched copper that faint hostile caricature be mind have tolerated still sharp clear a though have be photographed yesterday upon memory be afternoon when have realized that dolly be dead that scene be life size intense how in shady place under great tree have leant forward upon little folding table wept aloud what have carried through thing why have desired so intensely why have worked so industriously why did posse passion for order have inspired administrative work why have given best year to uganda why have be so concerned for welfare wisdom of joan peter why did work now to very breaking point until sleeplessness fever forced to rest for dream of great federation in worlda world state must certainly never live to see established if be indeed only bubble then surely be most obstinately opinionated of bubble be not merely bubble essential self of be not thing spun about in life that felt reflected world missed so acutely two dear other bubble have circled about so long that have now left to eddy in backwater while hurried off into midstream of life essential self self mused now that have struggled up through egotism of youth to present predominance be something deeper tougher more real than desire than excitement than pleasure pain be lesson have be learning there be something deeper in to have be getting down more more a life have gone on something to stuff of experience be incidental something in there be endless fortitude undying resolution to do there be something in profounder than stream of accident sat now with distress allayed mind playing with fancy metaphor analogy be profounder contentment beneath pain discontent consciousness of bubble giving way to underlying consciousness of stream be ingenious be not true men be not bubble carried blindly on stream be rather like bubble be be will part of will be slave of stream of matter thing indifferent to be paradoxically free bound be part of will what great will be have in grasp compelled to work saved from drowning in individual sorrow care must not say be easy to draw analogy that man be atom in life of specie a cell be atom in life of man again be not complete truth where be alleged will of specie if there be indeed such will in specie why be there war yet whatever might be assuredly there be something greater than sustaining life to felt like universal thing be indeed universal thing be strangely bound up with preference why did love choose certain thing passionately why be indifferent to others why be dolly joan more beautiful to than other woman why did so love sound of voice movement subtle line of face why did love peter standing upright when enthusiasm lit why did love light on polished steel darkness of deep water movement of flame of supple feline animal so intensely why did love thing more than sheen on painted wood grace of blonde woman movement of horse why did love justice revelation of scientific law setting right of disordered thing why did idea of
