operation by unsuspected eye happened that be immediate witness of davidsons seizure so fall naturally to to put story upon paper when say be immediate witness of seizure mean be first on scene thing happened at harlow technical college just beyond highgate archway be alone in larger laboratory when thing happened be in smaller room where balance be writing up note thunderstorm have completely upset work of course be just after one of louder peal thought heard glass smash in other room stopped writing turned round to listen for moment heard nothing hail be playing devil tattoo on corrugated zinc of roof then came sound smash doubt of time something heavy have be knocked off bench jumped up at once went opened door leading into big laboratory be surprised to hear queer sort of laugh saw davidson standing unsteadily in middle of room with dazzled look on face first impression be that be drunk did not notice be clawing out at something invisible yard in front of face put out hand slowly rather hesitatingly then clutched nothing whats come to said held up hand to face finger spread out great scott said thing happened three four year ago when one swore by personage then began raising foot clumsily a though have expected to find glued to floor davidson cried whats matter with turned round in direction looked about for looked over at on side of without slightest sign of seeing wave said remarkably neat schooner id swear be bellow voice hallo shouted suddenly at top of voice thought be up to foolery then saw littered about foot shattered remains of best of electrometer whats up man said youve smashed electrometer bellow again said friend left if hand be gone something about electrometer way be bellow suddenly came staggering towards damned stuff cut like butter said walked straight into bench recoiled none so buttery that said stood swaying felt scared davidson said what on earth come over looked round in direction must swear be bellow why dont show like man bellow occurred to that must be suddenly struck blind walked round table laid hand upon arm never saw man more startled in life jumped away from came round into attitude of self defence face fairly distorted with terror good god cried what be that bellow confound davidson jumped when answered stared how can express right through began talking not to to here in broad daylight on clear beach not place to hide in looked about wildly here im off suddenly turned ran headlong into big electro magnet so violently that a found afterwards bruised shoulder jawbone cruelly at that stepped back pace cried out with almost whimper what in heaven name have come over stood blanched with terror trembling violently with right arm clutching left where have collided with magnet by time be excited fairly scared davidson said dont be afraid be startled at voice not so excessively a before repeated word in a clear a firm tone a must assume bellow said be that cant see laughed cant even see where devil be here said in laboratory laboratory answered in puzzled tone put hand to forehead be in laboratory till flash came im hanged if im there now what ship be that there ship said do be sensible old chap ship repeated seemed to forget denial forthwith suppose said slowly be dead rummy part be feel just a though still have body dont get used to at once suppose old shop be struck by lightning suppose jolly quick thing bellow eh dont talk nonsense youre very much alive be in laboratory blundering about youve just smashed new electrometer dont envy when boyce arrives stared away from towards diagram of cryohydrates must be deaf said theyve fired gun for there go puff of smoke never heard sound put hand on arm again time be le alarmed seem to have sort of invisible body said by jove there boat coming round headland very much like old life after in different climate shook arm davidson cried wake up ii be just then that boyce came in so soon a spoke davidson exclaimed old boyce dead too what lark hastened to explain that davidson be in kind of somnambulistic trance boyce be interested at once did must to rouse fellow out of extraordinary state answered question asked of own attention seemed distracted by hallucination about beach ship kept interpolating observation concerning boat davit sail filling with wind made one feel queer in dusky laboratory to hear saying such thing be blind helpless have to walk down passage one at elbow to boyces private room while boyce talked to there humoured about ship idea went along corridor asked old wade to come look at voice of dean sobered little not very much asked where hand be why have to walk about up to waist in ground wade thought over long time know how knit brow then made feel couch guiding hand to thats couch said couch in private room of professor boyce horsehair stuffing davidson felt about puzzled over answered presently that must feel right couldnt see do see asked wade davidson said must see nothing lot of sand broken up shell wade gave other thing to feel telling what be watching keenly ship be almost hull down said davidson presently apropos of nothing never mind ship said wade listen to davidson do know what hallucination mean rather said davidson well everything see be hallucinatory bishop berkeley said davidson dont mistake said wade be alive in room of boyces something have happened to eye can not see can feel hear not see do follow seems to that see too much davidson rubbed knuckle into eye well said thats dont let perplex bellow here will take home in cab wait bit davidson thought help to sit down said presently now im sorry to trouble will tell over again wade repeated very patiently davidson shut eye pressed hand upon forehead yes said quite right now eye be shut know youre right thats bellow sitting by on couch im in england again be in dark then opened eye there said be sun just rising yard of ship tumbled sea couple of bird flying never saw anything so real im sitting up to neck in bank of sand bent forward covered face with hand then opened eye again dark sea sunrise yet im sitting on sofa in old boyces room god help iii be beginning for three week strange affection of davidsons eye continued unabated be far worse than being blind be absolutely helpless have to be fed like newly hatched bird led about undressed if attempted to move fell over thing struck against wall door after day so got used to hearing voice without seeing willingly admitted be at home that wade be right in what told sister to whom be engaged insisted on coming to see must sit for hour day while talked about beach of holding hand seemed to comfort immensely explained that when left college drove home lived in hampstead village appeared to a if drove right through sandhill be perfectly black until emerged again through rock tree solid obstacle when be taken to own room made giddy almost frantic with fear of falling because going upstairs seemed to lift thirty forty foot above rock of imaginary island kept saying must smash egg end be that have to be taken down into father consulting room laid upon couch stood there described island a being bleak kind of place on whole with very little vegetation except peaty stuff lot of bare rock there be multitude of penguin made rock white disagreeable to see sea be often rough once there be thunderstorm lay shouted at silent flash once twice seal pulled up on beach only on first two three day said be very funny way in penguin used to waddle right through how seemed to lie among without disturbing remember one odd thing be when wanted very badly to smoke put pipe in hand almost poked eye out with lit couldnt taste anything ive since found same with dont know if usual case can not enjoy tobacco at unless can see smoke queerest part of vision came when wade sent out in bath chair to get fresh air davidsons hired chair got that deaf obstinate dependant of theirs widgery to attend to widgerys idea of healthy expedition be peculiar sister who have be to dog home met in camden town towards king cross widgery trotting along complacently davidson evidently most distressed trying in feeble blind way to attract widgerys attention positively wept when sister spoke to oh get out of horrible darkness said feeling for hand must get out of will die be quite incapable of explaining be matter sister decided must go home presently a went uphill towards hampstead horror seemed to drop from said be good to see star again though be then about noon blazing day seemed told afterwards a if be being carried irresistibly towards water be not very much alarmed at first of course be night there lovely night of course asked for struck a odd of course said always night there when be day here well went right into water be calm shining under moonlight just broad swell seemed to grow broader flatter a came down into surface glistened just like skin might have be empty space underneath for must tell to contrary very slowly for rode slanting into water crept up to eye then went under skin seemed to break heal again about eye moon gave jump up in sky grew green dim fish faintly glowing came darting round thing seemed made of luminous glass passed through tangle of seaweed shone with oily lustre so drove down into sea star went out one by one moon grew greener darker seaweed became luminous purple red be very faint mysterious everything seemed to quiver while must hear wheel of bath chair creaking footstep of people going by man in distance selling special pall mall kept sinking down deeper deeper into water became inky black about not ray from above came down into darkness phosphorescent thing grew brighter brighter snaky branch of deeper weed flickered like flame of spirit lamp after time there be more weed fish came staring gaping towards into through never imagined such fish before have line of fire along side of a though have be outlined with luminous pencil there be ghastly thing swimming backwards with lot of twining arm then saw coming very slowly towards through gloom hazy mass of light resolved a drew nearer into multitude of fish struggling darting round something drifted drove on straight towards presently saw in midst of tumult by light of fish bit of splintered spar looming over dark hull tilting over glowing phosphorescent form be shaken writhed a fish bit at then be began to try to attract widgerys attention horror came upon ugh must have driven right into half eaten thing if sister have not come have great hole in bellow never mind be ghastly iv for three week davidson remained in singular state seeing what at time imagined be altogether phantasmal world stone blind to world around then one tuesday when called met old davidson in passage can see thumb old gentleman said in perfect transport be struggling into overcoat can see thumb bellow said with tear in eye lad will be right yet rushed in to davidson be holding up little book before face looking at laughing in weak kind of way amazing said there kind of patch come there pointed with finger im on rock a usual penguin be staggering flapping about a usual there be whale showing now then got too dark now to make out put something there see do see very dim broken in place see same like faint spectre of found out morning while be dressing like hole in infernal phantom world just put hand by mine no not there ah yes see base of thumb bit of cuff look like ghost of bit of hand sticking out of darkling sky just by there group of star like cross coming out from time davidson began to mend account of change like account of vision be oddly convincing over patch of field of vision phantom world grew fainter grew transparent a be through translucent gap began to see dimly real world about patch grew in size number ran together spread until only here there be blind spot left upon eye be able to get up steer about feed once more read smoke behave like ordinary citizen again at first be very confusing for to have two picture overlapping other like changing view of lantern in little while began to distinguish real from illusory at first be unfeignedly glad seemed only too anxious to complete cure by taking exercise tonic a odd island of began to fade away from became queerly interested in wanted particularly to go down in deep sea again must spend time wandering about low lying part of london trying to find water logged wreck have seen drifting glare of real daylight very soon impressed so vividly a to blot out everything of shadowy world of night time in darkened room must still see white splashed rock of island clumsy penguin staggering to fro even grew fainter fainter at last soon after married sister saw for last time v now to tell of queerest thing of about two year after cure dined with davidsons after dinner man named atkins called in be lieutenant in royal navy pleasant talkative man be on friendly term with brother in law be soon on friendly term with came out that be engaged to davidsons cousin incidentally took out kind of pocket photograph case to show new rendering of fiance by by said here old fulmar davidson looked at casually then suddenly face lit up good heaven said must almost swear what said atkins that have seen that ship before dont see how can have hasnt be out of south sea for six year before then began davidson then yes thats ship dreamt of im sure thats ship dreamt of be standing off island swarmed with penguin fired gun good lord said atkins who have now heard particular of seizure how deuce must dream then bit by bit came out that on very day davidson be seized hm fulmar have actually be off little rock to south of antipode island boat have landed overnight to get penguin egg have be delayed thunderstorm drifting up boat crew have waited until morning before rejoining ship atkins have be one of corroborated word for word description davidson have given of island boat there be not slightest doubt in of mind davidson have really seen place in unaccountable way while moved hither thither in sight moved hither thither in manner corresponded about distant island how be absolutely mystery completes remarkable story of davidsons eye perhaps best authenticated case in existence of real vision at distance explanation there be none forthcoming except what professor wade have thrown out explanation invokes fourth dimension dissertation on theoretical kind of space to talk of there being kink in space seems mere nonsense to may be because be mathematician when said that nothing must alter fact that place be eight thousand mile away answered that two point might be yard away on sheet of paper yet be brought together by bending paper round reader may grasp argument certainly idea seems to be that davidson stooping between pole of big electro magnet have extraordinary twist given to retinal element through sudden change in field of force due to lightning think a consequence of that may be possible to live visually in one part of world while one life bodily in have even made experiment in support of view so far have simply succeeded in blinding few dog believe be net result of work though have not seen for week latterly have be so busy with work in connection with saint pancras installation have have little opportunity of calling to see whole of theory seems fantastic to fact concerning davidson stand on altogether different footing can testify personally to accuracy of detail have given moth probably have heard of hapley not w t hapley son celebrated hapley hapley of periplaneta hapliia hapley entomologist if so know at least of great feud between hapley professor pawkins though certain of consequence may be new to for who have not word two of explanation be necessary idle reader may go over with glancing eye if indolence so incline be amazing how very widely diffused be ignorance of such really important matter a hapley pawkins feud epoch making controversy again have convulsed geological society be verily believe almost entirely unknown outside fellowship of body have heard men of fair general education even refer to great scene at meeting a vestry meeting squabble yet great hate of english scotch geologist have lasted now century have left deep abundant mark upon body of science hapley pawkins business though perhaps more personal affair stirred passion a profound if not profounder common man have conception of zeal animates scientific investigator fury of contradiction can arouse in be odium theologicum in new form there be men for instance who must gladly burn professor ray lankester at smithfield for treatment of mollusca in encyclopdia fantastic extension of cephalopod to cover pteropods wander from hapley pawkins began year year ago with revision of microlepidoptera whatever may be by pawkins in extinguished new specie created by hapley hapley who be always quarrelsome replied by stinging impeachment of entire classification of pawkins pawkins in rejoinder suggested that hapleys microscope be a defective a power of observation called irresponsible meddler hapley be not professor at time hapley in retort spoke of blundering collector described a if inadvertently pawkins revision a miracle of ineptitude be war to knife however must scarcely interest reader to detail how two great men quarrelled how split between widened until from microlepidoptera be at war upon open question in entomology there be memorable occasion at time royal entomological society meeting resembled nothing so much a chamber of deputy on whole fancy pawkins be nearer truth than hapley hapley be skilful with rhetoric have turn for ridicule rare in scientific man be endowed with vast energy have fine sense of injury in matter of extinguished specie while pawkins be man of dull presence prosy of speech in shape not unlike water barrel over conscientious with testimonial suspected of jobbing museum appointment so young men gathered round hapley applauded be long struggle vicious from beginning growing at last to pitiless antagonism successive turn of fortune now advantage to one side now to now hapley tormented by success of pawkins now pawkins outshone by hapley belong rather to history of entomology than to story in pawkins whose health have be bad for time published work upon mesoblast of death head what mesoblast of death head may be doe not matter rap in story work be far below usual standard gave hapley opening have coveted for year must have worked night day to make most of advantage in elaborate critique rent pawkins to tatter one can fancy man disordered black hair queer dark eye flashing a went for antagonist pawkins made reply halting ineffectual with painful gap of silence yet malignant there be mistaking will to wound hapley incapacity to do few of who heard be absent from meeting realised how ill man be hapley got opponent down meant to finish followed with simply brutal attack upon pawkins in form of paper upon development of moth in general paper showing evidence of most extraordinary amount of mental labour yet couched in violently controversial tone violent a be editorial note witness that be modified must have covered pawkins with shame confusion of face left loophole be murderous in argument utterly contemptuous in tone awful thing for declining year of man career world of entomologist waited breathlessly for rejoinder from pawkins must try one for pawkins have always be game when came surprised for rejoinder of pawkins be to catch influenza proceed to pneumonia die be perhaps a effectual reply a must make under circumstance largely turned current of feeling against very people who have most gleefully cheered on gladiator became serious at consequence there must be reasonable doubt fret of defeat have contributed to death of pawkins there be limit even to scientific controversy said serious people crushing attack be already in press appeared on day before funeral dont think hapley exerted to stop people remembered how hapley have hounded down rival forgot that rival defect scathing satire read ill over fresh mould thing provoked comment in daily paper be that made think that have probably heard of hapley controversy a have already remarked scientific worker live very much in world of own people dare say who go along piccadilly to academy year must not tell where learned society abide many even think that research be kind of happy family cage in kind of men lie down together in peace in private thought hapley must not forgive pawkins for dying in first place be mean dodge to escape absolute pulverisation hapley have in hand for in second left hapleys mind with queer gap in for twenty year have worked hard sometimes far into night seven day week with microscope scalpel collecting net pen almost entirely with reference to pawkins european reputation have won have come a incident in great antipathy have gradually worked up to climax in last controversy have killed pawkins have also thrown hapley out of gear so to speak doctor advised to give up work for time rest so hapley went down into quiet village in kent thought day night of pawkins good thing be now impossible to say about at last hapley began to realise in what direction pre occupation tended determined to make fight for started by trying to read novel must not get mind off pawkins white in face making last speech sentence beautiful opening for hapley turned to fiction found have grip on read island night entertainment until sense of causation be shocked beyond endurance by bottle imp then went to kipling found proved nothing besides being irreverent vulgar scientific people have limitation then unhappily tried besants inner house opening chapter set mind upon learned society pawkins at once so hapley turned to chess found little more soothing soon mastered move chief gambit commoner closing position began to beat vicar then cylindrical contour of opposite king began to resemble pawkins standing up gasping ineffectually against check mate hapley decided to give up chess perhaps study of new branch of science must after be better diversion best rest be change of occupation hapley determined to plunge at diatom have one of smaller microscope halibut monograph sent down from london thought that perhaps if must get up vigorous quarrel with halibut might be able to begin life afresh forget pawkins very soon be hard at work in habitual strenuous fashion at microscopic denizen of wayside pool be on third day of diatom hapley became aware of novel addition to local fauna be working late at microscope only light in room be brilliant little lamp with special form of green shade like experienced microscopist kept eye open be only way to avoid excessive fatigue one eye be over instrument bright distinct before be circular field of microscope across brown diatom be slowly moving with other eye hapley saw a be without seeing be only dimly conscious of brass side of instrument illuminated part of table cloth sheet of notepaper foot of lamp darkened room beyond suddenly attention drifted from one eye to other table cloth be of material called tapestry by shopmen rather brightly coloured pattern be in gold with small amount of crimson pale blue upon grayish ground at one point pattern seemed displaced there be vibrating movement of colour at point hapley suddenly moved head back looked with eye mouth fell open with astonishment be large moth butterfly wing spread in butterfly fashion be strange must be in room at for window be closed strange that must not have attracted attention when fluttering to present position strange that must match table cloth stranger far to hapley great entomologist be altogether unknown there be delusion be crawling slowly towards foot of lamp new genus by heaven in england said hapley staring then suddenly thought of pawkins nothing must have maddened pawkins more pawkins be dead something about head body of insect became singularly suggestive of pawkins just a chess king have be confound pawkins said hapley must catch looking round for mean of capturing moth rose slowly out of chair suddenly insect rose edge of lamp shade hapley heard ping vanished into shadow in moment hapley have whipped off shade so that whole room be illuminated thing have disappeared soon practised eye detected upon wall paper near door went towards poising lamp shade for capture before be within striking distance however have risen be fluttering round room after fashion of kind flew with sudden start turn seeming to vanish here reappear there once hapley struck missed then again third time hit microscope instrument swayed struck overturned lamp fell noisily upon floor lamp turned over on table very luckily went out hapley be left in dark with start felt strange moth blunder into face be maddening have light if opened door of room thing must get away in darkness saw pawkins quite distinctly laughing at pawkins have ever oily laugh swore furiously stamped foot on floor there be timid rapping at door then opened perhaps foot very slowly alarmed face of landlady appeared behind pink candle flame wore night cap over gray hair have purple garment over shoulder what be fearful smash said have anything strange moth appeared fluttering about chink of door shut that door said hapley suddenly rushed at door slammed hastily hapley be left alone in dark then in pause heard landlady scuttle upstairs lock door drag something heavy across room put against became evident to hapley that conduct appearance have be strange alarming confound moth pawkins however be pity to lose moth now felt way into hall found match after sending hat down upon floor with noise like drum with lighted candle returned to sitting room moth be to be seen yet once for moment seemed that thing be fluttering round head hapley very suddenly decided to give up moth go to bed be excited night long sleep be broken by dream of moth pawkins landlady twice in night turned out soused head in cold water one thing be very clear to landlady must not possibly understand about strange moth especially a have failed to catch one entomologist must understand quite how felt be probably frightened at behaviour yet failed to see how must explain decided to say nothing further about event of last night after breakfast saw in garden decided to go out talk to reassure talked to about bean potato bee caterpillar price of fruit replied in usual manner looked at little suspiciously kept walking a walked so that there be always bed of flower row of bean something of sort between after while began to feel singularly irritated at to conceal vexation went indoors presently went out for walk moth butterfly trailing odd flavour of pawkins with kept coming into walk though did best to keep mind off once saw quite distinctly with wing flattened out upon old stone wall run along west edge of park going up to found be only two lump of gray yellow lichen said hapley be reverse of mimicry instead of butterfly looking like stone here be stone looking like butterfly once something hovered fluttered round head by effort of will drove impression out of mind again in afternoon hapley called upon vicar argued with upon theological question sat in little arbour covered with brier smoked a wrangled look at moth said hapley suddenly pointing to edge of wooden table where said vicar dont see moth on edge of table there said hapley certainly not said vicar hapley be thunderstruck gasped vicar be staring at clearly man saw nothing eye of faith be better than eye of science said hapley awkwardly dont see point said vicar thinking be part of argument night hapley found moth crawling over counterpane sat on edge of bed in shirt sleeve reasoned with be pure hallucination knew be slipping battled for sanity with same silent energy have formerly displayed against pawkins so persistent be mental habit that felt a if be still struggle with pawkins be well versed in psychology knew that such visual illusion do come a result of mental strain point be did not only see moth have heard when touched edge of lamp shade afterwards when hit against wall have felt strike face in dark looked at be not at dreamlike perfectly clear solid looking in candle light saw hairy body short feathery antenn jointed leg even place where down be rubbed from wing suddenly felt angry with for being afraid of little insect landlady have got servant to sleep with night because be afraid to be alone in addition have locked door put chest of drawer against listened talked in whisper after have gone to bed nothing occurred to alarm about eleven have ventured to put candle out have dozed off to sleep woke up with start sat up in bed listening in darkness then heard slippered foot going to fro in hapleys room chair be overturned there be violent dab at wall then china mantel ornament smashed upon fender suddenly door of room opened heard upon landing clung to one listening seemed to be dancing upon staircase now must go down three four step quickly then up again then hurry down into hall heard umbrella stand go over fanlight break then bolt shot chain rattled be opening door hurried to window be dim gray night almost unbroken sheet of watery cloud be sweeping across moon hedge tree in front of house be black against pale roadway saw hapley looking like ghost in shirt white trouser running to fro in road beating air now must stop now must dart very rapidly at something invisible now must move upon with stealthy stride at last went out of sight up road towards down then while argued who must go down lock door returned be walking very fast came straight into house closed door carefully went quietly up to bedroom then everything be silent mr colville said hapley calling down staircase next morning hope did not alarm last night may well ask said mr colville fact be be sleep walker last two night have be without sleeping mixture there be nothing to be alarmed about really be sorry made as of myself will go over down to shoreham get stuff to make sleep soundly ought to have done yesterday half way over down by chalk pit moth came upon hapley again went on trying to keep mind upon chess problem be good thing fluttered into face struck at with hat in self defence then rage old rage rage have so often felt against pawkins came upon again went on leaping striking at eddying insect suddenly trod on nothing fell headlong there be gap in sensation hapley found sitting on heap of flint in front of opening of chalk pit with leg twisted back under strange moth be still fluttering round head struck at with hand turning head saw two men approaching one be village doctor occurred to hapley that be lucky then came into mind with extraordinary vividness that one must ever be able to see strange moth except that behoved to keep silent about late that night however after broken leg be set be feverish forgot self restraint be lying flat on bed began to run eye round room to see if moth be still about tried not to do be no good soon caught sight of thing resting close to hand by nightlight on green table cloth wing quivered with sudden wave of anger smote at with fist nurse woke up with shriek have missed that moth said then be fancy nothing time must see quite clearly insect going round cornice darting across room must also see that nurse saw nothing of looked at strangely must keep in hand knew be lost man if did not keep in hand a night waned fever grew upon very dread have of seeing moth made see about five just a dawn be gray tried to get out of bed catch though leg be afire with pain nurse have to struggle with on account of tied down to bed at moth grew bolder once felt settle in hair then because struck out violently with arm tied also at moth came crawled over face hapley wept swore screamed prayed for to take off unavailingly doctor be blockhead just qualified general practitioner quite ignorant of mental science simply said there be moth have possessed wit might still perhaps have saved hapley from fate by entering into delusion covering face with gauze a prayed might be done a say doctor be blockhead until leg be healed hapley be kept tied to bed with imaginary moth crawling over never left while be awake grew to monster in dream while be awake longed for sleep from sleep awoke screaming so now hapley be spending remainder of day in padded room worried by moth that one else can see asylum doctor call hallucination hapley when be in easier mood can talk say be ghost of pawkins consequently unique specimen well worth trouble of catching footnote remark on recent revision of microlepidoptera quart journ entomological soc rejoinder to certain remark etc ibid further remark etc ibid story of late mr elvesham set story down not expecting will be believed if possible to

progression what be be indeed immaterial vague persuasion of body gathering about came into suspense abysmal darkness about hand filled with impalpable suggestion with uncertain fluctuating shape then suddenly came sound like sound of tolling bell faint a if infinitely far muffled a though heard through thick swathing of darkness deep vibrating resonance with vast gulf of silence between stroke hand appeared to tighten on rod saw far above hand towards apex of darkness circle of dim phosphorescence ghostly sphere whence sound came throbbing at last stroke hand vanished for hour have come heard noise of many water black rod remained a great band across sky then voice seemed to run to uttermost part of space spoke saying there will be no more pain at almost intolerable gladness radiance rushed in upon saw circle shining white bright rod black shining many thing else distinct clear circle be face of clock rod rail of bed haddon be standing at foot against rail with small pair of scissors on finger hand of clock on mantel over shoulder be clasped together over hour of twelve mowbray be washing something in basin at octagonal table at side felt subdued feeling must scarce be spoken of a pain operation have not killed perceived suddenly that dull melancholy of year be lifted from mind plattner story whether story of gottfried plattner be to be credited not be pretty question in value of evidence on one hand have seven witness to be perfectly exact have six half pair of eye one undeniable fact on other have what be prejudice common sense inertia of opinion never be there seven more honest seeming witness never be there more undeniable fact than inversion of gottfried plattners anatomical structure never be there more preposterous story than one have to tell most preposterous part of story be worthy gottfrieds contribution for count a one of seven heaven forbid must be led into giving countenance to superstition by passion for impartiality so come to share fate of eusapias patron frankly believe there be something crooked about business of gottfried plattner what that crooked factor be will admit a frankly know have be surprised at credit accorded to story in most unexpected authoritative quarter fairest way to reader however will be for to tell without further comment gottfried plattner be in spite of name freeborn englishman father be alsatian who came to england in sixty married respectable english girl of unexceptional antecedent died after wholesome uneventful life devoted understand chiefly to laying of parquet flooring in gottfrieds age be seven twenty be by virtue of heritage of three language modern language master in small private school in south of england to casual observer be singularly like other modern language master in other small private school costume be very costly very fashionable on other hand be not markedly cheap shabby complexion like height bearing be inconspicuous must notice perhaps that like majority of people face be not absolutely symmetrical right eye little larger than left jaw trifle heavier on right side if a ordinary careless person be to bare chest feel heart beating must probably find quite like heart of one else here trained observer must part company if found heart quite ordinary trained observer must find quite otherwise once thing be pointed out to too must perceive peculiarity easily enough be that gottfrieds heart beat on right side of body now be not only singularity of gottfrieds structure although be only one must appeal to untrained mind careful sounding of gottfrieds internal arrangement by well known surgeon seems to point to fact that other unsymmetrical part of body be similarly misplaced right lobe of liver be on left side left on right while lung too be similarly contraposed what be still more singular unless gottfried be consummate actor must believe that right hand have recently become left since occurrence be about to consider a impartially a possible have found utmost difficulty in writing except from right to left across paper with left hand can not throw with right hand be perplexed at meal time between knife fork idea of rule of road be cyclist be still dangerous confusion there be not scrap of evidence to show that before occurrence gottfried be at left handed there be yet wonderful fact in preposterous business gottfried produce three photograph of have at age of five six thrusting fat leg at from under plaid frock scowling in photograph left eye be little larger than right jaw be trifle heavier on left side be reverse of present living condition photograph of gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict fact be because be one of cheap gem photograph be then in vogue taken direct upon metal therefore reversing thing just a looking glass must third photograph represents at one twenty confirms record of others there seems here evidence of strongest confirmatory character gottfried have exchanged left side for right yet how human being can be so changed short of fantastic pointless miracle be exceedingly hard to suggest in one way of course fact might be explicable on supposition that plattner have undertaken elaborate mystification on strength of heart displacement photograph may be faked left handedness imitated character of man doe not lend to such theory be quiet practical unobtrusive thoroughly sane from nordau standpoint like beer smoke moderately take walking exercise daily have healthily high estimate of value of teaching have good untrained tenor voice take pleasure in singing air of popular cheerful character be fond not morbidly fond of reading chiefly fiction pervaded with vaguely pious optimism sleep well rarely dream be in fact very last person to evolve fantastic fable indeed so far from forcing story upon world have be singularly reticent on matter meet inquirer with certain engaging bashfulness be almost word disarms most suspicious seems genuinely ashamed that anything so unusual have occurred to be to be regretted that plattners aversion to idea of post mortem dissection may postpone perhaps for ever positive proof that entire body have have left right side transposed upon fact mainly credibility of story hang there be way of taking man moving about in space a ordinary people understand space will result in changing side do right be still right left left can do with perfectly thin flat thing of course if be to cut figure out of paper figure with right left side must change side simply by lifting up turning over with solid be different mathematical theorist tell that only way in right left side of solid body can be changed be by taking that body clean out of space a know taking out of ordinary existence be turning somewhere outside space be little abstruse doubt one with knowledge of mathematical theory will assure reader of truth to put thing in technical language curious inversion of plattners right left side be proof that have moved out of space into what be called fourth dimension that have returned again to world unless choose to consider victim of elaborate motiveless fabrication be almost bound to believe that have occurred so much for tangible fact come now to account of phenomenon attended temporary disappearance from world appears that in sussexville proprietary school plattner not only discharged duty of modern language master also taught chemistry commercial geography bookkeeping shorthand drawing other additional subject to changing fancy of boy parent might direct attention knew little nothing of various subject in secondary a distinguished from board elementary school knowledge in teacher be very properly by mean so necessary a high moral character gentlemanly tone in chemistry be particularly deficient knowing say nothing beyond three gas three gas may be a however pupil began by knowing nothing derived information from caused one little inconvenience for several term then little boy named whibble joined school who have be educated seems by mischievous relative into inquiring habit of mind little boy followed plattners lesson with marked sustained interest in order to exhibit zeal on subject brought at various time substance for plattner to analyse plattner flattered by evidence of power of awakening interest trusting to boy ignorance analysed even made general statement a to composition indeed be so far stimulated by pupil a to obtain work upon analytical chemistry study during supervision of evening preparation be surprised to find chemistry quite interesting subject so far story be absolutely commonplace now greenish powder come upon scene source of greenish powder seems unfortunately lost master whibble tell tortuous story of finding done up in packet in disused limekiln near down must have be excellent thing for plattner possibly for master whibbles family if match must have be applied to powder there then young gentleman certainly did not bring to school in packet in common eight ounce graduated medicine bottle plugged with masticated newspaper gave to plattner at end of afternoon school four boy have be detained after school prayer in order to complete neglected task plattner be supervising in small class room in chemical teaching be conducted appliance for practical teaching of chemistry in sussexville proprietary school a in most small school in country be characterised by severe simplicity be kept in small cupboard standing in recess having about same capacity a common travelling trunk plattner being bored with passive superintendence seems to have welcomed intervention of whibble with green powder a agreeable diversion unlocking cupboard proceeded at once with analytical experiment whibble sat luckily for at safe distance regarding four malefactor feigning profound absorption in work watched furtively with keenest interest for even within limit of three gas plattners practical chemistry be understand temerarious be practically unanimous in account of plattners proceeding poured little of green powder into test tube tried substance with water hydrochloric acid nitric acid sulphuric acid in succession getting result emptied out little heap nearly bottleful in fact upon slate tried match held medicine bottle in left hand stuff began to smoke melt then exploded with deafening violence blinding flash five boy seeing flash being prepared for catastrophe ducked below desk be none of seriously hurt window be blown out into playground blackboard on easel be upset slate be smashed to atom plaster fell from ceiling other damage be done to school edifice appliance boy at first seeing nothing of plattner fancied be knocked down lying out of sight below desk jumped out of place to go to assistance be amazed to find space empty being still confused by sudden violence of report hurried to open door under impression that must have be hurt have rushed out of room carson foremost nearly collided in doorway with principal mr lidgett mr lidgett be corpulent excitable man with one eye boy describe a stumbling into room mouthing of tempered expletive irritable schoolmaster accustom to use lest worse befall wretched mumchancer said wheres mr plattner boy be agreed on very word wobbler snivelling puppy mumchancer be seems among ordinary small change of mr lidgetts scholastic commerce wheres mr plattner be question be to be repeated many time in next few day really seemed a though frantic hyperbole blown to atom have for once realised there be not visible particle of plattner to be seen not drop of blood stitch of clothing to be found apparently have be blown clean out of existence left not wrack behind not so much a must cover sixpenny piece to quote proverbial expression evidence of absolute disappearance a consequence of explosion be indubitable be not necessary to enlarge here upon commotion excited in sussexville proprietary school in sussexville elsewhere by event be quite possible indeed that of reader of page may recall hearing of remote dying version of excitement during last summer holiday lidgett must seem did everything in power to suppress minimise story instituted penalty of twenty five line for mention of plattners name among boy stated in schoolroom that be clearly aware of assistant whereabouts be afraid explains that possibility of explosion happening in spite of elaborate precaution taken to minimise practical teaching of chemistry might injure reputation of school so might mysterious quality in plattners departure indeed did everything in power to make occurrence seem a ordinary a possible in particular cross examined five eye witness of occurrence so searchingly that began to doubt plain evidence of sens in spite of effort tale in magnified distorted state made nine day wonder in district several parent withdrew son on colourable pretext not least remarkable point in matter be fact that large number of people in neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dream of plattner during period of excitement before return that dream have curious uniformity in almost of plattner be seen sometimes singly sometimes in company wandering about through coruscating iridescence in case face be pale distressed in gesticulated towards dreamer one two of boy evidently under influence of nightmare fancied that plattner approached with remarkable swiftness seemed to look closely into very eye others fled with plattner from pursuit of vague extraordinary creature of globular shape fancy be forgotten in inquiry speculation when on wednesday next one after monday of explosion plattner returned circumstance of return be a singular a of departure so far a mr lidgetts somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from plattners hesitating statement must appear that on wednesday evening towards hour of sunset former gentleman having dismissed evening preparation be engaged in garden picking eating strawberry fruit of be inordinately fond be large old fashioned garden secured from observation fortunately by high ivy covered red brick wall just a be stooping over particularly prolific plant there be flash in air heavy thud before must look round heavy body struck violently from behind be pitched forward crushing strawberry held in hand that so roughly that silk hat mr lidgett adheres to older idea of scholastic costume be driven violently down upon forehead almost over one eye heavy missile slid over sideways collapsed into sitting posture among strawberry plant proved to be long lost mr gottfried plattner in extremely dishevelled condition be collarless hatless linen be dirty there be blood upon hand mr lidgett be so indignant surprised that remained on four with hat jammed down on eye while expostulated vehemently with plattner for disrespectful unaccountable conduct scarcely idyllic scene completes what may call exterior version of plattner story exoteric aspect be quite unnecessary to enter here into detail of dismissal by mr lidgett such detail with full name date reference will be found in larger report of occurrence be laid before society for investigation of abnormal phenomenon singular transposition of plattners right left side be scarcely observed for first day so then first in connection with disposition to write from right to left across blackboard concealed rather than ostended curious confirmatory circumstance a considered must unfavourably affect prospect in new situation displacement of heart be discovered month after when be having tooth extracted under ansthetics then very unwillingly allowed cursory surgical examination to be made of with view to brief account in journal of anatomy exhaust statement of material fact may now go on to consider plattners account of matter first let clearly differentiate between preceding portion of story what be to follow have told thus far be established by such evidence a even criminal lawyer must approve one of witness be still alive reader if have leisure may hunt lad out to morrow even brave terror of redoubtable lidgett cross examine trap test to heart content gottfried plattner twisted heart three photograph be producible may be taken a proved that did disappear for nine day a consequence of explosion that returned almost a violently under circumstance in nature annoying to mr lidgett detail of circumstance may be that returned inverted just a reflection return from mirror from last fact a have already stated follows almost inevitably that plattner during nine day must have be in state of existence altogether out of space evidence to statement be indeed far stronger than upon most murderer be hanged for own particular account of where have be with confused explanation wellnigh self contradictory detail have only mr gottfried plattners word wish to discredit must point out what so many writer upon obscure psychic phenomenon fail to do that be passing here from practically undeniable to kind of matter reasonable man be entitled to believe reject a think proper previous statement render plausible discordance with common experience tilt towards incredible must prefer not to sway beam of reader judgment way simply to tell story a plattner told to gave narrative may state at house at chislehurst so soon a have left that evening went into study wrote down everything a remembered subsequently be good enough to read over typewritten copy so that substantial correctness be undeniable state that at moment of explosion distinctly thought be killed felt lifted off foot driven forcibly backward be curious fact for psychologist that thought clearly during backward flight wondered whether must hit chemistry cupboard blackboard easel heel struck ground staggered fell heavily into sitting position on something soft firm for moment concussion stunned became aware at once of vivid scent of singed hair seemed to hear voice of lidgett asking for will understand for time mind be greatly confused at first be under impression that be still standing in class room perceived quite distinctly surprise of boy entry of mr lidgett be quite positive upon score did not hear remark that ascribed to deafening effect of experiment thing about seemed curiously dark faint mind explained that on obvious mistaken idea that explosion have engendered huge volume of dark smoke through dimness figure of lidgett boy moved a faint silent a ghost plattners face still tingled with stinging heat of flash be say muddled first definite thought seem to have be of personal safety thought be perhaps blinded deafened felt limb face in gingerly manner then perception grew clearer be astonished to miss old familiar desk other schoolroom furniture about only dim uncertain gray shape stood in place of then came thing made shout aloud awoke stunned faculty to instant activity two of boy gesticulating walked one after other clean through neither manifested slightest consciousness of presence be difficult to imagine sensation felt came against say with more force than wisp of mist plattners first thought after be that be dead having be brought up with thoroughly sound view in matter however be little surprised to find body still about second conclusion be that be not dead that others be that explosion have destroyed sussexville proprietary school soul in except that too be scarcely satisfactory be thrown back upon astonished observation everything about be profoundly dark at first seemed to have altogether ebony blackness overhead be black firmament only touch of light in scene be faint greenish glow at edge of sky in one direction threw into prominence horizon of undulating black hill say be impression at first a eye grew accustomed to darkness began to distinguish faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in circumambient night against background furniture occupant of class room seems stood out like phosphorescent spectre faint impalpable extended hand thrust without effort through wall of room by fireplace describes a making strenuous effort to attract attention shouted to lidgett tried to seize boy a went to fro only desisted from attempt when mr lidgett whom a assistant master naturally disliked entered room say sensation of being in world yet not part of be extraordinarily disagreeable one compared feeling not inaptly to of cat watching mouse through window whenever made motion to communicate with dim familiar world about found invisible incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse then turned attention to solid environment found medicine bottle still unbroken in hand with remainder of green powder therein put in pocket began to feel about apparently be sitting on boulder of rock covered with velvety moss dark country about be unable to see faint misty picture of schoolroom blotting out have feeling due perhaps to cold wind that be near crest of hill that steep valley fell away beneath foot green glow along edge of sky seemed to be growing in extent intensity stood up rubbing eye must seem that made few step going steeply downhill then stumbled nearly fell sat down again upon jagged mass of rock to watch dawn became aware that world about be absolutely silent be a still a be dark though there be cold wind blowing up hill face rustle of grass soughing of bough must have accompanied be absent must hear therefore if must not see that hillside upon stood be rocky desolate green grew brighter moment a did so faint transparent blood red mingled with did not mitigate blackness of sky overhead rocky desolation about having regard to what follows be inclined to think that redness may have be optical effect due to contrast something black fluttered momentarily against livid yellow green of lower sky then thin penetrating voice of bell rose out of black gulf below oppressive expectation grew with growing light be probable that hour more elapsed while sat there strange green light growing brighter moment spreading slowly in flamboyant finger upward towards zenith a grew spectral vision of world became relatively absolutely fainter probably for time must have be about of earthly sunset so far a vision of world went plattner by few step downhill have passed through floor of class room be now seemed sitting in mid air in larger schoolroom downstairs saw boarder distinctly much more faintly than have seen lidgett be preparing evening task noticed with interest that several be cheating with euclid rider by mean of crib compilation whose existence have hitherto never suspected a time passed faded steadily a steadily a light of green dawn increased looking down into valley saw that light have crept far down rocky side that profound blackness of abyss be now broken by minute green glow like light of glow worm almost immediately limb of huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over basaltic undulation of distant hill monstrous hill mass about came out gaunt desolate in green light deep ruddy black shadow became aware of vast number of ball shaped object drifting a thistledown drift over high ground there be none of nearer to than opposite side of gorge bell below twanged quicker quicker with something like impatient insistence several light moved hither thither boy at work at desk be now almost imperceptibly faint extinction of world when green sun of other universe rose be curious point upon plattner insists during other world night be difficult to move about on account of vividness with thing of world be visible becomes riddle to explain why if be case in world catch glimpse of other world be due perhaps to comparatively vivid illumination of world of ours plattner describes midday of other world at brightest a not being nearly so bright a world at full moon while night be profoundly black consequently amount of light even in ordinary dark room be sufficient to render thing of other world invisible on same principle that faint phosphorescence be only visible in profoundest darkness have tried since told story to see something of other world by sitting for long space in photographer dark room at night have certainly seen indistinctly form of greenish slope rock only must admit very indistinctly indeed reader may possibly be more successful plattner tell that since return have dreamt seen recognised place in other world be probably due to memory of scene seems quite possible that people with unusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch glimpse of strange other world about however be digression a green sun rose long street of black building became perceptible though only darkly indistinctly in gorge after hesitation plattner began to clamber down precipitous descent towards descent be long exceedingly tedious being so not only by extraordinary steepness also by reason of looseness of boulder with whole face of hill be strewn noise of descent now then heel struck fire from rock seemed now only sound in universe for beating of bell have ceased a drew nearer perceived that various edifice have singular resemblance to tomb mausoleum monument saving only that be uniformly black instead of being white a most sepulchre be then saw crowding out of largest building very much a people disperse from church number of pallid rounded pale green figure dispersed in several direction about broad street of place going through side alley reappearing upon steepness of hill others entering of small black building lined way at sight of thing drifting up towards plattner stopped staring be not walking be indeed limbless have appearance of human head beneath tadpole like body swung be too astonished at strangeness too full indeed of strangeness to be seriously alarmed by drove towards in front of chill wind be blowing uphill much a soap bubble drive before draught a looked at nearest of approaching saw be indeed human head albeit with singularly large eye wearing such expression of distress anguish a have never seen before upon mortal countenance be surprised to find that did not turn to regard seemed to be watching following unseen moving thing for moment be puzzled then occurred to that creature be watching with enormous eye something be happening in world have just left nearer came nearer be too astonished to cry out made very faint fretting sound a came close to then struck face with gentle pat touch be very cold drove past upward towards crest of hill extraordinary conviction flashed across plattners mind that head have strong likeness to lidgett then turned attention to other head be now swarming thickly up hill side none made slightest sign of recognition one two indeed came close to head almost followed example of first dodged convulsively out of way upon most of saw same expression of unavailing regret have seen upon first heard same faint sound of wretchedness from one two wept one rolling swiftly uphill wore expression of diabolical rage others be cold several have look of gratified interest in eye one at least be almost in ecstasy of happiness plattner doe not remember that recognised more likeness in saw at time for several hour perhaps plattner watched strange thing dispersing over hill not till long after have ceased to issue from clustering black building in gorge did resume downward climb darkness about increased so much that have difficulty in stepping true overhead sky be now bright pale green felt hunger thirst later when did found chilly stream running down centre of gorge rare moss upon boulder when tried at last in desperation be good to eat groped about among tomb ran down gorge seeking vaguely for clue to inexplicable thing after long time came to entrance of big mausoleum like building from head have issued in found group of green light burning upon kind of basaltic altar bell rope from belfry overhead hanging down into centre of place round wall ran lettering of fire in character unknown to while be still wondering at purport of thing heard receding tramp of heavy foot echoing far down street ran out into darkness again must see nothing have mind to pull bell rope finally decided to follow footstep although ran far never overtook shouting be of avail gorge seemed to extend interminable distance be a dark a earthly starlight throughout length while ghastly green day lay along upper edge of precipice there be none of head now below be seemed busily occupied along upper slope looking up saw drifting hither thither hovering stationary flying swiftly through air reminded said of big snowflake only be black pale green in pursuing firm undeviating footstep that never overtook in groping into new region of endless devil dyke in clambering up down pitiless height in wandering about summit in watching drifting face plattner state that spent better part of seven eight day did not keep count say though once twice found eye watching have word with living soul slept among rock on hillside in gorge thing earthly be invisible because from earthly standpoint be far underground on altitude so soon a earthly day began world became visible to found sometimes stumbling over dark green rock arresting on precipitous brink while about green branch of sussexville lane be swaying again seemed to be walking through sussexville street watching unseen private business of household then be discovered that to almost human being in world there pertained of drifting head one in world be watched intermittently by helpless disembodiments what be watcher of living plattner never learned two presently found followed be like childhood memory of father mother now then other face turned eye upon eye like of dead people who have swayed injured helped in youth manhood whenever looked at plattner be overcome with strange sense of responsibility to mother ventured to speak made answer looked sadly steadfastly tenderly little reproachfully too seemed into eye simply tell story doe not endeavour to explain be left to surmise who watcher of living may be if be indeed dead why must so closely passionately watch world have left for ever may be indeed to mind seems just when life have closed when evil good be no longer choice for may still have to witness working out of train of consequence have laid if human soul continue after death then surely human interest continue after death be merely own guess at meaning of thing seen plattner offer interpretation for none be given be well reader must understand clearly day after day with head reeling wandered about strange lit world outside world weary towards end weak hungry by day by earthly day be ghostly vision of old familiar scenery of sussexville about irked worried must not see where to put foot ever again with chilly touch one of watching soul must come against face after dark multitude of watcher about intent distress confused mind beyond describing great longing to return to earthly life be so near yet so remote consumed unearthliness of thing about produced positively painful mental distress be worried beyond describing by own particular follower must shout at to desist from staring at scold at hurry away from be always mute intent run a might over uneven ground followed destiny on ninth day towards evening plattner heard invisible footstep approaching far away down gorge be then wandering over broad crest of same hill upon have fallen in entry into strange other world of turned to hurry down into gorge feeling way hastily be arrested by sight of thing be happening in room in back street near school of people in room knew by sight window be open blind up setting sun shone clearly into so that came out quite brightly at first vivid oblong of room lying like magic lantern picture upon black landscape livid green dawn in addition to sunlight candle have just be lit in room on bed lay lank man ghastly white face terrible upon tumbled pillow clenched hand be raised above head little table beside bed carried few medicine bottle toast water empty glass now then lank man lip fell apart to indicate word must not articulate woman did not notice that wanted anything because be busy turning out paper from old fashioned bureau in opposite corner of room at first picture be very vivid indeed a green dawn behind grew brighter brighter so became fainter more more transparent a echoing footstep paced nearer nearer footstep sound so loud in other world come so silently in plattner perceived about great multitude of dim face gathering together out of darkness watching two people in room never before have seen so many of watcher of living multitude have eye only for sufferer in room multitude in infinite anguish watched woman a hunted with greedy eye for something must not find crowded about plattner came across sight buffeted face noise of unavailing regret be about saw clearly only now then at other time picture quivered dimly through veil of green reflection upon movement in room must have be very still plattner say candle flame streamed up into perfectly vertical line of smoke in ear footfall echo beat like clap of thunder face two more particularly near woman one woman also white clear featured face might have once be cold hard be now softened by touch of wisdom strange to earth other might have be woman father be evidently absorbed in contemplation of act of hateful meanness so seemed must no longer guard against prevent behind be others teacher may be who have taught ill friend whose influence have failed over man too multitude none seemed to be parent teacher face might once have be coarse now purged to strength by sorrow in forefront one face girlish one angry remorseful merely patient weary a seemed to plattner waiting for relief power of description fail at memory of multitude of ghastly countenance gathered on stroke of bell saw in space of second must seem that be so worked on by excitement that quite involuntarily restless finger took bottle of green powder out of pocket held before doe not remember that abruptly footstep ceased waited for next there be silence then suddenly cutting through unexpected stillness like keen thin blade came first stroke of bell at that multitudinous face swayed to fro louder cry began about woman did not hear be burning something now in candle flame at second stroke everything grew dim breath of wind icy cold blew through host of watcher swirled about like eddy of dead leaf in spring at third stroke something be extended through to bed have heard of beam of light be like beam of darkness looking again at plattner saw that be shadowy arm hand green sun be now topping black desolation of horizon vision of room be very faint plattner must see that white of bed struggled be convulsed that woman looked round over shoulder at startled cloud of watcher lifted high like puff of green dust before wind swept swiftly downward towards temple in gorge then suddenly plattner understood meaning of shadowy black arm stretched across shoulder clutched prey did not dare turn head to see shadow behind arm with violent effort covering eye set to run made perhaps twenty stride then slipped on boulder fell fell forward on hand bottle smashed exploded a touched ground in moment found stunned bleeding sitting face to face with lidgett in old walled garden behind school there story of plattners experience end have resisted believe successfully natural disposition of writer of fiction to dress up incident of sort have told thing a far a possible in order in plattner told to have carefully avoided attempt at style effect construction must have be easy for instance to have worked scene of death bed into kind of plot in plattner might have be involved quite apart from objectionableness of falsifying most extraordinary true story such trite device must spoil to mind peculiar effect of dark world with livid green illumination drifting watcher of living unseen unapproachable to be yet lying about remains to add that death did actually occur in vincent terrace just beyond school garden so far a can be proved at moment of plattners return deceased be rate collector insurance agent widow who be much younger than married last month mr whymper veterinary surgeon of allbeeding a portion of story given here have in various form circulated orally in sussexville have consented to use of name on condition make distinctly known that emphatically contradicts detail of plattners account of husband last moment burnt will say although plattner never accused of doing so husband made one will just after marriage certainly from man who have never seen plattners account of furniture of room be curiously accurate one other thing even at risk of irksome repetition must insist upon lest seem to favour credulous superstitious view plattners absence from world for nine day be think proved that doe not prove story be quite conceivable that even outside space hallucination may be possible that at least reader must bear distinctly in mind crystal egg there be until year ago little very grimy looking shop near seven dial over in weatherworn yellow lettering name of c cave naturalist dealer in antiquity be inscribed content of window be curiously variegated comprised elephant tusk imperfect set of chessman bead weapon box of eye two skull of tiger one human several moth eaten stuffed monkey one holding lamp old fashioned cabinet fly blown ostrich egg so fishing tackle extraordinarily dirty empty glass fish tank there be also at moment story begin mass of crystal worked into shape of egg brilliantly polished at two people who stood outside window be looking one of tall thin clergyman other black bearded young man of dusky complexion unobtrusive costume dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation seemed anxious for companion to purchase article while be there mr cave came into shop beard still wagging with bread butter of tea when saw men object of regard countenance fell glanced guiltily over shoulder softly shut door be little old man with pale face peculiar watery blue eye hair be dirty gray wore shabby blue frock coat ancient silk hat carpet slipper very much down at heel remained watching two men a talked clergyman went deep into trouser pocket examined handful of money showed teeth in agreeable smile mr cave seemed still more depressed when came into shop clergyman without ceremony asked price of crystal egg mr cave glanced nervously towards door leading into parlour said five pound clergyman protested that price be high to companion a well a to mr cave be indeed very much more than mr cave have intended to ask when have stocked article attempt at bargaining ensued mr cave stepped to shop door held open five pound be price said a though wished to save trouble of unprofitable discussion a did so upper portion of woman face appeared above blind in glass upper panel of door leading into parlour stared curiously at two customer five pound be price said mr cave with quiver in voice swarthy young man have so far remained spectator watching cave keenly now spoke give five pound said clergyman glanced at to see if be in earnest when looked at mr cave again saw that latter face be white lot of money said clergyman diving into pocket began counting resource have little more than thirty shilling appealed to companion with whom seemed to be on term of considerable intimacy gave mr cave opportunity of collecting thought began to explain in agitated manner that crystal be not a matter of fact entirely free for sale two customer be naturally surprised at inquired why have not thought of before began to bargain mr cave became confused stuck to story that crystal be not in market afternoon that probable purchaser of have already appeared two treating a attempt to raise price still further made a if must leave shop at point parlour door opened owner of dark fringe little eye appeared be coarse featured corpulent woman younger very much larger than mr cave walked heavily face be flushed that crystal be for sale said five pound be good enough price for cant think what youre about cave not to take gentleman offer mr cave greatly perturbed by irruption looked angrily at over rim of spectacle without excessive assurance asserted right to manage business in own way altercation began two customer watched scene with interest amusement occasionally assisting mr cave with suggestion mr cave hard driven persisted in confused impossible story of inquiry for crystal that morning agitation became painful stuck to point with extraordinary persistence be young oriental who ended curious controversy proposed that must call again in course of two day so a to give alleged inquirer fair chance then must insist said clergyman five pound mr cave took on to apologise for husband explaining that be sometimes little odd a two customer left couple prepared for free discussion of incident in bearing mr cave talked to husband with singular directness poor little man quivering with emotion muddled between story maintaining on one hand that have customer in view on other asserting that crystal be honestly worth ten guinea why did ask five pound said wife do let manage business own way said mr cave mr cave have living with stepdaughter stepson at supper night transaction be re discussed none of have high opinion of mr cave business method action seemed culminating folly opinion he refused that crystal before said stepson loose limbed lout of eighteen five pound said stepdaughter argumentative young woman of six twenty mr cave answer be wretched must only mumble weak assertion that knew own business best drove from half eaten supper into shop to close for night ear aflame tear of vexation behind spectacle why have left crystal in window so long folly of be trouble closest in mind for time must see way of evading sale after supper stepdaughter stepson smartened up went out wife retired upstairs to reflect upon business aspect of crystal over little sugar lemon so forth in hot water mr cave went into shop stayed there until late ostensibly to make ornamental rockery for gold fish case really for private purpose will be better explained later next day mr cave found that crystal have be removed from window be lying behind second hand book on angling replaced in conspicuous position did not argue further about a nervous headache disinclined from debate mr cave be always disinclined day passed disagreeably mr cave be if anything more absent minded than usual uncommonly irritable withal in afternoon when wife be taking customary sleep removed crystal from window again next day mr cave have to deliver consignment of dog fish at one of hospital school where be needed for dissection in absence mr cave mind reverted to topic of crystal method of expenditure suitable to windfall of five pound have already devised very agreeable expedient among others dress of green silk for herself trip to richmond when jangling of front door bell summoned into shop customer be examination coach who came to complain of non delivery of certain frog asked for previous day mr cave did not approve of particular branch of mr cave business gentleman who have called in somewhat aggressive mood retired after brief exchange of word entirely civil so far a be concerned mr cave eye then naturally turned to window for sight of crystal be assurance of five pound of dream what be surprise to find gone went to place behind locker on counter where have discovered day before be not there immediately began eager search about shop when mr cave returned from business with dogfish about quarter to two in afternoon found shop in confusion wife extremely exasperated on knee behind counter routing among taxidermic material face came up hot angry over counter a jangling bell announced return forthwith accused of hiding hid what asked mr cave crystal at mr cave apparently much surprised rushed to window isnt here said great heaven what have become of just then mr cave stepson re entered shop from inner room have come home minute so before mr cave be blaspheming freely be apprenticed to second hand furniture dealer down road have meal at home be naturally annoyed to find dinner ready when heard of loss of crystal forgot meal anger be diverted from mother to first idea of course be that have hidden mr cave stoutly denied knowledge of fate freely offering bedabbled affidavit in matter at last be worked up to point of accusing first wife then stepson of having taken with view to private sale so began exceedingly acrimonious emotional discussion ended for mr cave in peculiar nervous condition midway between hysteric amuck caused stepson to be hour late at furniture establishment in afternoon mr cave took refuge from wife emotion in shop in evening matter be resumed with le passion in judicial spirit under presidency of stepdaughter supper passed unhappily culminated in painful scene mr cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation went out banging front door violently rest of family having discussed with freedom absence warranted hunted house from garret to cellar hoping to light upon crystal next day two customer called again be received by mr cave almost in tear transpired that one must imagine that have stood from cave at various time in married pilgrimage also gave garbled account of disappearance clergyman oriental laughed silently at one said be very extraordinary a mr cave seemed disposed to give complete history of life made to leave shop thereupon mr cave still clinging to hope asked for clergyman address so that if must get anything out of cave might communicate address be duly given apparently be afterwards mislaid mr cave can remember nothing about in evening of day cave seem to have exhausted emotion mr cave who have be out in afternoon supped in gloomy isolation contrasted pleasantly with impassioned controversy of previous day for time matter be very badly strained in cave household crystal customer reappeared now without mincing matter must admit that mr cave be liar knew perfectly well where crystal be be in room of mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator at st catherine hospital westbourne street stood on sideboard partially covered by black velvet cloth beside decanter of american whisky be from mr wace indeed that particular upon narrative be based be derived cave have taken off thing to hospital hidden in dog fish sack there have pressed young investigator to keep for mr wace be little dubious at first relationship to cave be peculiar have taste for singular character have more than once invited old man to smoke drink in room to unfold rather amusing view of life in general of wife in particular mr wace have encountered mr cave too on occasion when mr cave be not at home to attend to knew constant interference to cave be subjected having weighed story judicially decided to give crystal refuge mr cave promised to explain reason for remarkable affection for crystal more fully on later occasion spoke distinctly of seeing vision therein called on mr wace same evening told complicated story crystal said have come into possession with other oddment at forced sale of curiosity dealer effect not knowing what value might be have ticketed at ten shilling have hung upon hand at price for month be thinking of reducing figure when made singular discovery at time health be very bad must be borne in mind that throughout experience physical condition be one of ebb be in considerable distress by reason of negligence positive ill treatment even received from wife stepchild wife be vain extravagant unfeeling have growing taste for private drinking stepdaughter be mean over reaching stepson have conceived violent dislike for lost chance of showing requirement of business pressed heavily upon mr wace doe not think that be altogether free from occasional intemperance have begun life in comfortable position be man of fair education suffered for week at stretch from melancholia insomnia afraid to disturb family must slip quietly from wife side when thought became intolerable wander about house about three oclock one morning late in august chance directed into shop dirty little place be impenetrably black except in one spot where perceived unusual glow of light approaching discovered to be crystal egg be standing on corner of counter towards window thin ray smote through crack in shutter impinged upon object seemed a be to fill entire interior occurred to mr cave that be not in accordance with law of optic a have known in younger day must understand ray being refracted by crystal coming to focus in interior diffusion jarred with physical conception approached crystal nearly peering into round with transient revival of scientific curiosity that in youth have determined choice of calling be surprised to find light not steady writhing within substance of egg a though object be hollow sphere of luminous vapour in moving about to get different point of view suddenly found that have come between ray that crystal none le remained luminous greatly astonished lifted out of light ray carried to darkest part of shop remained bright for four five minute when slowly faded went out placed in thin streak of daylight luminousness be almost immediately restored so far at least mr wace be able to verify remarkable story of mr cave have repeatedly held crystal in ray of light have to be of le diameter than one millimetre in perfect darkness such a must be produced by velvet wrapping crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent must seem however that luminousness be of exceptional sort not equally visible to eye for mr harbinger whose name will be familiar to scientific reader in connection with pasteur institute be quite unable to see light mr waces own capacity for appreciation be out of comparison inferior to of mr cave even with mr cave power varied very considerably vision be most vivid during state of extreme weakness fatigue now from outset light in crystal exercised curious fascination upon mr cave say more for loneliness of soul than volume of pathetic writing must do that told human being of curious observation seems to have be living in such atmosphere of petty spite to admit existence of pleasure must have be to risk loss of found that a dawn advanced amount of diffused light increased crystal became to appearance non luminous for time be unable to see anything in except at night time in dark corner of shop use of old velvet cloth used a background for collection of mineral occurred to by doubling putting over head hand be able to get sight of luminous movement within crystal even in day time be very cautious lest must be thus discovered by wife practised occupation only in afternoon while be asleep upstairs then circumspectly in hollow under counter one day turning crystal about in hand saw something came went like flash gave impression that object have for moment opened to view of wide spacious strange country turning about did just a light faded see same vision again now must be tedious unnecessary to state phase of mr cave discovery from point suffice that effect be crystal being peered into at angle of about degree from direction of illuminating ray gave clear consistent picture of wide peculiar countryside be not dream like at produced definite impression of reality better light more real solid seemed be moving picture be to say certain object moved in slowly in orderly manner like real thing according a direction of lighting vision changed picture changed also must indeed have be like looking through oval glass at view turning glass about to get at different aspect mr cave statement mr wace assures be extremely circumstantial entirely free from of emotional quality taint hallucinatory impression must be remembered that effort of mr wace to see similar clarity in faint opalescence of crystal be wholly unsuccessful try a must difference in intensity of impression received by two men be very great be quite conceivable that what be view to mr cave be mere blurred nebulosity to mr view a mr cave described be invariably of extensive plain seemed always to be looking at from considerable height a if from tower mast to east to west plain be bounded at remote distance by vast reddish cliff reminded of have seen in picture what picture be mr wace be unable to ascertain cliff passed north south must tell point of compass by star be visible of night receding in almost illimitable perspective fading into mist of distance before met be nearer eastern set of cliff on occasion of first vision sun be rising over black against sunlight pale against shadow appeared multitude of soaring form mr cave regarded a bird vast range of building spread below seemed to be looking down upon a approached blurred refracted edge of picture became indistinct there be also tree curious in shape in colouring deep mossy green exquisite gray beside wide shining canal something great brilliantly coloured flew across picture first time mr cave saw picture saw only in flash hand shook head moved vision came went grew foggy indistinct at first have greatest difficulty in finding picture again once direction of be lost next clear vision came about week after first interval having yielded nothing tantalising glimpse useful experience showed view down length of valley view be different have curious persuasion subsequent observation abundantly confirmed that be regarding strange world from exactly same spot although be looking in different direction long faade of great building whose roof have looked down upon before be now receding in perspective recognised roof in front of faade be terrace of massive proportion extraordinary length down middle of terrace at certain interval stood huge very graceful mast bearing small shiny object reflected setting sun import of small object did not occur to mr cave until time after a be describing scene to mr wace terrace overhung thicket of most luxuriant graceful vegetation beyond be wide grassy lawn on certain broad creature in form like beetle enormously larger reposed beyond again be richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone beyond lined with dense red weed passing up valley exactly parallel with distant cliff be broad mirror like expanse of water air seemed full of squadron of great bird manuvring in stately curve across river be multitude of splendid building richly coloured glittering with metallic tracery facet among forest of moss like lichenous tree suddenly something flapped repeatedly across vision like fluttering of jewelled fan beating of wing face rather upper part of face with very large eye came a be close to own a if on other side of crystal mr cave be so startled so impressed by absolute reality of eye that drew head back from crystal to look behind have become so absorbed in watching that be quite surprised to find in cool darkness of little shop with familiar odour of methyl mustiness decay a blinked about glowing crystal faded went out such be first general impression of mr cave story be curiously direct circumstantial from outset when valley first flashed momentarily on sens imagination be strangely affected a began to appreciate detail of scene saw wonder rose to point of passion went about business listless distraught thinking only of time when must be able to return to watching then few week after first sight of valley came two customer stress excitement of offer narrow escape of crystal from sale a have already told now while thing be mr cave secret remained mere wonder thing to creep to covertly peep at a child might peep upon forbidden garden mr wace have for young scientific investigator particularly lucid consecutive habit of mind directly crystal story came to have satisfied by seeing phosphorescence with own eye that there really be certain evidence for mr cave statement proceeded to develop matter systematically mr cave be only too eager to come feast eye on wonderland saw came night from half past eight until past ten sometimes in mr waces absence during day on sunday afternoon also came from outset mr wace made copious note be due to scientific method that relation between direction from initiating ray entered crystal orientation of picture be proved by covering crystal in box perforated only with small aperture to admit exciting ray by substituting black holland for buff blind greatly improved condition of observation so in little while be able to survey valley in direction desired so having cleared way may give brief account of visionary world within crystal thing be in case seen by mr cave method of working be invariably for to watch crystal report what saw while mr wace who a science student have learnt trick of writing in dark wrote brief note of report when crystal faded be put into box in proper position electric light turned on mr wace asked question suggested observation to clear up difficult point nothing indeed must have be le visionary more matter of fact attention of mr cave have be speedily directed to bird like creature have seen so abundantly present in of earlier vision first impression be soon corrected considered for time that might represent diurnal specie of bat then thought grotesquely enough that might be cherub head be round curiously human be eye of one of have so startled on second observation have broad silvery wing not feathered glistening almost a brilliantly a new killed fish with same subtle play of colour wing be not built on plan of bird wing bat mr wace learned supported by curved rib radiating from body sort of butterfly wing with curved rib seems best to express appearance body be small fitted with two bunch of prehensile organ like long tentacle immediately under mouth incredible a appeared to mr wace persuasion at last became irresistible that be creature owned great quasi human building magnificent garden made broad valley so splendid mr cave perceived that building with other peculiarity have door that great circular window opened freely gave creature egress entrance must alight upon tentacle fold wing to smallness almost rod like hop into interior among be multitude of smaller winged creature like great dragon fly moth flying beetle across greensward brilliantly coloured gigantic ground beetle crawled lazily to fro moreover on causeway terrace large headed creature similar to greater winged fly wingless be visible hopping busily upon hand like tangle of tentacle allusion have already be made to glittering object upon mast stood upon terrace of nearer building dawned upon mr cave after regarding one of mast very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that glittering object there be crystal exactly like into peered still more careful scrutiny convinced that one in vista of nearly twenty carried similar object occasionally one of large flying creature must flutter up to one folding wing coiling number of tentacle about mast must regard crystal fixedly for space sometimes for a long a fifteen minute series of observation made at suggestion of mr wace convinced watcher so far a visionary world be concerned crystal into peered actually stood at summit of endmost mast on terrace that on one occasion at least one of inhabitant of other world have looked into mr cave face while be making observation so much for essential fact of very singular story unless dismiss a ingenious fabrication of mr wace have to believe one of two thing mr cave crystal be in two world at once that while be carried about in one remained stationary in other seems altogether absurd else that have peculiar relation of sympathy with exactly similar crystal in other world so what be seen in interior of one in world be under suitable condition visible to observer in corresponding crystal in other world vice versa at present indeed know of way in two crystal must so come en rapport nowadays know enough to understand that thing be not altogether impossible view of crystal a en rapport be supposition occurred to mr wace to at least seems extremely plausible where be other world on also alert intelligence of mr wace speedily threw light after sunset sky darkened rapidly there be very brief twilight interval indeed star shone out be recognisably same a see arranged in same constellation mr cave recognised bear pleiades aldebaran sirius so that other world must be somewhere in solar system at utmost only few hundred of million of mile from own following up clue mr wace learned that midnight sky be darker blue even than midwinter sky that sun seemed little smaller there be two small moon like moon smaller quite differently marked one of moved so rapidly that motion be clearly visible a one regarded moon be never high in sky vanished a rose be time revolved be eclipsed because be so near primary planet answer quite completely although mr cave did not know to what must be condition of thing on mar indeed seems exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into crystal mr cave did actually see planet mar inhabitant if be case then evening star shone so brilliantly in sky of distant vision be neither more le than own familiar earth for time martian if be martian seem to have known of mr cave inspection once twice one must come to peer go away very shortly to other mast a though vision be unsatisfactory during time mr cave be able to watch proceeding of winged people without being disturbed by attention although report be necessarily vague fragmentary be nevertheless very suggestive imagine impression of humanity martian observer must get who after difficult process of preparation with considerable fatigue to eye be able to peer at london from steeple of st martin church for stretch at longest of four minute at time mr cave be unable to ascertain if winged martian be same a martian who hopped about causeway terrace if latter must put on wing at will several time saw certain clumsy biped dimly suggestive of ape white partially translucent feeding among certain of lichenous tree once of fled before one of hopping round headed martian latter caught one in tentacle then picture faded suddenly left mr cave most tantalisingly in dark on occasion vast thing mr cave thought at first be gigantic insect appeared advancing along causeway beside canal with extraordinary rapidity a drew nearer mr cave perceived that be mechanism of shining metal of extraordinary complexity then when looked again have passed out of sight after time mr wace aspired to attract attention of martian next time that strange eye of one of appeared close to crystal mr cave cried out sprang away immediately turned on light began to gesticulate in manner suggestive of signalling when at last mr cave examined crystal again martian have departed thus far observation have progressed in early november then mr cave feeling that suspicion of family about crystal be allayed began to take to fro with in order that a occasion arose in daytime night might comfort with what be fast becoming most real thing in existence in december mr waces work in connection with forthcoming examination became heavy sitting be reluctantly suspended for week for ten eleven day be not quite sure saw nothing of cave then grew anxious to resume investigation stress of seasonal labour being abated went down to seven dial at corner noticed shutter before bird fancier window then at cobbler mr cave shop be closed rapped door be opened by stepson in black at once called mr cave who be mr wace must not observe in cheap ample widow weed of most imposing pattern without very great surprise mr wace learnt that cave be dead already buried be in tear voice be little thick have just returned from highgate mind seemed occupied with own prospect honourable detail of obsequies mr wace be at last able to learn particular of cave death have be found dead in shop in early morning day after last visit to mr wace crystal have be clasped in stone cold hand face be smiling said mr cave velvet cloth from mineral lay on floor at foot must have be dead five six hour when be found came a great shock to wace began to reproach bitterly for having neglected plain symptom of old man ill health chief thought be of crystal approached that topic in gingerly manner because knew mr cave peculiarity be dumbfounded to learn that be sold mr cave first impulse directly cave body have be taken upstairs have be to write to mad clergyman who have offered five pound for crystal informing of recovery after violent hunt in daughter joined be convinced of loss of address a be without mean required to mourn bury cave in elaborate style dignity of old seven dial inhabitant demand have appealed to friendly fellow tradesman in great portland street have very kindly taken over portion of stock at valuation valuation be own crystal egg be included in one of lot mr wace after few suitable condolence little offhandedly proffered perhaps hurried at once to great portland street there learned that crystal egg have already be sold to tall dark man in gray there material fact in curious to at least very suggestive story come abruptly to end great portland street dealer did not know who tall dark man in gray be have observed with sufficient attention to describe minutely did not even know way person have gone after leaving shop for time mr wace remained in shop trying dealer patience with hopeless question venting own exasperation at last realising abruptly that whole thing have passed out of hand have vanished like vision of night returned to own room little astonished to find note have made still tangible visible upon untidy table annoyance disappointment be naturally very great made second call equally ineffectual upon great portland street dealer resorted to advertisement in such periodical a be likely to come into hand of bric brac collector also wrote letter to daily chronicle nature periodical suspecting hoax asked to reconsider action before printed be advised that strange story unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence might imperil reputation a investigator moreover call of proper work be urgent so after month so save for occasional reminder to certain dealer have reluctantly to abandon quest for crystal egg from day to remains undiscovered occasionally however tell can quite believe have burst of zeal in abandon more urgent occupation resume search whether not will remain lost for ever with material origin of be thing equally speculative at present time if present purchaser be collector one must have expected inquiry of mr wace to have reached through dealer have be able to discover mr cave clergyman oriental other than rev james parker young prince of bosso kuni in java be obliged to for certain particular object of prince be simply curiosity extravagance be so eager to buy because cave be so oddly reluctant to sell be just a possible that buyer in second instance be simply casual purchaser not collector at crystal egg for know may at present moment be within mile of decorating drawing room serving a paper weight remarkable function unknown indeed be partly with idea of such possibility have thrown narrative into form will give chance of being read by ordinary consumer of fiction own idea in matter be practically identical with of mr wace believe crystal on mast in mar crystal egg of mr cave to be in physical at present quite inexplicable way en rapport believe further that terrestrial crystal must have be possibly at remote date sent hither from planet in order to give martian near view of affair possibly fellow to crystal on other mast be also on globe theory of hallucination suffices for fact man who must work miracle pantoum in prose be doubtful whether gift be innate for own part think came to suddenly indeed until be thirty be sceptic did not believe in miraculous power here since be most convenient place must mention that be little man have eye of hot brown very erect red hair moustache with end that twisted up freckle name be george mcwhirter fotheringay not sort of name by mean to lead to expectation of miracle be clerk at gomshotts be greatly addicted to assertive argument be while be asserting impossibility of miracle that have first intimation of extraordinary power particular argument be being held in bar of long dragon toddy beamish be conducting opposition by monotonous effective so say that drove mr fotheringay to very limit of patience there be present besides two very dusty cyclist landlord cox miss maybridge perfectly respectable rather portly barmaid of dragon miss maybridge be standing with back to mr fotheringay washing glass others be watching more le amused by present ineffectiveness of assertive method goaded by torres vedras tactic of mr beamish mr fotheringay determined to make unusual rhetorical effort looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let clearly understand what miracle be something contrariwise to course of nature done by power of will something what couldnt happen without being specially willed so say said mr beamish repulsing mr fotheringay appealed to cyclist who have hitherto be silent auditor received assent given with hesitating cough glance at mr beamish landlord must express opinion mr fotheringay returning to mr beamish received unexpected concession of qualified assent to definition of miracle for instance said mr fotheringay greatly encouraged here must be miracle lamp in natural course of nature couldnt burn like upsy down must beamish say couldnt said beamish said fotheringay dont mean to say eh said beamish reluctantly couldnt very well said mr fotheringay then here come one a might be along here stand a might be here say to lamp a might do collecting will turn upsy down without breaking go on burning steady hallo be enough to make one say hallo impossible incredible be visible to lamp hung inverted in air burning quietly with flame pointing down be a solid a indisputable a ever lamp be prosaic common lamp of long dragon bar mr fotheringay stood with extended forefinger knitted brow of one anticipating catastrophic smash cyclist who be sitting next lamp ducked jumped across bar everybody jumped more le miss maybridge turned screamed for nearly three second lamp remained still faint cry of mental distress came from mr fotheringay cant keep up said longer staggered back inverted lamp suddenly flared fell against corner of bar bounced aside smashed upon floor went out be lucky have metal receiver whole place must have be in blaze mr cox be first to speak remark shorn of needle excrescence be to effect that fotheringay be fool fotheringay be beyond disputing even so fundamental proposition a that be astonished beyond measure at thing have occurred subsequent conversation threw absolutely light on matter so far a fotheringay be concerned general opinion not only followed mr cox very closely very vehemently one accused fotheringay of silly trick presented to a foolish destroyer of comfort security mind be in tornado of perplexity be inclined to agree with made remarkably ineffectual opposition to proposal of departure went home flushed heated coat collar crumpled eye smarting ear red watched of ten street lamp nervously a passed be only when found alone in little bedroom in church row that be able to grapple seriously with memory of occurrence ask what on earth happened have removed coat boot be sitting on bed with hand in pocket repeating text of defence for seventeenth time didnt want confounded thing to upset when occurred to that at precise moment have said commanding word have inadvertently willed thing said that when have seen lamp in air have felt that depended on to maintain there without being clear how be to be done have not particularly complex mind might have stuck for time at inadvertently willed embracing a doe abstrusest problem of voluntary action a be idea came to with quite acceptable haziness from following a must admit clear logical path came to test of experiment pointed resolutely to candle collected mind though felt did foolish thing be raised up said in second that feeling vanished candle be raised hung in air one giddy moment a mr fotheringay gasped fell with smash on toilet table leaving in darkness save for expiring glow of wick for time mr fotheringay sat in darkness perfectly still did happen after said ow im to explain dont know sighed heavily began feeling in pocket for match must find none rose groped about toilet table wish have match said resorted to coat there be none there then dawned upon that miracle be possible even with match extended hand scowled at in dark let there be match in hand said felt light object fall across palm finger closed upon match after several ineffectual attempt to light discovered be safety match threw down then occurred to that might have willed lit did perceived burning in midst of toilet table mat caught up hastily went out perception of possibility enlarged felt for replaced candle in candlestick here be lit said mr fotheringay forthwith candle be flaring saw little black hole in toilet cover with wisp of smoke rising from for time stared from to little flame back then looked up met own gaze in looking glass by help communed with in silence for time how about miracle now said mr fotheringay at last addressing reflection subsequent meditation of mr fotheringay be of severe confused description so far must see be case of pure willing with nature of experience so far disinclined for further experiment at least until have reconsidered lifted sheet of paper turned glass of water pink then green created snail miraculously annihilated got miraculous new tooth brush somewhere in small hour have reached fact that will power must be of particularly rare pungent quality fact have indeed have inkling before certain assurance scare perplexity of first discovery be now qualified by pride in evidence of singularity by vague intimation of advantage became aware that church clock be striking one a did not occur to that daily duty at gomshotts might be miraculously dispensed with resumed undressing in order to get to bed without further delay a struggled to get shirt over head be struck with brilliant idea let be in bed said found so undressed stipulated finding sheet cold added hastily in nightshirt in nice soft woollen nightshirt ah said with immense enjoyment now let be comfortably asleep awoke at usual hour be pensive through breakfast time wondering whether overnight experience might not be particularly vivid dream at length mind turned again to cautious experiment for instance have three egg for breakfast two landlady have supplied good shoppy one be delicious fresh goose egg laid cooked served by extraordinary will hurried off to gomshotts in state of profound carefully concealed excitement only remembered shell of third egg when landlady spoke of night day must do work because of astonishing new self knowledge caused inconvenience because made up for miraculously in last ten minute a day wore on state of mind passed from wonder to elation albeit circumstance of dismissal from long dragon be still disagreeable to recall garbled account of matter have reached colleague led to badinage be evident must be careful how lifted frangible article in other way gift promised more more a turned over in mind intended among other thing to increase personal property by unostentatious act of creation called into existence pair of very splendid diamond stud hastily annihilated again a young gomshott came across counting house to desk be afraid young gomshott might wonder how have come by saw quite clearly gift required caution watchfulness in exercise so far a must judge difficulty attending mastery must be no greater than have already faced in study of cycling be that analogy perhaps quite a much a feeling that must be unwelcome in long dragon drove out after supper into lane beyond gasworks to rehearse few miracle in private there be possibly certain want of originality in attempt for apart from will power mr fotheringay be not very exceptional man miracle of moses rod came to mind night be dark unfavourable to proper control of large miraculous snake then recollected story of tannhuser that have read on back of philharmonic programme seemed to singularly attractive harmless stuck walking stick very nice poona penang lawyer into turf edged footpath commanded dry wood to blossom air be immediately full of scent of rose by mean of match saw for that beautiful miracle be indeed accomplished satisfaction be ended by advancing footstep afraid of premature discovery of power addressed blossoming stick hastily go back what meant be change back of course be confused stick receded at considerable velocity incontinently came cry of anger bad word from approaching person who be throwing bramble at fool cried voice got on shin im sorry old chap said mr fotheringay then realising awkward nature of explanation caught nervously at moustache saw winch one of three immering constable advancing what dyer mean by asked constable hallo be gent broke lamp at long dragon dont mean anything by said mr fotheringay nothing at what dyer do for then oh bother said mr fotheringay indeed dyer know that stick hurt what dyer do for eh for moment mr fotheringay must not think what have done for silence seemed to irritate mr winch youve be assaulting police young man time thats what done look here mr winch said mr fotheringay annoyed confused im sorry very fact be well must think of way truth be working miracle tried to speak in offhand way try a must couldnt working ere dont talk rot working miracle indeed miracle well thats downright funny why yous chap dont believe in miracle fact be be of silly conjuring trick thats what be now tell mr fotheringay never heard what mr winch be going to tell realised have given away flung valuable secret to wind of heaven violent gust of irritation swept to action turned on constable swiftly fiercely here said ive have enough of have ill show silly conjuring trick will go to hades go now be alone mr fotheringay performed more miracle night did trouble to see what have become of flowering stick returned to town scared very quiet went to bedroom lord said powerful gift extremely powerful gift didnt hardly mean a much a that not really wonder what hades be like sat on bed taking off boot struck by happy thought transferred constable to san francisco without more interference with normal causation went soberly to bed in night dreamt of anger of winch next day mr fotheringay heard two interesting item of news one have planted most beautiful climbing rose against elder mr gomshotts private house in lullaborough road river a far a rawlings mill be to be dragged for constable winch mr fotheringay be abstracted thoughtful day performed miracle except certain provision for winch miracle of completing day work with punctual perfection in spite of bee swarm of thought hummed through mind extraordinary abstraction meekness of manner be remarked by several people made matter for jesting for most part be thinking of winch on sunday evening went to chapel oddly enough mr maydig who took certain interest in occult matter preached about thing be not lawful mr fotheringay be not regular chapel goer system of assertive scepticism to have already alluded be now very much shaken tenor of sermon threw entirely new light on novel gift suddenly decided to consult mr maydig immediately after service so soon a be determined found wondering why have not done so before mr maydig lean excitable man with quite remarkably long wrist neck be gratified at request for private conversation from young man whose carelessness in religious matter be subject for general remark in town after few necessary delay conducted to study of manse be contiguous to chapel seated comfortably standing in front of cheerful fire leg threw rhodian arch of shadow on opposite wall requested mr fotheringay to state business at first mr fotheringay be little abashed found difficulty in opening matter will scarcely believe mr maydig be afraid so forth for time tried question at last asked mr maydig opinion of miracle mr maydig be still saying well in extremely judicial tone when mr fotheringay interrupted again dont believe suppose that common sort of person like for instance a might be sitting here now might have sort of twist inside that made able to do thing by will possible said mr maydig something of sort perhaps be possible if might make free with something here think might show by sort of experiment said mr fotheringay now take that tobacco jar on table for instance what want to know be whether what be going to do with be miracle not just minute mr maydig please knitted brow pointed to tobacco jar said be bowl of vilets tobacco jar did a be ordered mr maydig started violently at change stood looking from thaumaturgist to bowl of flower said nothing presently ventured to lean over table smell violet be fresh picked very fine one then stared at mr fotheringay again how did do that asked mr fotheringay pulled moustache just told there be be that miracle be black art what be what do think matter with thats what want to ask most extraordinary occurrence day last week knew more must do thing like than did came quite sudden something odd about will suppose thats a far a can see be that only thing must do other thing besides lord yes said mr fotheringay just anything thought suddenly recalled conjuring entertainment have seen here pointed change into bowl of fish not that change into glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in thats better see that mr maydig astonishing incredible be either most extraordinary must change into anything said mr fotheringay just anything here be pigeon will in moment blue pigeon be fluttering round room making mr maydig duck time came near stop there will said mr fotheringay pigeon hung motionless in air must change back to bowl of flower said after replacing pigeon on table worked that miracle expect will want pipe in bit said restored tobacco jar mr maydig have followed later change in sort of ejaculatory silence stared at mr fotheringay in very gingerly manner picked up tobacco jar examined replaced on table well be only expression of feeling now after easier to explain what came about said mr fotheringay proceeded to lengthy involved narrative of strange experience beginning with affair of lamp in long dragon complicated by persistent allusion to winch a went on transient pride mr maydigs consternation have caused passed away became very ordinary mr fotheringay of everyday intercourse again mr maydig listened intently tobacco jar in hand bearing changed also with course of narrative presently while mr fotheringay be dealing with miracle of third egg minister interrupted with fluttering extended hand be possible said be credible be amazing of course reconciles number of amazing difficulty power to work miracle be gift peculiar quality like genius second sight hitherto have come very rarely to exceptional people in case have always wondered at miracle of mahomet at yogi miracle miracle of madame blavatsky of course yes be simply gift carry out so beautifully argument of great thinker mr maydigs voice sank grace duke of argyll here plumb profounder law deeper than ordinary law of nature yes yes go on go on mr fotheringay proceeded to tell of misadventure with winch mr maydig no longer overawed scared began to jerk limb about interject astonishment what troubled most proceeded mr fotheringay im most mijitly in want of advice for of course he at san francisco wherever san francisco may be of course awkward for of a youll see mr maydig dont see how can understand what have happened dare say he scared exasperated something tremendous trying to get at dare say keep on starting off to come here send back by miracle few hour when think of of course thats thing wont be able to understand bound to annoy of course if take ticket time will cost lot of money done best must for of course difficult for to put in place thought afterwards that clothes might have got scorched know if hades be supposed to be before shifted in case suppose theyd have locked up in san francisco of course willed new suit of clothes on directly thought of see im already in deuce of tangle mr maydig looked serious see be in tangle yes difficult position how be to end became diffuse inconclusive however well leave winch for little discus larger question dont think be case of black art anything of sort dont think there be taint of criminality about at mr fotheringay none unless be suppressing material fact miracle pure miracle miracle if may say so of very highest class began to pace hearthrug gesticulate while mr fotheringay sat with arm on table head on arm looking worried dont see how im to manage about winch said gift of working miracle apparently very powerful gift said mr maydig will find way about winch never fear dear sir be most important man man of most astonishing possibility a evidence for example in other way thing may do yes ive thought of thing two said mr fotheringay of thing came bit twisty saw that fish at first wrong sort of bowl wrong sort of fish thought id ask one proper course said mr maydig very proper course altogether proper course stopped looked at mr fotheringay practically unlimited gift let test power for instance if really be if really be seem to be so incredible a may seem in study of little house behind congregational chapel on evening of sunday nov mr fotheringay egged on inspired by mr maydig began to work miracle reader attention be specially definitely called to date will object probably have already objected that certain point in story be improbable that if thing of sort already described have indeed occurred must have be in paper at time detail immediately following will find particularly hard to accept because among other thing involve conclusion that reader in question must have be killed in violent unprecedented manner more than year ago now miracle be nothing if not improbable a matter of fact reader be killed in violent unprecedented manner in in subsequent course of story will become perfectly clear credible a right minded reasonable reader will admit be not place for end of story being little beyond hither side of middle at first miracle worked by mr fotheringay be timid little miracle little thing with cup parlour fitment a feeble a miracle of theosophist feeble a be be received with awe by collaborator must have preferred to settle winch business out of hand mr maydig must not let after have worked dozen of domestic triviality sense of power grew imagination began to show sign of stimulation ambition enlarged first larger enterprise be due to hunger negligence of mr

plainly must see that be being hemmed in great net of giant warfare have in toil many time have seen levy have come down from north going to fro have come upon in distance amidst mountain making way for ammunition preparing mounting of gun once fancied have fired at taking for spy at rate shot have gone shuddering over several time have hidden in wood from hovering aeroplane thing matter now night of flight pain be in open place near great temple at pstum at last on blank stony place dotted with spiky bush empty desolate so flat that grove of eucalyptus far away showed to foot of stem how can see lady be sitting down under bush resting little for be very weak weary be standing up watching to see if must tell distance of firing came went be still know fighting far from other with terrible new weapon have never before be used gun must carry beyond sight aeroplane must do what must do man must foretell knew that be between two army that drew together knew be in danger that must not stop there rest though thing be in mind be in background seemed to be affair beyond concern chiefly be thinking of lady aching distress filled for first time have owned beaten have fallen weeping behind must hear sobbing must not turn round to because knew have need of weeping have held so far so long for be well thought that must weep rest then must toil on again for have inkling of thing hung so near even now can see a sat there lovely hair upon shoulder can mark again deepening hollow of cheek if have parted said if have let go said even now repent will not repent made choice will hold on to end then overhead in sky flashed something burst about heard bullet making noise like handful of pea suddenly thrown chipped stone about whirled fragment from brick passed put hand to mouth then moistened lip at flash have turned about know stood up stood up know moved step towards a though wanted to reach have be shot through heart stopped stared at felt that foolish incapacity englishman feel on such occasion met eye for moment then stared out of window for long space kept silence when at last looked at be sitting back in corner arm folded teeth gnawing at knuckle bit nail suddenly stared at carried said towards temple in arm a though mattered dont know why seemed sort of sanctuary know have lasted so long suppose must have died almost instantly only talked to way silence again have seen temple said abruptly indeed have brought still sunlit arcade of worn sandstone very vividly before be brown one big brown one sat down on fallen pillar held in arm silent after first babble be over after little while lizard came out ran about again a though nothing unusual be going on a though nothing have changed be tremendously still there sun high shadow still even shadow of weed upon entablature be still in spite of thudding banging went about sky seem to remember that aeroplane came up out of south that battle went away to west one aeroplane be struck overset fell remember that though didnt interest in least didnt seem to signify be like wounded gull know flapping for time in water must see down aisle of temple black thing in bright blue water three four time shell burst about beach then ceased time happened lizard scuttled in hid for space be mischief done except once stray bullet gashed stone hard by made just fresh bright surface a shadow grew longer stillness seemed greater curious thing remarked with manner of man who make trivial conversation be that didnt think didnt think at sat with in arm amidst stone in sort of lethargy stagnant dont remember waking up dont remember dressing day know found in office with letter slit open in front of how be struck by absurdity of being there seeing that in reality be sitting stunned in pstum temple with dead woman in arm read letter like machine have forgotten what be about stopped there be long silence suddenly perceived that be running down incline from chalk farm to euston started at passing of time turned on with brutal question with tone of now never did dream again yes seemed to force to finish voice be very low once more a be only for few instant seemed to have suddenly awakened out of great apathy to have risen into sitting position body lay there on stone beside gaunt body not know so soon be not may have heard voice know only knew clearly that men be coming into solitude that be last outrage stood up walked through temple there came into sight first one man with yellow face dressed in uniform of dirty white trimmed with blue then several climbing to crest of old wall of vanished city crouching there be little bright figure in sunlight there hung weapon in hand peering cautiously before further away saw others then more at point in wall be long lax line of men in open order presently man have first seen stood up shouted command men came tumbling down wall into high weed towards temple scrambled down with led came facing towards when saw stopped at first have watched men with mere curiosity when have seen meant to come to temple be moved to forbid shouted to officer must not come here cried be here be here with dead stared then shouted question back to in unknown tongue repeated what have said shouted again folded arm stood still presently spoke to men came forward carried drawn sword signed to to keep away continued to advance told again very patiently clearly must not come here be old temple be here with dead presently be so close must see face clearly be narrow face with dull gray eye black moustache have scar on upper lip be dirty unshaven kept shouting unintelligible thing question perhaps at know now that be afraid of at time did not occur to a tried to explain to interrupted in imperious tone bidding suppose stand aside made to go past caught hold of saw face change at grip fool cried dont know be dead started back looked at with cruel eye saw sort of exultant resolve leap into delight then suddenly with scowl swept sword back so thrust stopped abruptly became aware of change in rhythm of train brake lifted voice carriage jarred jerked present world insisted upon became clamorous saw through steamy window huge electric light glaring down from tall mast upon fog saw row of stationary empty carriage passing by then signal box hoisting constellation of green red into murky london twilight marched after looked again at drawn feature ran through heart be with sort of astonishment fear no pain just amazement that felt pierce felt sword drive home into body didnt hurt know didnt hurt at yellow platform light came into field of view passing first rapidly then slowly at last stopping with jerk dim shape of men passed to fro without euston cried voice do mean there be pain no sting smart amazement then darkness sweeping over everything hot brutal face before face of man who have killed seemed to recede swept out of existence euston clamoured voice outside euston carriage door opened admitting flood of sound porter stood regarding sound of door slamming hoof clatter of cab horse behind thing featureless remote roar of london cobble stone came to ear truck load of lighted lamp blazed along platform darkness flood of darkness opened spread blotted out thing luggage sir said porter be end asked seemed to hesitate then almost inaudibly answered mean couldnt get to be there on other side of temple then yes insisted yes nightmare cried nightmare indeed god great bird fought tore new accelerator certainly if ever man found guinea when be looking for pin be good friend professor gibberne have heard before of investigator overshooting mark never quite to extent that have done have really time at rate without touch of exaggeration in phrase found something to revolutionise human life that when be simply seeking round nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to stress of pushful day have tasted stuff now several time can not do better than describe effect thing have on that there be astonishing experience in store for in search of new sensation will become apparent enough professor gibberne a many people know be neighbour in folkestone unless memory play trick portrait at various age have already appeared in strand magazine think late in be unable to look up because have lent volume to one who have never sent back reader may perhaps recall high forehead singularly long black eyebrow give mephistophelian touch to face occupies one of pleasant little detached house in mixed style make western end of upper sandgate road so interesting be one with flemish gable moorish portico be in little room with mullioned bay window that work when be down here in of evening have so often smoked talked together be mighty jester besides like to talk to about work be one of men who find help stimulus in talking so have be able to follow conception of new accelerator right up from very early stage of course greater portion of experimental work be not done in folkestone in gower street in fine new laboratory next to hospital that have be first to use a one know at least a intelligent people know special department in gibberne have gained so great deserved reputation among physiologist be action of drug upon nervous system upon soporific sedative ansthetics be be told unequalled be also chemist of considerable eminence suppose in subtle complex jungle of riddle centre about ganglion cell axis fibre there be little cleared place of making little glade of illumination that until see fit to publish result be still inaccessible to other living man in last few year have be particularly assiduous upon question of nervous stimulant already before discovery of new accelerator very successful with medical science have to thank for at least three distinct absolutely safe invigorator of unrivalled value to practising men in case of exhaustion preparation known a gibbernes b syrup have suppose saved more life already than lifeboat round coast none of little thing begin to satisfy yet told nearly year ago increase central energy without affecting nerve simply increase available energy by lowering nervous conductivity of be unequal local in operation one wake up heart viscera leaf brain stupefied one get at brain champagne fashion doe nothing good for solar plexus what want what if earthly possibility mean to have be stimulant stimulates round that wake up for time from crown of head to tip of great toe make go two even three to everybody el one eh thats thing im after must tire man said not doubt of youd eat double treble just think what thing must mean imagine with little phial like held up little bottle of green glass marked point with in precious phial be power to think twice a fast move twice a quickly do twice a much work in given time a must otherwise do be such thing possible believe so if isnt ive wasted time for year various preparation of hypophosphites for example seem to show that something of sort even if be only one half time a fast must do must do said if be statesman in corner for example time rushing up against something urgent to be done eh must dose private secretary said gain double time think if for example wanted to finish book usually said wish id never begun em doctor driven to death want to sit down think out case barrister man cramming for examination worth guinea drop said more to men like in duel again said gibberne where depends on quickness in pulling trigger in fencing echoed see said gibberne if get a round thing will really do harm at except perhaps to infinitesimal degree brings nearer old age will just have lived twice to other people once suppose meditated in duel must be fair thats question for second said gibberne harked back further really think thing be possible said a possible said gibberne glanced at something went throbbing by window a motor bus a matter of fact paused smiled at deeply tapped slowly on edge of desk with green phial think know stuff already ive got something coming nervous smile upon face betrayed gravity of revelation rarely talked of actual experimental work unless thing be very near end may be may be shouldnt be surprised may even do thing at greater rate than twice will be rather big thing hazarded will be think rather big thing dont think quite knew what big thing be to be for remember have several talk about stuff after that new accelerator called tone about grew more confident on occasion sometimes talked nervously of unexpected physiological result use might have then must get little unhappy at others be frankly mercenary debated long anxiously how preparation might be turned to commercial account good thing said tremendous thing know im giving world something think only reasonable must expect world to pay dignity of science be very well think somehow must have monopoly of stuff for say ten year dont see why fun in life must go to dealer in ham own interest in coming drug certainly did not wane in time have always have queer little twist towards metaphysics in mind have always be given to paradox about space time seemed to that gibberne be really preparing le than absolute acceleration of life suppose man repeatedly dosed with preparation must live active record life indeed must be adult at eleven middle aged at twenty five by thirty well on road to senile decay seemed to that so far gibberne be only going to do for one who took drug exactly what nature have done for jew oriental who be men in teen aged by fifty quicker in thought act than be time marvel of drug have always be great to mind can madden man calm man make incredibly strong alert helpless log quicken passion allay that by mean of drug here be new miracle to be added to strange armoury of phial doctor use gibberne be far too eager upon technical point to enter very keenly into aspect of question be th th of august when told distillation must decide failure success for time be going forward a talked be on th that told thing be done new accelerator tangible reality in world met a be going up sandgate hill towards folkestone think be going to get hair cut came hurrying down to meet suppose be coming to house to tell at once of success remember that eye be unusually bright face flushed noted even then swift alacrity of step done cried gripped hand speaking very fast more than done come up to house see really really shouted incredibly come up see doe twice doe more much more scare come up see stuff taste try most amazing stuff on earth gripped arm walking at pace that forced into trot went shouting with up hill whole char banc full of people turned stared at in unison after manner of people in char banc be one of hot clear day folkestone see so much of colour incredibly bright outline hard there be breeze of course not so much breeze a sufficed under condition to keep cool dry panted for mercy im not walking fast be cried gibberne slackened pace to quick march youve be taking of stuff puffed said at utmost drop of water stood in beaker from have washed out last trace of stuff took last night know be ancient history now go twice said nearing doorway in grateful perspiration go thousand time many thousand time cried gibberne with dramatic gesture flinging open early english carved oak gate phew said followed to door dont know how many time go said with latch key in hand throw sort of light on nervous physiology kick theory of vision into perfectly new shape heaven know how many thousand time well try after thing be to try stuff now try stuff said a went along passage rather said gibberne turning on in study there be in little green phial there unless happen to be afraid be careful man by nature only theoretically adventurous be afraid on other hand there be pride well haggled say youve tried ive tried said dont look hurt by do dont even look livery feel sat down give potion said if worst come to worst will save having hair cut think be one of most hateful duty of civilised man how do take mixture with water said gibberne whacking down carafe stood up in front of desk regarded in easy chair manner be suddenly affected by touch of harley street specialist rum stuff know said made gesture with hand must warn in first place a soon a youve got down to shut eye open very cautiously in minute so time one still see sense of vision be question of length of vibration not of multitude of impact there kind of shock to retina nasty giddy confusion just at time if eye be open keep em shut shut said good next thing be keep still dont begin to whack about may fetch something nasty rap if do remember will be going several thousand time faster than ever did before heart lung muscle brain everything will hit hard without knowing wont know know youll feel just a do now only everything in world will seem to be going ever so many thousand time slower than ever went before thats what make so deuced queer lor said mean youll see said took up little measure glanced at material on desk glass said water here mustnt take too much for first attempt little phial glucked out precious content dont forget what told said turning content of measure into glass in manner of italian waiter measuring whisky sit with eye tightly shut in absolute stillness for two minute said then will hear speak added inch so of water to little dose in glass by by said dont put glass down keep in hand rest hand on knee yes so now raised glass new accelerator said new accelerator answered touched glass drank instantly closed eye know that blank non existence into one drop when one have taken gas for indefinite interval be like then heard gibberne telling to wake up stirred opened eye there stood a have be standing glass still in hand be empty that be difference well said nothing out of way nothing slight feeling of exhilaration perhaps nothing more sound thing be still said by jove yes be still except sort of faint pat patter like rain falling on different thing what be analysed sound think said be not sure glanced at window have ever seen curtain before window fixed in way before followed eye there be end of curtain frozen a be corner high in act of flapping briskly in breeze said thats odd here said opened hand held glass naturally winced expecting glass to smash so far from smashing did not even seem to stir in mid air motionless roughly speaking said gibberne object in latitude fall foot in first second glass be falling foot in second now only see hasnt be falling yet for hundredth part of second give idea of pace of accelerator waved hand round round over under slowly sinking glass finally took by bottom pulled down placed very carefully on table eh said to laughed that seems right said began very gingerly to raise from chair felt perfectly well very light comfortable quite confident in mind be going fast over heart for example be beating thousand time second caused discomfort at looked out of window immovable cyclist head down with frozen puff of dust behind driving wheel scorched to overtake galloping char banc did not stir gaped in amazement at incredible spectacle gibberne cried how long will confounded stuff last heaven know answered last time took went to bed slept off tell be frightened must have lasted minute think seemed like hour after bit slows down rather suddenly believe be proud to observe did not feel frightened suppose because there be two of why shouldnt go out asked why not theyll see not goodness why will be going thousand time faster than quickest conjuring trick be ever done come along way will go window door out by window went assuredly of strange experience have ever have imagined read of other people having imagining little raid made with gibberne on folkestone lea under influence of new accelerator be strangest maddest of went out by gate into road there made minute examination of statuesque passing traffic top of wheel of leg of horse of char banc end of whip lash lower jaw of conductor who be just beginning to yawn be perceptibly in motion rest of lumbering conveyance seemed still quite noiseless except for faint rattling came from one man throat a part of frozen edifice there be driver know conductor eleven people effect a walked about thing began by being madly queer ended by being disagreeable there be people like ourselves yet not like ourselves frozen in careless attitude caught in mid gesture girl man smiled at one leering smile threatened to last for evermore woman in floppy capelline rested arm on rail stared at gibbernes house with unwinking stare of eternity man stroked moustache like figure of wax stretched tiresome stiff hand with extended finger towards loosened hat stared at laughed at made face at then sort of disgust of came upon turned away walked round in front of cyclist towards lea goodness cried gibberne suddenly look there pointed there at tip of finger sliding down air with wing flapping slowly at speed of exceptionally languid snail be bee so came out upon lea there thing seemed madder than ever band be playing in upper stand though sound made for be low pitched wheezy rattle sort of prolonged last sigh that passed at time into sound like slow muffled ticking of monstrous clock frozen people stood erect strange silent self conscious looking dummy hung unstably in mid stride promenading upon grass passed close to little poodle dog suspended in act of leaping watched slow movement of leg a sank to earth lord look here cried gibberne halted for moment before magnificent person in white faint striped flannel white shoe panama hat who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed lady have passed wink studied with such leisurely deliberation a must afford be unattractive thing loses quality of alert gaiety one remark that winking eye doe not completely close that under drooping lid appears lower edge of eyeball little line of white heaven give memory said will never wink again smile said gibberne with eye on lady answering infernally hot somehow said let go slower oh come along said gibberne picked way among bath chair in path many of people sitting in chair seemed almost natural in passive pose contorted scarlet of bandsman be not restful thing to see purple faced little gentleman be frozen in midst of violent struggle to refold newspaper against wind there be many evidence that people in sluggish way be exposed to considerable breeze breeze have existence so far a sensation went came out walked little way from crowd turned regarded to see multitude changed to picture smitten rigid a be into semblance of realistic wax be impossibly wonderful be absurd of course filled with irrational exultant sense of superior advantage consider wonder of have said thought done since stuff have begun to work in vein have happened so far a people so far a world in general went in twinkling of eye new accelerator began gibberne interrupted there that infernal old woman said what old woman life next door to said gibberne have lapdog yap god temptation be strong there be something very boyish impulsive about gibberne at time before must expostulate with have dashed forward snatched unfortunate animal out of visible existence be running violently with towards cliff of lea be most extraordinary little brute know didnt bark wriggle make slightest sign of vitality kept quite stiffly in attitude of somnolent repose gibberne held by neck be like running about with dog of wood gibberne cried put down then said something else if run like gibberne cried youll set clothes on fire linen trouser be going brown a be clapped hand on thigh stood hesitating on verge gibberne cried coming up put down heat be too much running so two three mile second friction of air what said glancing at dog friction of air shouted friction of air going too fast like meteorite thing too hot gibberne gibberne im over pricking sort of perspiration can see people stirring slightly believe stuff working off put that dog down eh said working off repeated be too hot stuff working off im wet through stared at then at band wheezy rattle of whose performance be certainly going faster then with tremendous sweep of arm hurled dog away from went spinning upward still inanimate hung at last over grouped parasol of knot of chattering people gibberne be gripping elbow by jove cried believe be sort of hot pricking yes man moving pocket handkerchief perceptibly must get out of sharp must not get out of sharply enough luckily perhaps for might have run if have run must believe have burst into flame almost certainly must have burst into flame know have of thought of before must even begin to run action of drug have ceased be business of minute fraction of second effect of new accelerator passed like drawing of curtain vanished in movement of hand heard gibbernes voice in infinite alarm sit down said flop down upon turf at edge of lea sat scorching a sat there be patch of burnt grass there still where sat down whole stagnation seemed to wake up a did so disarticulated vibration of band rushed together into blast of music promenaders put foot down walked way paper flag began flapping smile passed into word winker finished wink went on way complacently seated people moved spoke whole world have come alive again be going a fast a be rather be going no faster than rest of world be like slowing down a one come into railway station everything seemed to spin round for second two have most transient feeling of nausea be little dog have seemed to hang for moment when force of gibbernes arm be expended fell with swift acceleration clean through lady parasol be saving of unless be for one corpulent old gentleman in bath chair who certainly did start at sight of afterwards regarded at interval with darkly suspicious eye finally believe said something to nurse about doubt if solitary person remarked sudden appearance among plop must have appeared abruptly ceased to smoulder almost at once though turf beneath be uncomfortably hot attention of one including even amusement association band on occasion for only time in history got out of tune be arrested by amazing fact still more amazing yapping uproar caused by fact that respectable over fed lapdog sleeping quietly to east of bandstand must suddenly fall through parasol of lady on west in slightly singed condition due to extreme velocity of movement through air in absurd day too when be trying to be a psychic silly superstitious a possible people got up trod on other people chair be overturned lea policeman ran how matter settled know be much too anxious to disentangle from affair get out of range of eye of old gentleman in bath chair to make minute inquiry a soon a be sufficiently cool sufficiently recovered from giddiness nausea confusion of mind to do so stood up skirting crowd directed step back along road below metropole towards gibbernes house amidst din heard very distinctly gentleman who have be sitting beside lady of ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threat language to one of chair attendant who have inspector written on cap if didnt throw dog said who did sudden return of movement familiar noise natural anxiety about clothes be still dreadfully hot front of thigh of gibbernes white trouser be scorched drabbish brown prevented minute observation must have liked to make on thing indeed really made observation of scientific value on return bee of course have gone looked for cyclist be already out of sight a came into upper sandgate road hidden from by traffic char banc however with people now alive stirring be clattering along at spanking pace almost abreast of nearer church noted however that window sill on have stepped in getting out of house be slightly singed that impression of foot on gravel on path be unusually deep so be have first experience of new accelerator practically have be running about saying doing sort of thing in space of second so of time have lived hour while band have played perhaps two bar effect have upon be that whole world have stopped for convenient inspection considering thing particularly considering rashness in venturing out of house experience might certainly have be much more disagreeable than be showed doubt that gibberne have still much to learn before preparation be manageable convenience practicability certainly demonstrated beyond cavil since adventure have be steadily bringing use under control have several time without slightest bad result taken measured dos under direction though must confess have not yet ventured abroad again while under influence may mention for example that story have be written at one sitting without interruption except for nibbling of chocolate by mean began at watch be now very nearly at minute past half hour convenience of securing long uninterrupted spell of work in midst of day full of engagement can not be exaggerated gibberne be now working at quantitative handling of preparation with especial reference to distinctive effect upon different type of constitution then hope to find retarder with to dilute present rather excessive potency retarder will of course have reverse effect to accelerator used alone must enable patient to spread few second over many hour of ordinary time so to maintain apathetic inaction glacier like absence of alacrity amidst most animated irritating surroundings two thing together must necessarily work entire revolution in civilised existence be beginning of escape from time garment of carlyle speaks while accelerator will enable to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon moment occasion that demand utmost sense vigour retarder will enable to pas in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship tedium perhaps be little optimistic about retarder have indeed still to be discovered about accelerator there be possible sort of doubt appearance upon market in convenient controllable assimilable form be matter of next few month will be obtainable of chemist druggist in small green bottle at high considering extraordinary quality by mean excessive price gibbernes nervous accelerator will be called hope to be able to supply in three strength one in one in one in distinguished by yellow pink white label respectively doubt use render great number of very extraordinary thing possible for of course most remarkable possibly even criminal proceeding may be effected with impunity by thus dodging a be into interstice of time like potent preparation will be liable to abuse have however discussed aspect of question very thoroughly have decided that be purely matter of medical jurisprudence altogether outside province will manufacture sell accelerator a for consequence will see door in wall one confidential evening not three month ago lionel wallace told story of door in wall at time thought that so far a be concerned be true story told with direct simplicity of conviction must not do otherwise than believe in in morning in own flat woke to different atmosphere a lay in bed recalled thing have told stripped of glamour of earnest slow voice denuded of focused shaded table light shadowy atmosphere wrapped about pleasant bright thing dessert glass napery of dinner have shared making for time bright little world quite cut off from everyday reality saw a frankly incredible be mystifying said then how well did isnt quite thing must have expected of people to do well afterwards a sat up in bed sipped morning tea found trying to account for flavour of reality that perplexed in impossible reminiscence by supposing did in way suggest present convey hardly know word to use experience be otherwise impossible to tell well dont resort to explanation now have got over intervening doubt believe now a believed at moment of telling that wallace did to very best of ability strip truth of secret for whether saw only thought saw whether be possessor of inestimable privilege victim of fantastic dream can not pretend to guess even fact of death ended doubt for ever throw light on that much reader must judge for forget now what chance comment criticism of mine moved so reticent man to confide in be think defending against imputation of slackness unreliability have made in relation to great public movement in have disappointed plunged suddenly have said preoccupation know went on after pause have be negligent fact be isnt case of ghost apparition odd thing to tell of redmond be haunted be haunted by something that rather take light out of thing fill with longing paused checked by english shyness so often overcomes when must speak of moving grave beautiful thing be at saint thelstans through said for moment seemed to quite irrelevant well paused then very haltingly at first afterwards more easily began to tell of thing be hidden in life haunting memory of beauty happiness filled heart with insatiable longing made interest spectacle of worldly life seem dull tedious vain to now have clue to thing seems written visibly in face have photograph in look of detachment have be caught intensified reminds of what woman once said of woman who have loved greatly suddenly said interest go out of forgets doesnt care rap for under very nose yet interest be not always out of when be holding attention to thing wallace must contrive to be extremely successful man career indeed be set with success left behind long ago soared up over head cut figure in world couldnt cut anyhow be still year short of forty say now that must have be in office very probably in new cabinet if have lived at school always beat without effort a be by nature be at school together at saint thelstans college in west kensington for almost school time came into school a co equal left far above in blaze of scholarship brilliant performance yet think made fair average running be at school heard first of door in wall be to hear of second time only month before death to at least door in wall be real door leading through real wall to immortal reality of be now quite assured came into life quite early when be little fellow between five six remember how a sat making confession to with slow gravity reasoned reckoned date of there be said crimson virginia creeper in one bright uniform crimson in clear amber sunshine against white wall came into impression somehow though dont clearly remember how there be horse chestnut leaf upon clean pavement outside green door be blotched yellow green know not brown dirty so that must have be new fallen take that mean october look out for horse chestnut leaf year ought to know if im right in be about five year four month old be said rather precocious little boy learnt to talk at abnormally early age be so sane old fashioned a people say that be permitted amount of initiative that most child scarcely attain by seven eight mother died when be two be under le vigilant authoritative care of nursery governess father be stern preoccupied lawyer who gave little attention expected great thing of for brightness found life little gray dull think one day wandered must not recall particular neglect enabled to get away course took among west kensington road have faded among incurable blur of memory white wall green door stood out quite distinctly a memory of childish experience ran did at very first sight of door experience peculiar emotion attraction desire to get to door open walk in at same time have clearest conviction that be unwise be wrong of must not tell to yield to attraction insisted upon a curious thing that knew from very beginning unless memory have played queerest trick that door be unfastened that must go in a chose seem to see figure of little boy drawn repelled be very clear in mind too though why must be so be never explained that father must be very angry if went in through door wallace described moment of hesitation to with utmost particularity went right past door then with hand in pocket making infantile attempt to whistle strolled right along beyond end of wall there recall number of mean dirty shop particularly that of plumber decorator with dusty disorder of earthenware pipe sheet lead ball tap pattern book of wall paper tin of enamel stood pretending to examine thing coveting passionately desiring green door then said have gust of emotion made run for lest hesitation must grip again went plump with outstretched hand through green door let slam behind so in trice came into garden have haunted life be very difficult for wallace to give full sense of garden into came there be something in very air of exhilarated gave one sense of lightness good happening well being there be something in sight of that made colour clean perfect subtly luminous in instant of coming into one be exquisitely glad a only in rare moment when one be young joyful one can be glad in world everything be beautiful there wallace mused before went on telling see said with doubtful inflection of man who pause at incredible thing there be two great panther there yes spotted panther be not afraid there be long wide path with marble edged flower border on side two huge velvety beast be playing there with ball one looked up came towards little curious a seemed came right up to rubbed soft round ear very gently against small hand held out purred be tell enchanted garden know size oh stretched far wide way that believe there be hill far away heaven know where west kensington have suddenly got to somehow be just like coming home know in very moment door swung to behind forgot road with fallen chestnut leaf cab tradesman cart forgot sort of gravitational pull back to discipline obedience of home forgot hesitation fear forgot discretion forgot intimate reality of life became in moment very glad wonder happy little boy in world be world with different quality warmer more penetrating mellower light with faint clear gladness in air wisp of sun touched cloud in blueness of sky before ran long wide path invitingly with weedless bed on side rich with untended flower two great panther put little hand fearlessly on soft fur caressed round ear sensitive corner under ear played with be a though welcomed home there be keen sense of home coming in mind when presently tall fair girl appeared in pathway came to meet smiling said well to lifted kissed put down led by hand there be amazement only impression of delightful rightness of being reminded of happy thing have in strange way be overlooked there be broad red step remember that came into view between spike of delphinium up went to great avenue between very old shady dark tree down avenue know between red chapped stem be marble seat of honour statuary very tame friendly white dove along cool avenue girl friend led looking down recall pleasant line finely modelled chin of sweet kind face asking question in soft agreeable voice telling thing pleasant thing know though what be be never able to recall presently little capuchin monkey very clean with fur of ruddy brown kindly hazel eye came down tree to ran beside looking up at grinning presently leapt to shoulder so two went on way in great happiness paused go on said remember little thing passed old man musing among laurel remember place gay with paroquet came through broad shaded colonnade to spacious cool palace full of pleasant fountain full of beautiful thing full of quality promise of heart desire there be many thing many people still seem to stand out clearly be little vague people be beautiful kind in way dont know how be conveyed to that be kind to glad to have there filling with gladness by gesture by touch of hand by welcome love in eye yes mused for while playmate found there be very much to because be lonely little boy played delightful game in grass covered court where there be sun dial set about with flower a one played one loved odd there gap in memory dont remember game played never remembered afterwards a child spent long hour trying even with tear to recall form of happiness wanted to play over again in nursery by remember be happiness two dear playfellow who be most with then presently came sombre dark woman with grave pale face dreamy eye sombre woman wearing soft long robe of pale purple who carried book beckoned took aside with into gallery above hall though playmate be loath to have go ceased game stood watching a be carried away come back to cried come back to soon looked up at face heeded not at face be very gentle grave took to seat in gallery stood beside ready to look at book a opened upon knee page fell open pointed looked marvelling for in living page of book saw be story about in be thing have happened to since ever be born be wonderful to because page of book be not picture understand reality wallace paused gravely looked at doubtfully go on said understand be reality yes must have be people moved thing came went in dear mother whom have near forgotten then father stern upright servant nursery familiar thing of home then front door busy street with traffic to fro looked marvelled looked half doubtfully again into woman face turned page over skipping to see more of book more so at last came to myself hovering hesitating outside green door in long white wall felt again conflict fear next cried must have turned on cool hand of grave woman delayed next insisted struggled gently with hand pulling up finger with childish strength a yielded page came over bent down upon like shadow kissed brow page did not show enchanted garden panther girl who have led by hand playfellow who have be so loath to let go showed long gray street in west kensington in chill hour of afternoon before lamp be lit be there wretched little figure weeping aloud for must do to restrain be weeping because must not return to dear playfellow who have called after come back to come back to soon be there be page in book harsh reality enchanted place restraining hand of grave mother at whose knee stood have gone whither have gone halted again remained for time staring into fire oh woefulness of return murmured well said after minute so poor little wretch be brought back to gray world again a realised fullness

thrown fruit nothing be to be found of there among dewy grass faint intangible globe of dandelion down temptation of harringay be quite impossible to say whether thing really happened depends entirely on word of r m harringay who be artist following version of affair narrative deposes harringay went into studio about ten oclock to see what must make of head that have be working at day before head

turned to picture put speck of brown in corner of mouth shifted attention thence to pupil of eye then decided that chin be trifle too impassive for vigil presently put down impedimenta lighting pipe surveyed progress of work im hanged if thing isnt sneering at said harringay still belief sneered animation of figure have certainly increased scarcely in direction wished there be mistake about sneer vigil of unbeliever said harringay rather subtle clever left eyebrow isnt cynical enough went dabbed at eyebrow added little to lobe of ear to suggest materialism further consideration ensued vigil off im afraid said harringay why not mephistopheles thats bit too common friend of doge not so seedy armour wont do though too camelot how about scarlet robe call one of sacred college humour in appreciation of middle italian history there always benvenuto cellini said harringay with clever suggestion of gold cup in one corner must scarcely suit complexion describes a babbling in way in order

more alive than anything have ever painted before call portrait of gentleman said certain gentleman wont do said harringay still keeping up courage kind of thing call bad taste that sneer will have to come out that gone little more fire in eye never noticed how warm eye be before might do for what price passionate pilgrim that devilish face wont do side of channel little inaccuracy doe said eyebrow probably too oblique therewith pulling blind lower to get better light resuming palette brush face on canvas seemed animated by spirit of own where expression of diablerie came in found impossible to

something of courage of panic struck brush full of bright red athwart picture then very curious thing very strange thing indeed occurred if did occur diabolified italian before shut eye pursed mouth wiped colour off face with hand then red eye opened again with sound like opening of lip face smiled be rather hasty of said picture harringay state now that worst have happened self possession returned have saving persuasion that devil be reasonable creature why do keep moving about then said making face that sneering squinting while be painting dont said picture do said harringay said picture not said harringay be said picture dont go hitting with paint again because true have be trying to fluke expression on face morning really havent idea what picture ought to look like have said harringay have not said picture never have with picture always start with vaguest presentiment of what be going to do be to be something beautiful be sure of devout perhaps tragic beyond that be experiment chance dear fellow dont think can paint picture like now must be remembered that for what follows have only harringays word will paint picture exactly a like said harringay calmly seemed to disconcert picture little cant paint picture without inspiration remarked have inspiration for inspiration sneered sardonic figure fancy came from seeing organ grinder looking up at window vigil have have just started painting on chance of something coming thats what did when saw at came want talk with art with said picture poor business potter dont know how be dont seem able to throw soul into

studio to filled number twelve hoghair with red paint true artist said picture be always ignorant man artist who theorises about work be no longer artist critic wagner say whats red paint for im going to paint out said harringay dont want to hear tommy rot if think just because im artist by trade im going to talk studio to make precious mistake one minute said picture evidently alarmed want to make offer genuine offer right what im saying lack inspiration well doubt youve heard of cathedral of cologne devil bridge rubbish said harringay do think want to go to perdition simply for pleasure of painting good picture getting slated take that blood be up danger only nerved to action so say so planted dab of vermilion in creature mouth italian spluttered tried to wipe off evidently horribly surprised then according to harringay there began very remarkable struggle harringay splashing away with red paint picture wriggling about wiping off a fast a put on two masterpiece said demon two

little while faint stirring beneath surface puckered slightly here there presently even that died away thing be perfectly still then harringay according to harringays account lit pipe sat down stared at enamelled canvas tried to make out clearly what have happened then walked round behind to see if back of be at remarkable then be began to regret have not photographed devil before painted out be harringays story not mine support by small canvas by enamelled pale green by violent asseveration be also true that never have produced masterpiece in opinion of intimate friend probably never will mr

facetious stranger have by wealth of shameless self exposure become possible confidant have be bitten by desire to show that too have lived felt many thing fever be upon be certainly confoundedly allusive at first eagerness to clear up with few precise question be only equalled controlled by anxiety not to get to sort of thing too soon in meeting so basis of confidence be complete from first to last think got most of item aspect indeed got quite number of time over almost everything that mr skelmersdale with very limited power of narration will ever be able to tell so come to story of adventure piece together again whether really happened whether imagined dreamt fell upon in strange hallucinatory trance profess to say that invented will not for one moment entertain man simply honestly belief thing happened a say happened be transparently incapable of lie so elaborate sustained in belief of simple yet often keenly penetrating rustic mind about find very strong confirmation of sincerity belief nobody can produce positive fact to falsify belief a for with much of endorsement transmit story be little old now to justify explain say went to sleep on aldington knoll about ten oclock one night be quite possibly midsummer night though have never thought of date can not be sure within week so be fine night windless with rising moon have be at pain to visit knoll thrice since story grew up under persuasion once went there in twilight summer moonrise on what be perhaps similar night to of adventure jupiter be great splendid above moon in north north west sky be green

went there sat down to think over so sulking grieving be overtaken by sleep so fell into fairy power quarrel have upset be trivial matter enough between girl at clapton hill to whom be engaged be farmer daughter said skelmersdale very respectable doubt excellent match for girl lover be very young with just mutual jealousy intolerantly keen edge of criticism that irrational hunger for beautiful perfection that life wisdom do presently most mercifully dull what precise matter of quarrel be have idea may have said liked men in gaiter when hadnt gaiter on may have said liked better in different sort of hat however began got by series of clumsy stage to bitterness tear doubt got tearful smeary grew dusty drooping parted with invidious comparison grave doubt whether ever have really cared for clear certainty must never care again with sort of thing upon mind came out upon aldington knoll grieving presently after long interval perhaps quite inexplicably fell asleep woke to find on softer turf than ever have slept on before under shade of very dark tree completely hid sky always indeed in fairyland sky be hidden seems except for one night when fairy be dancing mr skelmersdale during time with never saw star of night be in doubt whether be in fairyland proper out where ring rush be in low meadow near railway line at smeeth be light under tree for on leaf amidst turf shone multitude of glow worm very bright fine mr skelmersdales first impression be that be small next that quite number of people still smaller be standing about for reason say be neither surprised

time fancy sort of demure joyousness radiated from lady be in company of delightful person a guest chosen companion of delightful person mr skelmersdale set out to be taken into intimacy of fairyland welcomed gladly little warmly suspect pressure of hand in of hers lit face to after ten year ago young skelmersdale may have be very comely youth once took arm once think led by hand adown glade that glow worm lit just how thing chanced happened there be telling from mr skelmersdales disarticulated skeleton of description give little unsatisfactory glimpse of strange corner doings of place where there be many fairy together of toadstool thing shone pink of fairy food of must only say must have tasted of fairy music like little musical box came out of nodding flower there be great open place where fairy rode raced on thing what mr skelmersdale meant by here thing rode there be telling larv perhaps cricket little beetle elude so abundantly there be place where water splashed gigantic kingcup grew there in hotter time fairy bathed together there be game being played dancing much elvish love making too think among moss branch thicket there can be doubt that fairy lady made love to mr skelmersdale doubt that young man set to resist time came indeed when sat on bank beside in quiet secluded place smelling of vilets talked to of love when voice went low whispered said mr skelmersdale laid er on know came close with soft warm friendly way ad be a much a must do to keep ead seems kept head to certain limited unfortunate extent saw ow wind be blowing say so sitting there in place smelling of violet with touch of lovely fairy lady about mr skelmersdale broke to gently that be engaged have told loved dearly that be sweet human lad for whatever must ask of must have even heart desire mr skelmersdale who fancy tried hard to avoid looking at little lip a just dropped apart came together led up to more intimate question by saying must like enough capital to start little

thats a good a done will feel have money just a wish now know must kiss mr skelmersdale pretended not to hear latter part of remark said be very kind that really didnt deserve must be so kind fairy lady suddenly came quite close to whispered kiss said mr skelmersdale like fool did there be kiss kiss be told must have be quite other sort from millies resonant signal of regard there be something magic in kiss assuredly marked turning point at rate be one of passage that thought sufficiently important to describe most at length have tried to get right have tried to disentangle from hint gesture through came to have doubt that be different from telling far finer sweeter in soft filtered light subtly stirring silence of fairy glade fairy lady asked more about millie be very lovely so on great many time a to millies loveliness conceive answering that be right then on such occasion fairy lady told have fallen in love with a slept in moonlight so have be brought into fairyland have thought not knowing of millie that perhaps might chance to love now know cant said so must stop with just little while then must go back to millie told that know skelmersdale be already in love with pure inertia of mind kept in way be going imagine sitting in sort of stupefaction amidst glowing beautiful thing answering about millie little shop projected need of horse cart that absurd state of affair must have gone on for day day see little lady hovering about trying to amuse too dainty to understand complexity too tender to let go know hypnotised a be by earthly position went way with hither thither blind to everything in fairyland wonderful intimacy have come to be hard be impossible to give in print effect of radiant sweetness shining through jungle of poor skelmersdales rough broken sentence to at least shone clear amidst muddle of story like glow worm in tangle of weed there must have be many day of thing while be happening once say danced under moonlight in fairy ring stud meadow near smeeth at last came to end led into great cavernous place lit by red nightlight sort of thing where there be coffer piled on coffer cup golden box great heap of what certainly seemed

order to understand clearly be necessary to go back to experiment with mr vincey before remarkable attack mr bessel first attempt at self projection in experiment with mr vincey be a reader will remember unsuccessful through of be concentrating power will upon getting out of body willing with might say at last almost against expectation came success mr bessel asserts that being alive did actually by effort of will leave body pas into place state outside world release be asserts instantaneous at one moment be seated in chair with eye tightly shut hand gripping arm of chair doing must to concentrate mind on vincey then perceived outside body saw body near certainly not containing with hand relaxing head drooping forward on breast nothing shake in assurance of release describes in

express way anchored to body appeared to at first a if have discovered greater self of conscious being in brain be only little part saw albany piccadilly regent street room place in house very minute very bright distinct spread out below like little city seen from balloon now then vague shape like drifting wreath of smoke made vision little indistinct at first paid little heed to thing astonished most astonishes still be that saw quite distinctly inside of house a well a street saw little people dining talking in private house men woman dining playing billiards drinking in restaurant hotel several place of entertainment crammed with people be like watching affair of glass hive such be mr bessel exact word a took down when told story quite forgetful of mr vincey remained for space observing thing impelled by curiosity say stooped down with shadowy arm found possessed of attempted to touch man walking along vigo street must not do so though finger seemed to pas through man something prevented doing what be find hard to describe compare obstacle to sheet of glass felt a kitten may feel said when go for first time to pat reflection in mirror again again on occasion when heard tell story mr bessel returned to comparison of sheet of glass be not altogether precise comparison because a reader will speedily see there be interruption of generally impermeable resistance mean of getting through barrier to material world again naturally there be very great difficulty in expressing unprecedented impression in language of everyday experience thing impressed instantly weighed upon throughout experience be stillness of place be in world without sound at first mr bessel mental state be unemotional wonder thought chiefly concerned with where might be be out of body out of material body at rate be not all belief for one believe also that be somewhere out of space a understand altogether by strenuous effort of will have passed out of body into world beyond world world undreamt of yet lying so close to so strangely situated with regard to that thing on earth be clearly visible from without from within in other world about for long time a seemed to realisation occupied mind to exclusion of other matter then recalled engagement with mr vincey to astonishing experience be after prelude turned mind to locomotion in new body in found for time be unable to shift from attachment to earthly carcass for time new strange cloud body of simply swayed contracted expanded coiled writhed with effort to free then quite suddenly link bound snapped for moment everything be hidden by what appeared to be whirling sphere of dark vapour then through momentary gap saw drooping body collapse limply saw lifeless head drop sideways found be driving along like huge cloud in strange place of shadowy cloud have luminous intricacy of london spread like model below now be aware that fluctuating vapour about be something more than vapour temerarious excitement of first essay be shot with fear for perceived at first indistinctly then suddenly very clearly that be surrounded by face that roll coil of seeming cloud stuff be face such face face of thin shadow face of gaseous tenuity face like face glare with intolerable strangeness upon sleeper in evil hour of dream evil greedy eye be full of covetous curiosity face with knit brow snarling smiling lip vague hand clutched at mr bessel a passed rest of body be elusive streak of trailing darkness never word said never sound from mouth seemed to gibber about pressed in dreamy silence passing freely through dim mistiness be body gathering ever more numerously about shadowy mr bessel now suddenly fear stricken drove through silent active multitude of eye clutching hand so inhuman be face so malignant staring eye shadowy clawing gesture that did not occur to mr bessel to attempt intercourse with drifting creature idiot phantom seemed child of vain desire being unborn forbidden boon of being whose only expression gesture told of envy craving for life be one link with existence say much for resolution amidst swarming cloud of noiseless spirit of evil must still think of mr vincey made violent effort of will found knew not how stooping towards staple inn saw vincey sitting attentive alert in arm chair by fire clustering also about a clustered ever about life breathes be multitude of vain voiceless shadow longing desiring seeking loophole into life for space mr bessel sought ineffectually to attract friend attention tried to get in front of eye to move object in room to touch mr vincey remained unaffected ignorant of being be so close to own strange something mr bessel have compared to sheet of glass separated impermeably at last mr bessel did desperate thing have told how in strange way must see not only outside of man a see within extended shadowy hand thrust vague black finger a seemed through heedless brain then suddenly mr vincey started like man who recall attention from wandering thought seemed to mr bessel that little dark red body situated in middle of mr vinceys brain swelled glowed a did so since experience have be shown anatomical figure of brain know now that be that useless structure a doctor call pineal eye for strange a will seem to many have deep in brain where can not possibly see earthly light eye at time with rest of internal anatomy of brain be quite new to at sight of changed appearance however thrust forth finger rather fearful still of consequence touched little spot instantly mr vincey started mr bessel knew that be seen at instant came to mr bessel that evil have happened to body behold great wind blew through world of shadow tore away so strong be persuasion that thought no more of mr vincey turned about forthwith countless face drove back with like leaf before gale returned too late in instant saw body that have left inert collapsed lying indeed like body of man just dead have arisen by virtue of strength will beyond own stood with staring eye stretching limb in dubious fashion for moment watched in wild dismay then stooped towards pane of glass have closed against again be foiled beat passionately against about spirit of evil grinned pointed mocked gave way to furious anger compare to bird have fluttered heedlessly into room be beating at window pane hold back from freedom behold little body have once be be now dancing with delight saw shouting though must not hear shout saw violence of movement grow watched fling cherished furniture about in mad delight of existence rend book apart smash bottle drink heedlessly from jagged fragment leap smite in passionate acceptance of living watched action in paralysed astonishment then once more hurled against impassable barrier then with crew of mocking ghost about hurried back in dire confusion to vincey to tell of outrage have come upon brain of vincey be now closed against apparition disembodied mr bessel pursued in vain a hurried out into holborn to call cab foiled terror stricken mr bessel swept back again to find desecrated body whooping in glorious frenzy down burlington arcade now attentive reader begin to understand mr bessel interpretation of first part of strange story being whose frantic rush through london have inflicted so much injury disaster have indeed mr bessel body be not mr bessel be evil spirit out of strange world beyond existence into mr bessel have so rashly ventured for twenty hour held possession of for twenty hour dispossessed spirit body of mr bessel be going to fro in unheard of middle world of shadow seeking help in vain spent many hour beating at mind of mr vincey of friend mr hart a know roused by effort language might convey situation to helper across gulf did not know feeble finger groped vainly powerlessly in brain once indeed a have already told be able to turn mr vincey aside from path so that encountered stolen body in career must not make understand thing have happened be unable to draw help from encounter through hour persuasion be overwhelming in mr bessel mind that presently body must be killed by furious tenant must have to remain in shadow land for evermore so that long hour be growing agony of fear ever a hurried to fro in ineffectual excitement innumerable spirit of world about mobbed confused mind ever envious applauding multitude poured after successful fellow a went upon glorious career for that must seem must be life of bodiless thing of world be shadow of world ever watch coveting way into mortal body in order that may descend a fury frenzy a violent lust mad strange impulse rejoicing in body have won for mr bessel be not only human soul in place witness fact that met first one afterwards several shadow of men men like seemed who have lost body even may be a have lost wandered despairingly in lost world be life death must not speak because world be silent yet knew for men because of dim human body because of sadness of face how have come into world must not tell where body have lost might be whether still raved about earth whether be closed for ever in death against return that be spirit of dead believe doctor wilson paget think be rational soul of men who be lost in madness on earth at last mr bessel chanced upon place where little crowd of such disembodied silent creature be gathered thrusting through saw below brightly lit room four five quiet gentleman woman stoutish woman dressed in black bombazine sitting awkwardly in chair with head thrown back knew from portrait to be mr bullock medium perceived that tract structure in brain glowed stirred a have seen pineal eye in brain of mr vincey glow light be very fitful sometimes be broad illumination sometimes merely faint twilight spot shifted slowly about brain kept on talking writing with one hand mr bessel saw that crowding shadow of men about great multitude of shadow spirit of shadow land be striving thrusting to touch lighted region of brain a one gained brain be thrust away voice writing of hand changed so that what said be disorderly confused for most part now fragment of one soul message now fragment of anothers now babbled insane fancy of spirit of vain desire then mr bessel understood that spoke for spirit have touch of began to struggle very furiously towards be on outside of crowd at time must not reach at last growing anxious went away to find what have happened meanwhile to body for long time went to fro seeking in vain fearing that must have be killed then found at bottom of shaft in baker street writhing furiously cursing with pain leg arm two rib have be broken by fall moreover evil spirit be angry because time have be so short because of pain making violent movement casting body about at mr bessel returned with redoubled earnestness to room where sance be going on so soon a have thrust within sight of place saw one of men who stood about medium looking at watch a if meant that sance must presently end at great number of shadow who have be striving turned away with gesture of despair thought that sance be almost over only made mr bessel more earnest struggled so stoutly with will against others presently gained woman brain chanced that just at moment glowed very brightly in instant wrote message doctor wilson paget preserved then other shadow cloud of evil spirit about have thrust mr bessel away from for rest of sance must regain more so went back watched through long hour at bottom of shaft where evil spirit lay in stolen body have maimed writhing cursing weeping groaning learning lesson of pain towards dawn thing have waited for happened brain glowed brightly evil spirit came out mr bessel entered body have feared must never enter again a did so silence brooding silence ended heard tumult of traffic voice of people overhead that strange world be shadow of world dark silent shadow of ineffectual desire shadow of lost men vanished clean away lay there for space of about three hour before be
