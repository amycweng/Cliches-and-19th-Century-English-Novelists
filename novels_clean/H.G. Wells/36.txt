appropriate phrase proved yet next day there be nothing of in paper except little note in daily telegraph world went in ignorance of one of gravest danger ever threatened human race might not have heard of eruption at have not met ogilvy well known astronomer at ottershaw be immensely excited at news in excess of feeling invited up to take turn with night in scrutiny of red planet in spite of

there be light in upper window of house a people went to bed from railway station in distance came sound of shunting train ringing rumbling softened almost into melody by distance wife pointed out to brightness of red green yellow signal light hanging in framework against sky seemed so safe tranquil ii falling star then came night of first falling star be seen early in morning rushing over winchester eastward line of flame high in atmosphere hundred must have seen taken for ordinary falling star albin described a leaving greenish streak behind glowed for second denning greatest authority on meteorite stated that height of first appearance be about ninety one hundred mile seemed to that fell to earth about one hundred mile east of be at home at hour writing in study although french window face towards ottershaw blind be up for loved in day to look up at night sky saw nothing of yet strangest of thing ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while be sitting there visible to have only looked up a passed of who saw flight say travelled with hissing sound heard nothing of many people in berkshire surrey middlesex must have seen fall of at most have thought that meteorite have descended no one seems to have troubled to look for fallen mass night very early in morning poor ogilvy who have seen shooting star who be persuaded that meteorite lay somewhere on common between horsell ottershaw woking rose early with idea of finding find did soon after dawn not far from sand pit enormous hole have be made by impact of projectile sand gravel have be flung violently in direction over heath forming heap visible mile half away heather be on fire eastward thin blue smoke rose against dawn thing lay almost entirely buried in sand amidst scattered splinter of fir tree have shivered to fragment in descent uncovered part have appearance of huge cylinder caked over outline softened by thick scaly dun coloured incrustation have diameter of about thirty yard approached mass surprised at size more so at shape since most meteorite be rounded more le completely be however still so hot from flight through air a to forbid near approach stirring noise within cylinder ascribed to unequal cooling of surface for at time have not occurred to that might be hollow remained standing at edge of pit that thing have made for staring at strange appearance astonished chiefly at unusual shape colour dimly perceiving even then evidence of design in arrival early morning be wonderfully still sun just clearing pine tree towards weybridge be already warm did not remember hearing bird that morning there be certainly no breeze stirring only sound be faint movement from within cindery cylinder be alone on common then suddenly noticed with start that of grey clinker ashy incrustation covered meteorite be falling off circular edge of end be dropping off in flake raining down upon sand large piece suddenly came off fell with sharp noise brought heart into mouth for minute scarcely realised what meant although heat be excessive clambered down into pit close to bulk to see thing more clearly fancied even then that cooling of body might account for what disturbed idea be fact that ash be falling only from end of cylinder then perceived that very slowly circular top of cylinder be rotating on body be such gradual movement that discovered only through noticing that black mark have be near five minute ago be now at other side of circumference even then scarcely understood what indicated until heard muffled grating sound saw black mark jerk forward inch so then thing came upon in flash cylinder be artificialhollowwith end screwed out something within cylinder be unscrewing top good heaven said ogilvy there man in itmen in half roasted to death trying to escape at once with quick mental leap linked thing with flash upon mar thought of confined creature be so dreadful to that forgot heat went forward to cylinder to help turn luckily dull radiation arrested before must burn hand on still glowing metal at that stood irresolute for moment then turned scrambled out of pit set off running wildly into woking time then must have be somewhere about six oclock met waggoner tried to make understand tale told appearance be so wildhis hat have fallen off in pitthat man simply drove on be equally unsuccessful with potman who be just unlocking door of public house by horsell bridge fellow thought be lunatic at large made unsuccessful attempt to shut into taproom sobered little when saw london journalist in garden called over paling made understood henderson called saw that shooting star last night well said henderson out on horsell common now good lord said henderson fallen meteorite thats good something more than meteorite cylinderan artificial cylinder man there something inside henderson stood up with spade in hand whats that said be deaf in one ear ogilvy told that have seen henderson be minute so taking in then dropped spade snatched up jacket came out into road two men hurried back at once to common found cylinder still lying in same position now sound inside have ceased thin circle of bright metal showed between top body of cylinder air be entering escaping at rim with thin sizzling sound listened rapped on scaly burnt metal with stick meeting with response concluded man men inside must be insensible dead of course two be quite unable to do anything shouted consolation promise went off back to town again to get help one can imagine covered with sand excited disordered running up little street in bright sunlight just a shop folk be taking down shutter people be opening bedroom window henderson went into railway station at once in order to telegraph news to london newspaper article have prepared men mind for reception of idea by eight oclock number of boy unemployed men have already started for common to see dead men from mar be form story took heard of first from newspaper boy about quarter to nine when went out to get daily chronicle be naturally startled lost time in going out across ottershaw bridge to sand pit iii on horsell common found little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding huge hole in cylinder lay have already described appearance of colossal bulk embedded in ground turf gravel about seemed charred a if by sudden explosion doubt impact have caused flash of fire henderson ogilvy be not there think perceived that nothing be to be done for present have gone away to breakfast at hendersons house there be four five boy sitting on edge of pit with foot dangling amusing themselvesuntil stopped themby throwing stone at giant mass after have spoken to about began playing at touch in out of group of bystander among be couple of cyclist jobbing gardener employed sometimes girl carrying baby gregg butcher little boy two three loafer golf caddy who be accustomed to hang about railway station there be very little talking few of common people in england have anything vaguest astronomical idea in day most of be staring quietly at big table like end of cylinder be still a ogilvy henderson have left fancy popular expectation of heap of charred corps be disappointed at inanimate bulk went away while be there other people came clambered into pit fancied heard faint movement under foot top have certainly ceased to rotate be only when got thus close to that strangeness of object be at evident to at first glance be really no more exciting than overturned carriage tree blown across road not so much so indeed looked like rusty gas float required certain amount of scientific education to perceive that grey scale of thing be common oxide that yellowish white metal gleamed in crack between lid cylinder have unfamiliar hue extra terrestrial have meaning for most of onlooker at time be quite clear in own mind that thing have come from planet mar judged improbable that contained living creature thought unscrewing might be automatic in spite of ogilvy still believed that there be men in mar mind ran fancifully on possibility of containing manuscript on difficulty in translation might arise whether must find coin model in so forth be little too large for assurance on idea felt impatience to see opened about eleven a nothing seemed happening walked back full of such thought to home in maybury found difficult to get to work upon abstract investigation in afternoon appearance of common have altered very much early edition of evening paper have startled london with enormous headline message received from mar remarkable story from woking so forth in addition ogilvys wire to astronomical exchange have roused observatory in three kingdom there be dozen fly more from woking station standing in road by sand pit basket chaise from chobham rather lordly carriage besides that there be quite heap of bicycle in addition large number of people must have walked in spite of heat of day from woking chertsey so that there be altogether quite considerable crowdone two gaily dressed lady among others be glaringly hot not cloud in sky breath of wind only shadow be that of few scattered pine tree burning heather have be extinguished level ground towards ottershaw be blackened a far a one must see still giving off vertical streamer of smoke enterprising sweet stuff dealer in chobham road have sent up son with barrow load of green apple ginger beer going to edge of pit found occupied by group of about dozen menhenderson ogilvy tall fair haired man that afterwards learned be stent astronomer royal with several workman wielding spade pickax stent be giving direction in clear high pitched voice be standing on cylinder be now evidently much cooler face be crimson streaming with perspiration something seemed to have irritated large portion of cylinder have be uncovered though lower end be still embedded a soon a ogilvy saw among staring crowd on edge of pit called to to come down asked if must mind going over to see lord hilton lord of manor growing crowd said be becoming serious impediment to excavation especially boy wanted light railing put up help to keep people back told that faint stirring be occasionally still audible within case that workman have failed to unscrew top a afforded grip to case appeared to be enormously thick be possible that faint sound heard represented noisy tumult in interior be very glad to do a asked so become one of privileged spectator within contemplated enclosure failed to find lord hilton at house be told be expected from london by six oclock train from waterloo a be then about quarter past five went home have tea walked up to station to waylay iv cylinder open when returned to common sun be setting scattered group be hurrying from direction of woking one two person be returning crowd about pit have increased stood out black against lemon yellow of skya couple of hundred people perhaps there be raised voice sort of struggle appeared to be going on about pit strange imaginings passed through mind a drew nearer heard stent voice keep back keep back boy came running towards movin said to a passed screwin screwin out dont like im goin ome be went on to crowd there be really must think two three hundred people elbowing jostling one one two lady there being by mean least active he fallen in pit cried one keep back said several crowd swayed little elbowed way through one seemed greatly excited peculiar humming sound from pit say said ogilvy help keep idiot back dont know whats in confounded thing know saw young man shop assistant in woking believe be standing on cylinder trying to scramble out of hole again crowd have pushed in end of cylinder be being screwed out from within nearly two foot of shining screw projected somebody blundered against narrowly missed being pitched onto top of screw turned a did so screw must have come out for lid of cylinder fell upon gravel with ringing concussion stuck elbow into person behind turned head towards thing again for moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black have sunset in eye think everyone expected to see man emergepossibly something little unlike terrestrial men in essential man know did looking presently saw something stirring within shadow greyish billowy movement one above then two luminous diskslike eye then something resembling little grey snake about thickness of walking stick coiled up out of writhing middle wriggled in air towards meand then sudden chill came over there be loud shriek from woman behind half turned keeping eye fixed upon cylinder still from other tentacle be now projecting began pushing way back from edge of pit saw astonishment giving place to horror on face of people about heard inarticulate exclamation on side there be general movement backwards saw shopman struggling still on edge of pit found alone saw people on other side of pit running off stent among looked again at cylinder ungovernable terror gripped stood petrified staring big greyish rounded size perhaps of bear be rising slowly painfully out of cylinder a bulged up caught light glistened like wet two large dark coloured eye be regarding steadfastly mass framed head of thing be rounded have one might say face there be mouth under eye lipless brim of quivered panted dropped saliva whole creature heaved pulsated convulsively lank tentacular appendage gripped edge of cylinder swayed in air who have never seen living martian can scarcely imagine strange horror of appearance peculiar v shaped mouth with pointed upper lip absence of brow ridge absence of chin beneath wedgelike lower lip incessant quivering of mouth gorgon group of tentacle tumultuous breathing of lung in strange atmosphere evident heaviness painfulness of movement due to greater gravitational energy of earthabove extraordinary intensity of immense eyeswere at once vital intense inhuman crippled monstrous there be something fungoid in oily brown skin something in clumsy deliberation of tedious movement unspeakably nasty even at first encounter first glimpse be overcome with disgust dread suddenly monster vanished have toppled over brim of cylinder fallen into pit with thud like fall of great mass of leather heard give peculiar thick cry forthwith of creature appeared darkly in deep shadow of aperture turned running madly made for first group of tree perhaps hundred yard away ran slantingly stumbling for must not avert face from thing there among young pine tree furze bush stopped panting waited further development common round sand pit be dotted with people standing like in half fascinated terror staring at creature rather at heaped gravel at edge of pit in lay then with renewed horror saw round black object bobbing up down on edge of pit be head of shopman who have fallen in showing a little black object against hot western sun now got shoulder knee up again seemed to slip back until only head be visible suddenly vanished must have fancied faint shriek have reached have momentary impulse to go back help that fear overruled everything be then quite invisible hidden by deep pit heap of sand that fall of cylinder have made anyone coming along road from chobham woking must have be amazed at sighta dwindling multitude of perhaps hundred people more standing in great irregular circle in ditch behind bush behind gate hedge saying little to one that in short excited shout staring staring hard at few heap of sand barrow of ginger beer stood queer derelict black against burning sky in sand pit be row of deserted vehicle with horse feeding out of nosebag pawing ground v heat ray after glimpse have have of martian emerging from cylinder in have come to earth from planet kind of fascination paralysed action remained standing knee deep in heather staring at mound hid be battleground of fear curiosity did not dare to go back towards pit felt passionate longing to peer into began walking therefore in big curve seeking point of vantage continually looking at sand heap that hid new comer to earth once leash of thin black whip like arm of octopus flashed across sunset be immediately withdrawn afterwards thin rod rose up joint by joint bearing at apex circular disk that spun with wobbling motion what must be going on there most of spectator have gathered in one two groupsone little crowd towards woking other knot of people in direction of chobham evidently shared mental conflict there be few near one man approachedhe be perceived neighbour of mine though did not know nameand accosted be scarcely time for articulate conversation what ugly brute said good god what ugly brute repeated over over again did see man in pit said made answer to that became silent stood watching for time side by side deriving fancy certain comfort in one anothers company then shifted position to little knoll gave advantage of yard more of elevation when looked for presently be walking towards woking sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened crowd far away on left towards woking seemed to grow heard now faint murmur from little knot of people towards chobham dispersed there be scarcely intimation of movement from pit be a much a anything gave people courage suppose new arrival from woking also helped to restore confidence at rate a dusk came on slow intermittent movement upon sand pit began movement seemed to gather force a stillness of evening about cylinder remained unbroken vertical black figure in two three must advance stop watch advance again spreading out a did so in thin irregular crescent promised to enclose pit in attenuated horn too on side began to move towards pit then saw cabman others have walked boldly into sand pit heard clatter of hoof gride of wheel saw lad trundling off barrow of apple then within thirty yard of pit advancing from direction of horsell noted little black knot of men foremost of whom be waving white flag be deputation there have be hasty consultation since martian be evidently in spite of repulsive form intelligent creature have be resolved to show by approaching with signal that too be intelligent flutter flutter went flag first to right then to left be too far for to recognise anyone there afterwards learned that ogilvy stent henderson be with others in attempt at communication little group have in advance dragged inward so to speak circumference of now almost complete circle of people number of dim black figure followed at discreet distance suddenly there be flash of light quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of pit in three distinct puff drove up one after other straight into still air smoke flame perhaps must be better word for be so bright that deep blue sky overhead hazy stretch of brown common towards chertsey set with black pine tree seemed to darken abruptly a puff arose to remain darker after dispersal at same time faint hissing sound became audible beyond pit stood little wedge of people with white flag at apex arrested by phenomenon little knot of small vertical black shape upon black ground a green smoke arose face flashed out pallid green faded again a vanished then slowly hissing passed into humming into long loud droning noise slowly humped shape rose out of pit ghost of beam of light seemed to flicker out from forthwith flash of actual flame bright glare leaping from one to sprang from scattered group of men be a if invisible jet impinged upon flashed into white flame be a if man be suddenly momentarily turned to fire then by light of own destruction saw staggering falling supporter turning to run stood staring not a yet realising that be death leaping from man to man in little distant crowd felt be that be something very strange almost noiseless blinding flash of light man fell headlong lay still a unseen shaft of heat passed over pine tree burst into fire dry furze bush became with one dull thud mass of flame far away towards knaphill saw flash of tree hedge wooden building suddenly set alight be sweeping round swiftly steadily flaming death invisible inevitable sword of heat perceived coming towards by flashing bush touched be too astounded stupefied to stir crackle of fire in sand pit sudden squeal of horse be a suddenly stilled then be a if invisible yet intensely heated finger be drawn through heather between martian along curving line beyond sand pit dark ground smoked crackled something fell with crash far away to left where road from woking station open out on common forth with hissing humming ceased black dome like object sank slowly out of sight into pit have happened with such swiftness have stood motionless dumbfounded dazzled by flash of light have that death swept through full circle must inevitably have slain in surprise passed spared left night about suddenly dark unfamiliar undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness except where roadway lay grey pale under deep blue sky of early night be dark suddenly void of men overhead star be mustering in west sky be still pale bright almost greenish blue top of pine tree roof of horsell came out sharp black against western afterglow martian appliance be altogether invisible save for thin mast upon restless mirror wobbled patch of bush isolated tree here there smoked glowed still house towards woking station be sending up spire of flame into stillness of evening air nothing be changed save for terrible astonishment little group of black speck with flag of white have be swept out of existence stillness of evening so seemed to have scarcely be broken came to that be upon dark common helpless unprotected alone suddenly like thing falling upon from without camefear with effort turned began stumbling run through heather fear felt be rational fear panic terror not only of martian of dusk stillness about such extraordinary effect in unmanning have that ran weeping silently a child might do once have turned did not dare to look back remember felt extraordinary persuasion be being played with presently when be upon very verge of safety mysterious deathas swift a passage of lightwould leap after from pit about cylinder strike down vi heat ray in chobham road be still matter of wonder how martian be able to slay men so swiftly so silently many think that in way be able to generate intense heat in chamber of practically absolute non conductivity intense heat project in parallel beam against object choose by mean of polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition much a parabolic mirror of lighthouse project beam of light one have absolutely proved detail however be done be certain that beam of heat be essence of matter heat invisible instead of visible light be combustible flash into flame at touch lead run like water softens iron crack melt glass when fall upon water incontinently explodes into steam night nearly forty people lay under starlight about pit charred distorted beyond recognition night long common from horsell to maybury be deserted brightly ablaze news of massacre probably reached chobham woking ottershaw about same time in woking shop have closed when tragedy happened number of people shop people so forth attracted by story have heard be walking over horsell bridge along road between hedge run out at last upon common may imagine young people brushed up after labour of day making novelty a must make novelty excuse for walking together enjoying trivial flirtation may figure to yourself hum of voice along road in gloaming a yet of course few people in woking even knew that cylinder have opened though poor henderson have sent messenger on bicycle to post office with special wire to evening paper a folk came out by two three upon open found little knot of people talking excitedly peering at spinning mirror over sand pit newcomer be doubt soon infected by excitement of occasion by half past eight when deputation be destroyed there may have be crowd of three hundred people more at place besides who have left road to approach martian nearer there be three policeman too one of whom be mounted doing best under instruction from stent to keep people back deter from approaching cylinder there be booing from more thoughtless excitable soul to whom crowd be always occasion for noise horse play stent ogilvy anticipating possibility of collision have telegraphed from horsell to barrack a soon a martian emerged for help of company of soldier to protect strange creature from violence after returned to lead ill fated advance description of death a be seen by crowd tally very closely with own impression three puff of green smoke deep humming note flash of flame that crowd of people have far narrower escape than mine only fact that hummock of heathery sand intercepted lower part of heat ray saved have elevation of parabolic mirror be few yard higher none must have lived to tell tale saw flash men falling invisible hand a be lit bush a hurried towards through twilight then with whistling note that rose above droning of pit beam swung close over head lighting top of beech tree line road splitting brick smashing window firing window frame bringing down in crumbling ruin portion of gable of house nearest corner in sudden thud hiss glare of igniting tree panic stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for moment spark burning twig began to fall into road single leaf like puff of flame hat dress caught fire then came cry from common there be shriek shout suddenly mounted policeman came galloping through confusion with hand clasped over head screaming theyre coming woman shrieked incontinently everyone be turning pushing at behind in order to clear way to woking again must have bolted a blindly a flock of sheep where road grows narrow black between high bank crowd jammed desperate struggle occurred that crowd did not escape three person at least two woman little boy be crushed trampled there left to die amid terror darkness vii how reached home for own part remember nothing of flight except stress of blundering against tree stumbling through heather about gathered invisible terror of martian pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to fro

louder at same time far away in southeast mast upperworks of three ironclad rose one after other out of sea beneath cloud of black smoke brother attention speedily reverted to distant firing in south fancied saw column of smoke rising out of distant grey haze little steamer be already flapping way eastward of big crescent of shipping low essex coast be growing blue hazy when martian appeared small faint in remote distance advancing along muddy coast from direction of foulness at that captain on bridge swore at top of voice with fear anger at own delay paddle seemed infected with terror soul aboard stood at bulwark on seat of steamer stared at distant shape higher than tree church tower inland advancing with leisurely parody of human stride be first martian brother have seen stood more amazed than terrified watching titan advancing deliberately towards shipping wading farther farther into water a coast fell away then far away beyond crouch came striding over stunted tree then yet

almost to waterline douche of spray blinded brother for moment when eye be clear again saw monster have passed be rushing landward big iron upperworks rose out of headlong structure from twin funnel projected spat smoking blast shot with fire be torpedo ram thunder child steaming headlong coming to rescue of threatened shipping keeping footing on heaving deck by clutching bulwark brother looked past charging leviathan at martian again saw three of now close together standing so far out to sea that tripod support be almost entirely submerged thus sunken seen in remote perspective appeared far le formidable than huge iron bulk in whose wake steamer be pitching so helplessly must seem be regarding new antagonist with astonishment to intelligence may be giant be even such a thunder child fired gun simply drove full speed towards be probably not firing that enabled to get so near enemy a did did not know what to make of one shell must have sent to bottom forthwith with heat ray be steaming at pace that in minute seemed halfway between steamboat martiansa diminishing black bulk against receding horizontal expanse of essex coast suddenly foremost martian lowered tube discharged canister of black gas at ironclad hit larboard side glanced off in inky jet rolled away to seaward unfolding torrent of black smoke from ironclad drove clear to watcher from steamer low in water with sun in eye seemed a though be already among martian saw gaunt figure separating rising out of water a retreated shoreward one of raised camera like generator of heat ray held pointing obliquely downward bank of steam sprang from water at touch must have driven through iron of ship side like white hot iron rod through paper flicker of flame went up through rising steam then martian reeled staggered in moment be cut down great body of water steam shot high in air gun of thunder child sounded through reek going off one after other one shot splashed water high close by steamer ricocheted towards other flying ship to north smashed smack to matchwood one heeded that very much at sight of martian collapse captain on bridge yelled inarticulately crowding passenger on steamer stern shouted

nothing of thunder child must be made out must third martian be seen ironclad to seaward be now quite close standing in towards shore past steamboat little vessel continued to beat way seaward ironclad receded slowly towards coast be hidden still by marbled bank of vapour part steam part black gas eddying combining in strangest way fleet of refugee be scattering to northeast several smack be sailing between ironclad steamboat after time before reached sinking cloud bank warship turned northward then abruptly went about passed into thickening haze of evening coast grew faint at last indistinguishable amid low bank of cloud be gathering about sinking sun then suddenly out of golden haze of sunset came vibration of gun form of black shadow moving everyone struggled to rail of steamer peered into blinding furnace of west nothing be to be distinguished clearly mass of smoke rose slanting barred face of sun steamboat throbbed on way through interminable suspense sun sank into grey cloud sky flushed darkened evening star trembled into sight be deep twilight when captain cried out pointed brother strained eye something rushed up into sky out of greynessrushed slantingly upward very swiftly into luminous clearness above cloud in western sky something flat broad very large that swept round in vast curve grew smaller sank slowly vanished again into grey mystery of night

looked down must immediately have perished be so terrified that dared not go on turned aside hid in shed in garden there curate crouched weeping silently refusing to stir again fixed idea of reaching leatherhead must not let rest in twilight ventured out again went through shrubbery along passage beside big house standing in own ground so emerged upon road towards kew curate left in shed came hurrying after that second start be most foolhardy thing ever did for be manifest martian be about sooner have curate overtaken than saw fighting machine have seen before far away across meadow in direction of kew lodge four five little black figure hurried before across green grey of field in moment be evident martian pursued in three stride be among ran radiating from foot in direction used heat ray to destroy picked up one by one apparently tossed into great metallic carrier projected behind much a workman basket hang over shoulder be first time realised that martian might have other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity stood for moment petrified then turned fled through gate behind into walled garden fell into rather than found fortunate ditch lay there scarce daring to whisper to other until star be out suppose be nearly eleven oclock before gathered courage to start again no longer venturing into road sneaking along hedgerow through plantation watching keenly through darkness on right on left for martian who seemed to be about in one place blundered upon scorched blackened area now cooling ashen number of scattered dead body of men burned horribly about head trunk with leg boot mostly intact of dead horse fifty foot perhaps behind line of four ripped gun smashed gun carriage sheen seemed have escaped destruction place be silent deserted here happened on dead though night be too dark for to see into side road of place in sheen companion suddenly complained of faintness thirst decided to try one of house first house entered after little difficulty with window be small semi detached villa found nothing eatable left in place mouldy cheese there be however water to drink took hatchet promised to be useful in next house breaking then crossed to

with smashed crockery from dresser cant possibly move without making noise fancy be outside sat quite silent so that must scarcely hear other breathing everything seemed deadly still once something near plaster broken brickwork slid down with rumbling sound outside very near be intermittent metallic rattle said curate when presently happened again yes said what be martian said curate listened again be not like heat ray said for time be inclined to think one of great fighting machine have stumbled against house a have seen one stumble against tower of shepperton church situation be so

ruin for time curate be silent then whispered god have mercy upon heard presently whimpering to save for sound lay quite still in scullery for part scarce dared breathe sat with eye fixed on faint light of kitchen door must just see curate face dim oval shape collar cuff outside there began metallic hammering then violent hooting then again after quiet interval hissing like hissing of engine noise for most part problematical continued intermittently seemed if anything to increase in number a time wore on presently measured thudding vibration made everything about quiver vessel in pantry ring shift began continued once light be eclipsed ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark for many hour must have crouched there silent shivering until tired attention failed at last found awake very hungry be inclined to believe must have spent greater portion of day before awakening hunger be at stride so insistent that moved to action told curate be going to seek food felt way towards pantry made answer so soon a began eating faint noise made stirred up heard crawling after ii what saw from ruined house after eating crept back to scullery there must have dozed again for when presently looked round be alone thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence whispered for curate several time at last felt way to door of kitchen be still daylight perceived across

spite of metallic glitter fighting machine be coordinated animated to extraordinary pitch nothing to compare with people who have never seen structure have only ill imagined effort of artist imperfect description of such eye witness a to go upon scarcely realise that living quality recall particularly illustration of one of first pamphlet to give consecutive account of war artist have evidently made hasty study of one of fighting machine there knowledge ended presented a tilted stiff tripod without flexibility subtlety with altogether misleading monotony of effect pamphlet containing rendering have considerable vogue mention here simply to warn reader against impression may have created be more like martian saw in action than dutch doll be like human being to mind pamphlet must have be much better without at first say handling machine did not impress a machine a crablike creature with glittering integument controlling martian whose delicate tentacle actuated movement seeming to be simply equivalent of crab cerebral portion then perceived resemblance of grey brown shiny leathery integument to of other sprawling body beyond true nature of dexterous workman dawned upon with realisation interest shifted to other creature real martian already have have transient impression of first nausea no longer obscured observation moreover be concealed motionless under urgency of action be now saw most unearthly creature be possible to conceive be huge round bodiesor rather headsabout four foot in diameter body having in front of face face have nostrilsindeed martian seem to

aptly by distinguished anatomist professor howe hand even a saw martian for first time seemed to be endeavouring to raise on hand of course with increased weight of terrestrial condition be impossible

socket two three of seem to have be brought in cylinder be killed before earth be reached be just a well for for mere attempt to stand upright upon planet must have broken bone in body while be engaged in description may add in place certain further detail although be not evident to at time will enable reader who be unacquainted with to form clearer picture of offensive creature in three other point physiology differed strangely from ours organism did not sleep more than heart of man sleep since have extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate periodical extinction be unknown to have little sense of fatigue must seem on earth must never have moved without effort yet even to last kept in action in twenty four hour did twenty four hour of work a even on earth be perhaps case with ant in next place wonderful a seems in sexual world martian be absolutely without sex therefore without of tumultuous emotion arise from difference among men young martian there can now be dispute be really born upon earth during war be found attached to parent partially budded off just a young lilybulbs bud off like young animal in fresh water polyp in man in higher terrestrial animal such method of increase have disappeared even on earth be certainly primitive method among lower animal up even to first cousin of vertebrated animal tunicate two process occur side by side finally sexual method superseded competitor altogether on mar however just reverse have apparently be case be worthy of remark that certain speculative writer of quasi scientific repute writing long before martian invasion did forecast for man final structure not unlike actual martian condition prophecy remember appeared in november december in long defunct publication pall mall budget recall caricature of in pre martian periodical called punch pointed outwriting in foolish facetious tonethat perfection of mechanical appliance must ultimately supersede limb perfection of chemical device digestion that such organ a hair external nose teeth ear chin be no longer essential part of human being that tendency of natural selection must lie in direction of steady diminution through coming age brain alone remained cardinal necessity only one other part of body have strong case for survival be hand teacher agent of brain while rest of body dwindled hand must grow larger there be many true word written in jest here in martian have beyond dispute actual accomplishment of such suppression of animal side of organism by intelligence to be quite credible that martian may be descended from being not unlike ourselves by gradual development of brain hand latter giving rise to two bunch of delicate tentacle at last at expense of rest of body without body brain must of course become mere selfish intelligence without of emotional substratum of human being last salient point in system of creature differed from ours be in what one might have thought very trivial particular micro organism cause so much disease pain on earth have never appeared upon mar martian sanitary science eliminated age ago hundred disease fever contagion of human life consumption cancer tumour such morbidity never enter scheme of life speaking of difference between life on mar terrestrial life may allude here to curious suggestion of red weed apparently vegetable kingdom in mar instead of having green for dominant colour be of vivid blood red tint at rate seed martian intentionally accidentally brought with gave rise in case to red coloured growth only that known popularly a red weed however gained footing in competition with terrestrial form red creeper be quite transitory growth few people have seen growing for time however red weed grew with astonishing vigour luxuriance spread up side of pit by third fourth day of imprisonment cactus like branch formed carmine fringe to edge of triangular window afterwards found broadcast throughout country especially wherever there be stream of water martian have what appears to have be auditory organ single round drum at back of head body eye with visual range not very different from ours except according to philip blue violet be a black to be commonly supposed that communicated by sound tentacular gesticulation be asserted for instance in able hastily compiled pamphlet written evidently by someone not eye witness of martian action to have already alluded so far have be chief source of information concerning now surviving human being saw so much of martian in action a did take credit to myself for accident fact be so assert watched closely time after time have seen four five once six of sluggishly performing most elaborately complicated operation together without sound gesture peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding have modulation be believe in sense signal merely expiration of air preparatory to suctional operation have certain claim to at least elementary knowledge of psychology in matter be convincedas firmly a be convinced of anythingthat martian interchanged thought without physical intermediation have be convinced of in spite of strong preconception before martian invasion a occasional reader here there may remember have written with little vehemence against telepathic theory martian wore clothing conception of ornament decorum be necessarily different from ours not only be evidently much le sensible of change of temperature than be change of pressure seem to have affected health at seriously yet though wore clothing be in other artificial addition to bodily resource that great superiority over man lay men with bicycle road skate lilienthal soaring machine gun stick so forth be just in beginning of evolution that martian have worked out have become practically mere brain wearing different body according to need just a men wear suit of clothes take bicycle in hurry umbrella in wet of appliance perhaps nothing be more wonderful to man than curious fact that what be dominant feature of almost human device in mechanism be absentthe wheel be absent among thing brought to earth there be trace suggestion of use of wheel one must have at least expected in locomotion in connection be curious to remark even on earth nature have never hit upon wheel have preferred other expedient to development not only did martian not know of be incredible abstain from wheel in apparatus singularly little use be made of fixed pivot relatively fixed pivot with circular motion thereabout confined to one plane almost joint of machinery present complicated system of sliding part moving over small beautifully curved friction bearing while upon matter of detail be remarkable that long leverage of machine be in most case actuated by sort of sham musculature of disk in elastic sheath disk become polarised drawn closely powerfully together when traversed by current of electricity in way curious parallelism to animal motion be so striking disturbing to human beholder be attained such quasi muscle abounded in crablike handling machine on first peeping out of slit watched unpacking cylinder seemed infinitely more alive than actual martian lying beyond in sunset light panting stirring ineffectual tentacle moving feebly after vast journey across space while be still watching sluggish motion in sunlight noting strange detail of form curate reminded of presence by pulling violently at arm turned to scowling face silent eloquent lip wanted slit permitted only one of to peep through so have to forego watching for time while enjoyed that privilege when looked again busy handling machine have already put together several of piece of apparatus have taken out of cylinder into shape having unmistakable likeness to own down on left busy little digging mechanism have come into view emitting jet of green vapour working way round pit excavating embanking in methodical discriminating manner be have caused regular beating noise rhythmic shock have kept ruinous refuge quivering piped whistled a worked so far a must see thing be without directing martian at iii day of imprisonment arrival of second fighting machine drove from peephole into scullery for feared that from elevation martian might see down upon behind barrier at later date began to feel le in danger of eye for to eye in dazzle of sunlight outside refuge must have be blank blackness at first slightest suggestion of approach drove into scullery in heart throbbing retreat yet terrible a be danger incurred attraction of peeping be for of irresistible recall now with sort of wonder that in spite of infinite danger in be between starvation still more terrible death must yet struggle bitterly for horrible privilege of sight must race across kitchen in grotesque way between eagerness dread of making noise strike other thrust kick within few inch of exposure fact be that have absolutely incompatible disposition habit of thought action danger isolation only accentuated incompatibility at halliford have already come to hate curate trick of helpless exclamation stupid rigidity of mind endless muttering monologue vitiated effort made to think out line of action drove at time thus pent up intensified almost to verge of craziness be a lacking in restraint a silly woman must weep for hour together verily believe that to very end spoiled child of life thought weak tear in way efficacious must sit in darkness unable to keep mind off by reason of importunity ate more than did be in vain pointed out that only chance of life be to stop in house until martian have done with pit that in long patience time might presently come when must need food ate drank impulsively in heavy meal at long interval slept little a day wore on utter carelessness of consideration so intensified distress danger have much a loathed doing to resort to threat at last to blow brought to reason for time be one of weak creature void of pride timorous anmic hateful soul full of shifty cunning who face god man who face not even be disagreeable for to recall write thing set down story may lack nothing who have escaped dark terrible aspect of life will find brutality flash of rage in final tragedy easy enough to blame for know what be wrong a well a not what be possible to tortured men who have be under shadow who have gone down at last to elemental thing will have wider charity while within fought out dark dim contest of whisper snatched food drink gripping hand blow without in pitiless sunlight of terrible june be strange wonder unfamiliar routine of martian in pit let return to first new experience of mine after long time ventured back to peephole to find that new comer have be reinforced by occupant of fewer than three of fighting machine last have brought with certain fresh appliance stood in orderly manner about cylinder second handling machine be now completed be busied in serving one of novel contrivance big machine have brought be body resembling milk can in general form above oscillated pear shaped receptacle from stream of white powder flowed into circular basin below oscillatory motion be imparted to by one tentacle of handling machine with two spatulate hand handling machine be digging out flinging mass of clay into pear shaped receptacle above while with arm periodically opened door removed rusty blackened clinker from middle part of machine steely tentacle directed powder from basin along ribbed channel towards receiver be hidden from by mound of bluish dust from unseen receiver little thread of green smoke rose vertically into quiet air a looked handling machine with faint musical clinking extended telescopic fashion tentacle have be moment before mere blunt projection until end be hidden behind mound of clay in second have lifted bar of white aluminium into sight untarnished a yet shining dazzlingly deposited in growing stack of bar stood at side of pit between sunset starlight dexterous machine must have made more than hundred such bar out of crude clay mound of bluish dust rose steadily until topped side of pit contrast between swift complex movement of contrivance inert panting clumsiness of master be acute for day have to tell repeatedly that latter be indeed living of two thing curate have possession of slit when first men be brought to pit be sitting below huddled up listening with ear made sudden movement backward fearful that be observed crouched in spasm of terror came sliding down rubbish crept beside in darkness inarticulate gesticulating for moment shared panic gesture suggested resignation of slit after little while curiosity gave courage rose up stepped across clambered up to at first must see reason for frantic behaviour twilight have now come star be little faint pit be illuminated by flickering green fire came from aluminium making whole picture be flickering scheme of green gleam shifting rusty black shadow strangely trying to eye over through went bat heeding not at sprawling martian be no longer to be seen mound of blue green powder have risen to cover from sight fighting machine with leg contracted crumpled abbreviated stood across corner of pit then amid clangour of machinery came drifting suspicion of human voice entertained at first only to dismiss crouched watching fighting machine closely satisfying now for first time that hood did indeed contain martian a green flame lifted must see oily gleam of integument brightness of eye suddenly heard yell saw long tentacle reaching over shoulder of machine to little cage hunched upon back then somethingsomething struggling violentlywas lifted high against sky black vague enigma against starlight a black object came down again saw by green brightness that be man for instant be clearly visible be stout ruddy middle aged man well dressed three day before must have be walking world man of considerable consequence must see staring eye gleam of light on stud watch chain vanished behind mound for moment there be silence then began shrieking sustained cheerful hooting from martian slid down rubbish struggled to foot clapped hand over ear bolted into scullery curate who have be crouching silently with arm over head looked up a passed cried out quite loudly at desertion of came running after night a lurked in scullery balanced between horror terrible fascination peeping have although felt urgent need of action tried in vain to conceive plan of escape afterwards during second day be able to consider position with great clearness curate found be quite incapable of discussion new culminating atrocity have robbed of vestige of reason forethought practically have already sunk to level of animal a saying go gripped with hand grew upon mind once must face fact terrible a position be there be a yet justification for absolute despair chief chance lay in possibility of martian making pit nothing more than temporary encampment even if kept permanently might not consider necessary to guard chance of escape might be afforded also weighed very carefully possibility of digging way out in direction away from pit chance of emerging within sight of sentinel fighting machine seemed at first too great must have have to do digging curate must certainly have failed be on third day if memory serf right that saw lad killed be only occasion on actually saw martian feed after experience avoided hole in wall for better part of day went into scullery removed door spent hour digging with hatchet a silently a possible when have made hole about couple of foot deep loose earth collapsed noisily did not dare continue lost heart lay down on scullery floor for long time having spirit even to move after abandoned altogether idea of escaping by excavation say much for impression martian have made upon that at first entertained little hope of escape being brought about by overthrow through human effort on fourth fifth night heard sound like heavy gun be very late in night moon be shining brightly martian have taken away excavating machine save for fighting machine stood in remoter bank of pit handling machine be buried out of sight in corner of pit immediately beneath peephole place be deserted by except for pale glow from handling machine bar patch of white moonlight pit be in darkness except for clinking of handling machine quite still that night be beautiful serenity save for one planet moon seemed to have sky to herself dog howling that familiar sound be that made listen then heard quite distinctly booming exactly like sound of great gun six distinct report counted after long interval six again be iv death of curate be on sixth day of imprisonment peeped for last time presently found alone instead of keeping close to trying to oust from slit curate have gone back into scullery be struck by sudden thought went back quickly quietly into scullery in darkness heard curate drinking snatched in darkness finger caught bottle of burgundy for few minute there be tussle bottle struck floor broke desisted rose stood panting threatening other in end planted between food told of determination to begin discipline divided food in pantry into ration to last ten day must not let eat more day in afternoon made feeble effort to get at food have be dozing in instant be awake day night sat face to face weary resolute weeping complaining of immediate hunger be know night day to seemedit seems nowan interminable length of time so widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict for two vast day struggled in undertone wrestling contest there be time when beat kicked madly time when cajoled persuaded once tried to bribe with last bottle of burgundy for there be rain water pump from must get water force kindness availed be indeed beyond reason must neither desist from attack on food from noisy babbling to rudimentary precaution to keep imprisonment endurable must not observe slowly began to realise complete overthrow of intelligence to perceive that sole companion in close sickly darkness be man insane from certain vague memory be inclined to think own mind wandered at time have strange hideous dream slept sound paradoxical be inclined to think that weakness insanity of curate warned braced kept sane man on eighth day began to talk aloud instead of whispering nothing must do must moderate speech be just o god must say over over again be just on be punishment laid have sinned have fallen short there be poverty sorrow poor be trodden in dust held peace preached acceptable follymy god what follywhen must have stood up though died for called upon to repentrepent oppressor of poor needy wine press of god then must suddenly revert to matter of food withheld from praying begging weeping at last threatening began to raise voicei prayed not to perceived hold on mehe threatened must shout bring martian upon for time scared concession must have shortened chance of escape beyond estimating defied although felt assurance that might not do thing day at rate did not talked with voice rising slowly through greater part of eighth ninth daysthreats entreaty mingled with torrent of half sane always frothy repentance for vacant sham of god service such a made pity then slept awhile began again with renewed strength so loudly that must need make desist be still implored rose to knee for have be sitting in darkness near copper have be still too long said in tone must have reached pit now must bear witness woe unto unfaithful city woe woe woe woe woe to inhabitant of earth by reason of other voice of trumpet shut up said rising to foot in terror lest martian must hear for god sake nay shouted curate at top of voice standing likewise extending arm speak word of lord be upon in three stride be at door leading into kitchen must bear witness go have already be too long delayed put out hand felt meat chopper hanging to wall in flash be after be fierce with fear before be halfway across kitchen have overtaken with one last touch of humanity turned blade back struck with butt went headlong forward lay stretched on ground stumbled over stood panting lay still suddenly heard noise without run smash of slipping plaster triangular aperture in wall be darkened looked up saw lower surface of handling machine coming slowly across hole one of gripping limb curled amid debris limb appeared feeling way over fallen beam stood petrified staring then saw through sort of glass plate near edge of body face a may call large dark eye of martian peering then long metallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowly through hole turned by effort stumbled over curate stopped at scullery door tentacle be now way two yard more in room twisting turning with queer sudden movement way that for while stood fascinated by slow fitful advance then with faint hoarse cry forced across scullery trembled violently must scarcely stand upright opened door of coal cellar stood there in darkness staring at faintly lit doorway into kitchen listening have martian seen what be doing now something be moving to fro there very quietly now then tapped against wall started on movement with faint metallic ringing like movement of key on split ring then heavy bodyi knew too well whatwas dragged across floor of kitchen towards opening irresistibly attracted crept to door peeped into kitchen in triangle of bright outer sunlight saw martian in briareus of handling machine scrutinizing curate head thought at once that must infer presence from mark of blow have given crept back to coal cellar shut door began to cover up a much a must a noiselessly a possible in darkness among firewood coal therein now then paused rigid to hear if martian have tentacle through opening again then faint metallic jingle returned traced slowly feeling over kitchen presently heard nearerin scullery a judged thought that length might be insufficient to reach prayed copiously passed scraping faintly across cellar door age of almost intolerable suspense intervened then heard fumbling at latch have found door martian understood door worried at catch for minute perhaps then door opened in darkness must just see thinglike elephant trunk more than anything elsewaving towards touching examining wall coal wood ceiling be like black worm swaying blind head to fro once even touched heel of boot be on verge of screaming bit hand for time tentacle be silent must have fancied have be withdrawn presently with abrupt click gripped thought have meand seemed to go out of cellar again for minute be not sure apparently have taken lump of coal to examine seized opportunity of slightly shifting position have become cramped then listened whispered passionate prayer for safety then heard slow deliberate sound creeping towards again slowly slowly drew near scratching against wall tapping furniture while be still doubtful rapped smartly against cellar door closed heard go into pantry biscuit tin rattled bottle smashed then came heavy bump against cellar door then silence that passed into infinity of suspense have gone at last decided that have came into scullery no more lay tenth day in close darkness buried among coal firewood not daring even to crawl out for drink for craved be eleventh day before ventured so far from security v stillness first act before went into pantry be to fasten door between kitchen scullery pantry be empty scrap of food have gone apparently martian have taken on previous day at discovery despaired for first time took food drink either on eleventh twelfth day at first mouth throat be parched strength ebbed sensibly sat about in darkness of scullery in state of despondent wretchedness mind ran on eating thought have become deaf for noise of movement have be accustomed to hear from pit have ceased absolutely did not feel strong enough to crawl noiselessly to peephole must have gone there on twelfth day throat be so painful that taking chance of alarming martian attacked creaking rain water pump stood by sink got couple of glassful of blackened tainted rain water be greatly refreshed by emboldened by fact that enquiring tentacle followed noise of pumping during day in rambling inconclusive way thought much of curate of manner of death on thirteenth day drank more water dozed thought disjointedly of eating of vague impossible plan of escape whenever dozed dreamt of horrible phantasm of death of curate of sumptuous dinner asleep awake felt keen pain urged to drink again again light came into scullery be no longer grey red to disordered imagination seemed colour of blood on fourteenth day went into kitchen be surprised to find that frond of red weed have grown right across hole in wall turning half light of place into crimson coloured obscurity be early on fifteenth day heard curious familiar sequence of sound in kitchen listening identified a snuffing scratching of dog going into kitchen saw dog nose peering in through break among ruddy frond greatly surprised at scent of barked shortly thought if must induce to come into place quietly must be able perhaps to kill eat in case must be advisable to kill lest action attracted attention of martian crept forward saying good dog very softly suddenly withdrew head disappeared listenedi be not deafbut certainly pit be still heard sound like flutter of bird wing hoarse croaking be for long while lay close to peephole not daring to move aside red plant obscured once twice heard faint pitter patter like foot of dog going hither thither on sand far below there be more birdlike sound be at length encouraged by silence looked out except in corner where multitude of crow hopped fought over skeleton of dead martian have consumed there be not living thing in pit stared about scarcely believing eye machinery have gone save for big mound of greyish blue powder in one corner certain bar of aluminium in black bird skeleton of killed place be merely empty circular pit in sand slowly thrust out through red weed stood upon mound of rubble must see in direction save behind to north martian sign of martian be to be seen pit dropped sheerly from foot little way along rubbish afforded practicable slope to summit of ruin chance of escape have come began to tremble hesitated for time then in gust of desperate resolution with heart throbbed violently scrambled to top of mound in have be buried so long looked about again to northward too martian be visible when have last seen part of sheen in daylight have be straggling street of comfortable white red house interspersed with abundant shady tree now stood on mound of smashed brickwork clay gravel over spread multitude of red cactus shaped plant knee high without solitary terrestrial growth to dispute footing tree near be dead brown further network of red thread scaled still living stem neighbouring house have be wrecked none have be burned wall stood sometimes to second story with smashed window shattered door red weed grew tumultuously in roofless room below be great pit with crow struggling for refuse number of other bird hopped about among ruin far away saw gaunt cat slink crouchingly along wall trace of men there be none day seemed by contrast with recent confinement dazzlingly bright sky glowing blue gentle breeze kept red weed covered scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying oh sweetness of air vi work of fifteen day for time stood tottering on mound regardless of safety within noisome den from have emerged have thought with narrow intensity only of immediate security have not realised what have be happening to world have not anticipated startling vision of unfamiliar thing have expected to see sheen in ruinsi found about landscape weird lurid of planet for moment touched emotion beyond common range of men yet one that poor brute dominate know only too well felt a rabbit might feel returning to burrow suddenly confronted by work of dozen busy navvy digging foundation of house felt first inkling of thing presently grew quite clear in mind that oppressed for many day sense of dethronement persuasion be longer master animal among animal under martian heel with must be a with to lurk watch to run hide fear empire of man have passed away so soon a strangeness have be realised passed dominant motive became hunger of long dismal fast in direction away from pit saw beyond red covered wall patch of garden ground unburied gave hint went knee deep sometimes neck deep in red weed density of weed gave reassuring sense of hiding wall be six foot high when attempted to clamber found must not lift foot to crest so went along by side of came to corner rockwork enabled to get to top tumble into garden coveted here found young onion couple of gladiolus bulb quantity of immature carrot of secured scrambling over ruined wall went on way through scarlet crimson tree towards kewit be like walking through avenue of gigantic blood dropspossessed with two idea to get more food to limp a soon a far a strength permitted out of accursed unearthly region of pit way farther in grassy place be group of mushroom also devoured then came upon brown sheet of flowing willow water where meadow used to be fragment of nourishment served only to whet hunger at first be surprised at flood in hot dry summer afterwards discovered that be caused by tropical exuberance of red weed directly extraordinary growth encountered water straightway became gigantic of unparalleled fecundity seed be simply poured down into water of wey thames swiftly growing titanic water frond speedily choked river at putney a afterwards saw bridge be almost lost in tangle of weed at richmond too thames water poured in broad willow stream across meadow of hampton twickenham a water spread weed followed until ruined villa of thames valley be for time lost in red swamp whose margin explored much of desolation martian have caused be concealed in end red weed succumbed almost a quickly a have spread cankering disease due be believed to action of certain bacteria presently seized upon now by action of natural selection terrestrial plant have acquired resisting power against bacterial diseasesthey never succumb without severe struggle red weed rotted like thing already dead frond became bleached then shrivelled brittle broke off at least touch water have stimulated early growth carried last vestige out to sea first act on coming to water be of course to slake thirst drank great deal of moved by impulse gnawed frond of red weed be watery have sickly metallic taste found water be sufficiently willow for to wade securely although red weed impeded foot little flood evidently got deeper towards river turned back to mortlake managed to make out road by mean of occasional ruin of villa fence lamp so presently got out of spate made way to hill going up towards roehampton came out on putney common here scenery changed from strange unfamiliar to wreckage of familiar patch of ground exhibited devastation of cyclone in few score yard must come upon perfectly undisturbed space house with blind trimly drawn door closed a if have be left for day by owner a if inhabitant slept within red weed be le abundant tall tree along lane be free from red creeper hunted for food among tree finding nothing also raided couple of silent house have already be broken into ransacked rested for remainder of daylight in shrubbery being in enfeebled condition too fatigued to push on time saw human being sign of martian encountered couple of hungry looking dog hurried circuitously away from advance made near roehampton have seen two human skeletonsnot body skeleton picked cleanand in wood by found crushed scattered bone of several cat rabbit skull of sheep though gnawed part of in mouth there be nothing to be got from after sunset struggled on along road towards putney where think heat ray must have be used for reason in garden beyond roehampton got quantity of immature potato sufficient to stay hunger from garden one looked down upon putney river aspect of place in dusk be singularly desolate blackened tree blackened desolate ruin down hill sheet of flooded river red tinged with weed over allsilence filled with indescribable terror to think how swiftly that desolating change have come for time believed that mankind have be swept out of existence stood there alone last man left alive hard by top of putney hill came upon skeleton with arm dislocated removed several yard from rest of body a proceeded became more more convinced that extermination of mankind be save for such straggler a already accomplished in part of world martian thought have gone on left country desolated seeking food elsewhere perhaps even now be destroying berlin paris might be have gone northward vii man on putney hill spent that night in inn stand at top of putney hill sleeping in made bed for first time since flight to leatherhead will not tell needle trouble have breaking into houseafterwards found front door be on latchnor how ransacked room for food until just on verge of despair in what seemed to to be servant bedroom found rat gnawed crust two tin of pineapple place have be already searched emptied in bar afterwards found biscuit sandwich have be overlooked latter must not eat be too rotten former not only stayed hunger filled pocket lit lamp fearing martian might come beating that part of london for food in night before went to bed have interval of restlessness prowled from window to window peering out for sign of monster slept little a lay in bed found thinking consecutivelya thing remember to have done since last argument with curate during intervening time mental condition have be hurrying succession of vague emotional state sort of stupid receptivity in night brain reinforced suppose by food have eaten grew clear again thought three thing struggled for possession of mind killing of curate whereabouts of martian possible fate of wife former gave sensation of horror remorse to recall saw simply a thing done memory infinitely disagreeable quite without quality of remorse saw then a see now driven step by step towards hasty blow creature of sequence of accident leading inevitably to felt condemnation yet memory static unprogressive haunted in silence of night with sense of nearness of god sometimes come into stillness darkness stood trial only trial for moment of wrath fear retraced step of conversation from moment when have found crouching beside heedless of thirst pointing to fire smoke that streamed up from ruin of weybridge have be incapable of co operationgrim chance have taken no heed of have foreseen must have left at halliford did not foresee crime be to foresee do set down a have set story down a be there be witnessesall thing might have concealed set

be confined to book two seems to that carver suggestion a to reason of rapid death of martian be so probable a to be regarded almost a proven conclusion have assumed that in body of narrative at rate in body of martian be examined after war bacteria except already known a terrestrial specie be found that did not bury of dead reckless slaughter perpetrated point also to entire ignorance of putrefactive process probable a seems be by mean proven conclusion be composition of black smoke known martian used with such deadly effect generator of heat ray remains puzzle terrible disaster at ealing south kensington laboratory have disinclined analyst for further investigation upon latter spectrum analysis of black powder point unmistakably to presence of unknown element with brilliant group of three line in green be possible that combine with argon to form compound act at once with deadly effect upon constituent in blood such unproven speculation will scarcely be of interest to general reader to whom story be addressed none of brown scum drifted down thames after destruction of shepperton be examined at time now none be forthcoming result of anatomical examination of martian so far a prowling dog have left examination possible have already given everyone be familiar with magnificent almost complete specimen in spirit at natural history museum countless drawing have be made from beyond that interest of physiology structure be purely scientific question of graver universal interest be possibility of attack from martian think that nearly enough attention be being given to aspect of matter at present planet mar be in conjunction with return to opposition for one anticipate renewal of adventure in case must be prepared seems to that must be possible to define position of gun from shot be discharged to keep sustained watch upon part of planet to anticipate arrival of next attack in case cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite artillery before be sufficiently cool for martian to emerge might be butchered by mean of gun so soon a screw opened seems to that have lost vast advantage in failure of first surprise possibly see in same light lessing have advanced excellent reason for supposing that martian have actually succeeded in effecting landing on planet venus seven month ago now venus mar be in alignment with sun be to say mar be in opposition from point of view of observer on venus subsequently peculiar luminous sinuous marking appeared on unillumined half of inner planet almost simultaneously faint dark mark of similar sinuous character be detected upon photograph of martian disk one need to see drawing of appearance in order to appreciate fully remarkable resemblance in character at rate whether expect invasion not view of human future must be greatly modified by event have learned now that can not regard planet a being fenced in secure abiding place for man can never anticipate unseen good evil may come upon suddenly out of space may be that in larger design of universe invasion from mar be not without ultimate benefit for men have robbed of serene confidence in future be most fruitful source of decadence gift to human science have brought be enormous have done much to promote conception of commonweal of mankind may be that across immensity of space martian have watched fate of pioneer of theirs learned lesson that on planet venus have found securer settlement be that a may for many year yet there will certainly be relaxation of eager scrutiny of martian disk fiery dart of sky shooting star will bring with a fall unavoidable apprehension to son of men broadening of men view have resulted can scarcely be exaggerated before cylinder fell there be general persuasion that through deep of space life existed beyond petty surface of minute sphere now see further if martian can reach venus there be reason to suppose that thing be impossible for men when slow cooling of sun make earth uninhabitable a at last must do may be that thread of life have begun here will have streamed out caught sister planet within toil dim wonderful be vision have conjured up in mind of life spreading slowly from little seed bed of solar system throughout inanimate vastness of sidereal space be remote dream may be on other hand that destruction of martian be only reprieve to not to perhaps be future ordained must confess
