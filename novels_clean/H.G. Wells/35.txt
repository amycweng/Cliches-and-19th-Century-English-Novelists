convenient to speak of be expounding recondite matter to pale grey eye shone twinkled usually pale face be flushed animated fire burnt brightly soft radiance of incandescent light in lily of silver caught bubble flashed passed in glass chair being patent embraced caressed rather than submitted to be sat upon there be that luxurious after dinner atmosphere when thought run gracefully free of trammel of precision put to in waymarking point with lean forefingeras sat lazily admired earnestness over new paradox a thought fecundity must follow carefully will have to controvert one two idea be almost universally accepted geometry for instance taught at school be founded on misconception be not that rather large thing to expect to begin upon said filby argumentative person with red hair mean to ask to accept anything without reasonable ground for will soon admit a much a need from know of course that mathematical line line of thickness nil have real existence taught that have mathematical plane thing be mere abstraction be right said psychologist having only length breadth thickness can cube have real existence there object said filby of course solid body may exist real thing so most people think wait moment can instantaneous cube exist dont follow said filby can cube doe not last for time at have real existence filby became pensive clearly time traveller proceeded real body must have extension in four direction must have length breadth thickness andduration through natural infirmity of flesh will explain to in moment incline to overlook fact there be really four dimension three call three plane of space fourth time there be however tendency to draw unreal distinction between former three dimension latter because happens that consciousness move intermittently in one direction along latter from beginning to end of life said very young man making spasmodic effort to relight cigar over lamp very clear indeed now be very remarkable that be so extensively overlooked continued time traveller with slight accession of cheerfulness really be what be meant by fourth dimension though people who talk about fourth dimension know mean be only way of looking at time there be difference between time of three dimension of space except consciousness move along foolish people have got hold of wrong side of idea have heard what have to say about fourth dimension have not said provincial mayor be simply space a mathematician have be spoken of a having three dimension one may call length breadth thickness be always definable by reference to three plane at right angle to others philosophical people have be asking why three dimension particularlywhy not direction at right angle to other threeand have even tried to construct four dimensional geometry professor simon newcomb be expounding to new york mathematical society only month so ago know how on flat surface have only two dimension can represent figure of three dimensional solid similarly think that by model of three dimension must represent one of fourif must master perspective of thing see think so murmured provincial mayor knitting brow lapsed into introspective state lip moving a one who repeat mystic word yes think see now said after time brightening in quite transitory manner well mind telling have be at work upon geometry of four dimension for time of result be curious for instance here be portrait of man at eight year old at fifteen at seventeen at twenty three so on be evidently section a be three dimensional representation of four dimensioned being be fixed unalterable thing scientific people proceeded time traveller after pause required for proper assimilation of know very well that time be only kind of space here be popular scientific diagram weather record line trace with finger show movement of barometer yesterday be so high yesterday night fell then morning rose again so gently upward to here surely mercury did not trace line in of dimension of space generally recognised certainly traced line line therefore must conclude be along time dimension said medical man staring hard at coal in fire if time be really only fourth dimension of space why be why have always be regarded a something different why can not move in time a move about in other dimension of space time traveller smiled be so sure can move freely in space right left can go backward forward freely enough men always have done so admit move freely in two dimension how about up down gravitation limit there not exactly said medical man there be balloon before balloon save for spasmodic jumping inequality of surface man have freedom of vertical movement still must move little up down said medical man easier far easier down than up can not move at in time can not get away from present moment dear sir be just where be wrong that be just where whole world have gone wrong be always getting away from present moment mental existence be immaterial have dimension be passing along time dimension with uniform velocity from cradle to grave just a must travel down if began existence fifty mile above earth surface great difficulty be interrupted psychologist can move about in direction of space can not move about in time be germ of great discovery be wrong to say that can not move about in time for instance if be recalling incident very vividly go back to instant of occurrence become absent minded a say jump back for moment of course have mean of staying back for length of time more than savage animal have of staying six foot above ground civilised man be better off than savage in respect can go up against gravitation in balloon why must not hope that ultimately may be able to stop accelerate drift along time dimension even turn about travel other way oh began filby be why not said time traveller against reason said filby what reason said time traveller can show black be white by argument said filby will never convince possibly not said time traveller now begin to see object of investigation into geometry of four dimension long ago have vague inkling of machine to travel through time exclaimed very young man that will travel indifferently in direction of space time a driver determines filby contented with laughter have experimental verification said time traveller must be remarkably convenient for historian psychologist suggested one might travel back verify accepted account of battle of hastings for instance dont think must attract attention said medical man ancestor have great tolerance for anachronism one might get one greek from very lip of homer plato very young man thought in case must certainly plough for little go german scholar have improved greek so much then there be future said very young man just think one might invest one money leave to accumulate at interest hurry on ahead to discover society said erected on strictly communistic basis of wild extravagant theory began psychologist yes so seemed to so never talked of until experimental verification cried be going to verify that experiment cried filby who be getting brain weary let see experiment anyhow said psychologist though humbug know time traveller smiled round at then still smiling faintly with hand deep in trouser pocket walked slowly out of room heard slipper shuffling down long passage to laboratory psychologist looked at wonder what he got sleight of hand trick other said medical man filby tried to tell about conjuror have seen at burslem before have finished preface time traveller came back filbys anecdote collapsed machine thing time traveller held in hand be glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than small clock very delicately made there be ivory in transparent crystalline substance now must be explicit for followsunless explanation be to be absolutely unaccountable thing took one of small octagonal table be scattered about room set in front of fire with two leg on hearthrug on table placed mechanism then drew up chair sat down only other object on table be small shaded lamp bright light of fell upon model there be also perhaps dozen candle about two in brass candlestick upon mantel several in sconce so that room be brilliantly illuminated sat in low arm chair nearest fire drew forward so a to be almost between time traveller fireplace filby sat behind looking over shoulder medical man provincial mayor watched in profile from right psychologist from left very young man stood behind psychologist be on alert appears incredible to that kind of trick however subtly conceived however adroitly done must have be played upon under condition time traveller looked at then at mechanism well said psychologist little affair said time traveller resting elbow upon table pressing hand together above apparatus be only model be plan for machine to travel through time will notice that look singularly askew that there be odd twinkling appearance about bar a though be in way unreal pointed to part with finger also here be one little white lever here be medical man got up out of chair peered into thing beautifully made said took two year to make retorted time traveller then when have imitated action of medical man said now want clearly to understand that lever being pressed over sends machine gliding into future other revers motion saddle represents seat of time traveller presently be going to press lever off machine will go will vanish pas into future time disappear have good look at thing look at table too satisfy yourselves there be trickery dont want to waste model then be told im quack there be minute pause perhaps psychologist seemed about to speak to changed mind then time traveller put forth finger towards lever said suddenly lend hand turning to psychologist took that individual hand in own told to put out forefinger so that be psychologist who sent forth model time machine on interminable voyage saw lever turn be absolutely certain there be trickery there be breath of wind lamp flame jumped one of candle on mantel be blown out little machine suddenly swung round became indistinct be seen a ghost for second perhaps a eddy of faintly glittering brass ivory be gonevanished save for lamp table be bare everyone be silent for minute then filby said be damned psychologist recovered from stupor suddenly looked under table at that time traveller laughed cheerfully well said with reminiscence of psychologist then getting up went to tobacco jar on mantel with back to began to fill pipe stared at other look here said medical man be in earnest about do seriously believe that machine have travelled into time certainly said time traveller stooping to light spill at fire then turned lighting pipe to look at psychologist face psychologist to show that be not unhinged helped to cigar tried to light uncut what be more have big machine nearly finished in therehe indicated laboratoryand when be put together mean to have journey on own account mean to say that machine have travelled into future said filby into future pasti dont for certain know after interval psychologist have inspiration must have gone into past if have gone anywhere said why said time traveller because presume that have not moved in space if travelled into future must still be here time since must have travelled through time said if travelled into past must have be visible when came first into room last thursday when be here thursday before so forth serious objection remarked provincial mayor with air of impartiality turning towards time traveller not bit said time traveller to psychologist think can explain that presentation below threshold know diluted presentation of course said psychologist reassured thats simple point of psychology must have thought of plain enough help paradox delightfully can not see can appreciate machine more than can spoke of wheel spinning bullet flying through air if be travelling through time fifty time hundred time faster than be if get through minute while get through second impression creates will of course be only one fiftieth one hundredth of what must make if be not travelling in time thats plain enough passed hand through space in machine have be see said laughing sat stared at vacant table for minute so then time traveller asked what thought of sound plausible enough tonight said medical man wait until tomorrow wait for common sense of morning must like to see time machine asked time traveller therewith taking lamp in hand led way down long draughty corridor to laboratory remember vividly flickering light queer broad head in silhouette dance of shadow how followed puzzled incredulous how there in laboratory beheld larger edition of little mechanism have seen vanish from before eye part be of nickel part of ivory part have certainly be filed sawn out of rock crystal thing be generally complete twisted crystalline bar lay unfinished upon bench beside sheet of drawing took one up for better look at quartz seemed to be look here said medical man be perfectly serious be tricklike ghost showed last christmas upon machine said time traveller holding lamp aloft intend to explore time be that plain be never more serious in life none of quite knew how to take caught filbys eye over shoulder of medical man winked at solemnly iii time traveller return think that at time none of quite believed in time machine fact be time traveller be one of men who be too clever to be believed never felt that saw round always suspected subtle reserve ingenuity in ambush behind lucid frankness have filby shown model explained matter in time traveller word must have shown far le scepticism for must have perceived motif pork butcher must understand filby time traveller have more than touch of whim among element distrusted thing must have made fame of le clever man seemed trick in hand be mistake to do thing too easily serious people who took seriously never felt quite sure of deportment be somehow aware that trusting reputation for judgment with be like furnishing nursery with eggshell china so dont think of said very much about time travelling in interval between thursday next though odd potentiality ran doubt in most of mind plausibility be practical incredibleness curious possibility of anachronism of utter confusion suggested for own part be particularly preoccupied with trick of model that remember discussing with medical man whom met on friday at linnan said have seen similar thing at tbingen laid considerable stress on blowing out of candle how trick be done must not explain next thursday went again to richmondi suppose be one of time traveller most constant guestsand arriving late found four five men already assembled in drawing room medical man be standing before fire with sheet of paper in one hand watch in other looked round for time traveller andits past seven now said medical man suppose wed better have dinner wheres said naming host youve just come rather odd he unavoidably detained asks in note to lead off with dinner at seven if he not back say hell explain when come seems pity to let dinner spoil said editor of well known daily paper thereupon doctor rang bell psychologist be only person besides doctor who have attended previous dinner other men be blank editor aforementioned certain journalist anothera quiet shy man with beardwhom didnt know who a far a observation went never opened mouth evening there be speculation at dinner table about time traveller absence suggested time travelling in half jocular spirit editor wanted explained to psychologist volunteered wooden account of ingenious paradox trick have witnessed that day week be in midst of exposition when door from corridor opened slowly without noise be facing door saw first hallo said at last door opened wider time traveller stood before gave cry of surprise good heaven man whats matter cried medical man who saw next whole tableful turned towards door be in amazing plight coat be dusty dirty smeared with green down sleeve hair disordered a seemed to greyereither with dust dirt because colour have actually faded face be ghastly pale chin have brown cut on ita cut half healed expression be haggard drawn a by intense suffering for moment hesitated in doorway a if have be dazzled by light then came into room walked with just limp a have seen in footsore tramp stared at in silence expecting to speak said not word came painfully to table made motion towards wine editor filled glass of champagne pushed towards drained seemed to do good for looked round table ghost of old smile flickered across face what on earth have be up to man said doctor time traveller did not seem to hear dont let disturb said with certain faltering articulation im right stopped held out glass for more took off at draught thats good said eye grew brighter faint colour came into cheek glance flickered over face with certain dull approval then went round warm comfortable room then spoke again still a be feeling way among word im going to wash dress then ill come down explain thing save of mutton im starving for bit of meat looked across at editor who be rare visitor hoped be all right editor began question tell presently said time traveller imfunny be right in minute put down glass walked towards staircase door again remarked lameness soft padding sound of footfall standing up in place saw foot a went out have nothing on pair of tattered blood stained sock then door closed upon have half mind to follow till remembered how detested fuss about for minute perhaps mind be wool gathering then remarkable behaviour of eminent scientist heard editor say thinking after wont in headline brought attention back to bright dinner table whats game said journalist have be doing amateur cadger dont follow met eye of psychologist read own interpretation in face thought of time traveller limping painfully upstairs dont think anyone else have noticed lameness first to recover completely from surprise be medical man who rang bellthe time traveller hated to have servant waiting at dinnerfor hot plate at that editor turned to knife fork with grunt silent man followed suit dinner be resumed conversation be exclamatory for little while with gap of wonderment then editor got fervent in curiosity doe friend eke out modest income with crossing have nebuchadnezzar phase inquired feel assured business of time machine said took up psychologist account of previous meeting new guest be frankly incredulous editor raised objection what be time travelling man couldnt cover with dust by rolling in paradox must then a idea came home to resorted to caricature hadnt clothes brush in future journalist too must not believe at price joined editor in easy work of heaping ridicule on whole thing be new kind of journalistvery joyous irreverent young men special correspondent in day after tomorrow report journalist be sayingor rather shoutingwhen time traveller came back be dressed in ordinary evening clothes nothing save haggard look remained of change have startled say said editor hilariously chap here say have be travelling into middle of next week tell about little rosebery will what will take for lot time traveller came to place reserved for without word smiled quietly in old way wheres mutton said what treat be to stick fork into meat again story cried editor story be damned said time traveller want something to eat wont say word until get peptone into artery thanks salt one word said have be time travelling yes said time traveller with mouth full nodding head id give shilling line for verbatim note said editor time traveller pushed glass towards silent man rang with fingernail at silent man who have be staring at face started convulsively poured wine rest of dinner be uncomfortable for own part sudden question kept on rising to lip dare say be same with others journalist tried to relieve tension by telling anecdote of hettie potter time traveller devoted attention to dinner displayed appetite of tramp medical man smoked cigarette watched time traveller through eyelash silent man seemed even more clumsy than usual drank champagne with regularity determination out of sheer nervousness at last time traveller pushed plate away looked round suppose must apologise said be simply starving ive have most amazing time reached out hand for cigar cut end come into smoking room too long story to tell over greasy plate ringing bell in passing led way into adjoining room have told blank dash chose about machine said to leaning back in easy chair naming three new guest thing mere paradox said editor cant argue tonight dont mind telling story cant argue will went on tell story of what have happened to if like must refrain from interruption want to tell badly most of will sound like lying so be trueevery word of same be in laboratory at four oclock since then ive lived eight day such day a human being ever lived before im nearly worn out shant sleep till ive told thing over to then will go to bed interruption be agreed agreed said editor rest of echoed agreed with time traveller began story a have set forth sat back in chair at first spoke like weary man afterwards got more animated in writing down feel with only too much keenness inadequacy of pen inkand above own inadequacyto express quality read will suppose attentively enough can not see speaker white sincere face in bright circle of little lamp hear intonation of voice can not know how expression followed turn of story most of hearer be in shadow for candle in smoking room have not be lighted only face of journalist leg of silent man from knee downward be illuminated at first glanced now again at other after time ceased to do looked only at time traveller face iv time travelling told of last thursday of principle of time machine showed actual thing incomplete in workshop there be now little travel worn truly one of ivory bar be cracked brass rail bent rest of sound enough expected to finish on friday on friday when putting together be nearly done found that one of nickel bar be exactly one inch too short have to get remade so that thing be not complete until morning be at ten oclock today that first of time machine began career gave last tap tried screw again put one more drop of oil on quartz rod sat in saddle suppose suicide who hold pistol to skull feel much same wonder at what will come next a felt then took starting lever in one hand stopping one in other pressed first almost immediately second seemed to reel felt nightmare sensation of falling looking round saw laboratory exactly a before have anything happened for moment suspected that intellect have tricked then noted clock moment before a seemed have stood at minute so past ten now be nearly half past three drew breath set teeth gripped starting lever with hand went off with thud laboratory got hazy went dark mr watchett came in walked apparently without seeing towards garden door suppose took minute so to traverse place to seemed to shoot across room like rocket pressed lever over to extreme position night came like turning out of lamp in moment came tomorrow laboratory grew faint hazy then fainter ever fainter tomorrow night came black then day again night again day again faster faster still eddying murmur filled ear strange dumb confusedness descended on mind be afraid can not convey peculiar sensation of time travelling be excessively unpleasant there be feeling exactly like one have upon switchbackof helpless headlong motion felt same horrible anticipation too of imminent smash a put on pace night followed day like flapping of black wing dim suggestion of laboratory seemed presently to fall away from saw sun hopping swiftly across sky leaping minute minute marking day supposed laboratory have be destroyed have come into open air have dim impression of scaffolding be already going too fast to be conscious of moving thing slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for twinkling succession of darkness light be excessively painful to eye then in intermittent darkness saw moon spinning swiftly through quarter from new to full have faint glimpse of circling star presently a went on still gaining velocity palpitation of night day merged into one continuous greyness sky took on wonderful deepness of blue splendid luminous colour like of early twilight jerking sun became streak of fire brilliant arch in space moon fainter fluctuating band must see nothing of star save now then brighter circle flickering in blue landscape be misty vague be still on hillside upon house now stand shoulder rose above grey dim saw tree growing changing like puff of vapour now brown now green grew spread shivered passed away saw huge building rise up faint fair pas like dream whole surface of earth seemed changedmelting flowing under eye little hand upon dial registered speed raced round faster faster presently noted that sun belt swayed up down from solstice to solstice in minute le that consequently pace be over year minute minute by minute white snow flashed across world vanished be followed by bright brief green of spring unpleasant sensation of start be le poignant now merged at last into kind of hysterical exhilaration remarked indeed clumsy swaying of machine for be unable to account mind be too confused to attend to so with kind of madness growing upon flung into futurity at first scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything new sensation presently fresh series of impression grew up in minda certain curiosity therewith certain dreaduntil at last took complete possession of what strange development of humanity what wonderful advance upon rudimentary civilisation thought might not appear when came to look nearly into dim elusive world raced fluctuated before eye saw great splendid architecture rising about more massive than building of own time yet a seemed built of glimmer mist saw richer green flow up hillside remain there without wintry intermission even through veil of confusion earth seemed very fair so mind came round to business of stopping peculiar risk lay in possibility of finding substance in space machine occupied so long a travelled at high velocity through time scarcely mattered be so to speak attenuatedwas slipping like vapour through interstice of intervening substance to come to stop involved jamming of molecule by molecule into lay in way meant bringing atom into such intimate contact with of obstacle that profound chemical reactionpossibly far reaching explosionwould result blow apparatus out of possible dimensionsinto unknown possibility have occurred to again again while be making machine then have cheerfully accepted a unavoidable riskone of risk man have got to take now risk be inevitable no longer saw in same cheerful light fact be that insensibly absolute strangeness of everything sickly jarring swaying of machine above feeling of prolonged falling have absolutely upset nerve told must never stop with gust of petulance resolved to stop forthwith like impatient fool lugged over lever incontinently thing went reeling over be flung headlong through air there be sound of clap of thunder in ear may have be stunned for moment pitiless hail be hissing round be sitting on soft turf in front of overset machine everything still seemed grey presently remarked that confusion in ear be gone looked round be on what seemed to be little lawn in garden surrounded by rhododendron bush noticed that mauve purple blossom be dropping in shower under beating of hailstone rebounding dancing hail hung in little cloud over machine drove along ground like smoke in moment be wet to skin fine hospitality said to man who have travelled innumerable year to see presently thought what fool be to get wet stood up looked round colossal figure carved apparently in white stone loomed indistinctly beyond rhododendron through hazy downpour else of world be invisible sensation must be hard to describe a column of hail grew thinner saw white figure more distinctly be very large for silver birch tree touched shoulder be of white marble in shape something like winged sphinx wing instead of being carried vertically at side be spread so that seemed to hover pedestal appeared to be of bronze be thick with verdigris chanced that face be towards sightless eye seemed to watch there be faint shadow of smile on lip be greatly weather worn that imparted unpleasant suggestion of disease stood looking at for little spacehalf minute perhaps hour seemed to advance to recede a hail drove before denser thinner at last tore eye from for moment saw that hail curtain have worn threadbare that sky be lightening with promise of sun looked up again at crouching white shape full temerity of voyage came suddenly upon what might appear when hazy curtain be altogether withdrawn what might not have happened to men what if cruelty have grown into common passion what if in interval race have lost manliness have developed into something inhuman unsympathetic overwhelmingly powerful might seem old world savage animal only more dreadful disgusting for common likenessa foul creature to be incontinently slain already saw other vast shapeshuge building with intricate parapet tall column with wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon through lessening storm be seized with panic fear turned frantically to time machine strove hard to readjust a did so shaft of sun smote through thunderstorm grey downpour be swept aside vanished like trailing garment of ghost above in intense blue of summer sky faint brown shred of cloud whirled into nothingness great building about stood out clear distinct shining with wet of thunderstorm picked out in white by unmelted hailstone piled along course felt naked in strange world felt a perhaps bird may feel in clear air knowing hawk wing above will swoop fear grew to frenzy took breathing space set teeth again grappled fiercely wrist knee with machine gave under desperate onset turned over struck chin violently one hand on saddle other on lever stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again with recovery of prompt retreat courage recovered looked more curiously le fearfully at world of remote future in circular opening high up in wall of nearer house saw group of figure clad in rich soft robe have seen face be directed towards then heard voice approaching coming through bush by white sphinx be head shoulder of men running one of emerged in pathway leading straight to little lawn upon stood with machine be slight creatureperhaps four foot highclad in purple tunic girdled at waist with leather belt sandal buskinsi must not clearly distinguish whichwere on foot leg be bare to knee head be bare noticing that noticed for first time how warm air be struck a being very beautiful graceful creature indescribably frail flushed face reminded of more beautiful kind of consumptivethat hectic beauty of used to hear so much at sight of suddenly regained confidence took hand from machine v in golden age in moment be standing face to face fragile thing out of futurity came straight up to laughed into eye absence from bearing of sign of fear struck at once then turned to two others who be following spoke to in strange very sweet liquid tongue there be others coming presently little group of perhaps eight ten of exquisite creature be about one of addressed came into head oddly enough that voice be too harsh deep for so shook head pointing to ear shook again came step forward hesitated then touched hand then felt other soft little tentacle upon back shoulder wanted to make sure be real there be nothing in at alarming indeed there be something in pretty little people inspired confidencea graceful gentleness certain childlike ease besides looked so frail that must fancy flinging whole dozen of about like ninepin made sudden motion to warn when saw little pink hand feeling at time machine happily then when be not too late thought of danger have hitherto forgotten reaching over bar of machine unscrewed little lever must set in motion put in pocket then turned again to see what must do in way of communication then looking more nearly into feature saw further peculiarity in dresden china type of prettiness hair be uniformly curly came to sharp end at neck cheek there be not faintest suggestion of on face ear be singularly minute mouth be small with bright red rather thin lip little chin ran to point eye be large mild andthis may seem egotism on parti fancied even that there be certain lack of interest might have expected in a made effort to communicate with simply stood round smiling speaking in soft cooing note to other began conversation pointed to time machine to myself then hesitating for moment how to express time pointed to sun at once quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple white followed gesture then astonished by imitating sound of thunder for moment be staggered though import of gesture be plain enough question have come into mind abruptly be creature fool may hardly understand how took see have always anticipated that people of year eight hundred two thousand odd must be incredibly in front of in knowledge art everything then one of suddenly asked question showed to be on intellectual level of one of five year old childrenasked in fact if have come from sun in thunderstorm let loose judgment have suspended upon clothes frail light limb fragile feature flow of disappointment rushed across mind for moment felt that have built time machine in vain nodded pointed to sun gave vivid rendering of thunderclap a startled withdrew pace so bowed then came one laughing towards carrying chain of beautiful flower altogether new to put about neck idea be received with melodious applause presently be running to fro for flower laughingly flinging upon until be almost smothered with blossom who have never seen like can scarcely imagine what delicate wonderful flower countless year of culture have created then someone suggested that plaything must be exhibited in nearest building so be led past sphinx of white marble have seemed to watch while with smile at astonishment towards vast grey edifice of fretted stone a went with memory of confident anticipation of profoundly grave intellectual posterity came with irresistible merriment to mind building have huge entry be altogether of colossal dimension be naturally most occupied with growing crowd of little people with big open portal yawned before shadowy mysterious general impression of world saw over head be tangled waste of beautiful bush flower long neglected yet weedless garden saw number of tall spike of strange white flower measuring foot perhaps across spread of waxen petal grew scattered a if wild among variegated shrub a say did not examine closely at time time machine be left deserted on turf among rhododendron arch of doorway be richly carved naturally did not observe carving very narrowly though fancied saw suggestion of old phnician decoration a passed through struck that be very badly broken weather worn several more brightly clad people met in doorway so entered dressed in dingy nineteenth century garment looking grotesque enough garlanded with flower surrounded by eddying mass of bright soft coloured robe shining white limb in melodious whirl of laughter laughing speech big doorway opened into proportionately great hall hung with roof be in shadow window partially glazed with coloured glass partially unglazed admitted tempered light floor be made up of huge block of very hard white metal not plate slabsblocks be so much worn a judged by going to fro of past generation a to be deeply channelled along more frequented way transverse to length be innumerable table made of slab of polished stone raised perhaps foot from floor upon be heap of fruit recognised a kind of hypertrophied raspberry orange for most part be strange between table be scattered great number of cushion upon conductor seated signing for to do likewise with pretty absence of ceremony began to eat fruit with hand flinging peel stalk so forth into round opening in side of table be not loath to follow example for felt thirsty hungry a did so surveyed hall at leisure perhaps thing struck most be dilapidated look stained glass window displayed only geometrical pattern be broken in many place curtain hung across lower end be thick with dust caught eye that corner of marble table near be fractured nevertheless general effect be extremely rich picturesque there be perhaps couple of hundred people dining in hall most of seated a near to a must come be watching with interest little eye shining over fruit be eating be clad in same soft yet strong silky material fruit by bye be diet people of remote future be strict vegetarian while be with in spite of carnal craving have to be frugivorous also indeed found afterwards horse cattle sheep dog have followed ichthyosaurus into extinction fruit be very delightful one in particular seemed to be in season time be therea floury thing in three sided huskwas especially good made staple at first be puzzled by strange fruit by strange flower saw later began to perceive import however be telling of fruit dinner in distant future now so soon a appetite be little checked determined to make resolute attempt to learn speech of new men of mine clearly be next thing to do fruit seemed convenient thing to begin upon holding one of up began series of interrogative sound gesture have considerable difficulty in conveying meaning at first effort met with stare of surprise inextinguishable laughter presently fair haired little creature seemed to grasp intention repeated name have to chatter explain business at great length to other first attempt to make exquisite little sound of language caused immense amount of genuine if uncivil amusement however felt like schoolmaster amidst child persisted presently have score of noun substantive at least at command then got to demonstrative pronoun even verb to eat be slow work little people soon tired wanted to get away from interrogation so determined rather of necessity to let give lesson in little dos when felt inclined very little dos found be before long for never met people more indolent more easily fatigued vi sunset of mankind queer thing soon discovered about little host be lack of interest must come to with eager cry of astonishment like child like child must soon stop examining wander away after other toy dinner conversational beginning ended noted for first time almost who have surrounded at first be gone be odd too how speedily came to disregard little people went out through portal into sunlit world again a soon a hunger be satisfied be continually meeting more of men of future who must follow little distance chatter laugh about having smiled gesticulated in friendly way leave again to own device calm of evening be upon world a emerged from great hall scene be lit by warm glow of setting sun at first thing be very confusing everything be so entirely different from world have knowneven flower big building have left be situated on slope of broad river valley thames have shifted perhaps mile from present position resolved to mount to summit of crest perhaps mile half away from must get wider view of planet in year eight hundred two thousand seven hundred one ad for must explain be date little dial of machine recorded a walked be watching for impression must possibly help to explain condition of ruinous splendour in found worldfor ruinous be little way up hill for instance be great heap of granite bound together by mass of aluminium vast labyrinth of precipitous wall crumpled heap amidst be thick heap of very beautiful pagoda like plantsnettles possiblybut wonderfully tinted with brown about leaf incapable of stinging be evidently derelict remains of vast structure to what end built must not determine be here be destined at later date to have very strange experiencethe first intimation of still stranger discoverybut of will speak in proper place looking round with sudden thought from terrace on rested for while realised that there be small house to be seen apparently single house possibly even household have vanished here there among greenery be palace like building house cottage form such characteristic feature of own english landscape have disappeared communism said to on heel of came thought looked at half dozen little figure be following then in flash perceived that have same form of costume same soft hairless visage same girlish rotundity of limb may seem strange perhaps have not noticed before everything be so strange now saw fact plainly enough in costume in difference of texture bearing now mark off sex from other people of future be alike child seemed to eye to be miniature of parent judged then that child of time be extremely precocious physically at least found afterwards abundant verification of opinion seeing ease security in people be living felt that close resemblance of sex be after what one must expect for strength of man softness of woman institution of family differentiation of occupation be mere militant necessity of age of physical force where population be balanced abundant much childbearing becomes evil rather than blessing to state where violence come rarely offspring be secure there be le necessityindeed there be necessityfor efficient family specialisation of sex with reference to childrens need disappears see beginning of even in own time in future age be complete must remind be speculation at time later be to appreciate how far fell short of reality while be musing upon thing attention be attracted by pretty little structure like well under cupola thought in transitory way of oddness of well still existing then resumed thread of speculation there be large building towards top of hill a walking power be evidently miraculous be presently left alone for first time with strange sense of freedom adventure pushed on up to crest there found seat of yellow metal did not recognise corroded in place with kind of pinkish rust half smothered in soft moss arm rest cast filed into resemblance of griffin head sat down on surveyed broad view of old world under sunset of long day be a sweet fair view a have ever seen sun have already gone below horizon west be flaming gold touched with horizontal bar of purple crimson below be valley of thames in river lay like band of burnished steel have already spoken of great palace dotted about among variegated greenery in ruin still occupied here there rose white silvery figure in waste garden of earth here there came sharp vertical line of cupola obelisk there be hedge sign of proprietary right evidence of agriculture whole earth have become garden so watching began to put interpretation upon thing have seen a shaped to that evening interpretation be something in way afterwards found have got only half truthor only glimpse of one facet of truth seemed to that have happened upon humanity upon wane ruddy sunset set thinking of sunset of mankind for first time began to realise odd consequence of social effort in be at present engaged yet come to think be logical consequence enough strength be outcome of need security set premium on feebleness work of ameliorating condition of lifethe true civilising process make life more more securehad gone steadily on to climax one triumph of united humanity over nature have followed thing be now mere dream have become project deliberately put in hand carried forward harvest be what saw after sanitation agriculture of today be still in rudimentary stage science of time have attacked little department of field of human disease even so spread operation very steadily persistently agriculture horticulture destroy weed just here there cultivate perhaps

morlocks to judge by well must be then tall pinnacle of palace of green porcelain polished gleam of wall came back to memory in evening taking weena like child upon shoulder went up hill towards south west distance have reckoned be seven eight mile must have be nearer eighteen have first seen place on moist afternoon when distance be deceptively diminished in addition heel of one of shoe be loose nail be working through solethey be comfortable old shoe wore about indoorsso be lame be already long past sunset when came in sight of palace silhouetted black against pale yellow of sky weena have be hugely delighted when began to carry after while desired to let down ran along by side of occasionally darting off on hand to pick flower to stick in pocket pocket have always puzzled weena at last have concluded that be eccentric kind of vas for floral decoration at least utilised for purpose that reminds in changing jacket found time traveller paused put hand into pocket silently placed two withered flower not unlike very large white mallow upon little table then resumed narrative a hush of evening crept over world proceeded over hill crest towards wimbledon weena grew tired wanted to return to house of grey stone pointed out distant pinnacle of palace of green porcelain to contrived to make understand that be seeking refuge there from fear know that great pause come upon thing before dusk even breeze stop in tree to there be always air of expectation about evening stillness sky be clear remote empty save for few horizontal bar far down in sunset well night expectation took colour of fear in darkling calm sens seemed preternaturally sharpened fancied must even feel hollowness of ground beneath foot must indeed almost see through morlocks on ant hill going hither thither waiting for dark in excitement fancied that must receive invasion of burrow a declaration of war why have taken time machine so went on in quiet twilight deepened into night clear blue of distance faded one star after came out ground grew dim tree black weenas fear fatigue grew upon took in arm talked to caressed then a darkness grew deeper put arm round neck closing eye tightly pressed face against shoulder so went down long slope into valley there in dimness almost walked into little river waded went up opposite side of valley past number of sleeping house by statuea faun such figure minus head here too be acacia so far have seen nothing of morlocks be yet early in night darker hour before old moon rose be still to come from brow of next hill saw thick wood spreading wide black before hesitated at must see end to to right left feeling tiredmy foot in particular be very sorei carefully lowered weena from shoulder a halted sat down upon turf must no longer see palace of green porcelain be in doubt of direction looked into thickness of wood thought of what might hide under dense tangle of branch one must be out of sight of star even be there no other lurking dangera danger did not care to let imagination loose uponthere must still be root to stumble over tree bole to strike against be very tired too after excitement of day so decided must not face must pas night upon open hill weena be glad to find be fast asleep carefully wrapped in jacket sat down beside to wait for moonrise hillside be quiet deserted from black of wood there came now then stir of living thing above shone star for night be very clear felt certain sense of friendly comfort in twinkling old constellation have gone from sky however that slow movement be imperceptible in hundred human lifetime have long since rearranged in unfamiliar grouping milky way seemed to be still same tattered streamer of star dust a of yore southward a judged be very bright red star be new to be even more splendid than own green sirius amid scintillating point of light one bright planet shone kindly steadily like face of old friend looking at star suddenly dwarfed own trouble gravity of terrestrial life thought of unfathomable distance slow inevitable drift of movement out of unknown past into unknown future thought of great precessional cycle that pole of earth describes only forty time have that silent revolution occurred during year have traversed during few revolution activity tradition complex organisation nation language literature aspiration even mere memory of man a knew have be swept out of existence instead be frail creature who have forgotten high ancestry white thing of went in terror then thought of great fear be between two specie for first time with sudden shiver came clear knowledge of what meat have seen might be yet be too horrible looked at little weena sleeping beside face white starlike under star forthwith dismissed thought through long night held mind off morlocks a well a must whiled away time by trying to fancy must find sign of old constellation in new confusion sky kept very clear except for hazy cloud so doubt dozed at time then a vigil wore on came faintness in eastward sky like reflection of colourless fire old moon rose thin peaked white close behind overtaking overflowing dawn came pale at first then growing pink warm morlocks have approached indeed have seen none upon hill night in confidence of renewed day almost seemed to that fear have be unreasonable stood up found foot with loose heel swollen at ankle painful under heel so sat down again took off shoe flung away awakened weena went down into wood now green pleasant instead of black forbidding found fruit wherewith to break fast soon met others of dainty one laughing dancing in sunlight a though there be such thing in nature a night then thought once more of meat have seen felt assured now of what be from bottom of heart pitied last feeble rill from great flood of humanity clearly at time in long ago of human decay morlocks food have run short possibly have lived on rat such like vermin even now man be far le discriminating exclusive in food than wasfar le than monkey prejudice against human flesh be deep seated instinct so inhuman son of men tried to look at thing in scientific spirit after be le human more remote than cannibal ancestor of three four thousand year ago intelligence must have made state of thing torment have gone why must trouble eloi be mere fatted cattle ant like morlocks preserved preyed uponprobably saw to breeding of there be weena dancing at side then tried to preserve from horror be coming upon by regarding a rigorous punishment of human selfishness man have be content to live in ease delight upon labour of fellow man have taken necessity a watchword excuse in fullness of time necessity have come home to even tried carlyle like scorn of wretched aristocracy in decay attitude of mind be impossible however great intellectual degradation eloi have kept too much of human form not to claim sympathy to make perforce sharer in degradation fear have at time very vague idea a to course must pursue first be to secure safe place of refuge to make such arm of metal stone a must contrive necessity be immediate in next place hoped to procure mean of fire so must have weapon of torch at hand for nothing knew must be more efficient against morlocks then wanted to arrange contrivance to break open door of bronze under white sphinx have in mind battering ram have persuasion that if must enter door carry blaze of light before must discover time machine escape must not imagine morlocks be strong enough to move far away weena have resolved to bring with to own time turning such scheme over in mind pursued way towards building fancy have chosen a dwelling palace of green porcelain found palace of green porcelain when approached about noon deserted falling into ruin only ragged vestige of glass remained in window great sheet of green facing have fallen away from corroded metallic framework lay very high upon turfy down looking north eastward before entered be surprised to see large estuary even creek where judged wandsworth battersea must once have be thought thenthough never followed up thoughtof what might have happened might be happening to living thing in sea material of palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain along face of saw inscription in unknown character thought rather foolishly that weena might help to interpret only learnt that bare idea of writing have never entered head always seemed to fancy more human than be perhaps because affection be so human within big valve of doorwhich be open brokenwe found instead of customary hall long gallery lit by many side window at first glance be reminded of museum tiled floor be thick with dust remarkable array of miscellaneous object be shrouded in same grey covering then perceived standing strange gaunt in centre of hall what be clearly lower part of huge skeleton recognised by oblique foot that be extinct creature after fashion of megatherium skull upper bone lay beside in thick dust in one place where rain water have dropped through leak in roof thing have be worn away further in gallery be huge skeleton barrel of brontosaurus museum hypothesis be confirmed going towards side found what appeared to be sloping shelf clearing away thick dust found old familiar glass case of own time must have be air tight to judge from fair preservation of of content clearly stood among ruin of latter day south kensington here apparently be palontological section very splendid array of fossil must have be though inevitable process of decay have be staved off for time have through extinction of bacteria fungi lost ninety nine hundredth of force be nevertheless with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon treasure here there found trace of little people in shape of rare fossil broken to piece threaded in string upon reed case have in instance be bodily removedby morlocks a judged place be very silent thick dust deadened footstep weena who have be rolling sea urchin down sloping glass of case presently came a stared about very quietly took hand stood beside at first be so much surprised by ancient monument of intellectual age gave thought to possibility presented even preoccupation about time machine receded little from mind to judge from size of place palace of green porcelain have great deal more in than gallery of palontology possibly historical gallery might be even library to at least in present circumstance must be vastly more interesting than spectacle of old time geology in decay exploring found short gallery running transversely to first appeared to be devoted to mineral sight of block of sulphur set mind running on gunpowder must find saltpetre indeed nitrate of kind doubtless have deliquesced age ago yet sulphur hung in mind set up train of thinking a for rest of content of gallery though on whole be best preserved of saw have little interest be specialist in mineralogy went on down very ruinous aisle running parallel to first hall have entered apparently section have be devoted to natural history everything have long since passed out of recognition few shrivelled blackened vestige of what have once be stuffed animal desiccated mummy in jar have once held spirit brown dust of departed plant be be sorry for because must have be glad to trace patient readjustment by conquest of animated nature have be attained then came to gallery of simply colossal proportion singularly ill lit floor of running downward at slight angle from end at entered at interval white globe hung from ceilingmany of cracked smashedwhich suggested that originally place have be artificially lit here be more in element for rising on side of be huge bulk of big machine greatly corroded many broken down still fairly complete know have certain weakness for mechanism be inclined to linger among more so a for most part have interest of puzzle must make only vaguest guess at what be for fancied that if must solve puzzle must find in possession of power might be of use against morlocks suddenly weena came very close to side so suddenly that startled have not be for think must have noticed that floor of gallery sloped at footnote may be of course that floor did not slope that museum be built into side of hilled end have come in at be quite above ground be lit by rare slit like window a went down length ground came up against window until at last there be pit like area of london house before only narrow line of daylight at top went slowly along puzzling about machine have be too intent upon to notice gradual diminution of light until weenas increasing apprehension drew attention then saw that gallery ran down at last into thick darkness hesitated then a looked round saw that dust be le abundant surface even further away towards dimness appeared to be broken by number of small narrow footprint sense of immediate presence of morlocks revived at felt be wasting time in academic examination of machinery called to mind that be already far advanced in afternoon have still weapon refuge mean of making fire then down in remote blackness of gallery heard peculiar pattering same odd noise have heard down well took weenas hand then struck with sudden idea left turned to machine from projected lever not unlike in signal box clambering upon stand grasping lever in hand put weight upon sideways suddenly weena deserted in central aisle began to whimper have judged strength of lever pretty correctly for snapped after minute strain rejoined with mace in hand more than sufficient judged for morlock skull might encounter longed very much to kill morlock so very inhuman may think to want to go killing one own descendant be impossible somehow to feel humanity in thing only disinclination to leave weena persuasion that if began to slake thirst for murder time machine might suffer restrained from going straight down gallery killing brute heard well mace in one hand weena in other went out of gallery into still larger one at first glance reminded of military chapel hung with tattered flag brown charred rag that hung from side of presently recognised a decaying vestige of book have long since dropped to piece semblance of print have left here there be warped board cracked metallic clasp told tale well enough have be literary man might perhaps have moralised upon futility of ambition a be thing struck with keenest force be enormous waste of labour to sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified at time will confess that thought chiefly of philosophical transaction own seventeen paper upon physical optic then going up broad staircase came to what may once have be gallery of technical chemistry here have not little hope of useful discovery except at one end where roof have collapsed gallery be well preserved went eagerly to unbroken case at last in one of really air tight case found box of match very eagerly tried be perfectly good be not even damp turned to weena dance cried to in own tongue for now have weapon indeed against horrible creature feared so in derelict museum upon thick soft carpeting of dust to weenas huge delight solemnly performed kind of composite dance whistling land of leal a cheerfully a must in part be modest cancan in part step dance in part skirt dance so far a tail coat permitted in part original for be naturally inventive a know now still think that for box of match to have escaped wear of time for immemorial year be most strange a for be most fortunate thing yet oddly enough found far unlikelier substance be camphor found in sealed jar that by chance suppose have be really hermetically sealed fancied at first that be paraffin wax smashed glass accordingly odour of camphor be unmistakable in universal decay volatile substance have chanced to survive perhaps through many thousand of century reminded of sepia painting have once seen done from ink of fossil belemnite must have perished become fossilised million of year ago be about to throw away remembered that be inflammable burnt with good bright flamewas in fact excellent candleand put in pocket found explosive however mean of breaking down bronze door a yet iron crowbar be most helpful thing have chanced upon nevertheless left gallery greatly elated can not tell story of long afternoon must require great effort of memory to recall exploration in at proper order remember long gallery of rusting stand of arm how hesitated between crowbar hatchet sword must not carry however bar of iron promised best against bronze gate there be number of gun pistol rifle most be mass of rust many be of new metal still fairly sound cartridge powder there may once have be have rotted into dust one corner saw be charred shattered perhaps thought by explosion among specimen in place be vast array of idolspolynesian mexican grecian phnician country on earth must think here yielding to irresistible impulse wrote name upon nose of steatite monster from south america particularly took fancy a evening drew on interest waned went through gallery after gallery dusty silent often ruinous exhibit sometimes mere heap of rust lignite sometimes fresher in one place suddenly found near model of tin mine then by merest accident discovered in air tight case two dynamite cartridge shouted eureka smashed case with joy then came doubt hesitated then selecting little side gallery made essay never felt such disappointment a did in waiting five ten fifteen minute for explosion never came of course thing be dummy a might have guessed from presence really believe that have not be so must have rushed off incontinently blown sphinx bronze door a proved chance of finding time machine together into non existence be after think that came to little open court within palace be turfed have three fruit tree so rested refreshed towards sunset began to consider position night be creeping upon inaccessible hiding place have still to be found that troubled very little now have in possession thing be perhaps best of defence against morlocksi have match have camphor in pocket too if blaze be needed seemed to that best thing must do must be to pas night in open protected by fire in morning there be getting of time machine towards a yet have only iron mace now with growing knowledge felt very differently towards bronze door up to have refrained from forcing largely because of mystery on other side have never impressed a being very strong hoped to find bar of iron not altogether inadequate for work xii in darkness emerged from palace while sun be still in part above horizon be determined to reach white sphinx early next morning ere dusk purposed pushing through wood have stopped on previous journey plan be to go a far a possible that night then building fire to sleep in protection of glare accordingly a went along gathered stick dried grass saw presently have arm full of such litter thus loaded progress be slower than have anticipated besides weena be tired also began to suffer from sleepiness too so that be full night before reached wood upon shrubby hill of edge weena must have stopped fearing darkness before singular sense of impending calamity must indeed have served a warning drove have be without sleep for night two day be feverish irritable felt sleep coming upon morlocks with while hesitated among black bush behind dim against blackness saw three crouching figure there be scrub long grass about did not feel safe from insidious approach forest calculated be rather le than mile across if must get through to bare hillside there a seemed to be altogether safer resting place thought that with match camphor must contrive to keep path illuminated through wood yet be evident that if be to flourish match with hand must have to abandon firewood so rather reluctantly put down then came into head must amaze friend behind by lighting be to discover atrocious folly of proceeding came to mind a ingenious move for covering retreat dont know if have ever thought what rare thing flame must be in absence of man in temperate climate sun heat be rarely strong enough to burn even when be focused by dewdrop a be sometimes case in more tropical district lightning may blast blacken rarely give rise to widespread fire decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with heat of fermentation rarely result in flame in decadence too art of fire making have be forgotten on earth red tongue went licking up heap of wood be altogether new strange thing to weena wanted to run to play with believe must have cast into have not restrained caught up in spite of struggle plunged boldly before into wood for little way glare of fire lit path looking back presently must see through crowded stem that from heap of stick blaze have spread to bush adjacent curved line of fire be creeping up grass of hill laughed at turned again to dark tree before be very black weena clung to convulsively there be still a eye grew accustomed to darkness sufficient light for to avoid stem overhead be simply black except where gap of remote blue sky shone down upon here there lit none of match because have hand free upon left arm carried little one in right hand have iron bar for way heard nothing crackling twig under foot faint rustle of breeze above own breathing throb of blood vessel in ear then seemed to know of pattering behind pushed on grimly pattering grew more distinct then caught same queer sound voice have heard in underworld there be evidently several of morlocks be closing in upon indeed in minute felt tug at coat then something at arm weena shivered violently became quite still be time for match to get one must put down did so a fumbled with pocket struggle began in darkness about knee perfectly silent on part with same peculiar cooing sound from morlocks soft little hand too be creeping over coat back touching even neck then match scratched fizzed held flaring saw white back of morlocks in flight amid tree hastily took lump of camphor from pocket prepared to light a soon a match must wane then looked at weena be lying clutching foot quite motionless with face to ground with sudden fright stooped to seemed scarcely to breathe block of camphor flung to ground a split flared up drove back morlocks shadow knelt down lifted wood behind seemed full of stir murmur of great company seemed to have fainted put carefully upon shoulder rose to push on then there came horrible realisation in manuvring with match weena have turned about several time now have not faintest idea in what direction lay path for knew might be facing back towards palace of green porcelain found in cold sweat have to think rapidly what to do determined to build fire encamp where be put weena still motionless down upon turfy bole very hastily a first lump of camphor waned began collecting stick leaf here there out of darkness round morlocks eye shone like carbuncle camphor flickered went out lit match a did so two white form have be approaching weena dashed hastily away one be so blinded by light that came straight for felt bone grind under blow of fist gave whoop of dismay staggered little way fell down lit piece of camphor went on gathering bonfire presently noticed how dry be of foliage above for since arrival on time machine matter of week no rain have fallen so instead of casting about among tree for fallen twig began leaping up dragging down branch very soon have choking smoky fire of green wood dry stick must economise camphor then turned to where weena lay beside iron mace tried what must to revive lay like one dead must not even satisfy whether not breathed now smoke of fire beat over towards must have made heavy of sudden moreover vapour of camphor be in air fire must not need replenishing for hour so felt very weary after exertion sat down wood too be full of slumbrous murmur did not understand seemed just to nod open eye be dark morlocks have hand upon flinging off clinging finger hastily felt in pocket for match box andit have gone then gripped closed with again in moment knew what have happened have slept fire have gone out bitterness of death came over soul forest seemed full of smell of burning wood be caught by neck by hair by arm pulled down be indescribably horrible in darkness to feel soft creature heaped upon felt a if be in monstrous spider web be overpowered went down felt little teeth nipping at neck rolled over a did so hand came against iron lever gave strength struggled up shaking human rat from holding bar short thrust where judged face might be must feel succulent giving of flesh bone under blow for moment be free strange exultation so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon knew that weena be lost determined to make morlocks pay for meat stood with back to tree swinging iron bar before whole wood be full of stir cry of minute passed voice seemed to rise to higher pitch of excitement movement grew faster yet none came within reach stood glaring at blackness then suddenly came hope what if morlocks be afraid close on heel of came strange thing darkness seemed to grow luminous very dimly began to see morlocks about methree battered at feetand then recognised with incredulous surprise that others be running in incessant stream a seemed from behind away through wood in front back seemed no longer white reddish a stood agape saw little red spark go drifting across gap of starlight between branch vanish at understood smell of burning wood slumbrous murmur be growing now into gusty roar red glow morlocks flight stepping out from behind tree looking back saw through black pillar of nearer tree flame of burning forest be first fire coming after with looked for weena be gone hissing crackling behind explosive thud a fresh tree burst into flame left little time for reflection iron bar still gripped followed in morlocks path be close race once flame crept forward so swiftly on right a ran be outflanked have to strike off to left at last emerged upon small open space a did so morlock came blundering towards past went on straight into fire now be to see most weird horrible thing think of beheld in future age whole space be a bright a day with reflection of fire in centre be hillock tumulus surmounted by scorched hawthorn beyond be arm of burning forest with yellow tongue already writhing from completely encircling space with fence of fire upon hillside be thirty forty morlocks dazzled by light heat blundering hither thither against other in bewilderment at first did not realise blindness struck furiously at with bar in frenzy of fear a approached killing one crippling several more when have watched gesture of one of groping under hawthorn against red sky heard moan be assured of absolute helplessness misery in glare struck more of yet now then one must come straight towards setting loose quivering horror that made quick to elude at one time flame died down somewhat feared foul creature must presently be able to see be thinking of beginning fight by killing of before must happen fire burst out again brightly stayed hand walked about hill among avoided looking for trace of weena weena be gone at last sat down on summit of hillock watched strange incredible company of blind thing groping to fro making uncanny noise to other a glare of fire beat on coiling uprush of smoke streamed across sky through rare tatter of red canopy remote a though belonged to universe shone little star two three morlocks came blundering into drove off with blow of fist trembling a did so for most part of night be persuaded be nightmare bit screamed in passionate desire to awake beat ground with hand got up sat down again wandered here there again sat down then must fall to rubbing eye calling upon god to let awake thrice saw morlocks put head down in kind of agony rush into flame at last above subsiding red of fire above streaming mass of black smoke whitening blackening tree stump diminishing number of dim creature came white light of day searched again for trace of weena there be none be plain that have left poor little body in forest can not describe how relieved to think that have escaped awful fate to seemed destined a thought of be almost moved to begin massacre of helpless abomination about contained hillock a have said be kind of island in forest from summit must now make out through haze of smoke palace of green porcelain from must get bearing for white sphinx so leaving remnant of damned soul still going hither thither moaning a day grew clearer tied grass about foot limped on across smoking ash among black stem still pulsated internally with fire towards hiding place of time machine walked slowly for be almost exhausted a well a lame felt intensest wretchedness for horrible death of little weena seemed overwhelming calamity now in old familiar room be more like sorrow of dream than actual loss that morning left absolutely lonely againterribly alone began to think of house of mine of fireside of of with such thought came longing be pain a walked over smoking ash under bright morning sky made discovery in trouser pocket be still loose match box must have leaked before be lost xiii trap of white sphinx about eight nine in morning came to same seat of yellow metal from have viewed world upon evening of arrival thought of hasty conclusion upon evening must not refrain from laughing bitterly at confidence here be same beautiful scene same abundant foliage same splendid palace magnificent ruin same silver river running between fertile bank gay robe of beautiful people moved hither thither among tree be bathing in exactly place where have saved weena that suddenly gave keen stab of pain like blot upon landscape rose cupola above way to underworld understood now what beauty of overworld people covered very pleasant be day a pleasant a day of cattle in field like cattle knew of enemy provided against need end be same grieved to think how brief dream of human intellect have be have committed suicide have set steadfastly towards comfort ease balanced society with security permanency a watchword have attained hopesto come to at last once life

a see upperworld man have drifted towards feeble prettiness underworld to mere mechanical industry that perfect state have lacked one thing even for mechanical perfectionabsolute permanency apparently a time went on feeding of underworld however be effected have become disjointed mother necessity who have be staved off for few thousand year came back again began below underworld being in contact with machinery however perfect still need little thought outside habit have probably retained perforce rather more initiative if le of other human character than upper when other meat failed turned to what old habit have hitherto forbidden so say saw in last view of world of eight hundred two thousand seven hundred one may be a wrong explanation a mortal wit must invent be how thing shaped to a give to after fatigue excitement terror of past day in spite of grief seat tranquil view warm sunlight be very pleasant be very tired sleepy soon theorising passed into dozing catching at took own hint spreading out upon turf have long refreshing sleep awoke little before sunsetting now felt safe against being caught napping by morlocks stretching came on down hill towards white sphinx have crowbar in one hand other hand played with match in pocket now came most unexpected thing a approached pedestal of sphinx found bronze valve be open have slid down into groove at stopped short before hesitating to enter within be small apartment on raised place in corner of be time machine have small lever in pocket so here after elaborate preparation for siege of white sphinx be meek surrender threw iron bar away almost sorry not to use sudden thought came into head a stooped towards portal for once at least grasped mental operation of morlocks suppressing strong inclination to laugh stepped through bronze frame up to time machine be surprised to find have be carefully oiled cleaned have suspected since that morlocks have even partially taken to piece while trying in dim way to grasp purpose now a stood examined finding pleasure in mere touch of contrivance thing have expected happened bronze panel suddenly slid up struck frame with clang be in darktrapped so morlocks thought at chuckled gleefully must already hear murmuring laughter a came towards very calmly tried to strike match have only to fix on lever depart then like ghost have overlooked one little thing match be of abominable kind light only on box may imagine how calm vanished little brute be close upon one touched made sweeping blow in dark at with lever began to scramble into saddle of machine then came one hand upon then then have simply to fight against persistent finger for lever at same time feel for stud over fitted one indeed almost got away from a slipped from hand have to butt in dark with headi must hear morlocks skull ringto recover be nearer thing than fight in forest think last scramble at last lever be fixed pulled over clinging hand slipped from darkness presently fell from eye found in same grey light tumult have already described xiv further vision have already told of sickness confusion that come with time travelling time be not seated properly in saddle sideways in unstable fashion for indefinite time clung to machine a swayed vibrated quite unheeding how went when brought to look at dial again be amazed to find where have arrived one dial record day thousand of day million of day thousand of million now instead of reversing lever have pulled over so a to go forward with when came to look at indicator found that thousand hand be sweeping round a fast a second hand of watchinto futurity a drove on peculiar change crept over appearance of thing palpitating greyness grew darker thenthough be still travelling with prodigious velocitythe blinking succession of day night be usually indicative of slower pace returned grew more more marked puzzled very much at first alternation of night day grew slower slower so did passage of sun across sky until seemed to stretch through century at last steady twilight brooded over earth twilight only broken now then when comet glared across darkling sky band of light have indicated sun have long since disappeared for sun have ceased to setit simply rose fell in west grew ever broader more red trace of moon have vanished circling of star growing slower slower have given place to creeping point of light at last time before stopped sun red very large halted motionless upon horizon vast dome glowing with dull heat now then suffering momentary extinction at one time have for little while glowed more brilliantly again speedily reverted to sullen red heat perceived by slowing down of rising setting that work of tidal drag be done earth have come to rest with one face to sun even a in own time moon face earth very cautiously for remembered former headlong fall began to reverse motion slower slower went circling hand until thousand one seemed motionless daily one be no longer mere mist upon scale still slower until dim outline of desolate beach grew visible stopped very gently sat upon time machine looking round sky be no longer blue north eastward be inky black out of blackness shone brightly steadily pale white star overhead be deep indian red starless south eastward grew brighter to glowing scarlet where cut by horizon lay huge hull of sun red motionless rock about be of harsh reddish colour trace of life must see at first be intensely green vegetation covered projecting point on south eastern face be same rich green one see on forest moss on lichen in cave plant like grow in perpetual twilight machine be standing on sloping beach sea stretched away to south west to rise into sharp bright horizon against wan sky there be breaker wave for not breath of wind be stirring only slight oily swell rose fell like gentle breathing showed that eternal sea be still moving living along margin where water sometimes broke be thick incrustation of saltpink under lurid sky there be sense of oppression in head noticed be breathing very fast sensation reminded of only experience of mountaineering from judged air to be more rarefied than be now far away up desolate slope heard harsh scream saw thing like huge white butterfly go slanting fluttering up into sky circling disappear over low hillock beyond sound of voice be so dismal that shivered seated more firmly upon machine looking round again saw that quite near what have taken to be reddish mass of rock be moving slowly towards then saw thing be really monstrous crab like creature can imagine crab a large a yonder table with many leg moving slowly uncertainly big claw swaying long antenn like carter whip waving feeling stalked eye gleaming at on side of metallic front back be corrugated ornamented with ungainly

have lighted there tried to brush away with hand in moment returned almost immediately came by ear struck at caught something threadlike be drawn swiftly out of hand with frightful qualm turned saw that have grasped antenna of monster crab stood just behind evil eye be wriggling on stalk mouth be alive with appetite vast ungainly claw smeared with algal slime be descending upon in moment hand be on lever have placed month between monster be still on same beach saw distinctly now a soon a stopped dozen of seemed to be crawling here there in sombre light among foliated sheet of intense green

green of lichenous plant thin air hurt one lung contributed to appalling effect moved on hundred year there be same red suna little larger little dullerthe same dying sea same chill air same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in out among green weed red rock in westward sky saw curved pale line like vast new moon so travelled stopping ever again in great stride of thousand year more drawn on by mystery of earth fate watching with strange fascination sun grow larger duller in westward sky life of old earth ebb away at last more than thirty million year hence huge red hot dome of sun have come to obscure nearly tenth part of darkling heaven then stopped once more for crawling multitude of crab have disappeared red beach save for livid green liverwort lichen seemed lifeless now be flecked with white bitter cold assailed rare white flake ever again came eddying down to north eastward glare of snow lay under starlight of sable sky must see undulating crest of hillock pinkish white there be fringe of ice along sea margin with drifting mass farther out main expanse of salt ocean bloody under eternal sunset be still unfrozen looked about to see if trace of animal life remained certain indefinable apprehension still kept in saddle of machine saw nothing moving in earth sky sea green slime on rock alone testified that life be not extinct willow sandbank have appeared in sea water have receded from beach fancied saw black object flopping about upon bank became motionless a looked at judged that eye have be deceived that black object be merely rock star in sky be intensely bright seemed to to twinkle very little suddenly noticed that circular westward outline of sun have changed that concavity bay have appeared in curve saw grow larger for minute perhaps stared aghast at blackness be creeping over day then realised that eclipse be beginning moon planet mercury be passing across sun disk naturally at first took to be moon there be much to incline to believe that what really saw be transit of inner planet passing very near to earth darkness grew apace cold wind began to blow in freshening gust from east showering white flake in air increased in number from
