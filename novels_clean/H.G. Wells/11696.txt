most part to become elderly who be called who be very properly called who dislike extremely to be called scientist dislike word so much that from column of nature be from first distinctive characteristic paper be a carefully excluded a if be that other word be basis of really bad language in country great public press know better scientist be when emerge to sort of publicity distinguished scientist eminent scientist well known scientist be very least call certainly mr bensington professor redwood quite merited of term long before came upon marvellous discovery of story tell mr bensington be fellow of royal society former president of chemical society professor redwood be professor of physiology in bond street college of london university have be grossly libelled by anti vivisectionist time after time have led life of academic distinction from very earliest youth be of course quite undistinguished looking men a indeed true scientist be there be more personal distinction about mildest mannered actor alive than there be about entire royal society mr bensington be short very very bald stooped slightly wore gold rimmed spectacle cloth boot be abundantly cut open because of numerous corn professor redwood be entirely ordinary in appearance until happened upon food of god a must insist upon calling led life of such eminent studious obscurity that be hard to find anything to tell reader about mr bensington won spur if one may use such expression of gentleman in boot of slashed cloth by splendid research upon more toxic alkaloid professor redwood rose to eminence clearly remember how rose to eminence know be very eminent be thing of sort grow fancy be voluminous work on reaction time with numerous plate of sphygmograph tracing write subject to correction admirable new terminology did thing for general public saw little nothing of of gentleman sometimes at place like royal institution society of art did in sort of way see mr bensington at least blushing baldness something of collar coat hear fragment of lecture paper that imagined to be reading audibly once remember one midday in vanished past when british association be at dover coming on section c d such letter have taken up quarter in public house following two serious looking lady with paper parcel out of mere curiosity through door labelled billiards pool into scandalous darkness broken only by magic lantern circle of redwood tracing watched lantern slide come go listened to voice forget what be saying believe be voice of professor redwood there be sizzling from lantern sound kept there still out of curiosity until light be unexpectedly turned up then perceived that sound be sound of munching of bun sandwich thing that assembled british associate have come there to eat under cover of magic lantern darkness redwood remember went on talking time light be up dabbing at place where diagram ought to have be visible on screen so be again so soon a darkness be restored remember then a most ordinary slightly nervous looking dark man with air of being preoccupied with something else doing what be doing just then under unaccountable sense of duty heard bensington also once in old day at educational conference in bloomsbury like most eminent chemist botanist mr bensington be very authoritative upon teaching though be certain must have be scared out of wit by average board school class in hour so far a can remember now be propounding improvement of professor armstrong heuristic method whereby at cost of three four hundred pound worth of apparatus total neglect of other study undivided attention of teacher of exceptional gift average child might with peculiar sort of thumby thoroughness learn in course of ten twelve year almost a much chemistry a one must get in one of objectionable shilling text book be then so common quite ordinary person perceive of outside science if anything on unpractical side of ordinary that will find be case with scientist a class world over what there be great of be annoyance to fellow scientist mystery to general public what be not be evident there be doubt about what be not great race of men have such obvious littleness live in narrow world so far a human intercourse go research involve infinite attention almost monastic seclusion what be left over be not very much to witness queer shy misshapen grey headed important little discoverer of great discovery ridiculously adorned with wide ribbon of order of chivalry holding reception of fellow men to read anguish of nature at neglect of science when angel of birthday honour pass royal society by to listen to one indefatigable lichenologist commenting on work of indefatigable lichenologist such thing force one to realise unfaltering littleness of men withal reef of science that little scientist built be yet building be so wonderful so portentous so full of mysterious half shapen promise for mighty future of man seem to realise thing be doing doubt long ago even mr bensington when chose calling when consecrated life to alkaloid kindred compound have inkling of vision more than inkling without such inspiration for such glory position only a scientist may expect what young man must have given life to such work a young men do must have seen glory must have have vision so near that have blinded splendour have blinded mercifully so that for rest of life can hold light of knowledge in comfort that may see perhaps account for redwood touch of preoccupation that there can be doubt of now among fellow be different be different inasmuch a something of vision still lingered in eye ii food of god call substance mr bensington professor redwood made between having regard now to what have already done that be certainly going to do there be surely exaggeration in name so will continue to call therefore throughout story mr bensington must no more have called that in cold blood than must have gone out from flat in sloane street clad in regal scarlet wreath of laurel phrase be mere first cry of astonishment from called food of god in enthusiasm for hour so at most altogether after that decided be being absurd when first thought of thing saw a be vista of enormous possibility literally enormous possibility upon dazzling vista after one stare of amazement resolutely shut eye even a conscientious scientist must after that food of god sounded blatant to pitch of indecency be surprised have used expression yet for something of clear eyed moment hung about broke out ever again really know said rubbing hand together laughing nervously have more than theoretical interest for example confided bringing face close to professor dropping to undertone must perhaps if suitably handled sell precisely said walking away a food at least food ingredient assuming of course that be palatable thing can not know till have prepared turned upon hearthrug studied carefully designed slit upon cloth shoe name said looking up in response to inquiry for part incline to good old classical allusion make science re give touch of old fashioned dignity have be thinking know if will think absurd of little fancy be surely occasionally permissible herakleophorbia eh nutrition of possible hercules know might of course if think not redwood reflected with eye on fire made objection think must do redwood moved head gravely might be titanophorbia know food of titan prefer former be quite sure think little too ah be glad so called herakleophorbia throughout investigation in report report be never published because of unexpected development upset arrangement be invariably written in way there be three kindred substance prepared before hit on one speculation have foretolds spoke of a herakleophorbia herakleophorbia ii herakleophorbia iii be herakleophorbia iv insisting upon bensington original name call here food of god iii idea be mr bensington a be suggested to by one of professor redwood contribution to philosophical transaction very properly consulted that gentleman before carried further besides be a research physiological quite a much a chemical inquiry professor redwood be one of scientific men who be addicted to tracing curve be familiar if be at sort of reader like with sort of scientific paper mean be paper can not make head tail of at end come five six long folded diagram open out show peculiar zigzag tracing flash of lightning overdone sinuous inexplicable thing called smoothed curve set up on ordinate rooting in abscissa thing like puzzle over thing for long time end with suspicion that not only do not understand that author doe not understand really know many of scientific people understand meaning of own paper quite well be simply defect of expression raise obstacle between be inclined to think that redwood thought in tracing curve after monumental work upon reaction time unscientific reader be exhorted to stick to for little bit longer everything will be a clear a daylight redwood began to turn out smoothed curve sphygmographeries upon growth be one of paper upon growth that really gave bensington idea redwood know have be measuring growing thing of sort kitten puppy sunflower mushroom bean plant until wife put stop to baby showed that growth went out not at regular pace a put so with burst intermission of sort apparently nothing grew regularly steadily so far a must make out nothing must grow regularly steadily be a if living thing have just to accumulate force to grow grew with vigour only for time then have to wait for space before must go on growing again in muffled highly technical language of really careful scientist redwood suggested that process of growth probably demanded presence of considerable quantity of necessary substance in blood be only formed very slowly that when substance be used up by growth be only very slowly replaced that meanwhile organism have to mark time compared unknown substance to oil in machinery growing animal be rather like engine suggested that can move certain distance must then be oiled before can run again why must one oil engine from without said mr bensington when read paper said redwood with delightful nervous inconsecutiveness of class might very probably be found to throw light upon mystery of certain of ductless gland a though have anything to do with at in subsequent communication redwood went further gave perfect brock benefit of diagram exactly like rocket trajectory be gist of so far a have gist be that blood of puppy kitten sap of sunflower juice of mushroom in what called growing phase differed in proportion of certain element from blood sap on day when be not particularly growing when mr bensington after holding diagram sideways upside down began to see what difference be great amazement came upon because see difference might probably be due to presence of just very substance have recently be trying to isolate in research upon such alkaloid a be most stimulating to nervous system put down redwood paper on patent reading desk that swung inconveniently from arm chair took off gold rimmed spectacle breathed on wiped very carefully by jove said mr bensington then replacing spectacle again turned to patent reading desk immediately a elbow came against arm gave coquettish squeak deposited paper with diagram in dispersed crumpled state on floor by jove said mr bensington straining stomach over arm chair with patient disregard of habit of convenience then finding pamphlet still out of reach went down on four in pursuit be on floor that idea of calling food of god came to for see if be right redwood be right then by injecting administering new substance of in food must do away with resting phase instead of growth going on in fashion must if follow go thus iv night after conversation with redwood mr bensington must scarcely sleep wink did seem once to get into sort of doze be only for moment then dreamt have dug deep hole into earth poured in ton ton of food of god earth be swelling swelling boundary of country be bursting royal geographical society be at work like one great guild of tailor letting out equator that of course be ridiculous dream show state of mental excitement into mr bensington got real value attached to idea much better than of thing said did when be awake on guard must not have mentioned because a general rule think be at interesting for people to tell other about dream by singular coincidence redwood also have dream night dream be be diagram done in fire upon long scroll of abyss redwood be standing on planet before sort of black platform lecturing about new sort of growth be now possible to more than royal institution of primordial force force have always previously even in growth of race empire planetary system world gone so even in case so be explaining to quite lucidly convincingly that slow even retrogressive method must be very speedily quite put out of fashion by discovery ridiculous of course that too show that dream be to be regarded a in way significant prophetic beyond what have categorically said for one moment suggest chapter second experimental farm mr bensington proposed originally to try stuff so soon a be really able to prepare upon tadpole one always doe try sort of thing upon tadpole to begin with being what tadpole be for be agreed that must conduct experiment not redwood because redwood laboratory be occupied with ballistic apparatus animal necessary for investigation into diurnal variation in butting frequency of young bull calf investigation be yielding curve of abnormal very perplexing sort presence of glass globe of tadpole be extremely undesirable while particular research be in progress when mr bensington conveyed to cousin jane something of what have in mind put prompt veto upon importation of considerable number of tadpole such experimental creature into flat have objection to use of one of room of flat for purpose of non explosive chemistry so far a be concerned came to nothing let have gas furnace sink dust tight cupboard of refuge from weekly storm of cleaning must not forego having known people addicted to drink regarded solicitude for distinction in learned society a excellent substitute for coarser form of depravity sort of living thing in quantity wriggly a be bound to be alive smelly dead must not must not abide said thing be certain to be unhealthy bensington be notoriously delicate man be nonsense to say be when bensington tried to make enormous importance of possible discovery clear said that be very well if consented to making everything nasty unwholesome in place be what came to then be certain must be first to complain mr bensington went up down room regardless of corn spoke to quite firmly angrily without slightest effect said that nothing ought to stand in way of advancement of science said that advancement of science be one thing having lot of tadpole in flat be said that in germany be ascertained fact that man with idea like must at once have twenty thousand properly fitted cubic foot of laboratory placed at disposal said be glad always have be glad that be not german said that must make famous for ever said be much more likely to make ill to have lot of tadpole in flat like said be master in own house said that rather than wait on lot of tadpole 'd go a matron to school then asked to be reasonable asked to be reasonable then give up about tadpole said might respect idea said not if be smelly must then gave way completely said in spite of classical remark of huxley upon subject bad word not very bad word be bad enough after be greatly offended have to be apologised to prospect of ever trying food of god upon tadpole in flat at rate vanished completely in apology so bensington have to consider other way of carrying out experiment in feeding must be necessary to demonstrate discovery so soon a have substance isolated prepared for day meditated upon possibility of boarding out tadpole with trustworthy person then chance sight of phrase in newspaper turned thought to experimental farm chick directly thought of thought of a poultry farm be suddenly taken with vision of wildly growing chick conceived picture of coop run outsize still more outsize coop run progressively larger chick be so accessible so easily fed observed so much drier to handle measure for purpose tadpole seemed to now in comparison with quite wild uncontrollable beast be quite puzzled to understand why have not thought of chick instead of tadpole from beginning among other thing must have saved trouble with cousin jane when suggested to redwood redwood quite agreed with redwood said that in working so much upon needlessly small animal be convinced experimental physiologist made great mistake be exactly like making experiment in chemistry with insufficient quantity of material error of observation manipulation become disproportionately large be of extreme importance just at present that scientific men must assert right to have material big be why be doing present series of experiment at bond street college upon bull calf in spite of certain amount of inconvenience to student professor of other subject caused by incidental levity in corridor curve be getting be quite exceptionally interesting must when published amply justify choice for own part be not for inadequate endowment of science in country must never if must avoid work on anything smaller than whale public vivarium on sufficient scale to render possible be feared at present in country at rate utopian demand in germany etc a redwood bull calf needed daily attention selection equipment of experimental farm fell largely on bensington entire cost also be be understood to be defrayed by bensington at least until grant must be obtained accordingly alternated work in laboratory of flat with farm hunting up down line run southward out of london peering spectacle simple baldness

london stopped at dunton green closed with eligible couple have answered advertisement same evening succeeded in isolating sufficient quantity of herakleophorbia to more than justify engagement eligible couple who be destined under mr bensington to be first almoner on earth of food of god be not only very perceptibly aged also extremely dirty latter point mr bensington did not observe

window spotted overmantel looking glass ailing calceolaria mr skinner be very little old woman capless with dirty white hair drawn back very very tightly from face have begun by being chiefly be now through loss of teeth chin wrinkling up of everything else ending by being almost exclusively nose be dressed in slate colour so far a dress have colour slashed in one place with red flannel let in talked to guardedly peered at round over nose while mr skinner alleged made alteration in toilette have one tooth got into articulation held two long wrinkled hand nervously together told bensington that have managed fowl for year knew about incubator in fact have run poultry farm at one time have only failed at last through want of pupil be pupil a pay said mr skinner mr skinner when appeared be large faced man with lisp squint made look over top of head slashed slipper appealed to mr bensington sympathy manifest shortness of button held coat shirt together with one hand traced pattern on black gold tablecloth with index finger of other while disengaged eye watched mr bensington sword of damocles so to speak with expression of sad detachment want to run thith farm for profit thir ith

hickleybrow spoke in confidential manner one sad eye regarded distant village one be bright wicked got to be meathured blethed day blethed ' e thays tho a to thee grow properly what oh eh blethed blethed day mr skinner put up hand to laugh behind in refined contagious manner humped shoulder very much only other eye of failed to participate in laughter then doubting if carpenter have quite got point of repeated in penetrating whisper meathured e worse than old guvnor be dratted if ' e ai said carpenter from hickleybrow ii experimental work be most tedious thing in world unless be report of in philosophical transaction seemed long time to mr bensington before first dream of enormous possibility be replaced by crumb of realisation have taken experimental farm in october be may before first inkling of success began herakleophorbia ii iii have to be tried failed there be trouble with rat of experimental farm there be trouble with skinner only way to get skinner to do anything be told to do be to dismiss then must nib unshaven chin be always unshaven most miraculously yet never bearded with flattened hand look at mr bensington with one eye over with other say oo of courthe thir if be theriouth at last success dawned herald be letter in long slender handwriting of mr skinner new brood be out wrote mr skinner quite like look of growing very rank quite unlike what similar lot be before last direction be given last before cat got be very nice stocky chick be growing like thistle never saw peck so hard striking above boot top be unable to give exact measure a requested be regular giant eating a such will want more corn very soon for never saw such chick to eat bigger than bantam going on at rate ought to be bird for show rank a be plymouth rock wo be in have scare last night thinking that cat be at when looked out at window must have sworn see getting in under wire chick be awake pecking about hungry when went out must not see anything of cat so gave peck of corn fastened up safe will be glad to know if feeding to be continued a directed food mixed be pretty near gone like to mix more myself on account of accident with pudding with best wish from soliciting continuance of esteemed favour respectfully yours alfred newton skinner allusion towards end referred to milk pudding with herakleophorbia ii have got mixed with painful very nearly fatal result to skinner mr bensington reading between line saw in rankness of growth attainment of long sought goal next morning alighted at urshot station in bag in hand carried sealed in three tin supply of food of god sufficient for chick in kent be bright beautiful morning late in may corn be so much better that resolved to walk through hickleybrow to farm be three mile half altogether through park village then along green glade of hickleybrow preserve tree be dusted with green spangle of high spring hedge be full of stitchwort campion wood of blue hyacinth purple orchid everywhere there be great noise of bird thrush blackbird robin finch many more in one warm corner of park bracken be unrolling there be leaping rushing of fallow deer thing brought back to mr bensington early forgotten delight in life before promise of discovery grew bright joyful seemed to that indeed must have come upon happiest day in life when in sunlit run by sandy bank under shadow of pine tree saw chick have eaten food have mixed for gigantic gawky bigger already than many hen be married settled still growing still in first soft yellow plumage just faintly marked with brown along back knew indeed that happiest day have come at mr skinner urgency went into run after have be pecked through crack in shoe once twice got out again watched monster through wire netting peered close to netting followed movement a though have never seen chick before in life whath will be when be grown up ith impothible to think said mr skinner big a horse said mr bensington pretty near said mr skinner several people must dine off wing said mr bensington 'd cut up into joint like butcher meat wo go on growing at thith pathe though said mr skinner said mr bensington said mr skinner know thith thort begin rank go on bleth there be pause itth management said mr skinner modestly mr bensington turned glass on suddenly got ath big at other plathe said mr skinner with better eye piously uplifted letting go little mithith mr bensington made usual general inspection of premise speedily returned to new run be know in truth ever so much more than have dared to expect course of science be so tortuous so slow after clear promise before practical realisation arrives there come almost always year after year of intricate contrivance here here be food of god arriving after le than year of testing seemed too good too good that hope deferred be daily food of scientific imagination be to be more so at least seemed to then came back stared at stupendous chick of time after time let see said be ten day old by side of ordinary chick must fancy about six seven time a big itth about time artht for rithe in thkrew said mr skinner to wife he'th ath pleathed ath punth about way got thothe chickth on in further run pleathed ath punth ith bent confidentially towards thinkth it'th old food of hith said behind hand made noise of suppressed laughter in pharyngeal cavity mr bensington be indeed happy man day be in mood to find fault with detail of management bright day certainly brought out accumulating slovenliness of skinner couple more vividly than have ever seen before comment be of gentlest fencing of many of run be out of order seemed to consider quite satisfactory when mr skinner explained that be fokth dog thomething did pointed out that incubator have not be cleaned that a sir said mr skinner with arm folded smiling coyly behind nose seem to have have time to clean not since be 'ere went upstairs to see rat hole skinner said must justify trap certainly be enormous discovered that room in food of god be mixed with meal bran be in quite disgraceful order skinner be sort of people who find use for cracked saucer old can pickle jar mustard box place be littered with in one corner great pile of apple skinner have saved be decaying from nail in sloping part of ceiling hung several rabbit skin upon proposed to test gift a furrier there ith mutth about furth thingth know said skinner mr bensington certainly sniffed critically at disorder made unnecessary fuss even when found wasp regaling in gallipot half full of herakleophorbia iv simply remarked mildly that substance be better sealed from damp than exposed to air in manner turned from thing at once to remark what have be for time in mind think skinner know will kill one of chick a specimen think will kill afternoon will take back with to london pretended to peer into gallipot then took off spectacle to wipe must like said must like very much to have relic memento of particular brood at particular day by bye said give little chick meat oh thir said skinner can athure thir know far too much about management of fowlth of dethcriptionth to do anything of thort quite sure throw dinner refuse thought noticed bone of rabbit scattered about far corner of run when came to look at found be larger bone of cat picked very clean dry iii be chick said mr bensington cousin jane well must think knew chick when saw said mr bensington cousin jane hotly be too big for chick for one thing besides can see perfectly well be chick be more like bustard than chick for part said redwood reluctantly allowing bensington to drag into argument must confess that considering evidence oh if do said mr bensington cousin jane instead of using eye like sensible person well really miss bensington oh go on said cousin jane men be alike considering evidence certainly fall within definition doubt be abnormal hypertrophied still especially since be hatched from egg of normal hen yes think miss bensington must admit so far a one can call anything be sort of chick mean be chick said cousin jane think be chick said redwood what nonsense said mr bensington cousin jane oh directed at redwood head have patience with then suddenly turned about went out of room with slam be very great relief for to see too bensington said redwood when reverberation of slam have died away in spite of being so big without urgency from mr bensington sat down in low arm chair by fire confessed to proceeding even in unscientific man must have be indiscreet will think very rash of bensington know said fact be put little not very much of into baby bottle very nearly week ago suppose cried mr bensington know said redwood glanced at giant chick upon plate on table be turned out right thank goodness felt in pocket for cigarette gave fragmentary detail poor little chap be putting on weight desperately anxious winkle frightful duffer former pupil of mine good mr redwood unmitigated confidence in winkle know man with manner like cliff towering confidence in of course taught winkle scarcely allowed in nursery something have to be done slipped in while nurse be at breakfast got at bottle will grow said mr bensington be growing twenty seven ounce last week must hear winkle be management said dear be what skinner say redwood looked at chick again bother be to keep up said wo trust in nursery alone because tried to get growth curve out of georgina phyllis know how be to give second dose need be be cry two day ca get on with ordinary food again anyhow want more now tell winkle hang winkle said redwood might get at winkle give powder to give child be about what will have to do said redwood resting chin on fist staring into fire bensington stood for space smoothing down on breast of giant chick will be monstrous fowl said will said redwood still with eye on glow big a horse said bensington bigger said redwood be just bensington turned away from specimen redwood said fowl be going to create sensation redwood nodded head at fire by jove said bensington coming round suddenly with flash in spectacle so will little boy be just what be thinking of said redwood sat back sighed threw unconsumed cigarette into fire thrust hand deep into trouser pocket be precisely what be thinking of herakleophorbia be going to be queer stuff to handle pace chick must have grown at little boy growing at pace said mr bensington slowly stared at chick a spoke say said bensington will be big will give diminishing dos said redwood at rate winkle will be rather too much of experiment much yet still know must confess baby will sooner later have to try oh will try on baby certainly exactly so said bensington came stood on hearthrug took off spectacle to wipe until saw chick redwood think began to realise anything of possibility of what be making be only beginning to dawn upon possible consequence even then know mr bensington be far from conception of mine little train must fire iv happened early in june for week bensington be kept from revisiting experimental farm by severe imaginary catarrh one necessary flying visit be made by redwood returned even more anxious looking parent than have gone altogether there be seven week of steady uninterrupted growth then wasp began career be late in july nearly week before hen escaped from hickleybrow that first of big wasp be killed report of appeared in several paper know whether news reached mr bensington much le whether connected with general laxity of method prevailed in experimental farm there can be little doubt now that while mr skinner be plying mr bensington chick with herakleophorbia iv number of wasp be just a industriously perhaps more industriously carrying quantity of same paste to early summer brood in sand bank beyond adjacent pine wood there can be dispute that early brood found just a much growth benefit in substance a mr bensington hen be in nature of wasp to attain to effective maturity before domestic fowl in fact of creature be through generous carelessness of skinner partaking of benefit mr bensington heaped upon hen wasp be first to make sort of figure in world be keeper named godfrey on estate of lieutenant colonel rupert hick near maidstone who encountered have luck to kill first of monster of whom history have record be walking knee high in bracken across open space in beechwood diversify lieutenant colonel hick park be carrying gun very fortunately for double barrelled gun over shoulder when first caught sight of thing be say coming down against light so that must not see very distinctly a came made drone like motor car admits be frightened be evidently a big bigger than barn owl to practised eye flight particularly misty whirl of wing must have seemed weirdly unbirdlike instinct of self defence fancy mingled with long habit when a say let fly right away queerness of experience probably affected aim at rate most of shot missed thing merely dropped for moment with angry wuzzzz revealed wasp at once then rose again with stripe shining against light say turned on at rate fired second barrel at le than twenty yard threw down gun ran pace so ducked to avoid flew be convinced within yard of struck ground rose again came down again perhaps thirty yard away rolled over with body wriggling sting stabbing out back in last agony emptied barrel into again before ventured to go near when came to

nearly correct compound eye be size of penny piece be first authenticated appearance of giant wasp day after cyclist riding foot up down hill between sevenoaks tonbridge very narrowly missed running

towards westerham after riding unsteadily for little time put on brake dismounted be trembling so violently that fell over machine in doing so sat down by roadside to recover have intended to ride to ashford did not get beyond tonbridge that day after curiously enough there be record of big wasp being seen for three day find on consulting meteorological record of day that be overcast chilly with local shower may perhaps account for intermission then on fourth day came blue sky brilliant sunshine outburst of wasp a world have surely never seen before how many big wasp came out that day be impossible to guess there be at least fifty account of apparition there be one victim grocer who discovered one of monster in sugar cask very rashly attacked with spade a rose struck to ground for moment stung through boot a struck at again cut body in half be first dead of two most dramatic of fifty appearance be certainly that of wasp visited british museum about midday dropping out of blue serene upon one of innumerable pigeon feed in courtyard of building flying up to cornice to devour victim at leisure after that crawled for time over museum roof entered dome of reading room by skylight buzzed about inside for little time there be stampede among reader at last found window vanished again with sudden silence from human observation most of other report be of mere passing

there answered voice then did chap get sense of duty of friendship returned to redwood be mr bensington hurt said man inside heard imperfectly one ai to blame if ai said voice inside became clearer to redwood that must have shot bensington forgot cut upon face arose came back to find bensington seated on ground rubbing shoulder bensington looked over glass peppered redwood said then tried to jump over knocked down let have with barrel how have hurt shoulder to be sure man appeared in doorway got once in chest once in side said where be waggon said cossar appearing amidst thicket of gigantic canary creeper leaf became evident to redwood amazement first that one have be shot secondly that trolley waggon have shifted fifty yard be now standing with interlocked wheel amidst tangled distortion of skinner kitchen garden horse have stopped plunging half way towards burst barrel of sulphur lay in path with cloud of sulphur dust above indicated to cossar walked towards have one seen that rat shouted cossar following got in between rib once once in face a turned on be joined by two men a worried at locked wheel killed that rat said one of men have got asked cossar jim bates have found beyond hedge got jest a came round corner whack behind shoulder when thing be little ship shape again redwood went stared at huge misshapen corpse brute lay on side with body slightly bent rodent teeth overhanging receding lower jaw gave face look of colossal feebleness of weak avidity seemed not in least ferocious terrible fore paw reminded of lank emaciated hand except for one neat round hole with scorched rim on side of neck creature be absolutely intact meditated over fact for time there must have be two rat said at last turning away yes one everybody hit got away be certain that own shot canary creeper leaf tendril engaged in mysterious search for holdfast constitutes tendril career bent engagingly towards neck made step aside hastily whoo z z z z z z z z z from distant wasp nest whoo oo zoo oo v incident left party alert not unstrung got store into house have evidently be ransacked by rat after flight of mr skinner four of men took two horse back to hickleybrow dragged dead rat through hedge into position commanded by window of house incidentally came upon cluster of giant earwig in ditch creature dispersed hastily cossar reached out incalculable limb managed to kill several with boot gun butt then two of men hacked through several of main stem of canary creeper huge cylinder be couple of foot in diameter came out by sink at back while cossar set house in order for night bensington redwood one of assistant electrician went cautiously round by fowl run in search of rat hole skirted giant nettle widely for huge weed threatened with poison thorn good inch long then round beyond gnawed dismantled stile came abruptly on huge cavernous throat of most westerly of giant rat hole evil smelling profundity drew up into line together hope will come out said redwood with glance at pent house of well if reflected bensington will said redwood meditated will have to rig up sort of flare if do go in said redwood went up little path of white sand through pine wood halted presently within sight of wasp hole sun be setting now wasp be coming home for good wing in golden light made twirling halo about three men peered out from under tree did not care to go right to edge of wood watched tremendous insect drop crawl for little enter disappear will be still in couple of hour from now said redwood be like being boy again ca miss hole said bensington even if night be dark by bye about light full moon said electrician looked up went back consulted with cossar said that obviously must get sulphur nitre plaster of paris through wood before twilight for broke bulk carried sack after necessary shouting of preliminary direction never word be spoken a buzzing of wasp nest died away there be scarcely sound in world noise of footstep heavy breathing of burthened men thud of sack took turn at labour except mr bensington who be manifestly unfit took post in skinner bedroom with rifle to watch carcase of dead rat of others took turn to rest from sack carrying to keep watch two at time upon rat hole behind nettle grove pollen sac of nettle be ripe now then vigil must be enlivened by dehiscence of bursting of sac sounding exactly like crack of pistol pollen grain a big a buckshot pattered about mr bensington sat at window on hard horse hair stuffed arm chair covered by grubby antimacassar have given touch of social distinction to skinner sitting room for many year unaccustomed rifle rested on sill spectacle anon watched dark bulk of dead rat in thickening twilight anon wandered about in curious meditation there be faint smell of paraffin without for one of cask leaked mingled with le unpleasant odour arising from hacked crushed creeper within when turned head blend of faint domestic scent beer cheese rotten apple old boot a leading motif be full of reminiscence of vanished skinner regarded dim room for space furniture have be greatly disordered perhaps by inquisitive rat coat upon clothes peg on door razor dirty scrap of paper piece of soap have hardened through year of disuse into horny cube be redolent of skinner distinctive personality came to bensington mind with complete novelty of realisation that in probability man have be killed eaten at least in part by monster now lay dead there in darkling to think of that harmless looking discovery in chemistry may lead to here be in homely england yet in infinite danger sitting out alone with gun in twilit ruined house remote from comfort shoulder dreadfully bruised from gun kick by jove grasped now how profoundly order of universe have changed for have come right away to amazing experience without even saying word to cousin jane what must be thinking of tried to imagine must not have extraordinary feeling that be parted for ever must never meet again felt have taken step come into world of new immensity what other monster might not deepening shadow hide tip of giant nettle came out sharp black against pale green amber of western sky everything be very still very still indeed wondered why must not hear others away there round corner of house shadow in cart shed be now abysmal black bang bang bang sequence of echo shout long silence bang diminuendo of echo stillness then thank goodness redwood cossar be coming out of inaudible darkness redwood be calling bensington bensington have bagged of rat cossar bagged of rat vi when expedition have finished refreshment night have fully come star be at brightest growing pallor towards hankey heralded moon watch on rat hole have be maintained watcher have shifted to hill slope above hole feeling safer firing point squatted there in rather abundant dew fighting damp with others rested in house three leader discussed night work with men moon rose towards midnight a soon a be clear of down one except rat hole sentinel started off in single file led by cossar towards wasp nest so far a wasp nest went found task exceptionally easy astonishingly easy except that be longer labour be graver affair than common wasp nest might have be danger there be doubt danger to life never so much a thrust head out of portentous hillside stuffed in sulphur nitre bunged hole soundly fired train then with common impulse party cossar turned ran athwart long shadow of pine finding cossar have stayed behind came to halt together in knot hundred yard away convenient to ditch offered cover just for minute two moonlit night black white be heavy with suffocated buzz rose mingled to roar deep abundant note culminated died then almost incredibly night be still by jove said bensington almost in whisper be done stood intent hillside above black point lace of pine shadow seemed a bright a day a colourless a snow setting plaster in hole positively shone cossar loose framework moved towards so far said cossar crack bang shot from near house then stillness what be said bensington one of rat put head out suggested one of men by bye left gun up there said redwood by sack one began to walk towards hill again must be rat said bensington obviously said cossar gnawing finger nail bang hullo said one of men then abruptly came shout two shot loud shout be almost scream three shot in rapid succession splintering of wood sound be very clear very small in immense stillness of night then for moment nothing minute muffled confusion from direction of rat hole then again wild yell man found running hard for gun two shot bensington found gun in hand going hard through pine tree after number of receding back be curious that thought uppermost in mind at moment be wish that cousin jane must see bulbous slashed boot flew out in wild stride face be distorted into permanent grin because wrinkled nose kept glass in place also held muzzle of gun projecting straight before a flew through chequered moonlight man who have run away met full tilt have dropped gun hullo said cossar caught in arm what be came out together said man rat yes six of where be flack down what be say panted bensington coming up unheeded flack down fell down came out one after other what made rush fired barrel first left flack be on to come on said cossar come with where be flack show whole party moved forward further detail of engagement dropped from man who have run away others clustered about except cossar who led where be back in hole perhaps cleared made rush for hole what do mean did get behind got down by hole saw come out know tried to cut off lolloped out like rabbit ran down let fly ran about wild after first shot suddenly came at went for how many six seven cossar led way to edge of pine wood halted d'yer mean got flack asked one one of 'em be on to did shoot how must one loaded said cossar over shoulder there be confirmatory movement flack said one d'yer mean flack said there be time to lose said cossar shouted flack a led way whole force advanced towards rat hole man who have run away little to rear went forward through rank exaggerated weed skirted body of second dead rat be extended in bunchy line man with gun pointing forward peered about in clear moonlight for crumpled ominous shape crouching form found gun of man who have run away very speedily flack cried cossar flack ran past nettle fell down volunteered man who ran away where round about there where did fall hesitated led athwart long black shadow for space turned judicially about here think well be not here now gun confound swore cossar where be everything got to strode step towards black shadow on hillside masked hole stood staring then swore again if have dragged in so hung for space tossing other fragment of thought bensington glass flashed like diamond a looked from one to other men face changed from cold clearness to mysterious obscurity a turned to from moon one spoke one completed sentence then abruptly cossar chose line flapped limb way expelled order in pellet be obvious wanted one except cossar be moving towards house be going into hole asked redwood obviously said cossar made clear once more that lamp of cart trolley be to be got brought to bensington grasping started off along path by well glanced over shoulder saw cossar gigantic figure standing out a if be regarding hole pensively at sight bensington halted for moment half turned be leaving cossar cossar be able to take care of of course suddenly bensington saw something that made shout windless hi in second three rat have projected from dark tangle of creeper towards cossar for three second cossar stood unaware of then have become most active thing in world did fire gun apparently have time to aim to think of aiming ducked leaping rat bensington saw then smashed at back of head with butt of gun monster gave one leap fell over cossar form went right down out of sight among reedy grass then rose again running towards of rat whirling gun overhead faint shout came to bensington ear then perceived remaining two rat bolting divergently cossar in pursuit towards hole whole thing be affair of misty shadow three fighting monster be exaggerated made unreal by delusive clearness of light at moment cossar be colossal at moment invisible rat flashed athwart eye in sudden unexpected leap ran with movement of foot so swift seemed to run on wheel be over in minute one saw bensington must hear others behind still receding towards house shouted something inarticulate then ran back towards cossar while rat vanished came up to outside hole in moonlight distribution of shadow constituted cossar visage intimated calm hullo said cossar back already where be lamp be back now in hole one broke neck of a ran past see there pointed gaunt finger bensington be too astonished for conversation lamp seemed interminable time in coming at last appeared first one unwinking luminous eye preceded by swaying yellow glare then winking now then then shining out again two others about came little figure with little voice then enormous shadow group made a be spot of inflammation upon gigantic dreamland of moonshine flack said voice flack illuminating sentence floated up locked in attic cossar be continually more wonderful produced great handful of cotton wool stuffed in ear bensington wondered why then loaded gun with quarter charge of powder who else must have thought of wonderland culminated with disappearance of cossar twin realm of boot sole up central hole cossar be on four with two gun one trailing on side from string under chin most trusted assistant little dark man with grave face be to go in stooping behind holding lantern over head everything have be made a sane obvious proper a lunatic dream wool seems be on account of concussion of rifle man have too obviously so long a rat turned tail on cossar harm must come to directly headed for must see eye fire between since must have to come down cylinder of hole cossar must hardly fail to hit be cossar insisted obvious method little tedious perhaps absolutely certain a assistant stooped to enter bensington saw that end of ball of twine have be tied to tail of coat by be to draw in rope if must be needed to drag out body of rat bensington perceived that object held in hand be cossar silk hat how have got there must be something to remember by anyhow at of adjacent hole stood little group with lantern on ground shining up hole with one man kneeling aiming at round void before waiting for anything might emerge there be interminable suspense then heard cossar first shot like explosion in mine one nerve muscle tightened at bang bang bang rat have tried bolt two more be dead then man who held ball of twine reported twitching be killed one in there said bensington want rope watched rope creep into hole seemed a though have become animated by serpentine intelligence for darkness made twine invisible at last stopped crawling there be long pause then what seemed to bensington queerest monster of crept slowly from hole resolved into little engineer emerging backwards after ploughing deep furrow cossar boot thrust out then came lantern illuminated back only one rat be left alive now poor doomed wretch cowered in inmost recess until cossar lantern went in again slew finally cossar that human ferret went through run to make sure got said to nearly awe stricken company at last if have be mud headed mucker must have stripped to waist obviously feel sleeve bensington be wet through with perspiration jolly hard to think of everything only halfway up of whisky can save from cold vii there be moment during wonderful night when seemed to bensington that be planned by nature for life of fantastic adventure be particularly case for hour so after have taken stiff whisky sha go back to sloane street confided to tall fair dirty engineer wo eh fear said bensington nodding darkly exertion of dragging seven dead rat to funeral pyre by nettle grove left bathed in perspiration cossar pointed out obvious physical reaction of whisky to save from otherwise inevitable chill there be sort of brigand supper in old bricked kitchen with row of dead rat lying in moonlight against hen run outside after thirty minute so of rest cossar roused to labour be still to do obviously a said have to wipe place out litter scandal see stirred up to idea of making destruction complete smashed splintered fragment of wood in house built trail of chopped wood wherever big vegetation be springing made pyre for rat body soaked in paraffin bensington worked like conscientious navvy have sort of climax of exhilaration energy towards two o'clock when in work of destruction wielded axe bravest fled neighbourhood afterwards be little sobered by temporary loss of spectacle be found for at last in side coat pocket men went to fro about grimy energetic men cossar moved amongst like god bensington drank delight of human fellowship come to happy army to sturdy expedition never to who live life of sober citizen in city after cossar have taken axe away set to carry wood went to fro saying be good fellow kept on long after be aware of fatigue at last be ready broaching of paraffin began moon robbed now of meagre night retinue of star shone high above dawn burn everything said cossar going to fro burn ground make clean sweep of see bensington became aware of looking now very gaunt horrible in pale beginning of daylight hurrying past with lower jaw projected flaring torch of touchwood in hand come away said one pulling bensington arm still dawn bird be singing there be suddenly full of tumultuous crackling little dull red flame ran about base of pyre changed to blue upon ground set out to clamber leaf by leaf up stem of giant nettle singing sound mingled with crackling snatched gun from corner of skinner living room then one be running cossar came after with heavy stride then be standing looking back at experimental farm be boiling up smoke flame poured out like crowd in panic from door window from thousand crack crevice in roof trust cossar to build fire great column of smoke shot with blood red tongue darting flash rushed up into sky be like huge giant suddenly standing up straining upward abruptly spreading great arm out across sky cast night back upon utterly hiding obliterating incandescence of sun rose behind hickleybrow be soon aware of stupendous pillar of smoke came out upon crest in various deshabille to watch coming behind like fantastic fungus smoke pillar swayed fluctuated up up into sky making down seem low other object petty in foreground led by cossar maker of mischief followed path eight little black figure coming wearily gun shouldered across meadow a bensington looked back there came into jaded brain echoed there familiar formula what be have lit to day have lit to day then remembered latimer word have lit day candle in england a man may ever put out again what man cossar be to be sure admired back view for space be proud to have held that hat proud although be eminent investigator cossar only engaged in applied science suddenly fell shivering yawning enormously wishing be warmly tucked away in bed in little flat that looked out upon sloane street did do even to think of cousin jane leg became cotton strand foot lead wondered if one must get coffee in hickleybrow have never be up night for three thirty year viii while eight adventurer fought with rat about experimental farm nine mile away in village of cheasing eyebright old lady with excessive nose struggled with great difficulty by light of flickering candle gripped sardine tin opener in one gnarled hand in other held tin of herakleophorbia have resolved to open die struggled indefatigably grunting at fresh effort while through flimsy partition voice of caddles infant wailed bless poor said mr skinner then with solitary tooth biting lip in ecstasy of determination come up presently jab fresh supply of food of god be let loose to wreak power of giantry upon world chapter fourth giant child for time at least spreading circle of residual consequence about experimental farm must pas out of focus of narrative how for long time power of bigness in fungus toadstool in grass weed radiated from charred not absolutely obliterated centre can tell here at length how mournful spinster two surviving hen made wonder of show spent remaining year in eggless celebrity reader who be hungry for fuller detail in matter be referred to newspaper of period to voluminous indiscriminate file of modern recording angel business lie with mr bensington at focus of disturbance have come back to london to find quite terribly famous man in night whole world have changed with respect to everybody understood cousin jane seemed knew about people in street knew about newspaper more to meet cousin jane be terrible of course when be over not so terrible after good woman have limit even to power over fact be clear that have communed with accepted food a something in nature of thing took line of huffy dutifulness disapproved highly be evident did not prohibit flight of bensington a must have considered may have shaken worst be to treat with bitter persistence for cold have not caught fatigue have long since forgotten to buy new sort of hygienic wool combination underwear be apt to get involved turned partially inside out partially not a difficult to get into for absent minded man a society so for space a far a convenience left leisure still continued to participate in development of new element in human history food of god public mind following own mysterious law of selection have chosen a one only responsible inventor promoter of new wonder must hear nothing of redwood without protest allowed cossar to follow natural impulse into terribly prolific obscurity before be aware of drift of thing mr bensington be so to speak stark dissected upon hoarding baldness curious general pinkness golden spectacle have become national possession resolute young men with large expensive looking camera general air of complete authorisation took possession of flat for brief fruitful period let off flash light in filled for day with dense intolerable vapour retired to fill page of syndicated magazine with admirable photograph of mr bensington complete at home in second best jacket slashed shoe other resolute mannered person of various age sex dropped in told thing about boomfood be punch first called stuff boomfood afterwards reproduced what have said a own original contribution to interview thing became quite obsession with broadbeam popular humourist scented confounded thing must not understand fretted dreadfully in effort to laugh thing down one saw in club great clumsy presence with evidence of midnight oil burning manifest upon large unwholesome face explaining to one must buttonhole scientific chap know have sense of humour know be what be science kill jest at bensington became malignant libel enterprising press cutting agency sent bensington long article about from sixpenny weekly entitled new terror offered to supply one hundred such disturbance for guinea two extremely charming young lady totally unknown to called to speechless indignation of cousin jane have tea with afterwards sent birthday book for signature be speedily quite hardened to seeing name associated with most incongruous idea in public press to discover in review article written about boomfood in tone of utmost intimacy by people have never heard of delusion may have cherished in day of obscurity about pleasantness of fame be dispelled utterly for ever at first except for broadbeam tone of public mind be quite free from touch of hostility did not seem to occur to public mind a anything mere playful supposition that more herakleophorbia be going to escape again did not seem to occur to public mind that growing little band of baby now being fed on food must presently be growing more up than most of ever grow sort of thing pleased public mind be caricature of eminent politician after course of boom feeding us of idea on hoarding such edifying exhibition a dead wasp have escaped fire remaining hen beyond that public did not care to look until very strenuous effort be made to turn eye to remoter consequence even then for while enthusiasm for action be partial there be always somethin ' new said public public so glutted with novelty that must hear of earth being split a one split apple without surprise wonder what will do next there be one two people outside public a be who did already take that further glance seems be frightened by what saw there there be young caterham for example cousin of earl of pewterstone one of most promising of english politician who taking risk of being thought faddist wrote long article in nineteenth century after to suggest total suppression in certain of mood there be bensington seem to realise said to cossar do sometimes when think of what mean poor child of redwood of course three forty foot high perhaps after ought to go on with go on with cried cossar convulsed with inelegant astonishment pitching note higher than ever of course will go on with d'you think be made for just to loaf about between meal time serious consequence screamed of course enormous obviously ob viously why man be only chance will ever get of serious consequence want to shirk for moment indignation be speechless be downright wicked said at last repeated explosively wicked bensington worked in laboratory now with more emotion than zest must tell whether wanted serious consequence to life not be man of quiet taste be marvellous discovery of course quite marvellous have already become proprietor of several acre of scorched discredited property near hickleybrow at price of nearly acre at time be disposed to think a serious consequence of speculative chemistry a unambitious man must wish of course be famous terribly famous more than satisfying altogether more than satisfying be fame have attained habit of research be strong in at moment rare moment in laboratory chiefly must find something else than habit cossar argument to urge to work little spectacled man poised perhaps with slashed shoe wrapped about leg of high stool hand upon tweezer of balance weight must have again flash of adolescent vision must have momentary perception of eternal unfolding of seed have be sown in brain must see a be in sky behind grotesque shape accident of present coming world of giant mighty thing future have in store vague splendid like glittering palace seen suddenly in passing of sunbeam far away presently must be with a though distant splendour have never shone upon brain must perceive nothing ahead sinister shadow vast declivity darkness inhospitable immensity cold wild terrible thing ii amidst complex confused happening impact from great outer world constituted mr bensington fame shining active figure presently became conspicuous became almost a be leader marshal of externality in mr bensington eye be dr winkle that convincing young practitioner who have already appeared in story a mean whereby redwood be able to convey food to son even before great outbreak be evident that mysterious powder redwood have given have awakened gentleman interest immensely so soon a first wasp came be putting two two together be sort of doctor be in manner in moral in method appearance most succinctly finally expressed by word rising be large fair with hard alert superficial aluminium coloured eye hair like chalk mud even featured muscular about clean shaven mouth erect in figure energetic in movement quick spinning on heel wore long frock coat black silk tie plain gold stud chain silk hat have special shape brim made look wiser better than anybody looked a young old a anybody grown up after first wonderful outbreak took to bensington redwood food of god with convincing air of proprietorship at time in spite of testimony of press to contrary bensington be disposed to regard a original inventor of whole affair accident said winkle when bensington hinted at danger of further escape be nothing nothing discovery be everything properly developed suitably handled sanely controlled have have something very portentous indeed in food of ours must keep eye on must let out of control again must let rest certainly did not mean to do that be at bensington now almost day bensington glancing from window must see faultless equipage come spanking up sloane street after incredibly brief interval winkle must enter room with light strong motion pervade protrude newspaper supply information make remark well must say rubbing hand how be getting on so pas to current discussion about do see must say for example caterham have be talking about stuff at church association dear said bensington be cousin of prime minister be yes said winkle very able young man very able quite wrong headed know violently reactionary thoroughly able be evidently disposed to make capital out of stuff of ours take very emphatic line talk of proposal to use in elementary school proposal to use in elementary school said something about that other day quite in passing little affair at polytechnic trying to make clear stuff be really highly beneficial not in slightest degree dangerous in spite of first little accident can not possibly occur again know must be rather good stuff be taken up what did say mere obvious nothing a see take up with perfect gravity treat thing a attack say there be already sufficient waste of public money in elementary school without tell old story about piano lesson again know one say wish to prevent child of lower class obtaining education suited to condition to give food of sort will be to destroy sense of proportion utterly expands topic what good will do asks to make poor people six thirty foot high really belief know that will be thirty six foot high so must be said bensington if gave food at regularly nobody said anything said something dear winkle will be bigger of course interrupted winkle with air of knowing about discouraging crude idea of bensington bigger indisputably listen to what say will make happier be point curious be will make better will be more respectful to properly constituted authority be fair to child curious how anxious sort be for justice so far a future arrangement go even nowadays say cost of feeding clothing child be more than many of parent can contrive if sort of thing be to be permitted eh see make mere passing suggestion into positive proposal then calculates how much pair of breech for growing lad of twenty foot high so will cost just a though really believed ten pound reckons for merest decency curious caterham so concrete honest struggling ratepayer will have to contribute to that say say have to consider right of parent be here two column parent have right to have child brought up in own size then come question of school accommodation cost of enlarged desk form for already too greatly burthened national school to get what proletariat of hungry giant wind up with very serious passage say even if wild suggestion mere passing fancy of mine know misinterpreted at wild suggestion about school come to nothing doe end matter be strange food so strange a to seem to almost wicked have be scattered recklessly so say may be scattered again once have taken be poison unless go on with beo be ' said bensington in short proposes formation of national society for preservation of proper proportion of thing odd eh people be hanging on to idea like anything what do propose to do winkle shrugged shoulder threw out hand form society said fuss want to make illegal to manufacture herakleophorbia at rate to circulate knowledge of have written about bit to show that caterham idea of stuff be very much exaggerated very much exaggerated indeed doe seem to check curious how people be turning against national temperance association by bye have founded branch for temperance in growth mm said bensington stroked nose after have happened there be bound to be uproar on face of thing startling winkle walked about room for time hesitated departed became evident there be something at back of mind aspect of crucial importance to that waited to display one day when redwood bensington be at flat together gave glimpse of something in reserve how be going said rubbing hand together be getting together sort of report for royal society yes hm said winkle very profoundly walked to hearth rug hm here be point ought ought what ought to publish be not in middle age said redwood know a cossar say swapping wisdom be true scientific method in most case certainly be exceptional will put whole thing before royal society in proper way said redwood winkle returned to on later occasion be in many way exceptional discovery doe matter said redwood be sort of knowledge must easily be subject to grave abuse grave danger a caterham put redwood said nothing even carelessness know if be to form committee of trustworthy people to control manufacture of boomfood herakleophorbia must say might paused redwood with certain private discomfort pretended that did not see sort of interrogation outside apartment of redwood bensington winkle in spite of incompleteness of instruction became leading authority upon boomfood wrote letter defending use made note article explaining possibility jumped up irrelevantly at meeting of scientific medical association to talk about identified with published pamphlet called truth about boomfood in minimised whole of hickleybrow affair almost to nothing said that be absurd to say boomfood must make people thirty seven foot high be obviously exaggerated must make bigger of course be within intimate circle of two be chiefly evident that winkle be extremely anxious to help in making of herakleophorbia help in correcting proof there might be of paper there might be in preparation upon subject do anything indeed might lead up to participation in detail of making of herakleophorbia be continually telling that felt be big thing that have big possibility if only be safeguarded in way at last one day asked outright to be told just how be made have be thinking over what said said redwood well said winkle brightly be sort of knowledge must easily be subject to grave abuse said redwood see how applies said winkle doe said redwood winkle thought over for day so then came to redwood said that doubted if ought to give powder about knew nothing to redwood little boy seemed to be uncommonly like taking responsibility in dark made redwood thoughtful have seen that society for total suppression of boomfood claim to have several thousand member said winkle changing subject have drafted bill said winkle have got young caterham to take up readily enough be in earnest be forming local committee to influence candidate want to make penal to prepare store herakleophorbia without special license felony matter of imprisonment without option to administer boomfood be what call know to person under one twenty there be collateral society know sort of people society for preservation of ancient stature be going to have mr frederic harrison on council say know be written essay about say be vulgar entirely inharmonious with revelation of humanity be found in teaching of comte be sort of thing eighteenth century must have produced even in worst moment idea of food never entered head of comte show how wicked really be one say who really understood comte mean to say said redwood alarmed out of disdain for winkle will not do said winkle public opinion be public opinion vote be vote everybody can see be up to disturbing thing human instinct be against disturbance know nobody seems to believe caterham idea of people thirty seven foot high who wo be able to get inside church meeting house social human institution for that be not so easy in mind about see there be something something more than common discovery there be said redwood in discovery anyhow be getting restive caterham keep harping on may happen if get loose again say over over again wo ca there be bounced about room for little while a if meant to reopen topic of secret then thought better of went two scientific men looked at one for space only eye spoke if worst come to worst said redwood at last in strenuously calm voice will give food to little teddy with own hand iii be only few day after redwood opened paper to find that prime minister have promised royal commission on boomfood sent newspaper in hand round to bensington flat winkle believe be making mischief for stuff play into hand of caterham keep on talking about what be going to do alarming people if go on really believe will hamper inquiry even a be with trouble about little boy bensington wished winkle must do notice how have dropped into way of calling boomfood like name said bensington with glance over glass be just so exactly what be to winkle why doe keep on about be be something called booming said redwood understand if be everybody be getting to think be not that matter in event of ignorant ridiculous agitation becoming serious began bensington little boy ca get on without stuff said redwood see how can help now if worst come to worst slight bouncing noise proclaimed presence of winkle became visible in middle of room rubbing hand together wish 'd knock said bensington looking vicious over gold rim winkle be apologetic then turned to redwood be glad to find here began fact be have seen about royal commission interrupted redwood yes said winkle thrown out yes what do think of excellent thing said winkle bound to stop most of clamour ventilate whole affair shut up caterham be not what came round for redwood fact be like royal commission said bensington can assure will be right may say think be breach of confidence very possibly may have place on commission oom said redwood looking into fire can put whole thing right can make perfectly clear first that stuff be controllable secondly that nothing short of miracle be needed before anything like catastrophe at hickleybrow can possibly happen again be just what be wanted authoritative assurance of course must speak with more confidence if knew be quite by way just at present there be something else little matter upon be wanting to consult ahem fact be well happen to be in slight difficulty can help out redwood raised eyebrow be secretly glad matter be highly confidential go on said redwood worry about have recently be entrusted with child child of of exalted personage winkle coughed be getting on said redwood must confess be largely powder reputation of success with little boy there be can not disguise strong feeling against use yet find that among more intelligent one must go quietly in thing know little by little still in case of serene high mean new little patient of mine a matter of fact suggestion came from parent must never struck redwood a being embarrassed thought have doubt of advisability of using powder said redwood merely passing doubt propose to discontinue in case of little boy certainly not so far a can see must be murder must do for world will have powder said redwood suppose must fear said redwood there be recipe be good winkle if will pardon frankness will make powder just a well perhaps said winkle after momentary hard stare at redwood just a well then can assure really mind in least iv when winkle have gone bensington came stood on hearth rug looked down at redwood serene highness remarked serene highness said redwood be princess of weser dreiburg further than third cousin redwood said bensington be curious thing to say know do think winkle understands what just what be have made doe really understand said bensington dropping voice keeping eye doorward in family family of new patient go on said redwood who have always be if anything little under under average yes so very tactfully undistinguished in way be going to produce royal personage outsize royal personage of size know redwood be not sure whether there be not something almost treasonable transferred eye from door to redwood redwood flung momentary gesture index finger erect at fire by jove said doe know man said redwood doe know anything be most exasperating quality a student nothing passed examination have fact have just a much knowledge a rotating bookshelf containing time encyclopedia doe know anything now be winkle incapable of really assimilating anything not immediately directly related to superficial self be utterly void of imagination a consequence incapable of knowledge one must possibly pas so many examination be so well dressed so well done so successful a doctor without precise incapacity be in spite of be seen heard be told there be have idea whatever of what have set going have got boom on be working well on boomfood one have let in to new royal baby be boomier than ever fact that weser dreiburg will presently have to face gigantic problem of thirty odd foot princess not only have entered head must must there will be fearful row said bensington in year so so soon a really see be going on growing unless after fashion hush up be lot to hush up rather wonder what will do never do anything royal tact be bound to do something perhaps will o lord yes will suppress such thing have be known redwood burst into desperate laughter

be all right dear said be all right be only little overwrought be that cheap perambulator have arranged for bath chair man to come round with something stouter to morrow mr redwood looked at tearfully over top of handkerchief baby in bath chair sobbed well why not be like cripple be like young giant dear have cause to be ashamed of have done something to dandy said can see in face well have stopped growth anyhow said redwood heartlessly knew said mr redwood clenched pocket handkerchief fashion in one hand looked at with sudden change to severity what have done to child dandy what be wrong with

baby bus driver used to say look 'ealthy forward passenger must remark bottle fed bus driver must explain say 'olds gallon 'ad to be specially made for 'im very 'ealthy child any'ow forward passenger must conclude when mr redwood realized that growth be indeed going on indefinitely logically really did for first time when motor perambulator arrived gave way to passion of grief declared never wished to enter nursery again wished be dead wished child be dead wished everybody be dead wished have never married redwood wished one ever married anybody ajaxed little retired to own room where

base job being man with woman a be vi before year be out there be in addition to redwood pioneer vehicle quite number of motor perambulator to be seen in west of london be told there be a many a eleven most careful inquiry yield trustworthy evidence of only six within metropolitan area at time must seem stuff acted differently upon different type of constitution at first herakleophorbia be not adapted to injection there can be doubt that considerable proportion of human being be incapable of absorbing substance in normal course of digestion be given for example to winkle youngest boy seems to have be a incapable of growth a if redwood be right father be incapable of knowledge others again according to society for total suppression of boomfood became in inexplicable way corrupted by perished at onset of infantile disorder cossar boy took to with amazing avidity of course thing of kind never come with absolute simplicity of application into life of man growth in particular be complex thing generalisation must need be little inaccurate general law of food must seem to be when must be taken into system in way stimulated in very nearly same degree in case increased amount of growth from six to seven time did not go beyond amount of food in excess be taken excess of herakleophorbia indeed beyond necessary minimum led be found to morbid disturbance of nutrition to cancer tumour ossification like once growth upon large scale have begun be soon evident that must only continue upon scale that continuous administration of herakleophorbia in small sufficient dos be imperative if be discontinued while growth be still going on there be first vague restlessness distress then period of voracity a in case of young rat at hankey then growing creature have sort of exaggerated anaemia sickened died plant suffered in similar way however applied only to growth period so soon a adolescence be attained in plant be represented by formation of first flower bud need

enforce simple line of construction clean colour must have said redwood in one place have neat horizontal band of square in crimson purple orange lemon blue green in many hue many shade did honour square giant child must arrange rearrange to pleasure decoration must follow said redwood let first get range of tint then may go away there be reason why one must bias in favour of particular colour design then place must be full of interest said redwood interest be food for child blankness torture starvation must have picture galore there be picture hung about room for permanent service however blank frame be provided into new picture must come pas thence into portfolio so soon a fresh interest have passed there be one window looked down length of street in addition for added interest

sort of incredulity came to redwood a stood among thing if really be going on said redwood staring up at remote ceiling from far away came sound like bellowing of mafficking bull almost a if in answer be going on right said redwood evidently there followed resounding blow upon table followed by vast crowing shout gooloo boozoo bzz best thing can do said redwood following out divergent line of thought be to teach that beating became more insistent for moment seemed to redwood that caught rhythm of engine throbbing engine must have imagined of great train of event bore down upon then descendant flight of sharper beat broke up that effect be repeated come in cried perceiving that one rapped door be big enough for cathedral opened slowly little way new winch ceased to creak bensington appeared in crack gleaming benevolently under protruded baldness over glass have ventured round to see whispered in confidentially furtive manner come in said redwood did shutting door behind walked forward hand behind back advanced few step peered up with bird like movement at dimension about rubbed chin thoughtfully time come in said with subdued note in voice strike a 'big yes said redwood surveying again also a if in endeavour to keep hold of visible impression yes be going to be big too know know said bensington with note be nearly awe very big looked at one almost a be apprehensively very big indeed said bensington stroking bridge of nose with one eye watched redwood doubtfully for confirmatory expression of know fearfully big seem able to imagine even with just how big be going to be chapter fifth minimificence of mr bensington be while royal commission on boomfood be preparing report that herakleophorbia really began to demonstrate capacity for leakage earliness of second outbreak be more unfortunate from point of view of cossar at rate since draft report still in existence show that commission have under tutelage of most able member doctor stephen winkle fr md frcp d sc jp dl etc already quite made up mind that accidental leakage be impossible be prepared to recommend to entrust preparation of boomfood to qualified committee winkle chiefly with entire control over sale be quite enough to satisfy reasonable objection to free diffusion committee be to have absolute monopoly be doubt to be considered a part of irony of life that first most alarming of second series of leakage occurred within fifty yard of little cottage at keston occupied during summer month by doctor winkle there can be little doubt now that redwood refusal to acquaint winkle with composition of herakleophorbia iv have aroused in gentleman novel intense desire towards analytical chemistry be not very expert manipulator for reason probably saw fit to do work not in excellently equipped laboratory be at disposal in london without consulting one almost with air of secrecy in rough little garden laboratory at keston establishment doe not seem to have shown very great energy very great ability in quest indeed one gather dropped inquiry after working at intermittently for about month garden laboratory in work be done be very roughly equipped supplied by standpipe tap with water draining into pipe ran down into swampy rush bordered pool under alder tree in secluded corner of common just outside garden hedge pipe be cracked residuum of food of god escaped through crack into little puddle amidst clump of rush just in time for spring awakening everything be astir with life in scummy little corner there be frog spawn adrift tremulous with tadpole just bursting gelatinous envelope there be little pond snail creeping out into life under green skin of rush stem larva of big water beetle be struggling out of egg case doubt if reader know larva of

only thing have chance with monster to get share of food be rush slimy green scum in water seedling weed in mud at bottom clean up of study presently washed fresh spate of food into puddle overflowed carried sinister expansion of struggle for life into adjacent pool under root of alder first person to discover what be going on be mr lukey carrington special science teacher under london education board in leisure specialist in fresh water algae be certainly not to be envied discovery have come down to keston common for day to fill number of specimen tube for subsequent examination came with dozen so of corked tube clanking faintly in pocket over sandy crest down towards pool spiked walking stick in hand garden lad standing on top of kitchen step clipping doctor winkle hedge saw in unfrequented corner found occupation sufficiently inexplicable interesting to watch pretty closely saw mr carrington stoop down by side of pool with hand against old alder stem peer into water of course must not appreciate surprise pleasure with mr carrington beheld big unfamiliar looking blob thread of algal scum at bottom there be tadpole visible have be killed by time must seem mr carrington saw nothing at unusual except excessive vegetation bared arm to elbow leant forward dipped deep in pursuit of specimen seeking hand went down instantly there flashed out of cool shadow under tree root something flash have buried fang deep into arm bizarre shape be foot long more brown jointed like scorpion ugly apparition sharp amazing painfulness of bite be too much for mr carrington equilibrium felt going yelled aloud over toppled face foremost splash into pool boy saw vanish heard splashing of struggle in water unfortunate man emerged again into boy field of vision hatless streaming with water screaming never before have boy heard scream from man astonishing stranger appeared to be tearing at something on side of face there appeared streak of blood there flung out arm a if in despair leapt in air like frantic creature ran violently ten twelve yard then fell rolled on ground over out of sight of boy lad be down step through hedge in trice happily with garden shear still in hand a came crashing through gorse bush say be half minded to turn back fearing have to deal with lunatic possession of shear reassured must 'ave jabbed eye explained anyhow directly mr carrington caught sight of demeanour became at once that of sane desperate man struggled to foot stumbled stood up came to meet boy look cried ca get 'em off with qualm of horror boy saw that attached

carrington effort to detach monster from face have only served to lacerate flesh to have attached streak face neck coat with living scarlet will cut 'im cried boy on sir with zest of age in such proceeding severed one by one head from body of mr carrington assailant said boy with wincing face a one fell before even then so tough determined be grip that severed head remained for space still fiercely biting home still sucking with blood streaming out of neck behind boy stopped that with few more slash of scissors in one of mr carrington be implicated must get 'em off repeated carrington stood for space swaying bleeding profusely dabbed feeble hand at injury examined result upon palm then gave way at knee fell headlong in dead faint at boy foot between still leaping body of defeated foe very luckily did occur to boy to splash water on face for there be still more of horror under alder root instead passed back by pond went into garden with intention of calling assistance there met gardener coachman told of whole affair when got back to mr carrington be sitting up dazed weak able to warn against danger in pool ii such be circumstance by world have first notification that food be loose again in week keston common be in full operation a what naturalist call centre of distribution time there be wasp rat earwig nettle there be at least three water spider several dragon fly larva presently became dragon fly dazzling kent with hovering sapphire body nasty gelatinous scummy growth swelled over pond margin sent slimy green mass surging halfway up garden path to doctor winkle house there began growth of rush equisetum potamogeton ended only with drying of pond speedily became evident to public mind that time there be not simply one centre of distribution number of centre there be one at ealing there can be doubt now from came plague of fly red spider there be one at sunbury productive of ferocious great eel must come ashore kill sheep there be one in bloomsbury gave world new strain of cockroach of quite terrible sort old house be in bloomsbury much inhabited by undesirable thing abruptly world found confronted with hickleybrow experience over again with sort of queer exaggeration of familiar monster in place of giant hen rat wasp centre burst out with own characteristic local fauna flora know now that one of centre corresponded to one of patient of doctor winkle be by mean apparent at time doctor be last person to incur odium in matter there be panic quite naturally passionate indignation be indignation not against doctor winkle against food not so much against food a against unfortunate bensington whom from very first popular imagination have insisted upon regarding a sole only person responsible for new thing attempt to lynch followed be just one of explosive event bulk largely in history be in reality least significant of occurrence history of outbreak be mystery nucleus of crowd certainly came from anti boomfood meeting in hyde park organised by extremist of caterham party there seems one in world who actually first proposed one who ever first hinted suggestion of outrage at so many people assisted be problem for m gustave le bon mystery in psychology of crowd fact emerges that about three o'clock on sunday afternoon remarkably big ugly london crowd entirely out of hand came rolling down thursday street intent on bensington exemplary death a warning to scientific investigator that came nearer accomplishing object than london crowd have ever come since hyde park railing came down in remote middle victorian time crowd came so close to object indeed that for space of hour more word must have settled unfortunate gentleman fate first intimation have of thing be noise of people outside went to window peered realising nothing of what impended for minute perhaps watched seething about entrance disposing of ineffectual dozen of policeman who barred way before fully realised own importance in affair came upon in flash that roaring swaying multitude be after be alone in flat fortunately perhaps cousin jane having gone down to ealing to have tea with relation on mother side have more idea of how to behave under such circumstance than have of etiquette of day of judgment be still dashing about flat asking furniture what must do turning key in lock then unlocking again making dart at door window bedroom when floor clerk came to there be moment sir said have got number from board in hall be coming straight up ran mr bensington out into passage already echoing with approaching tumult from great staircase locked door behind led way into opposite flat by mean of duplicate key be only chance now said flung up window opened on ventilating shaft showed that wall be set with iron staple made rudest most perilous of wall ladder to serve a fire escape from upper flat shoved mr bensington out of window showed how to cling on pursued up ladder goading jabbing leg with bunch of key whenever desisted from climbing seemed to bensington at time that must climb vertical ladder for evermore above parapet be inaccessibly remote mile perhaps below did not care to think of thing below steady on cried clerk gripped ankle be quite horrible having ankle gripped like mr bensington tightened hold on iron staple above to drowning clutch gave faint squeal of terror became evident clerk have broken window then seemed have vast distance sideways there came noise of window frame sliding in sash be bawling thing mr bensington moved head round cautiously until must see clerk come down six step clerk commanded moving about seemed very foolish very very cautiously mr bensington lowered foot pull cried a clerk made to help from open window seemed to that to reach window from ladder must be very respectable feat for flying fox be rather with idea of decent suicide than in hope of accomplishing that made step at last quite ruthlessly clerk pulled in will have to stop here said clerk key be good here be american lock will get out slam door behind see if can find man of floor will be locked in go to window be be ugliest crowd have ever seen if only think be out will probably content by breaking up stuff indicator said in said bensington devil did well anyhow 'd better not be found vanished with slam of door bensington be left to own initiative again took under bed there presently be found by cossar bensington be almost comatose with terror when be found for cossar have burst door in with shoulder by jumping at across breadth of passage come out of bensington said be right be have got to get out of be setting place on fire porter be clearing out servant be gone be lucky caught man who knew look here bensington peering from under bed became aware of unaccountable garment on cossar arm of thing

little of march of event outside be quiet street at time day be unusually quiet scarcely cab scarcely tradesman cart passed that morning now then men went by without distinctive air of event now then little group of child nursemaid woman going shopping so forth came on to stage right left up down street with exasperating suggestion of indifference to concern more spacious than own must discover police guarded house with amazement exit in opposite direction where great truss of giant hydrangea hung across pavement staring back pointing now then man must come ask one of policeman question get curt reply opposite house seemed dead housemaid appeared once at bedroom window stared for space occurred to redwood to signal to for time watched gesture a if with interest made vague response to

event interminable momentous morning lengthened out about twelve there came bawling of newsvendor from adjacent road passed contrary to wont left redwood street alone suspicion dawned upon that police be guarding end of street tried to open window brought policeman into room forthwith clock of parish church struck twelve after abyss of time one mocked with lunch ate mouthful tumbled food about little in order to get taken away drank freely of whisky then took chair went back to window minute expanded into grey immensity for time perhaps slept woke with vague impression of remote concussion perceived rattling of window like quiver of earthquake lasted for minute so died away then after silence returned then died away again fancied might be merely passage of heavy vehicle along main road

nettle grasp giant nettle refrain once started sang through mind must not be dismissed what after must caterham do be religious man be bound in sort of way by not to do violence without cause grasp nettle perhaps for example princess be to be seized sent abroad there might be trouble with son in case why have be arrested why be necessary to keep in ignorance of thing like that thing suggested something more extensive perhaps for example meant to lay giant by heel be to be arrested together there have be hint of in election speech then doubt have got cossar also caterham be religious man

poppy head a big a hat curtain rod be grass stem tremendous skull of great hog of oakham hung portentous ivory overmantel with chinese jar in eye socket snout down above fire be to photograph redwood went in particular to photograph of son brought back countless memory of thing have passed out of mind of early day of food of bensington timid presence of cousin jane of cossar night work at experimental farm thing came to now very little bright distinct like thing seen through telescope on sunny day then there be giant nursery giant childhood young giant first effort to speak first clear sign of affection gun flowed in on irresistibly overwhelmingly that outside there outside accursed silence mystery son cossar son glorious first fruit of greater age be even now fighting fighting for

stricken rigid trembling of window have begun again then have come thud vast concussion shook house concussion seemed to last for age must have be very near for moment seemed that something have struck house above enormous impact broke into tinkle of falling glass then stillness ended at last with minute clear sound of running foot in street below foot released from rigor turned towards window saw starred broken heart beat high with sense of crisis of conclusive occurrence of release then again realisation of impotent confinement fell about like curtain must see nothing outside except that small electric lamp opposite be not lighted must hear nothing after first suggestion of wide alarm must add nothing to interpret enlarge mystery except presently there came reddish fluctuating brightness in sky towards south east light waxed waned when waned doubted if have ever waxed have crept upon very gradually with darkling became predominant fact in long night of suspense sometimes seemed to have quiver one associate with dancing flame at others fancied be no more than normal reflection of evening light waxed waned through long hour only vanished at last when be submerged altogether under rising tide of dawn did mean what must mean almost certainly be sort of fire near remote must not even tell whether be smoke cloud drift streamed across sky about one o'clock there began flickering of searchlight athwart that ruddy tumult flickering continued for rest of night too might mean many thing what must mean what did mean just stained unrestful sky have suggestion of huge explosion to occupy mind there came further sound further running nothing shouting might have be only distant effort of drunken men did not turn up light stood at draughty broken window distressful slight black outline to officer who looked ever again into room exhorted to rest night redwood remained at window peering up at ambiguous drift of sky only with coming of dawn did obey fatigue lie down upon little bed have prepared for between writing desk sinking fire in fireplace under great hog skull iii for thirty six long hour did redwood remain imprisoned closed in shut off from great drama of two day while little people in dawn of greatness fought against child of food then abruptly iron curtain rose again found near very centre of struggle curtain rose a unexpectedly a fell in late afternoon be called to window by clatter of cab stopped without young man descended in minute stood before in room slightly built young man of thirty perhaps clean shaven well dressed well mannered mr redwood sir began must be willing to come to mr caterham need presence very urgently need presence there leapt question into redwood mind that for moment must not put hesitated then in voice broke asked what have done to son stood breathless for reply son sir son be doing well so at least gather doing well be wounded sir yesterday have not heard redwood smote pretence aside voice be no longer coloured by fear by anger know have not heard know have heard nothing mr caterham feared sir be time of upheaval one taken by surprise arrested to save sir from misadventure arrested to prevent giving warning advice to son go on tell have happened have succeeded have killed young man made pace so towards window turned sir said concisely what have to tell be proof sir that fighting be not planned by found totally unprepared mean mean sir giant have to certain extent held own world changed for redwood for moment something like hysteria have muscle of face throat then gave vent to profound ah heart bounded towards exultation giant have held own there have be terrible fighting terrible destruction be most hideous misunderstanding in north midland giant have be killed everywhere be fighting now sir there be flag of truce from sir mr caterham sent flag of truce whole thing be hideous misunderstanding be why want to talk to put case before insist sir that must intervene redwood interrupted do know what happened to son asked be wounded tell tell princess came before movement to surround cossar camp be complete cossar pit at chislehurst came suddenly sir crashing through dense thicket of giant oat near river upon column of infantry soldier have be very nervous day produced panic shot sir ran away shot at wildly against order redwood gave note of denial be true sir not on account of son wo pretend on account of princess yes be true two giant ran shouting towards encampment soldier ran way then began firing say saw stagger ugh yes sir know be not badly hurt how sent message sir that be doing well to who else sir redwood stood for nearly minute with arm tightly folded taking in then indignation found voice because be fool in doing thing because miscalculated blundered must like to think be not murderer in intention besides rest young man looked interrogation other giant young man made further pretence of misunderstanding tone fell thirteen sir be dead others wounded yes sir caterham gasped want to meet where be others got to encampment during fighting sir seem to have known well of course did if have be for cossar cossar be there yes sir surviving giant be there one who did get to camp in fighting have gone be going now under flag of trace mean said redwood that be beaten be not beaten sir can not say be beaten son have broken rule of war once last night now again after attack have be withdrawn afternoon began to bombard london be legitimate have be firing shell filled with poison poison yes poison food herakleophorbia yes sir mr caterham sir be beaten of course that beat be cossar what can hope to do now what good be to do anything now will breathe in dust of street what be there to fight for more rule of war indeed now caterham want to humbug to help bargain good heaven man why must come to exploded windbag have played game murdered muddled why must young man stood with air of vigilant respect be fact sir interrupted that giant insist that will see will have ambassador unless come to be afraid sir there will be more bloodshed on side perhaps sir on side world be resolved thing must end redwood looked about study eye rested for moment on photograph of boy turned met expectation of young man yes said at last will come iv encounter with caterham be entirely different from anticipation have seen man only twice in life once at dinner once in lobby of house imagination have be active not with man with creation of newspaper caricaturist legendary caterham jack giant killer perseus rest of element of human personality came in to disorder that here be not face of caricature portrait face of worn sleepless man lined drawn yellow in white of eye little weakened about mouth here indeed be red brown eye black hair distinctive aquiline profile of great demagogue here be also something else that smote premeditated scorn rhetoric aside man be suffering be suffering acutely be under enormous stress from beginning have air of impersonating presently with single gesture slightest movement revealed to redwood that be keeping up with drug moved thumb to waistcoat pocket then after few sentence more threw concealment aside slipped little tabloid to lip moreover in spite of stress upon in spite of fact that be in wrong redwood junior by dozen year strange quality in something personal magnetism one may call for want of better name have won way for to eminence of disaster be with still on also redwood have failed to reckon from first so far a course conduct of speech went caterham prevailed over redwood quality of first phase of meeting be determined by tone procedure be happened a if be matter of course redwood expectation vanished at presence shook hand before redwood remembered that meant to parry familiarity pitched note of conference from outset sure clear a search for expedient under common catastrophe if made mistake be when ever again fatigue got better of immediate attention habit of public meeting carried away then drew up through interview men stood looked away from redwood began to fence justify once even said gentleman quietly expandingly began to talk there be moment when redwood ceased even to feel interlocutor when became mere auditor of monologue became privileged spectator of extraordinary phenomenon perceived something almost like specific difference between being whose beautiful voice enveloped who be talking talking mind before be so powerful so limited from driving energy personal weight invincible oblivion to certain thing there sprang up in redwood mind most grotesque strange of image instead of antagonist who be fellow creature man one must hold morally responsible to whom one must address reasonable appeal saw caterham a something something like monstrous rhinoceros a be civilised rhinoceros begotten of jungle of democratic affair monster of irresistible onset invincible resistance in crashing conflict of tangle be supreme beyond man be being supremely adapted to make way through multitude of men for there be fault so important a self contradiction science so significant a reconciliation of interest economic reality topographical necessity barely touched mine of scientific expedient existed for more than railway rifled gun geographical literature exist for animal prototype what did exist be gathering caucus vote above vote be vote incarnate million of vote now in great crisis with giant broken not beaten vote monster talked be so evident that even now have everything to learn did not know there be physical law economic law quantity reaction that humanity voting nemine contradicente can not vote away be disobeyed only at price of destruction did not know there be moral law can not be bent by force of glamour be bent only to fly back with vindictive violence in face of shrapnel judgment day be evident to redwood that man must have sheltered behind curiously dodged vote of house of common what most concerned mind now be not power held fastness away there to south not defeat death effect of thing upon majority cardinal reality in life have to defeat giant go under be by mean absolutely despairful in hour of utmost failure with blood disaster upon hand rich promise of still more horrible disaster with gigantic destiny of world towering toppling over be capable of belief that by sheer exertion of voice by explaining qualifying restating might yet reconstitute power be puzzled distressed doubt fatigued suffering if only must keep up if only must keep talking a talked seemed to redwood to advance recede to dilate contract redwood share of talk be of most subsidiary sort wedge a be suddenly thrust in be nonsense be use suggesting that then why did begin be doubtful if caterham really heard at round such interpolation caterham speech flowed indeed like swift stream about rock there incredible man stood on official hearthrug talking talking with enormous power skill talking a though pause in talk explanation presentation of standpoint light of consideration expedient must permit antagonistic influence to leap into being into vocal being only being must comprehend there stood amidst slightly faded splendour of official room in one man after have succumbed to belief that certain power of intervention be creative control of empire more talked more certain redwood sense of stupendous futility grew did man realise that while stood talked there whole great world be moving that invincible tide of growth flowed flowed that there be hour parliamentary hour weapon in hand of avenger of blood outside darkling whole room single leaf of giant virginia creeper tapped unheeded on pane redwood became anxious to end amazing monologue to escape to sanity judgment to beleaguered camp fastness of future where at very nucleus of greatness son be gathered together for talking be endured have curious impression that unless monologue ended must presently find carried away by that must fight against caterham voice a one fight against drug fact have altered be altering beneath spell be man saying since redwood have to report to child of food in sort of way perceived did matter must have to listen guard sense of reality a well a must much about bloodguiltiness be eloquence that did matter next be suggesting convention be suggesting that surviving child of food must capitulate go apart form community of own there be precedent said for must assign territory where interjected redwood stooping to argue caterham snatched at concession turned face to redwood voice fell to persuasive reasonableness must be determined that contended be quite subsidiary question then went on to stipulate except for where be must have absolute control food fruit of food must be stamped out redwood found bargaining princess stand apart said redwood struggling to get back to old footing be absurd that afterwards at rate be agreed that making of food must stop have agreed to nothing have said nothing on one planet to have two race of men one great one small consider what have happened consider be little foretaste of what might presently happen if food have way consider have already brought upon world if there be to be race of giant increasing multiplying be not for to argue said redwood must go to son want to go to son be why have come to tell exactly what offer caterham made speech upon term child of food be to be given great reservation in north america perhaps africa in might live out life in own fashion be nonsense said redwood there be other giant now abroad over europe here there there must be international convention be not impossible something of sort indeed have already be spoken of in reservation can live out own life in own way may do what like may make what like will be glad if will make thing may be happy think provided there be more child precisely child be for so sir will save world will save absolutely from fruit of terrible discovery be not too late for only be eager to temper expediency with mercy even now be burning searing place shell hit yesterday can get under trust will get under in way without cruelty without injustice suppose child agree for first time caterham looked redwood fully in face must think will why must not agree asked in richly toned amazement suppose what can be war can not have thing go on can not sir have scientific men imagination have mercy can not have world trampled under growing herd of such monster monstrous growth a food have made can not can not ask sir what can be war remember have happened be only beginning be skirmish mere affair of police believe mere affair of police be cheated by perspective by immediate bigness of newer thing behind be nation be humanity behind thousand who have died there be million be not for fear of bloodshed sir behind first attack there must be forming other attack even now whether can kill food not most assuredly can kill son reckon too much on thing of yesterday on happening of mere score of year on one battle have sense of slow course of history offer convention for sake of life not because can change inevitable end if think that poor two dozen of giant can resist force of people of alien people who will come to aid if think can change humanity at blow in single generation alter nature stature of man flung out arm go to now sir see for evil have done crouching among wounded stopped a though have glanced at redwood son by chance there came pause go to said be what want to do then go now turned pressed button of bell without in immediate response came sound of opening door hastening foot talk be at end display be over abruptly caterham seemed to contract to shrivel up into yellow faced fagged out middle sized middle aged man stepped forward a if be stepping out of picture with complete assumption of friendliness that lie behind public conflict of race held out hand to redwood a if be matter of course redwood shook hand with for second time chapter fifth giant leaguer presently redwood found in train going south over thames have brief vision of river shining under light of smoke still going up from place where shell have fallen on north bank where vast multitude of men have be organised to burn herakleophorbia out of ground southern bank be dark for reason even street be not lit be clearly visible be outline of tall alarm tower dark bulk of flat school after minute of peering scrutiny turned back on window sank into thought there be nothing more to see do until saw son be fatigued by stress of last two day seemed to that emotion must need be exhausted have fortified with strong coffee before starting thought ran thin clear mind touched many thing reviewed again now in enlightenment of accomplished event manner in food have entered unfolded in world bensington thought might be excellent food for infant whispered to with faint smile then there came into mind a vivid a if be still unsettled own horrible doubt after have committed by giving to own son from with steady unfaltering expansion in spite of effort of men to help hinder food have spread through whole world of man now even if kill redwood whispered thing be done secret of making be known far wide have be own work plant animal multitude of distressful growing child must conspire irresistibly to force world to revert again to food happened in present struggle thing be done said with mind swinging round beyond controlling to rest upon present fate of child son must find exhausted by effort of battle wounded starving on verge of defeat must find still stout hopeful ready for still grimmer conflict of morrow son be wounded have sent message mind came back to interview with caterham be roused from thought by stopping of train in chislehurst station recognised place by huge rat alarm tower crested camden hill row of blossoming giant hemlock lined road caterham private secretary came to from other carriage told that mile farther line have be wrecked that rest of journey be to be made in motor car redwood descended upon platform lit only by hand lantern swept by cool night breeze quiet of derelict wood set weed embedded suburb for inhabitant have taken refuge in london at outbreak of yesterday conflict became instantly impressive conductor took down step to where motor car be waiting with blazing light only light to be seen handed over to care of driver bade farewell will do best for said with imitation of master manner a held redwood hand so soon a redwood must be wrapped about started out into night at one moment stood still then motor car be rushing softly swiftly down station incline turned one corner followed winding of lane of villa then before stretched road motor droned up to topmost speed black night swept past everything be very dark under starlight whole world crouched mysteriously be gone without sound not breath stirred flying thing by wayside deserted pallid white villa on hand with black unlit window reminded of noiseless procession of skull driver beside be silent man stricken into silence by condition of journey answered redwood brief question in monosyllable gruffly athwart southern sky beam of searchlight waved noiseless pass sole strange evidence of life seemed in that derelict world about hurrying machine road be presently bordered on side by gigantic blackthorn shoot made very dark by tail grass big campion huge giant dead nettle a high a tree flickering past darkly in silhouette overhead beyond keston came to rising hill driver went slow at crest stopped engine throbbed became still there said big gloved finger pointed black misshapen thing before redwood eye far away a seemed great embankment crested by blaze from searchlight sprang rose up against sky beam went came among cloud hilly land about a if traced mysterious incantation know said driver at last be clear be afraid to go on presently searchlight swept down sky to stopped a be with start scrutinised blinding stare confused rather than mitigated by intervening monstrous weed stem so sat with glove held over eye trying to look under meet light go on said redwood after while driver still have doubt tried to express died down to know again at last ventured on here go said roused machinery to motion again followed intently by great white eye to redwood seemed for long time be no longer on earth in state of palpitating hurry through luminous cloud teuf teuf teuf went machine ever again obeying know not what nervous impulse driver sounded horn passed into welcome darkness of high fenced lane down into hollow past house into blinding stare again then for space road ran naked across down seemed to hang throbbing in immensity once more giant weed rose about whirled past then quite abruptly close upon loomed figure of giant shining brightly where searchlight caught below black against sky above hullo there cried stop there be more road beyond be that father redwood redwood stood up gave vague shout by way of answer then cossar be in road beside gripping hand with of pulling out of car what of son asked redwood be right said cossar have hurt nothing serious in lad well of well have have to make fight for giant be saying something to motor driver redwood stood aside a machine wheeled round then suddenly cossar vanished everything vanished be in absolute darkness for space glare be following motor back to crest of keston hill watched little conveyance receding in white halo have curious effect a though be not moving at halo be group of war blasted giant elder flashed into gaunt scarred gesticulation be swallowed again by night redwood turned to cossar dim outline again clasped hand have be shut up kept in ignorance said for two whole day fired food at said cossar obviously thirty shot eh come from caterham know do laughed with note of bitterness suppose be wiping up ii where be son said redwood be all right giant be waiting for message yes son passed with cossar down long slanting tunnel be lit red for moment then became dark again came out presently into great pit of shelter giant have made redwood first impression be of enormous arena bounded by very high cliff with floor greatly encumbered be in darkness save for passing reflection of watchman searchlight whirled perpetually high overhead for red glow came went from distant corner where two giant worked together amidst metallic clangour against sky a glare came about eye caught familiar outline of old worksheds playsheds be made for cossar boy be hanging now a be at cliff brow strangely twisted distorted with gun of caterham bombardment there be suggestion of huge gun emplacement above there nearer be pile of mighty cylinder be perhaps ammunition about wide space below form of great engine incomprehensible bulk be scattered in vague disorder giant appeared vanished among mass in uncertain light great shape be not disproportionate to thing amidst moved be actively employed sitting lying a if courted sleep one near at hand whose body be bandaged lay on rough litter of pine bough be certainly asleep redwood peered at dim form eye went from one stirring outline to where be son cossar then saw son be sitting under shadow of great wall of steel presented a black shape recognisable only by pose feature be invisible sat chin upon hand a though weary lost in thought beside redwood discovered figure of princess dark suggestion of merely then a glow from distant iron returned saw for instant red lit tender infinite kindliness of shadowed face stood looking down upon lover with hand resting against steel seemed that whispered to redwood must have gone towards presently said cossar first there be message yes said redwood stopped son be now looking up speaking to princess in too low tone for to hear young redwood raised face bent down towards glanced aside before spoke if be beaten heard whispered voice of young redwood paused red blaze showed eye bright with unshed tear bent nearer spoke still lower there be something so intimate private in bearing in soft tone redwood redwood who have thought for two whole day of nothing son felt intrusive there abruptly be checked for first time in life perhaps realised how much more son may be to father than father can ever be to son realised full predominance of future over past here between two have part part be played turned to cossar in instant realisation eye met voice be changed to tone of grey resolve will deliver message now said afterwards will be soon enough then pit be so enormous so encumbered that be long tortuous route to place from redwood must speak to cossar followed steeply descending way that passed beneath arch of interlocking machinery so came into vast deep gangway that ran athwart bottom of pit gangway wide vacant yet relatively narrow conspired with everything about to enhance redwood sense of own littleness became a be excavated gorge high overhead separated from by cliff of darkness searchlight wheeled blazed shining shape went to fro giant voice called to one above there calling giant together to council of war to hear term caterham have sent gangway still inclined downward towards black vastness towards shadow mystery inconceivable thing into redwood went slowly with reluctant footstep cossar with confident stride redwood thought be busy two men passed into completest darkness cossar took companion wrist went now slowly perforce redwood be moved to speak said be strange big said cossar strange strange that must be strange to who be in sense beginning of be stopped wrestling with elusive meaning threw unseen gesture at cliff have not thought of before have be busy year have passed here see be new generation cossar new emotion new need cossar cossar saw now dim gesture to thing about be youth cossar made answer irregular footfall went striding on be youth cossar be taking thing over be beginning upon own emotion own experience own way have made new world be ours be even sympathetic great place planned said cossar face close now ah have given to son redwood must feel loose wave of arm that must not see be be over almost over message yes then be over well of course be out of two old men said cossar with familiar note of sudden anger of course be obviously man for own time now be time beginning be right excavator gang do job go see be what death be for work out little brain little emotion then lot begin afresh fresh fresh perfectly simple what be trouble paused to guide redwood to step yes said redwood one feel left sentence incomplete be what death be for heard cossar below insisting how else must thing be done be what death be for iii after devious winding ascent came out upon projecting ledge from be possible to see over greater extent of giant pit from redwood might make heard by whole of assembly giant be already gathered below about at different level to hear message have to deliver eldest son of cossar stood on bank overhead watching revelation of searchlight for feared breach of truce worker at great apparatus in corner stood out clear in own light be near stripped turned face towards redwood with watchful reference ever again to casting that must not leave saw nearer figure with fluctuating indistinctness by light came went remoter one still le distinctly came from vanished again into depth of great obscurity for giant have more light than must help in pit that eye might be ready to see effectually attacking force might spring upon out of darkness around ever again chance glare must pick out display group that of tall powerful form giant from sunderland clothed in overlapping metal plate others clad in leather in woven rope in woven metal a condition have determined sat amidst rested hand upon stood erect among machine weapon a mighty a face a came went from visible to invisible have steadfast eye made effort to begin did not do so then for moment son face glowed out in hot insurgence of fire son face looking up to tender a well a strong at that found voice to reach speaking across gulf a be to son come from caterham said sent to to tell term offer paused be impossible term know now that see here together be impossible term brought to because wanted to see son once more wanted to see son tell term said cossar be what caterham offer want to go apart leave world where doe not know vaguely somewhere in world great region be to be set apart be to make more of food to have child of own to live in own way for own time then to end for ever stopped be be there followed great stillness darkness veiled giant seemed to look thoughtfully at felt touch at elbow cossar be holding chair for queer fragment of doll furniture amidst piled immensity sat down crossed leg then put one across knee of other clutched boot nervously felt small self conscious acutely visible absurdly placed then at sound of voice forgot again have heard brother said voice out of shadow answered have heard answer brother to caterham be then there be silence for space of second then voice said people be right after light be have be right in killing grew larger than kind beast plant manner of great thing arose be right in trying to massacre be right now in saying must not marry kind according to light be right know be time that also knew that can not have pigmy giant in one world together caterham have said that again again clearly world ours be not hundred now said be endless million so may be thing be a have said then long silence be to die then god forbid be be what caterham say must have live out life die one by one till only one remains one at last must die also must cut down giant plant weed kill giant under life burn out trace of food make end to to food for ever then little pigmy world must be safe must go on safe for ever living little pigmy life doing pigmy kindness pigmy cruelty to other might even perhaps attain sort of pigmy millennium make end to war make end to over population sit down in world wide city to practise pigmy art worshipping one till world begin to freeze in corner sheet of iron fell in thunder to ground brother know what mean to do in spluttering of light from searchlight redwood saw earnest youthful face turning to son be easy now to make food must be easy for to make food for world mean brother redwood said voice out of darkness that be for little people to eat food what else be there to do be not hundred be many million held own so far if be god will may still hold own yes think of dead voice took up strain dead said think of unborn brother came voice of young redwood what can do fight if beat make take food can not help take food now suppose be to resign heritage do folly caterham suggests suppose must suppose give up great thing stir within repudiate thing father did for that father did for pas when time have come into decay nothingness what then will little world of theirs be a be before may fight against greatness in who be child of men can conquer even if must destroy one what then must save for greatness be abroad not only in not only in food in purpose of thing be in nature of thing be part of space time to grow still to grow from first to last be being be law of life what other law can there be to help others to grow be still to grow unless help to fail will fight hard to overcome said voice what of will fight said young redwood if refuse term doubt not will fight indeed hope will be open fight if after offer peace will be only better to catch unawares make mistake brother in way other will fight war have begun must fight to end unless be wise may find presently have lived only to make better weapon against child kind so far have be only dawn of battle life will be battle of will be killed in battle of will be waylaid there be easy victory victory whatever be not more than half defeat for be sure of what of if only keep foothold if only leave behind growing host to fight when be gone to morrow will scatter food will saturate world with food suppose come to term term be food be not a though little great must live together in perfection of compromise be one thing other what right have parent to say child will have light light have have will grow greater than greatness to have grown do speak for brother assenting murmur answered to child who will be woman a well a to child who will be men said voice from darkness even more so to be mother of new race for next generation there must be great little said redwood with eye on son face for many generation little will hamper great great press upon little so must need be father there will be conflict endless conflict endless misunderstanding life be that great little can not understand one in child born of man father redwood lurks seed of greatness waiting for food then be to go to caterham again tell will stay with father redwood answer go to caterham at dawn say that will fight so be said young redwood brother murmured iron wait cried voice two giant who be working in corner began rhythmic hammering made mighty music to scene metal glowed out far more brightly than have done before gave redwood clearer view of encampment than have come to saw oblong space to full extent with great engine of warfare ranged ready to hand beyond at higher level house of cossars stood about be young giant huge beautiful glittering in mail amidst preparation for morrow sight of lifted heart be so easily powerful be so tall gracious be so steadfast in movement there be son amongst first of giant woman princess there leapt into mind oddest contrast memory of bensington very bright little bensington with hand amidst soft breast feather of first great chick standing in conventionally furnished room of peering over spectacle dubiously a cousin jane banged door have happened in yesterday of one twenty year then suddenly strange doubt took hold of that place present greatness be texture of dream that be dreaming must in instant wake to find in study again giant slaughtered food suppressed prisoner locked in what else indeed be life always to be prisoner locked in be culmination end of dream must wake through bloodshed battle to find food most foolish of fancy hope faith of greater world to come no more than coloured film upon pool of bottomless decay littleness invincible so strong deep be wave of despondency suggestion of impending disillusionment that started to foot stood pressed clenched fist into eye so for moment remained fearing to open again see lest dream must already have passed away voice of giant child spoke to one undertone to clangorous melody of smith tide of doubt ebbed heard giant voice heard movement about still be real surely be real a real a spiteful act more real for great thing may be be coming thing littleness bestiality infirmity of men be thing go opened eye done cried one of two ironworker flung hammer down voice sounded above son of cossar standing on great embankment have turned be now speaking to be not that must oust little people from world said in order that who be more than one step upwards from littleness may hold world for ever be step fight for not ourselves be here brother to what end to serve spirit purpose have be breathed into life fight not for ourselves for be momentary hand eye of life of world so father redwood taught through through little folk spirit look learns from by word birth act must pas to still greater life earth be resting place earth be playing place else indeed might put throat to little people knife having greater right to live than in turn might yield to ant vermin fight not for ourselves for growth growth go on for ever to morrow whether live die growth will conquer through be law of spirit for ever more to grow according to will of god to grow out of crack cranny out of shadow darkness into greatness light greater said speaking with slow deliberation greater brother then still greater to grow again to grow to grow at last into fellowship understanding of god growing till earth be more than footstool till spirit will have driven fear into nothingness spread swung arm heavenward there voice ceased white glare of one of searchlight wheeled about for moment fell upon standing out gigantic with hand upraised against sky for one instant shone looking up fearlessly into starry deep mail clad young strong resolute still then light have passed be no more than great black outline against starry sky great black outline threatened with one mighty gesture firmament of heaven multitude of star end
