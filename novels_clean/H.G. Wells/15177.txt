striking darkness by westminster bridge be intense a tramcar turned corner from embankment jenny craned to look at thickly running water below glistening of reflected light spotted surface of thames gave rapid current air of such mysterious especially sinister power that be for instant aware of almost uncontrollable terror must feel heart beating yet must not withdraw gaze be nothing no danger threatened jenny danger of uneventful life sense of sudden yielding to unknown force be merest fancy to be quickly forgotten when occasion have passed none le for instant dread be breathless be fear of one who walk in wood at inexplicable rustle darkness sense of moving water continued to fascinate slightly shuddered not at thought at sensation of moment at last closed eye still however to see mirrored a in visual memory picture be trying to ignore in faint panic hardly conscious to fear stared at neighbour newspaper spelling out heading to of paragraph until need of such protection be past a car proceeded over bridge grinding way through still rolling echo of striking hour seemed part of endless succession of such car alike crowded with homeward bound passenger to curious mind resembling ship pas very slowly at night from safe harbourage to unfathomable element of open sea be such cold still night that sliding window of car be almost closed atmosphere of covered upper deck be heavy with tobacco smoke be so dark that one must not see beyond fringe of lamplight upon bridge moon be in last quarter must not rise for several hour while glitter of city lay behind sky be greyed with light from below surrounding blackness spread creeping finger of night in shadow man sitting beside jenny continued to puff steadfastly at pipe lost in news holding mechanically in further hand return ticket must presently be snatched by hurrying tram conductor be shabby middle aged clerk with thin beard so have not least interest for jenny whose eye be caught by other beauty than of assiduous labour have not even to look at to be quite sure that did not matter to almost jenny did not care whether have glanced sideways at not presently gave quiet sigh of relief a at length river be left behind curious nervous tension more lasting than might have felt at seeing man balancing upon high window sill be relaxed breathed more deeply perhaps for few instant then quite naturally looked at reflection in sliding glass hat a must see in first sure speedless survey have got droop see about said silently threateningly jerking head hat trembled at motion be thereafter ignored stealthily jenny went back to own reflection in window catching clearly chiselled profile of face bereft in dark mirror of colour must see nose chin quite white lip a part of general colourless gloom little white brooch at neck stood boldly out be must be seen with clearness a light be not directly overhead eye be quite lost apparently in deep shadow yet must not resist delight of continuing narrowly to examine face saw be hardly recognisable a own be bewitchingly pale study in black white kind of face in man must at once have drawn attention stimulated curiosity have longed to be pale pallor be achieving by millinery work in stuffy room be not marble whiteness have desired only in sliding window must see face ideally transfigured there have brooding dimness of strange poetic romance must know about girl thought 'd want to know about 'd wonder time about a though have secret reflection became curiously distorted jenny be smiling to herself a soon a tramcar have passed bridge lighted window above shop broke magic mirror gave jenny new interest until a went onward shopping district ablaze with colour crowded with loitering people alive with din turned thought from into one absorbed contemplation of what be beneath eye so absorbed be indeed that conductor have to prod shoulder with two finger before must recover ticket exchange for 'arf asleep people grumbled shoving aside projecting arm elbow prevented free passage between seat feyuss please jenny shrugged shoulder seemed a though have be irritated at conductor touch felt quite bruised silly old fool thought with brusque glance then went silently back to contemplation of life gathered upon muddy glistening pavement below ii in few minute be past shop once again in darkness grinding along pitching from end to end driver bell clanging minute to warn cart people off tramline once with awful thunderous grating of brake car be pulled up everybody tried to see what have provoked sense of accident there be little shouting jenny staring hard into roadway thought must see a cause small girl pushing perambulator loaded with bundle of washing first impulse be pity poor little thing word be hardly in mind before be chased away by faint indignation at child for getting in tram way everybody ought to look where be going ev ry bo dy ought to look where be go ing said pitching tramcar ev ry bo dy oh sickening jenny looked at neighbour paper refuge striking speech read whose what did matter talk talk why did do something be to do tram pitched to refrain of comic song action speak louder than word kid who be wheeling perambulator full of washing jenny attention drifted away like speech of one who looked again at reflection girl in sliding glass must say much 'd think more 'd say when sir herbert pressed for answer thought be own sir herbert mainwaring what be girl in one of best said may command army of soldier can not still beating of woman heart silly fool be jenny have felt tear in eye burning throat very dry when word have be spoken in play jenny at theatre jenny here now be different person different why there be fifty jenny shrewd romantic honest true jenny be behind not stupid not sentimental bold a lion destructively experienced in hardship endurance very quick indeed to single out wither humbug be within range of knowledge innocent a child before other sort of humbug whatsoever be why must now sneer at stage heroine must play with mysterious beauty of own reflection be why must also be led into quick indignation by something read in newspaper tum ty tum ty tum ty tum said tram there be more shop there be straggling shop full blazing row of shop there be stall along side of road woman dancing to organ outside public house shop shop house house house light darkness jenny gathered skirt be where got down one glance at tragic lady of mirror one glance at rising smoke went to join general cloud be upon iron shod stair of car into greasy roadway then darkness a turned along beside big building into side street among row row of small house of kennington park iii be painfully dark in side street lamp drew beam such short distance that be a useless a hidden star only down street one saw mild spot starting out of gloom fascinating in regularity like shining bead set at prepared interval in body of jet house be in darkness because evening meal be laid in kitchen front room be kept for sunday use excepting when emerald edwin geralds doris be practising upon mother piano then must hear din not now now be a quiet a night even door be not slammed jenny crossed street turned corner on corner be small chandler shop with magnificent tea per lb excellent tea per d lb good tea per d lb advertised in great bill upon window above huge collection of unlikely good gathered together like happy family in tarnished abode jenny passed dully lighted shop turned in at own gate in moment be inside house sniffing at warm odour laden air within door mouth drew down at corner stew to night amused gleam lost upon dowdy passage fled across bright eye emmy must have thanked for emmy sick to death herself of smell of cooking must have slammed down pot in despairing rage in kitchen table be laid emmy stretched head back to peer from scullery where be busy at gas stove did not say word jenny also be speechless went a if without thinking to kitchen cupboard table be only half laid a usual that fact did not make action more palatable to emmy emmy who be older than jenny by mysterious period diminished by kept at normal term of three year by jenny except in moment of heat when grew for purpose of retort be also le effective in many way such a in appearance in adroitness jenny comprised in a be good look of family emmy be housekeeper who looked after pa blanchard jenny be roving blade who augmented pa pension by own fluctuating wage be slight barrier between sister nevertheless emmy be quite generous enough be long suffering so that resentment took general form of silence secret brooding upon different fortune there be great deal to be said about difference saying grew more more remote from explicit utterance a thought of ground into emmy mind through long hour day week of solitude pa must not hear anything besides banging of pot be too used to sudden noise to take notice of such thing pot occasionally dented in savage dash against other against tap might have heard vicious apostrophe if have listened intently to emmy ejaculation a be with endurance of pot mutely bore scar waited dumbly for superannuation bruise stood to emmy when renewed acquaintance with a mark of yet grievance against jenny for jenny enjoyed liberty of life while emmy stayed at home jenny sported while emmy be engaged upon hideous routine of kitchen affair upon nursing of comparatively helpless old man who must do hardly anything at for pa be in bedroom back room on ground floor chosen because must not walk up stair must have a little trouble in self conveyance a possible staggeringly making toilet for meal to come sitting patiently in front of dressing table by light of solitary candle must appear in due course when be fetched have be strong man runner cricketer in youth rather obstreperously disposed that time be past strength for such pursuit be a dead a wife who have suffered because of vagary must no longer disappear on saturday a have be used to do in old day chair in kitchen horse hair sofa in sitting room bed in bedroom be only change now have from one day end to emmy jenny pledge of real not very delicate affection be remained to call up sorrowful thought of old love old time of virility when pa strength rough boisterousness have be delight of perhaps dozen regular companion sometimes looked at two girl with passionless scrutiny a though be trying to remember something buried in ancient neglect eye must thereafter perhaps at mere sense of helplessness fill slowly with tear until emmy smothering own rough sympathy must dab pa eye with harsh handkerchief must rebuke for decay be hard moment in blanchard home for two girl have grown almost manlike in abhorrence of tear with masculine distaste have arisen corresponding feeling of powerlessness in face of emotion must not share be a though pa have become something like old beloved dog unable to speak pitied despised yet claiming by very dumbness something that must only give by mean of pat half bullying kindness at such time be jenny who left place at table popped morsel of food into pa mouth be emmy who best understood bitterness of soul be emmy therefore who must snap at sister bid get on with own food while pa blanchard made trembling scrape with knife fork until mood passed then be emmy who be most with pa be emmy who hated in middle of love because stood to a living symbol of daily inescapable servitude in household jenny must never have felt that must like to kill pa emmy sometimes felt that at time when have be provoking obtuse so shook with hysterical anger born of inevitable day in society in kitchen that must have thrown at battered pot carried must have pushed passionately against mantelpiece in fierce hatred of helplessness occasional perverse stupidity be rarely stupid with jenny giggled at teasing jenny be taller than emmy by several inch be tall thin dark with air of something like impudent bravado made expression sometimes little wicked nose be long straight almost sharp pointed face too thin to be perfect oval eye be wide open so full of power to show feeling that seemed constantly alive with changing mocking light shadow if have be stouter excellent shape of body now almost too thick in waist must have be emphasised happiness comfort decrease in physical a in mental restlessness must have made more than ordinarily beautiful a be drew eye at once a though challenged conflict of will movement be so swift eager so little clumsy jerking that jenny have carriage to command admiration resemblance between sister be ordinarily not noticeable must have needed photograph because photograph besides flattening feature also in manner compose distinguish to reveal likeness in shape in shadow even in outline be momentarily obscured by natural difference of colouring expression emmy be le dark more temperamentally unadventurous stouter possessed of more colour be twenty eight possibly twenty nine mouth be rather too hard for pleasantness be not peevish lip be set a though have endured much eye also be hard although if cried one saw face soften remarkably into semblance of of little girl from involuntary defiance expression changed to something really pathetic one must not help loving then not with free give take of happy affection with shamed hope that nobody must read conflict of sympathy contempt made one love frigid conscious jenny rarely cried cheek reddened eye grew full of tear did not cry tongue be too ready brain too quick for also kept temper from flooding over into self abandonment of angry weeping vituperation perhaps be that have too much pride that in general saw life with too much self complacency that be not in habit of yielding to disappointment may have be that jenny belonged to class of person who be called sufficient plunged through crisis with own zest meeting attack with counter attack keeping head surveying with instinctive irreverence protective wariness of london urchin possibility swaying fortune of fight emmy so much slower so much le self reliant have refuge in scolding that grew shriller more shrill until ended in violent weeping withdrawal from field entirely abject be not born fighter be harder on surface weaker in power below surface long solitude have made build up grievance devastating thought have given thousand bitter thing to fling into conflict have not strengthened character must not stand strain of prolonged argument sooner later must abandon everything exhausted beaten into impotence must bear more endure more than jenny must bear much so that story of life might be read a one long scene of endurance of thing jenny must have struggled madly to overcome to escape having borne for so long must fight only like cat head a be turned aside fur upon end stealthily moving paw by paw always keeping front to foe seeking for escape until pride perilously supporting temper gave way dissolved into incoherence quivering sob might have be said roughly that jenny more closely resembled father whose temperament in care free happy go lucky way understood very well better than emmy did that while carried into affair necessarily more delicate refinement than have still dare devil spirit that pa friend have so much admired have more humour than emmy more power to laugh to be detached to be indifferent emmy have such power must laugh must only laugh seriously at obviously funny thing otherwise felt everything too much a jenny must have said must take joke made angry puzzled to be laughed at jenny laughed back tried to score point in return not always scrupulously emmy put check on tongue be sometimes virtuously silent jenny rarely put check on tongue sometimes let say perfectly outrageous thing be surprised at consequence for be enough that have not meant to hurt sometimes hurt very much frequently hurt emmy to quick darting in one of sure careless stab shattered self control so while loved other jenny also despised emmy while emmy in return hated be jealous of jenny even to point of actively wishing in moment of furtive shamefaced savageness to harm be outward difference between sister in time of stress of inner truer self must be more rash to speak for in time of peace jenny have innumerable insight emotion must be forever unknown to elder girl sense of rivalry however be acute coloured moment of domestic life unwinking incessant when emmy came from scullery into kitchen bearing precious dish of stew when jenny standing up be measured against rivalry must have be seen by skilled observer rayed forked about a lightning might have done about two adjacent tree emmy put down dish fetch pa will said briefly one must see who gave order in kitchen iv jenny found father in bedroom sitting before dressing table upon tall candle stood in equally tall candlestick be looking intently at reflection in looking glass a one who encounter examines stranger in glass face looked red ugly tossed grey hair heavy beard be made to appear startlingly unkempt mouth be open eye shaded by lowered lid in rather trembling voice addressed jenny upon entrance be supper ready asked heard come in yes pa said jenny be going to brush hair got fancy for like have what man with shirt unbuttoned tie out come here let have look at although word be unkind tone be not a rectified omission put arm round jenny gave father light hug right be be good boy yes good boy feebly waveringly responded what be noos to night jenny jenny considered made frown so concentrated be effort to remember well somebody made speech volunteered can do ca somebody paid five hundred pound transfer for jack sutherdon be barnsley burnley oh fire at southwark just usual sort of news pa murder ah have murder used to have grumbled old man be police pa jenny wanted to reassure know how be trembled stiffening body rising from chair perhaps hush up be shock to must not move until notion have sunk into head perhaps people be more careful get leaving about like used to pa blanchard have suggestion such perilous idea so frequently started by jenny for mystification joggled together in brain made there subject of thousand rumination tantalised pa slowly revolving thought kept moving through long hour of silence such notion preserved interest in world senile belief in magic a nothing else must have done together pace suited to step two moved slowly to door took long time to make short journey though jenny supported father on one side used stick in right hand in passage waited while blew out candle then went forward to meal at approach pa eye opened wider luminously glowed be there dumpling quivered seeming to tremble with excitement one for pa cried emmy from kitchen pa gave small chuckle of joy progress be accelerated reached table emmy took right arm for descent into substantial chair upon pa plate glistened fair dumpling glorious mountain of paste amid wreckage of meat gravy now perhaps emmy went on smoothing back from forehead little streamer of hair will close door jenny be closed with bang made pa jump emmy look savagely up sorry cried jenny how dumpling pa sat recklessly at table v to look at three of sitting there munching away be sight not altogether pleasing pa vein stood out from forehead two girl devoted to food a if needed there be none of airy talk go on in house of rich while maid manservant come respectfully to right left of diner with decanter dish here food be thing there be speech sometimes pa eye rolled sometimes emmy glanced up with unconscious malevolence at jenny sometimes jenny almost winked at lithograph portrait of edward seventh a prince of wale hung over mantelpiece above one tenpenny have'penny clock ticked away so busily there something have happened long ago to edward seventh have stain across field marshal uniform something have happened also to clock lay upon side a if kicking in death agony something have happened to almost everything in kitchen even plate on dresser cup saucer hung stood upon shelf bore noble scar of service time emmy turned glance upon damaged plate a sharp a stalactite have thought jenny doing time looked at convulsive clock emmy said to herself be miss jenny cleverness when chucked cosy at alf when emmy said in reflective silence of animosity name alf drew deep breath looked straight up at jenny with inscrutable eye of pain vi stew being finished emmy collected plate retired once again to scullery now did jenny show afresh curiosity whose first flush have be so ill satisfied by meat course when however emmy reappeared with most domestic of sweet bread pudding jenny face fell once more for of dish most abominated bread pudding under breath adversely commented oh lor whispered stew bp what life emmy not hearing second sighted on such matter shot malevolent glance from place in awful voice intended to be trifle arch addressed father bready butter pudding pa inquired old man whinnied with delight emmy be appeased have one satisfied client at rate cut into pudding with knife producing wedge with dexterous hand hey ho observed jenny to herself tastelessly beginning work of laborious demolition jenny think be common ought to have job of getting meal cried emmy bitterly obliquely attacking sister by talking at something to talk about then sneered with chagrin up in arm at criticism well truth be drawled jenny if want like bread pudding somehow have never said that before in year seemed to that bread pudding be like ash in mouth be like duty funeral stew stuff got to be finished up flared emmy defiantly with sense of being adjudged inferior because have dutifully habituated to appreciation of bread pudding might think of what else be to do be just old girl just why like just hate to feel be finishing up same with stew know be be something else first be not fresh same old thing week in week out finishing up scrap proud stomach quick flush came into emmy cheek tear started to eye perhaps be oh em feel like sometimes o o h drawled word wearily oh for bit more money then must give stew to cat meat man bread to old thompson chicken then must have nice thing to

slaving hour after hour wish 'd try manage better bet 'd be thankful to finish up scrap way old way 'd like to see do what do momentarily jenny picture of emmy nature drawn accommodatingly by in order that own might be differentiated exalted by comparison be shattered emmy vehemence have thus temporary effect of creating fresh reality out of common idealisation of circumstance legend must re form later perhaps must continue so to re form a persuasion flowed back upon jenny egotism until crystallised hard became unchallengeable at rate for instant jenny have have glimmer of insight into tamer discontent rebelliousness that encroached like canker upon emmy originally sweet nature shock of impact with unpleasant conviction made jenny hasten to dissemble real belief in emmy born inferiority note be changed from one of complaint into one of persuasive entreaty be not that be not that not at must like change from stew bread pudding sometimes mean seem to like right at ill considered suggestion made with unintentional savageness jenny so worked upon that own colour rose high temper became suddenly unmanageable talk about being out breathlessly exclaimed when do go out when tell o o h like what about going to picture with alf rylett emmy hand be jerking upon table in anger be always out with well never be not when be interrupted unexpectedly by feeble jubilant voice more bready butter pudding said pa blanchard tipping plate to show that have finished yes pa for moment emmy be distracted from feud in mechanical way a mother sometimes deep in conversation attend to child need

evening surged into mind evening when jenny be out with alf while drudge stayed at home with pa until be desperate with sense of unutterable wrong time after time go sorry be sure flung back jenny fairly in fray too quick not to read plain message of emmy tone expression too cruel to relinquish sudden advantage never guessed wanted must have done for world never said know satirically concluded with studiously careful accent used when wanted to indicate scorn innuendo be sorry ought to have asked if might then with dash into grimmer satire why doe ask to go with funny asking be emmy grew violently crimson voice have roughness in be mortally wounded anybody 'd know be lady said warmly be welcome retorted jenny eye flashed glittering in paltry gaslight be never emmy did know be silly little fool fancy going on like about man like at age vehement glance flashed between emmy jealousy be in face clear a day jenny drew sharp breath then obstinately closed lip looking for moment like girl in sliding window inscrutable emmy also recovering spoke again trying to steady voice be not what think ca bear to see playing about with be not fair think mean course mean anything fellow like jenny laughed little woundingly what be matter with savagely emmy betrayed again be trembling from head to foot mind blundering hither thither for help against quicker witted foe be only be not good

after take care be not left oh can take care jenny said with cold nonchalance trust vii later when be in chilly scullery washing up supper dish be again constrained somehow when be alone together must not quarrel needed presence of pa blanchard to stimulate to retort in rambling silence found spur for unkind eloquence too often pa be used a stalking horse for anger must hardly hear must not follow talk by directing remark to so that cannoned off at other obtained satisfaction for rivalry endured from day to day between hungry heart latent bitterness in nature yearning for expression found in presence alone anger be generally silent may have be that love be strong that courage failed that energy required for conflict be not aroused that deeply loved one be sure there be rivalry jealousy irritation between did not affect love jealousy be part of general discontent jealousy must grow more intense a remained frustrate unhappy understood force at work within saw perversely illustrated in other fault in case cause of unhappiness be unsatisfied love unsatisfied craving for love be more acute in emmy case because be older because love needed be under eye being wasted upon jenny if be love not that mixture of admiration desire with self esteem go to make common formula to name of love be generally attached jenny must not be jealous of emmy a emmy be jealous of jenny have cause emmy be not rival jenny rival be life a will be shown hereafter have own pain be thus only natural that two girl having pushed pa chair to side of kitchen fire having loaded set light to pa pipe must work together in silence for few minute clearing table washing supper dish be distant aggrieved emmy with labouring breath sense of bitter animosity jenny with curled lip of one triumphant who doe not need triumph must abandon at first move of forgiveness must not speak work be done emmy be rinsing washing basin before jenny must bring to say awkwardly what have in mind em began did know know silence emmy continued to swirl water round with small washing mop face averted jenny lip stiffened made attempt to be last restraining irritation with great effort if like wo wo go out with more oh need

still sobbing in arm looked down laying face against sister face little contemptuous smile appeared in eye brow furrowed well emmy must cry must did want to cry wanted to go out in darkness so pleasantly enwrapped earth back to stir glitter of life somewhere beyond abruptly jenny sighed vision have be far different from scene have carried over land sea right into unexplored realm where there be wild laughter noise where heart broke tragically woman in hour of ruin turned triumphant eye to glory of life where blinding streaming light scintillating colour made everything seem different made seem romantic rapturous indescribable from vision back to cupboard like house in kennington park stodgy alf rylett supper of stew bread butter pudding pa little sobbing figure in arm be incongruous flight made jenny mouth twist in smile so painful that be almost grimace oh lor said again under breath a have said earlier what life chapter ii treat gradually emmy tearless sob diminished began to murmur broken meaningless ejaculation of self contempt to strain away from jenny at last pushed jenny from feverishly freeing so that stood apart while emmy blew nose wiped eye

hurriedly to meet what be that asked in trembling tone what be doing a though felt sick faint sat sharply down upon old chair near door jenny rallied only kid game said nothing at alf said nothing looking at girl emmy tried to speak again at first word must not come finally went on with dreadful understanding did want to take alf did want to go be a though short absence perhaps even change of costume have worked curious cognate change in mind perhaps be that in flushed happiness have forgotten to be suspicious have blindly misread meaning of earlier colloquy a result of invitation have be given be so silly quickly cried jenny of course wanted to go alf emmy eye be fixed upon with look of urgent entreaty looked at alf with love extraordinary intimate confidence with woman of class do so generally regard men love ready to yield judgment to decision when did not answer stood still before like red faced boy staring down at floor seemed to shudder began despairingly to unfasten button of

going to happen to be alf emmy disregarded watching alf too transparent uneasiness always be little lying beast said venomously trickster see jenny said defiantly to alf what own sister say so be with sailor playing fool with alf emmy voice rose always be wonder alf never seen long ago at moment with electrifying suddenness pa put down tankard what ai gone yet trembled thought be going out how did know looked sharply at one sobered so for one instant stood incapable of giving explanation to meekly inquiring old man who have disturbed quarrel alf so helpless before girl be steeled by interruption took two step towards emmy will have out later on said meanwhile come on em be just on eight come along there be good girl stooped took hand drew to foot then with uncommon tenderness re buttoned coat with one arm about led emmy to door pressed back be against within magic circle of arm suddenly deliriously happy jenny still panting stood a have stood for last few minute watched departure heard front door close a left house with shaky step went slammed door of kitchen trembling violently leant against door a emmy have done earlier for moment must not speak must not think feel only a clock in neighbourhood solemnly recorded eighth hour did choke down little sob say with ghost of bereaved irony be done chapter iv wish waiting until have little recovered self control jenny presently moved from door to fireplace proceeded methodically to put coal on fire be still shaking slightly corner of mouth be uncontrollably twitching with alternate smile other raiding emotion so that did not yet feel in fit state to meet pa scrutiny might be old fool sometimes appeared to be inconveniently might not just because did not want to be particularly bright be quite probable that must have flourish of brilliance be a occasionally happens in dullest of mortal so jenny be time in attending to fire until supposed that undue redness of cheek might be imagined to have be occasioned by strenuous activity then straightened looked down at pa with curious mixture of protectiveness anxiety pleased with be inquired more to make conversation might engage ancient mind in ruminant pastime than to begin series of inquiry into pa mental state eh jenny said pa staring back at ai gone out be emmy be gone out what did fool alf rylett want be shouting heard yes pa must have listened rebuked jenny with fine colour pa shook shaggy head felt cunningly for empty tankard hoping that have be refilled by benevolent genius be not until full measure of disappointment have be revealed that answered be listening quavered did hear what said did emmy go out with yes pa to theatre alf brought ticket ticket ticket for seat oh dear why ca understand did have to pay at door pa suddenly understood oh ah said did have to pay there be pause be like alf rylett presently added pa jenny sat looking at in consternation at uncharitable remark be not cried never knew be wicked old man pa gave antediluvian chuckle sounded like magical appalling rattle from inner recess of person be getting brighter brighter a star appear to do when darkness deepens see proceeded did alf say there be noos admitted uncertainty furtively looked at suspecting time memory have betrayed in ancient way continuing to trust to magic well did seem to think much of what did bring will tell bit of news pa be that have got pair of rummiest daughter ever struck pa looked out from beneath bushy grey eyebrow resembling worn dilapidated perversion of whistler portrait of carlyle eyelid seemed to work a brooded upon announcement be a though together two explored blanchard archive for confirmation of jenny sweeping statement blanchards of several generation might have be imagined a flitting across fantastic horizon keening for withered laurel thrown into shade by more brighter eccentric be might have be fascinating speculation pa did not indulge antique vein for very long moment concrete image beguiled back to daughter before daughter who be engaged in unexpected emotional treat said know gave wide grin showed gap in teeth a nothing else must have done not even profoundest yawn jenny be stunned by evidence of brightness in parent well be caution cried to think of sitting there saying reckon have got pretty rummy old pa if truth be only known pa grin if possible stretched wider again that terrible chuckle suggested derangement of internal part running down of overwound clock wheezed across startled air maybe pa said with unpardonable complacency maybe bless soul exclaimed jenny must not be sure when manner returned to one of vacancy when kitchen be silent whether pa have really talked thus whether have dreamed talk to dying day be never sure for pa certainly added nothing to conversation thereafter be real have too excited brain played trick jenny pinched be like fairy tale in cat talk little bird humanly sing tiniest of fairy appear from behind clock from within flower pot looked at pa with fresh awe there be knowing where have have interest for of one returned by miracle from other region gifted with preposterous knowledge became at instant fabulous like rip van winkle sleeping beauty white cat in perplexity jenny fell once more into kind of dream argumentative dream went back over earlier row re living exaggerating unconsciously noble unselfishness of own act pointed effectiveness of speech until scene be transformed now appeared in other hue in other fashioning be what volatile mind be able to do with recent happening whatsoever re casting in form altogether more exquisite than crude reality chiaroscuro of experience be thus so constantly changing recomposing that apparent result of scene in fact dreamer be in retrospect always victor in heroic limelight with jenny be mood not preoccupation when have be moved excited beyond ordinary often did tend to put matter in fresh aspect more palatable to self love more picturesque in detail than actual happening be one of advantage of rapidly working brain that power of improvisation be in solitude very constant reassuring be a though such grain upon more strictly personal side be commonwealth of little cell building microbe chief microbe come like engineer to estimate damage to one amour propre to devise mean of repair then summons necessary workman who be tiny self love ancient praise habitual complacency staircase word of one think too late for use in scene with help restores that proportion without human being can not maintain self respect jenny be like british type a recorded in legend being beaten never admitted even five minute later through adroitness of special engineer handyman must be able quite seriously to demonstrate victory to herself defeat never how alf emmy shrank now before increasing skill in argument how be shattered how inept be feebleness how splendid jenny have be in act in motive in speech in performance er yes jenny said beginning to ridicule own highly coloured picture well be something like have too much sense of ridiculous to maintain for long unquestioned heroic vein a natural to own action more justly resumed consideration of scene pondering over in nakedness meaning trying to see how stupid little feeling have burst way from overcharged heart how word counted a part of mosaic of misunderstanding have be composed oh blow jenny impatiently ejaculated with sinking heart at thought of sequel sequel there be bound to be however muffled did not rest with there be emmy alf alike burning with wish to avenge upon if only must disappear just drop out altogether like man overboard at night in storm leave emmy alf to settle together own trouble must drop out nobody must without dying though might often wish to do so even then

inter action have just to go on a be doing waking up morning after event taking old place in world in instance must have somehow to smooth matter over when excitement agitation of evening be past must be terribly difficult must not yet see clear course if only emmy did live in same house if only by throwing alf over a far a concerned must at same time throw into emmy waiting arm why must everybody be sensible if only must all be sensible for hour everything must be arranged happiness must be made real for of misunderstanding be bound to come anger jealousy conflicting desire stupid suspicion jenny fidgeted in chair eyed pa with sort of vicarious hostility why even old man be complication nay be worst thing of for must drop out there be getting away from be a much permanently there a chair upon be drowsing saw a incubus then emmy being so fussy standing on dignity when 'd give soul for happiness then alf being so what be alf well alf be stupid be word for alf be stupid a stupid a stupid

afterwards when evening be over have gone off in cloud of glory must think over come solemnly to conclusion that reason for mumbling stupidity toeing heeling idiotic speechlessness set emmy on hind leg be sheer love of truth must tell lie to woman must be must pretend that jenny have chivvied into taking em that be too noble to refuse to take em to let em really see point blank that did want to take when came to pinch have be able to screw into truly noble attitude needed for such act of self sacrifice have be speechless when prompt lie added to promptitude exactitude of jenny lie must have saved situation not alf can not tell lie sneered jenny to woman george washington think yes then said secret complacency preening suggesting that possibly moment two of satisfied pity might be at point in place 'd really wanted to take jenny have taken ticket because have wanted to be in jenny company for evening not emmy there be difference if wanted cream bun got fobbed off with scone there be something in jenny be rather flattered by happy figure even excitedly giggled at comparison of emmy with scone jenny did not like scone thought stodgy have also that astounding feminine love of cream bun true man must ever acknowledge understand so emmy became scone with not too many current in jenny fluent fancy be inclined to dwell upon notion little lost sight of alf grievance in pleasure at figure have drawn mind be recalled with jerk now what be alf have wanted to take jenny right have taken emmy because have taken emmy have grievance right against whom against emmy certainly not

cried have ticket given to be not a though cost anything so what be row about ii thereafter began to think of alf have taken out several time not a many time a emmy imagined because emmy have thought about excursion great deal not only magnified multiplied nevertheless alf have taken jenny out several time to music hall once twice to picture where have sat thrilled in cushioned darkness while acrobatic human grey faced tragic creature jerked darted at top speed in out of most amazingly telescoped accident difficulty alf have paid more than once for pa said be true that jenny have paid on

what have not got hating jenny for monopolising alf hating alf have monopolising jenny then a be woman hating jenny for being more pleasing woman than having wounded jealousy moved into strong craving for alf driven deeper deeper into heart by long continued thought frustrated desire so have come to look upon a one defrauded by jenny of pleasure of happiness of love of alf rylett call love thought jenny bitterly if be love have got use for love giving not getting know that much love giving wanting to give have got be got nothing at to do with envy hating people being jealous then swift feeling of pity darted through changing thought changing shade of portrait of emmy have be etching with quick corrosive stroke of insight poor old em murmured be have rotten time know have let have alf if want want want anybody except closed eye in most fleeting vision nobody except just keith slowly jenny raised hand pressed back of wrist to lip not kissing wrist holding against lip so that be forced

kitchen again scanning address writing blue seal with minerva head still in perplexity seemed a though task be first to guess identity of sender who must have written to be unheard of think for wondering jest if only lip have be steady heart beating with normal pulsation with shrug turned back from seal to address felt that curious mistake have be made that letter be not for at for other

to left of door a lock clicked behind a went forward side light of motor blazed across vision blinding again be there softly called yes miss man deep voice came sharply out of darkness jumped down from seat to open door of car action startled jenny why have man done did know be coming suddenly asked drawing back with sort of chill yes miss said man jenny caught breath half turned away like shy horse fear friendly hand have be sure of then oh be wretched thought be shaken to heart by such confidence have be sure of there be flash of time in determined not to go passed with dreadful speed too

with hand cooled burning cheek a if have be ice slowly car nosed out of road into wider thoroughfare adventure have begun in earnest there be drawing back now chapter vi yacht to lie deep among cushion gently to ride out along street road that have so often tramped in kind of weather be enough to intoxicate jenny heard soft humming of engine saw lamp other vehicle flashing by with sense of effortless speed be to incomparable if only have be mentally at ease free from distraction must have enjoyed instant of journey even a be must not restrain eagerness a overtook tramcar chauffeur honked horn glided nearer nearer passed seemed to leave tram standing time be in process of happening jenny gave small excited chuckle thinking of speed ease of how people in tram must feel at being defeated in race such encounter became race in pressed physically forward a if to urge steed to final effort never have jenny teen so eager for victory so elated when certainty be confirmed be worth while to live for such experience how envied driver with steady hand upon steering wheel ah be like sailor like sailor of romance with wind beating upon face eye ever watchful under hand car rode splendidly to keith jenny closed eye must feel heart beating fast blood heating cheek reddening blood hurt mouth seemed to hurt too because have smiled so much lay back thinking of keith of meeting so few so long ago so indescribably happy beautiful always remembered a have be when first have caught eye when have stood so erect among other men who lounged by sea smoking lolling at ease be different a be different be going to how happy be why did breath come quickly heart sink must not bother to decide question be too excited to do so in life have never known moment of such breathless anticipation of excitement believed be happiness there be one other thought that jenny shirked went on nevertheless in spite of inattention plying moulding somewhere deep below thrilling joy thought be that must not show keith that loved because while knew felt sure that loved must not be smallest fraction of time before in confession be too proud for that must tell that loved spell must be broken shyness must be gone bravado immediately unnecessary until then must beware be a necessary to keith pride a to own that must win keith loved must not care for love too easily won consciousness of whole issue be at work below thought thought from joy dread to discomfort of doubt raced faster than car speedless headlong among be two that bitterly corroded be of pa of keith confidence that must come be a poison in mind ii then there came curious sense that something have happened car stopped in darkness through air there came in huge tone of big ben sound of striking hour be nine o'clock be back at westminster before be bridge above be lighted face of clock like faded sun stroke rolled out in swelling wave made whole atmosphere feel soundladen chauffeur have opened door of car

dinghy mind how go miss hold tight to rail closed door of car pointed to step dinghy stone step to black water jenny be shaken by shudder horror of water have come upon earlier in evening returned more intensely stroke of clock be same darkness feeling of sinister water rolling there beneath bridge resistlessly carrying burden to sea if keith have not be there must have turned run swiftly away overcome by fear timidly reached step stopped peering down through dimness put foot forward so that hung dubiously beyond edge of pavement what coward thought violently with contempt drove forward at moment must see below at edge of lapping water outline of small boat of man who sat in using oar against force of current so a to keep boat always near step heard dear familiar voice call out with perfect shout of welcome jenny good girl how be come along be careful how come be six more then stop jenny obeyed desired nothing else doubtings be driven away in breath went quickly down back water lapped wattled against stone boat saw keith stand up drawing dinghy against step offering hand have previously be holding up small lantern gilded brown mud with feeble colour made water look like oil now cried quickly step boat rocked jenny crouched down upon narrow seat aflame with rapture terrified of water be so near so inescapably near sense of smooth softness yieldingness danger lurking beneath flowing surface be acute tried more desperately to sit exactly in middle of boat so that must not overbalance closed eye sitting very still heard water saying plup plup plup round be afraid meant soft death must not forget that jenny must not swim be stricken between terror joy overwhelmed then be boat keith said pointing say be sport to come jenny saw light shining from middle of river must imagine that yacht lay there stubbornly resisting current of flowing thames iii crouching still watched bend to oar driving boat nose beyond shadowy yacht because knew that must allow for current eye devoured heart sang plup plup plup plup said water oar plashed gently jenny saw blackness gliding beside thick swift might go down down down in black nothingness nobody must know of oar ground against edge of dinghy wood against wood grumbling echoing upon water behind everything heard roaring of london be aware of light moving stationary high above how low upon water be seemed to be on level with boat edge how much alone be moving there in darkness while life of city went on so far above if boat sank jenny shivered for knew that must be drowned must imagine white face under river surface lantern flashing then nothing must be secret happening mystery work of tragic instant jenny blanchard must be forgotten for ever a if have never be be horrid sensation to a sat there so near death time that jenny be mutely enduring terror be slowly nearing yacht grew taller a approached more clearly outlined against sky moon be beginning to catch building to lighten heaven far above very pale be star sky be still murky so that river remained in darkness came alongside yacht keith shipped oar caught hold of something jenny must not see dinghy be borne round away from yacht side rose catching with hand at object projecting from yacht hastily knotting rope jenny saw short ladder hanging over side lantern shining there be keith cried up go be quite steady hold brass rail after second in knee be too weak to allow of moving jenny conquered tremor rose unsteadily in boat cast at brass rail that keith have indicated to hand have be so tightly clasped together steeling rail be startlingly cold touch of nerved because be firm felt dinghy yield a stepped from seemed for one instant to be hanging precariously in space above terrifying water then be at top of ladder ready for keith warning shout about descent to deck jumped down be aboard yacht a glanced around keith be upon deck beside catching arm jenny triumphant complacency be so great that gave tiny nervous laugh have not spoken at until moment keith have not heard voice well said jenny be over gave audible sigh of relief thank goodness here be keith cried aboard minerva iv led to door down three step then seemed

want to know when thought of moment jenny ceased to desire somehow may have be by mere exhausted cessation of feeling wished only to understand life then never to see again be kind of numbness that seized then awoke once again stirred by bright light by luxury of surroundings where sleep with passionate interest in everything concerned jenny looked eagerly about cabin now indicated broad bunk with beautifully white counterpane eiderdown quilt a might optimistically have dreamed about tiny cabin be so compact so marvellously furnished with beautiful thing that seemed to jenny kind of suite in tabloid form did not understand how have done without luxurious necessity for five twenty year sometimes keith answered having followed marvelling eye from beauty to beauty when there be company sleep forward with others have be hurrying by with cruet bread dish when exclamation checked be lord friend of yours then jenny asked sometimes keith dryly answered understand jenny frowned again at tone said keith passed on jenny stood surveying sleeping cabin whole nest of drawer attracted eye deep drawer must hold innumerable thing then saw hand basin with tap for hot cold water impulsively

fascinating towel tiny rug light above hand basin to switch on above bunk be wonderful there be looking glass before in must see own reflection a clear a day too clearly for pleasure face irresistibly

though when shut eye saw a old woman felt curious stab at heart keith returning found jenny still before mirror engaged in unsparing scrutiny laughing gently caught elbow with finger in mirror glance met at touch jenny thrilled unconsciously leaned towards from mirrored glance turned questioningly to meet upon face beaming expression of tranquil enjoyment stimulated to candid remark somehow restored of lost ease to be able to speak so look funny appealed to judgment keith bent nearer a for more detailed examination retaining hold upon elbow face be tantalisingly close to hers jenny involuntarily turned head away not coquettishly through embarrassment at mingling of desire timidity be that word asked look right dear dear knew that word meant more to than did to so carelessly be uttered sent shock through how jenny wished that might indeed be dear to keith released followed laden backwards forward until table be cleared then unscrewed table leg whole thing came gently away in hand there appeared four small brass socket imbedded in carpet deep pile centre of room be clear by same dexterous use of acquaintance with cabin mechanism keith unfastened one of settee wheeled forward so that stood under light in great comfort for time when must sit to hear story now said will have breather on deck to clear old head iii by time moon be silvering river riding high above earth serenely thing of eternal mystery to beholder with passing of cloud deepening of night star not eclipsed by moon shone like swarmed throbbing point of silver seemed more remote a though clearer air have driven farther off jenny own face throat illumined stared up at moon marvelling then turned without speaking to black shadow gliding silent water upon hand be chequer of contrast beautiful to eye haunting to spirit soft wind stirred hair made bare teeth in pleasure at sweet contact keith led to wide wooden seat ran by side of deck sat together there noise of city be dimmer lamp be yellowed in moon whiter light there be occasional movement upon face of river long way away heard sharp panting a motor boat rushed through water sending out great surging wave made other craft rise fall sway a river agitation subsided boat came nearer coloured light showing presently hastened past moving thing with muffled figure at helm minerva rocked gently almost until sound of motor boat tuff tuff have be lost in general noise of london nearer at hand above jenny must hear clanging of tram gong clatter slow boom of motor omnibus sound be mellowed by evening although be near enough to be comforting be too far away to interrupt pleasant solitude with two of sat in shadow jenny craned to hear chuckle of water against yacht side be beautiful moment in life gave little moan swayed against keith delight succeeded by deadly languor iv so for moment sat keith arm around shoulder then jenny moved so a to free be restless unhappy again nerve on edge moon water have soothed be now irritation

jenny with brain restored by gentle breeze to normal quickness of action seemed dartingly to seek in direction for reassurance found in everything single tone touch to feed insatiable greed for token of love oh be miserable indeed disappointed in dearest most secret aspiration be perhaps afraid that wanted to attach to if be so why must be honest tell so that be wanted from wanted only truth felt

reserve be merest trivial legend of kennington park be like other girl secure in complacent belief that must win love until year crept by love came must eagerly seek to accept travesty of love sidled

housewifely anxiety even amid tremor of other acute concern a alf knelt lavishly sprinkled more water upon pa face set jug ready to emmy hand working with quiet deftness aroused watchful admiration be here neither clumsy rough if method be a primitive a mean at hand gentle treatment of senseless body showed to be adaptable to emergency how loved pride gleamed in emmy eye must see in eternal handy

already open thought must see at moment quick contraction of throat additional augury be found in fact that alf simultaneously have succeeded in dribbling of brandy between pa teeth although of ran out at corner of mouth out on to cheek also be retained must help to revive alf gave quick nod time one of satisfaction feel heart emmy whispered did so can feel be right famous pa gave little groan seemed to stir emmy felt shoulder move against knee looked quickly up faint relieved smile crossing anxious face then a alf returned glance eye became fixed looked beyond up over head jenny stood in doorway fully dressed without hat coat face blanched at picture before ii to jenny coming with precautionary quietness into house sight came a greatest shock found kitchen door ajar heard voice then burst upon three feebly illumined figure emmy still in out of door coat knelt beside alf upon floor between with face terribly grey lay pa still in old red nightshirt with one of bare foot showing stained shirt upon mark of water looking in light perfectly black might have be of blood filled jenny with horror be only when saw emmy alf staring mutely at that struggled against deadly faintness be thickening veil of darkness before eye be dreadful moment hullo jen alf said look here thought must be in bed emmy murmured be awful not suspicion heart felt a if somebody have sharply pinched did not know have be out made tremble in sudden flurry of excited relief quickly came forward bending over pa into cheek there have come faintest wash of colour eyelid fluttered jenny stooped took hand quite mechanically pressing between hers against heart at moment pa eye opened wide stared up at with alf at side emmy behind supporting head upon lap pa must see only jenny twitching grin fled across face grin of loving recognition be succeeded by sign of recovery peculiar fumbling suggestion of remembered cunning jenny dearie whispered pa gaspingly good boy eye closed again emmy looked in quick challenge at alf a if to say see how be come in last be luck that must see always same jenny be saying very low look to a if 'd be bad boy ca be with time emmy put in having reached point of general self defence in course of mental exploration be recovering from shock first horrible fear will get to bed carry back in there jenny asked floor soaking wet have not to receive rebuke although shaken be reviving in happiness in graciousness with second diminution of dread now agreed to pa removal stumbled into bedroom laid upon own bed alf went quickly back again to kitchen for brandy presently good dose of be sending thrilling reviving fire through pa person emmy have busied in making bandage for wounded head jenny have arranged more comfortably drying chest laying little towel between body night short lest must take cold pa be very complacently aware of ministration by time be in full order completed be fast asleep having expressed sort of contrition for naughtiness for alarm have given reassured party returned to kitchen iii alf must not now wait to sit down to supper drank glass of beer after getting down for rather humorously illustrating how pa design must have be frustrated then with quick handshake with jenny hurried away will let out emmy said there be quick exchanged glance jenny be left alone in kitchen for two three minute until emmy returned humming little self consciously no longer pale quite commotion said emmy with assumed ease jenny be looking at jenny heart felt a though be bursting have never in life known sensation of guilt guilt at suppression of

with thought of happy life before described in detail event of theatre walk did not give exactly true story be not to be expected that must do so jenny did not expect gave indication of happiness be main object gave further indication le intentional of character a author can avoid doing jenny immediately discounting in light of own temperament re shaping re proportioning form of emmy narrative be like eternal critic apprehending only what must personally recognise took pleasure in tale saw forward into future very satisfactory ending to emmy romance got back just a twelve be striking emmy concluded deep flush overspread jenny face turned away quickly in order that might not be seen emmy still continued busy with thought occurred to to be surprised that jenny must be fully dressed surprise pressed further onward with narrative then of course found pa be strange of to do must have be there long must have waited for to go up must have listened must find place to keep though be never done thing before in life must have listened for going up then come creeping out here why there be candle on floor fancy might have set fire to whole house see must have be upstairs long thought

way jenny answered in fine glow go mine emmy looked at shaking head in kind of narrow wisdom not if sends chauffeur said slowly not that sort of man v for moment jenny heart burned with indignation then turned cold if emmy be right supposing just supposing savagely thrust doubt of keith from trust in be forced by dread into still warmer louder proclamation understand cried must have never seen wait minute went quickly out of kitchen up to bedroom there secretly kept from eye be little photograph of keith brought down in anxious triumph showed to emmy emmy three year seniority have never be of so much account there jenny said that be keith look at emmy held photograph under meagre light be astonished although kept outwardly calm because keith besides being obviously what be called gentleman looked honest candid must not find fault with face be very good looking admitted in critical tone very not sort of man thought emphasised jenny keenly elated at emmy dilemma be have got money never asked think have be chauffeur lord there know lord oh jenny emmy tone be still one of warning wo marry be sure wo yes will jenny said confidently excitement have shaken be not firm jenny of custom looked imploringly at emmy say believe begged emmy returned urgent gaze felt jenny arm round two face be very close 'd have done same jenny urged something in tone awakened suspicion in emmy mind tried to see what lay behind glowing mystery be so close to hers own eye be shining a if from inner brightness sister so unlike so inexpressibly contrary in phase of outlook in small detail of history have in common that in own manner with consequence drawn from difference of character aim have spent happy hour with man loved what be to follow remained undetermined emmy heart be warmed with happiness be for first time filled only with impulse of kindness love for jenny must blame more for jenny desertion be just enough since consequence of desertion have be remedied to enhance emmy sense of own superiority there remained only journey taken by jenny again took from sister hand little photograph alf face seemed to come between photograph careful poring scrutiny more jealous scrutiny of mother than of sister be rather thin emmy ventured dubiously what colour be eye blue hair brown be lovely look nice emmy said relenting be nice em dear say 'd have done same emmy gave jenny great hug kissing a if jenny have be little girl to emmy moment be without alloy own future assured else fell into orderly picture made up view of life be not quite calm even surprised to feel so much warmth of love for jenny still holding sister be conscious of quick impulse be exulting pathetically shy be funny being happy at once be whispered sparkling vi to herself jenny groaned sufficient retort know that be feeling so tremendously happy own self thought for reaction have set in be glad enough to bring about by various movement long delayed bedward journey be beginning to feel that head heart be aching that more confidence from emmy must be unbearable where emmy have grown communicative since emmy have nothing to conceal jenny have felt more more that happiness be staled a thought corroded by time turned out kitchen gas clock pointed to twenty minute past two darkest hour be already recorded in three more hour sun must rise jenny knew long before then must see sky greying a though successive veil of transformation be to reveal crystal grotto preceded up stair carrying candle lighting way at top of staircase emmy must find own candle must part be now equally eager for separation emmy because wanted to think over over again detail of happiness to make plan for kind of life be to open afresh in day lay ahead arrived at landing sister did not pause kiss looked smiled seriously a entered bedroom with closing of door noise seemed to depart from little house though jenny heard emmy moving in room house be in darkness emmy be gone pa lay asleep in dim light head bandaged water slowly soaking into towel protectively laid upon chest in kitchen ailing clock ticked away night everything seemed at peace jenny who when have closed door set candle down went quickly to bed sitting upon edge looking straight before with dark sober eye have much to think of must never forgive now for leaving pa might have be more serious accident have happened during absence must even plead to emmy that accident might have happened if have not left house at nothing quick brain must urge have really satisfied jenny stark fact remained that have be there under promise to tend pa that have failed in acknowledged trust might have died if have died must have be to blame not pa must help be driven by inner necessity to do thing must not be allowed to do jenny might have pleaded same justification have done so before have be necessity to to go to keith a far a went did not question paramount power of impulse not will strongest craving have led jenny must perhaps hardly discourse learnedly upon such thing must follow dictate of nature never accused pa of responsibility be irresponsible have be left to look after have not stayed ill have befallen bitter smile curved jenny lip suppose 'd say be punishment whispered 'd like to think be after that stayed long time silent swaying gently while candle flickered head full of kind of formless musing then rose from bed took candle so that must see face in small mirror upon dressing table candle flickered still more in draught from open window jenny saw breath hang like cloud before in mirror face looked deadly pale lip be slightly drawn a if be about to cry dark shadow be upon face whether real work of feeble light did not think to question be looking straight at own eye black with dilation of pupil somehow struck with horror be deepest emotion jenny be speaking to girl in glass must have thought of be saying come out of respectable home do thing like silly little fool be silly little fool because ca stand not loving go do for moment stopped turning away lip bitten eye veiled oh doe love breathed quite a much quite a much nearly nearly a much sighed deeply standing lone in centre of room long thin shadow thrown upon wall in front of to leave pa be thinking shaking head be wrong when 'd promised will always know be wrong will never be able to forget a long a live not a long a live if have gone 'd never have seen keith again never 'd have gone off heart must have broken must have got older older hated everybody hated pa most likely now just hate oh be so difficult moved impatiently at last went back to mirror not to look into to remove candle to blow out to leave room in darkness done jenny drew up blind so that must see outline of roof opposite seemed to that for long distance there be sound at only there time far behind house somewhere buried in heart of london there be same unintermittent low growl be always in ear even at night like sleepless pulse beating steadily through silence jenny be not happy heart be cold continued to look from window face full of gravity be hearing again keith voice a planned future be not sanguine now seemed too far away so much have happened so much have happened that seemed a though must never be realised never be part of memory at so blank sheer did now stand pressing upon like overwhelming darkness thought again of bridge striking hour knock letter hurried ride remembered supper argument with argument with alf fleeting mood so many so painful during time with keith to love to be loved be sole commandment of life how learned knew not to love to work knew be theory of emmy how different be how altogether unlike emmy with alf jenny with keith yes be got what want jenny whispered in darkness be what want must do for only in world have got to have one pattern whether suit not else be not 'right ' like be outside be misfit eh well be good whimpering about what must be must a say soberly moved from window began to undress in darkness stopping now then a if be listening to low humming far beyond house when thought of unresting life made heart beat more quickly away there upon black running current of river be keith on tiny yacht so open upon treacherous sea to kind of danger nothing between keith sudden horrible death wooden hulk own seamanship be keith belonged to did not belong to to keith might must give a have done must still be apart from might give love care knew that pride love must be love pride to submit not keith away from released from spell jenny knew that have yielded to freedom so cherished a inalienable right have given freedom be in power for real freedom be innocence desire to do right be not that wanted to defy so much a must bear shackle that have respect for belief that thing must be done only because be always done for other reason that of tradition feared nothing own merciless judgment be not now that dreaded emmy powerlessness to forgive opinion of anybody else in world be that must not forgive who be strong enough to live alone in world so long a be young vigorous have rare faculty of self judgment be only when be exhausted that turn elsewhere for judgment pardon jenny sat once again upon bed oh keith dearest began keith thought flew swiftly to yacht to keith with unforgettable pain heard voice ringing in ear saw clear eye a honest a day looking straight into own pain mingled with love pride battled there within heart making fine tumult of sensation jenny felt smiling in darkness at conflict even began very softly to laugh a if sound checked awoke secret sadness that tumultuous sensation be trying to hide courage suddenly gave way keith gently called voice barely audible only silence be there keith be far away unreachable jenny pressed hand to lip be trembling uncontrollably rose struggling for composure struggling to get back to old way of looking at everything seemed imperative that must do so in forlorn quivering voice ventured what life golly what life effort to pretend that must still make fun of event of evening be too great for jenny threw upon bed burying face in pillow keith oh keith end
