tumbridge be going to suit said mr preemby hope will little daddy good night christina alberta first evening at petunia boarding house have be described with particularity because be sample of still uneventful evening seemed to lie before mr preemby there impressed a unfathomable enormity of uneventfulness in nothing harmful disturbing must conceivably occur to last remote possibility of

possibly illegal cigarette in lounge indeed smoked two miss margaret rewster looked at through bead curtain near office miss emily have sniff from landing upstairs though nothing be said then mr preemby followed major bone into smoking room to gather further information must about temple decoration religious custom of people of further india be inclined to think major bone rather biased by evangelical prejudice major bone be not even indignant about eastern religion night wanted to talk about bath talked about bath told mr preemby in very great detail about remarkable occurrence at bath have met gentleman named bone gentleman much of own age appearance captain bone who have also once be in burmah detailed various extremely dramatic conversation between other bone occasionally going back correcting have made most elaborate comparison of genealogy did not appear that be even remotely related most curious coincidence have ever occurred to said major bone in bath in nineteen eh nine

be cambridge undergraduate geologist have bag of specimen on machine fact conveyed across width of room to mr preemby in course of rather one sided conversation from first christina alberta did not like young gentleman from cambridge be like younger cruder teddy winterton with impudent bad manner instead of impudent good manner with bodily grace good look while spoke to mr preemby glanced at have inkling of part might play in life of daddy when daddy went into lounge for coffee cigarette young man came placed at adjacent table initiated more conversation be tunbridge well amusing place be there chance of getting golf tennis there be number of delightful walk said mr preemby not much fun alone said young man there be pleasure of observation said mr preemby country have be pretty well worked over said young man of science be there museum here mr preemby did not know there ought to be museum in town presently coffee cigarette be finished evening mr preemby be for drawing room major bone have gone smoking room have attraction mr preemby have exchanged few amiable word with gentleman with whisker hoped to follow up christina alberta went with at sight of old tatlers sketch remembered have bought book in high street that day second hand copy of rousseau confession went off to get found young gentleman from cambridge still sitting in lounge smoking cigarette pretty gloomy here said oh dont know said christina alberta with open mind pausing before nothing much doing what not gala night im stranded must bear up spose wouldnt be disposed to come out for bit forage around for fun said young man from cambridge taking courage in hand sorry said christina alberta conclusively turned to go on offence said young man from cambridge nice of to think of said christina alberta who must rather have be thought utterly shameless than least bit prudish good hunting young man from cambridge perceived that be dismissed christina alberta went into drawing room for tremendous bout of nothingness anyhow have got rousseau to read to morrow must be in london about rousseau have always wanted to know how stood towards rousseau carried on to ten oclock didnt think much of rousseau ought to have known few of new hope club girl theyd have shown for three week christina alberta did not return to tunbridge well when returned have passed through variety of experience will have due effect upon course of story story be story of mr preemby have little sympathy with modern sort of novel will not let girl alone must follow up into most private intimate affair christina alberta be perplexed worried must have hated pursuit of such searchlight suffice that event have crowded so closely upon that for whole day together thought scarcely at of possibly quite lonely little daddy at tunbridge well then came letter brought bustling down think only right to tell said letter very important communication indeed have be made to of utmost importance ought to tell about seem to alter life know be immearced in study communication be so important that want to talk over with soon must come up to studio to tell about very likely mr crumb might be in must much prefer to tell here on common amid more congenial surroundings of will find almost unbeleavable communication said christina alberta re reading letter communication went down to tunbridge well afternoon chapter fifth scale fall from mr preembys eye scale said mr preemby have fallen from eye have chosen seat upon common commanded extensive view of town town crowned by green cupola of opera house lying a though house have be shot out of cart down long incline to pantile beyond be wide distance of kentish hill country blue remote christina alberta waited for more experience said mr preemby speaking with occasional hrrmp experience difficult to relate naturally think be of sceptical disposition taking after dear mother be very sceptical of psychic phenomenon in particular said be nonsense when dear mother said thing be nonsense then be nonsense only made thing disagreeable if argued be anything else a for always open mind dogma way just refrained daddy have be having psychic experience how must have psychic experience down here let tell story in due order want to see a saw in due order how did begin mr preemby held up propitiatory hand please in own way said christina alberta bit lip scrutinized tranquil resolution of profile there be hurrying have to tell tale a have prepared think said mr preemby that mine be very credulous sort of mind be true be not given to argument say very much think observe think observe have kind of gift for judging people think be very easy man to deceive be to be noted that started whole affair began at suggestion know what put into head do know that be started whole thing going know after departure little band at petunia boarding house be reduced to just six person not counting young gentleman from cambridge who be a miss rewster say bird of passage naturally six of felt rather drawn together there be two miss solbs very intelligent young lady there be mr hockleby mr hockleby miss hockleby there be be drawn together at lunch after have gone off be little showery have fire in drawing room miss solb one with glass tried to show one of patience got into quite interesting argument about whether be possible to will card must turn up next have always inclined to view that for certain people people with necessary gift be possible to do so mr hockleby showed extremely sceptical in matter said that if there be card on top of pack ready to turn up if one willed that different card must turn up then that meant that one have really by sheer will force to re manufacture two of card in pack make over again into other make blank reprint everything tried to explain to that be not philosophically sound because of predestination if be predestined to will that card must be on top of pack then card be also predestined to be there argued be necessary to tell daddy before get to psychic experience be just to illustrate fact that mr hockleby be extremely sceptical person be that young man from cambridge present at discussion oh be not have probably gone down to garage to see if spare part have come be always going down to garage to see about spare part mr preemby hrrmped began new section of narrative be in evening after dinner said that thing really began went into smoking room to smoke afterwards went into drawing room when went into drawing room have more thought of occult phenomenon christina alberta than have of flying over moon a came into drawing room saw miss solb looking at patience card have just put out way be holding hand on table reminded of way have read that people put hand together on table when be trying experiment in table turning almost without thinking said why miss solb way be holding hand be just way do when be going to do table turning said just like mr hockleby be reading paper at time time think may have be morning post put down when heard say that looked over glass at said dont believe in sort of thing mr preemby surely wife be sitting with back to from way spoke think must have be eating sort of sweet lozenge at time do said did at home dozen of time before be married dont know what put into head christina alberta seemed almost a though be something behind did may have be sort of antagonism have always felt about man hockleby anyhow said id really like to try of table turning younger miss solb shes really quite charming young lady when get to know seems have be reading little occult literature lately how old be daddy asked christina alberta regarding with look of novel suspicion dont think can be very much more than thirty two three thirty four at outside really quite well read quite well read well anyhow said must like to try miss hockleby evidently have be brought up on strictly sceptical line by father be curious too so to cut long story short tried only mr hockleby objected mr hockleby overruled that be only one among who have ever seen anything of sort before so be who arranged thing told what to do chose very solid table one usually have big aspidistra on while be turning out light why did do daddy one always doe that said mr preemby make atmosphere more favourable lit candle miss margaret rewster got for turned out electric light while be doing in came young mr charles fenton said what did say peculiar expression ah yes gollys said whats up be that young man with motor bicycle yes young man from cambridge explained what be doing asked to join declared knew nothing of psychic phenomenon have never experimented with at seemed very doubtful about taking part in trial dont think there anything in said will just waste time indeed remember now that did go out intending to visit music hall then came back said be raining very important to note that be not at all eager to join that be quite uninformed about occult thing because see a will tell found out presently that be person of exceptional psychic gift much greater psychic gift than anyone else among well arranged about table in usual manner thumb little finger touching for time nothing seemed to happen at found emily rewster be peeping in through slightly open door perhaps may have have unfavourable influence suppose wondered what be doing why have asked sister for candle then mr fenton got very restive grumbled to said be silliest way of passing evening have ever tried be little difficult to persuade to keep silence persevere right said with kind of resentment have own way then suddenly came two violent rap rap like little pistol shot not immediately under table be a if be in air foot so under table then table began to move slowly at first shifting along floor then quite strongly twisting pushing up against hand be very weird impressive christina alberta very weird impressive indeed rose nearly two foot must think then mr hockleby broke circle fell rather heavily fancy leg hit shin uttered exclamation stooped to rub leg in indistinct light hit head on edge of table seemed almost judgment on scepticism thought turned up one two of light to attend to dont like said mr fenton be bit too rum for asked to try just once more dont like table riding up like said such bad example for chair suppose of start playing cup ball with might get nasty toss from buck jumping chair besides lot too like channel crossing for taste think be good deal excited by what have happened others even mr hockleby be eager to continue next time will press down said think be little suspicious that wife have something to do with phenomenon evidently spiritualism be long standing dispute between wife wife said have seen table move before none so actively a one have done down sat again have hardly waited minute before table began rocking about in most extraordinary fashion then absolutely flew up so violently that elder miss solb be thrown back over ottoman there be there be bumped under chin at same time there be perfect volley of crack like somebody cracking finger ever so much louder be quite comfort to have light up again see mr hockleby holding table down firmly in proper place damn said quite loudly damn keep down miss hockleby father picked up miss solb who be on floor in sort of hysterical fit of laughter with foot waving about dont like said mr fenton go through one like electric shock spoke quite simply only one of who have have experience with occult phenomenon be mr hockleby have not done anything of sort since marriage to mr hockleby five six year before because of scepticism said now that be very evident that very strong resolute spirit be present be trying to communicate with explained simple safe method of getting into communication be to reform circle round table be to call over alphabet when came to letter spirit wanted there must be rap so must be able to arrive at something definite there be sort of code quite well understood seems in spirit world in convey by one rap yes by two so on set to work at said mr preemby asked if spirit must like to spell out anything answered with two very loud rap then mr hockleby read out letter b c so on when got to s spirit gave rap so loud made jump what did spell out daddy name quite unknown to then sargon then king of king asked be spirit be communicating with sargon answer came be sargon present yes then who be communicant oujah who be oujah wise man be very slow process spelling out word in way by time have got so far be very tired mr fenton in particular be very tired yawned seemed greatly exhausted said at last felt so weary muzzy that must go to bed be really very natural because though none of realized at time be actual medium under oujahs control went to bed tried to go on without magic have departed must not get so much a rap so sat for time talking over mr hockleby in particular be greatly flabbergasted then rest of went to bed evidently mr fenton made rap said christina alberta evidently presence be necessary for rap to be made corrected mr preemby quite unconsciously be mejum there be pause go on with story said christina alberta next evening be wet again a spare part hadnt come mr fenton be able to join once more made little objection at first because said people be particular baptist be doubtful whether sort of thing be not necromancy forbidden in bible persuaded out of time spelt out quite singular message be awake sargon arise be forever fallen even from first have have feeling that message from sargon have something to do with now suddenly conviction came upon asked be sargon present yes knew must be so be anyone in circle yes be gentleman pointing to mr very loud be yes mr hockleby noted at time looked annoyed a though felt be who ought to be sargon then young mr fenton stood up suddenly oh cant stand more of said head feel quite muzzy im sure sort of thing be harmful walked across room sat down suddenly with hand hanging over arm of chair be one of big arm chair covered in cretonne felt very much concerned a for myself be in daze at thought of being sargon being called upon so openly to rouse to action did not understand fully a yet that meant to did realize that meant very great deal what did think meant said christina alberta sharply perplexed gaze searched profile blue eye stared at thing far away beyond distant hill strange thing fantastic empire secret city mystical tradition brow be knit in effort to keep story together in good time said mr preemby let tell story in own way be telling think that young mr fenton said felt heavy strange mr hockleby happily be quite equal to situation have seen same thing before dont struggle against said let go just lean back in chair if want to lie quiet do if want to say anything do let influence work turned to whispered trance what be trance said mr fenton just like what be trance began moving hand in front of face making pass think call shut eye gave sort of sigh head lolled back sat round waiting presently began to mutter at first be just nonsense oojah woojer boojer word like then more distinctly oujah wise man sargons servant oujah come to serve sargon to awaken after that seemed to wander off into sheer rubbish why be mouse when spin whispered in own voice then damned spare part mr hockleby said be quite characteristic of sort of trance then mr hockleby got writing pad pencil to take down anything more be said presently when mr fenton spoke again did not speak in own voice in kind of hoarse whisper quite different from usual voice be voice of oujah speaking oujah control with slight accent sumerian suppose well thing said be very astonishing indeed think that oujah be anxious to secure attention by convincing that knew of thing intimate thing nobody else must know at same time did not wish others to know too clearly what be aiming at how did go what can remember mr hockleby have lot of written down so far have not have time to make copy child of sea desert said blue water desert sand be too fanciful to find allusion to sheringham in cascade great water thing like wheel on blue shield be more puzzling cascade great water set thinking of big washer remember swastika on blue delivery van christina alberta be not that oddly suggestive of thing like wheel on blue shield norse people called swastika fire wheel army with white garment fluttering long line drawn out army of delivery that again be queer one be reminded of army also dont think absurd of drying ground van be like one thing becoming transparent seeing other behind be sure of exact phrase daddy mr hockleby have written down if have not got quite right will be able to read note swastika may be coincidence said christina alberta may have be drawing on edge of newspaper do sometimes may have seen doe not account for blue ground laid great stress on blue ground there be other thing matter known only to dear mother must not tell without telling everything small thing entirely private to name of late grandfather at dis munday name be be sometimes difficult to argue about thing although one may be absolutely convinced be mixed up with broken sentence about great city two daughter of western king wise man also called belshazzar belshazzar seemed to drift in out of thought come again to world have fallen into disorder be remarkable word then beware of woman take sceptre out of hand of king do know how to rule ask tutankhamen ask ruin in desert pah said christina alberta a though woman have ever have fair chance well anyhow mr hockleby have that written down seemed to that too applied to for because of great fondness for mother have let so many year of life slip away said many other thing christina alberta richly suggestive thing have told enough for to understand what have happened in end mr fenton came to quite suddenly much more suddenly than be usual in such case mr hockleby said sat up yawned rubbed eye oh lord said what nonsense be im going to bed asked if felt exhausted said be absolutely fed up be actual word asked if be end of message what message said have absolutely memory of communication at have be talking asked isnt sort of thing one ought to get up to what sort of thing have be saying nothing objectionable hope if so apologize mustnt do more of sort of thing mr hockleby told have never met anyone with promise of great psychic power a have before said be really very sorry to hear said owed to to cultivate so rare strange gift said that wouldnt do for people at rain have stopped said thought must take walk down to pantile back before turning in perfectly simple natural be from first to last rather unwilling really did look tired out didnt laugh once asked christina alberta why must seemed little afraid of what have transmitted next day spare part came mr hockleby did utmost to try to get once more in afternoon develop communication must not do so be full of question about ferry at tilbury time of high tide must not even give name address when spoke of sending mr hocklebys note to occult review be suddenly quite alarmed said that if name appeared in connection with might mean very serious row with family must not even allow to put mr f from cambridge put quite name said quite different name put anything like doe not point to mr walker say from london something of sort of course there be nothing for to do agree be whole of communication daddy be only beginning because after began to remember began to remember more more remember thing from other life memory stored up young mr fenton be so to speak more than first cut in curtain of forgetfulness that hung between present life previous existence now be rent torn open so must see thing through at dozen point now begin to realize what really be what can really be know christina alberta have never actually believed be not even a schoolboy now be interesting know understand clearly be somebody else have always be somebody else who do believe be daddy so far a can gather be first chief called porg in city called kleb in very beginning of world ons ons ago tamed people taught many thing then afterwards be sargon sargon king of king there be very little about here in public library in encyclopdia britannica upstart who took name name three thousand year later assyrian fellow be sargon tell about got mixed up with jew besieged samaria be original sargon long before there be jew anything of sort long before abraham isaac jacob afterwards be belshazzar last crown prince of babylonian be not very clear that remains obscure only one part of record be lit a yet possibly have be other people figure stand out in memory now be sargon be memory have be returning to be who have returned in daddy dont really believe believe know long before communication came to have have intimation assurance be somebody else now see clearly can remember day in akkadia now just a clearly a can remember day in woodford well must almost doubt whether have ever lived at woodford well seems so far away now be when be in bed night after mr fenton have gone that memory began to come be in bed then suddenly be not in bed be reclining on couch under canopy canopy of pure white wool very finely woven embroidered with emblem symbol suchlike thing in golden thread be upon state barge upon euphrates two king daughter sister with slender neck not unlike two miss solbs except that be fairer decidedly younger much younger clad rather more in accordance with requirement of warm climate chiefly in woven gold sat fanned with fan of eagle feather dyed royal purple at foot sat councillor prewm who be oddly enough extremely like mr hockleby just same iron grey whisker with same little tuft of hair over ear be wearing extremely tall cap of black woollen substance be making memoranda with wooden style on tablet of wet clay be like writing on mud pie beyond be officer of boat on kind of bridge be

existence crowd upon now be deception of imagination can go right back a if be yesterday be surer by far that be sargon than be albert edward preemby father former be true self latter be just very simple unpretending wrapping for purpose at present inexplicable to have hidden from world waved hand with bolder gesture than be habitual to sat with eye wide open looking at unseen thing girl regarded for second in silence be trying to grasp full import of amazing speech be communication said at last have to know said have to serve help help how must help how far be thing going what be to do have told anyone else of daddy asked abruptly have told anyone else turned solemn little face towards ah there said have to be very discreet careful very careful indeed here now be not time to proclaim that sargon king of king have come back to civilization did so much to found one have to be careful christina alberta there be spirit of opposition for instance have told something of first vision dream may call if like to mr hockleby described resemblance between prewm be by mean pleased be seditious insubordinate nature besides since then have recalled what happened on advice of oujah to prewm have realized since then that though one may be convinced oneself doe not follow one will convince other people be true that miss hockleby two miss solbs have asked to tell more of dream too

then mr preemby be almost forgotten there be moment there be phase when became aware of cold undertow of conviction that be after just mr preemby mr preemby formerly of limpid stream laundry making believe carrying off perhaps presently failing to carry off chill flow of doubt must even oblige to reason with force into definite reassurance of must debate whole question candidly fairly surely there be deception must have be deception about sance told thing one must have known must repeat pin faith to that knew that christina alberta have not really believed be just because of revealing scepticism that have fled from have asked question tearing rending question have said um be not proper to say um to world emperor if presently fasted went into trance felt sure that must come stand

saw thought of obstructing flash into being die wont stay have something said before go back eat here cried got to door hand trembled so that be difficult to turn handle stood motionless staring at with lower lip dropping expression of doubt upon face be a if be not quite sure of of course meant to pursue course wanted to pursue be appallingly plain walked with dignity out of open front door down garden path did not look back knew face came up close to window watched never in whole life have panic come so near to must have liked to run after train have started felt little safer how devil

mind like thorn have gone right home must not get out again have always knew be different have always have style of own most of people have met in world have impressed a being colourless weak in speech action evasive be word evasive evaded use of sort of blunt word didnt know why christina alberta be for saying damn gut so forth until one convinced her of better reason for avoiding than merely that werent used by nice people others be always not saying thing because werent said not doing thing because werent done for what be said what be done however manifestly preposterous be have sort of terrified imitativeness just ran about being a far a possible somebody else until died why exist at then why not get out of leave one else in possession anyhow got through life didnt get into trouble supported one on other hand if didnt evade puzzled other people left track be like train leaving rail trying to take cross country short cut hit against everything be evasive life have always despised really sane life be ceasing to evade ceasing to be sane sheep have read have disease called gid then wandered alone died be originality thinking for oneself not going with crowd so forth have be pride glory just way out from sane life originality eccentricity queerness craziness madness be that merely quantitative scale be not daddy queerness after year of extremest evasion have at last tried to break away to something real strange have after fashion be attempting anything else be too lop sided lop sided in different direction perhaps lop sided none le inherited lop sidedness mind went off at tangent on question whether have really inherited anything from daddy be queerness sort of queerness at ought to be seeing that be father daughter how different be for father daughter how amazingly different be be father daughter much repressed fantasy came back to fantasy based on flimsiest foundation on chance phrase mother have used on moment of intuition once twice reverie have arisen out of lurking particle of memory have taken by surprise only to be thrust aside again with contempt blup blup blup there came familiar variation to familiar sound of train christina alberta be running into liverpool street station perplexity be unsolved old fantasy lost heart faded away what be good of such dream there be christina alberta meeting next day with wilfred devizes turned out to be much more exciting affair than have expected to be acting on advice of paul lambone have brought photograph letter so in daddy handwriting with have thought out what judged must be significant thing to tell about went in taxi with paul lambone to devizes house just off cavendish square be shown up at once past waiting room consulting room to dignified little sitting room with open fire table with tea thing great array of bookcase devizes came in to forthwith be little shocked to think that lank dark shock headed man must be recognizably like be younger than have expected to be younger thought than daddy mr lambone wore long unbuttoned morning coat carried nose right be indeed very good looking hullo paul said cheerfully be young lady whose father be stolen well have tea miss miss preemby said paul lambone one call christina alberta devizes turned eye be by habit disposition scrutinizing eye upon betrayed faint momentary surprise came shook hand tell about said dont think he really mad only rather exceptional odd thats isnt lambone tell be sane quite possible id better go over state of mind first then can discus question of asylum afterwards gather want to get under own care outside isnt by mean simple well have to study obstacle meanwhile tea ive be disentangling delusion of perfectly terrible old lady im rather deflated just tell about in own way tell said paul settling shoulder into arm chair preparing to interrupt christina alberta began to unfold premeditated discourse now then devizes must interrupt with question kept eye on seemed to even from beginning that betrayed something more than attention to what be saying looked at a though have seen before couldnt quite remember where described daddy talk to when be girl about pyramid lost atlantis so forth odd spirit of release renewed growth have followed death of mother told of spiritualistic sance coming of sargon devizes be very keen on various aspect of sargon story be odd that suggestion fell in so aptly with preembys mental disposition what be young man up to dont quite understand dont know think just hit by chance on stuff talked be just bad luck that fitted undergraduate idea of fun undergraduate fun might have be ka man happened to be sargon may have be reading ancient history didnt suppose know anything about father couldnt have done suppose thought daddy looked little small absurd suppose appealed to sense of humour to single out from others make great king id like to have few minute straight talk with young man see isnt delusion devizes deception said paul lambone be generally coherent asked devizes granted thesis he amazingly coherent said doesnt sometimes become one else god millionaire anything of sort belief in reincarnation hint at having lived other life thats thousand of people do said lambone nobody be persecuting nobody make noise to trouble get at with x ray anything of sort not shadow of sort of thing man sane unless went mad when walked out of friend studio im for sanity right out said lambone wish id have chance to talk to there something everybodys chattering now about inferiority complex well isnt common for people who have be rather put upon deceived so forth who dont want to face fact of life to take refuge in assumed personality putting revery spiritualist sance so forth together doesnt work out on line know be really au fond preemby devizes asked annoyed to tell so said christina alberta think one reason why went away be because friend mr crumb be at studio where live must try to make be sensible about that drove away know be really preemby hate know be make believe paul lambone took up discourse do so sympathize with so far from that being insane perfectly rational becoming somebody else greater than be part of religion of world mithraist used to become serapists if remember rightly used to become osiris want to be born again really one with sense humility doe into something greater who will deliver from body of death thats why christina alberta daddy be so tremendously interesting he got imagination he got originality may be feeble little chap have that having exceptional mind isnt insanity said devizes else must put poet artist in asylum few must come up to standard said lambone wish did devizes reflected think ive got thing clear he coherent he neat in dress isnt persecuted he unselfish in thought almost romantically so he not fattish lumpish he never have sort of fit there insane type properly qualified doctor must class under then most doctor be altogether unqualified for mental practice stupid doctor might mistake imagination for splendour of paranoia take abstraction in reverie for dementia prcox think be masked epileptic be case of mental disease father be probably not diseased at he mentally disturbed thats difference between real lunatic be difference between basketful of fruit thats be overturned basketful thats gone rotten overturned fruit get bruised rot very easily being overturned isnt being rotten what sort of man be to look at shes got photograph said lambone id like to see said be given recent one of mr preemby a laundryman too much moustache by long way said be there anything with at least of face uncovered there nothing here eye thought youd feel that said lambone there one of mr preemby a young man taken soon after wedding with mr preemby have got christina alberta here be thats mr preemby in chair moustache in bulk have yet to come married young devizes asked christina alberta must have done said dont know exact age mother never told devizes scrutinized photograph queer said seemed to be searching memory something familiar ive met people like be london people suppose said looking hard at christina alberta woodford well said christina alberta father be born at sheringham added a afterthought sheringham thats queer with manifestly deepened interest looked at couple posed against one of rustic background dear to victorian photographer chrissy repeated to chrissy christina alberta cant be for moment dr devizes ceased to attend to consultant remained intently observing tried to fix attention on young man face in picture be young woman who sat on rustic style absorbed interest amazing how completely have forgotten face how came back now incredibly unlike yet like memory of remembered glass neck shoulder sort of stiff defiance when be mother father married asked how long ago eighteen ninety nine answered then be born straight away asked question with affectation of ease there be decent interval said christina alberta with clumsy levity be born in nineteen hundred little fair blue eyed chap with rather absent minded manner seem to see devizes said resumed examination of photograph nobody spoke for better part of minute good lord whispered lambone to devizes drank cup of tea absent mindedly extraordinary ejaculated never dreamt of what be answer went off at tangent christina alberta resemblance to mother amazing be worrying ever since came into room be distracting attention ive got little picture jumped up went out of room christina alberta puzzled excited turned instantly on lambone knew father mother said apparently said lambone with something defensive in voice apparently echoed knew knew well whats thinking of devizes reappeared holding out small gold framed picture look at that said handed to paul lambone might be christina alberta dont see how like be allowing for preposterous hair piled upon head way dress go up round neck handed picture to christina alberta looked at lambone in amazed interrogation might be in fancy dress christina alberta agreed with picture in hand there came long pause looked up saw expression of face mind gave fantastic leap so fantastic that instantly leapt back to point of departure be like flash of lightning in night a dark a pitch made great effort to pull conversation together to behave a though mind have never leapt at have to do with daddy case asked nothing directly resemblance to mother be pure coincidence pure curious coincidence just for moment pulled attention aside forgive ive belief where there resemblance of sort there blood relationship suppose mother people what did say be called hoskin did say dont remember didnt say didnt name be hossett ah yes hossett suppose that two three generation back hossetts devizes intermarried there be cousin at dont know what remove type go under in family then bob up again sort of link christina alberta doesnt give special interest dont feel now that youre just old patient rather just paul friend feel linked well thats that let come back to father who married mother just when be starting old south african war he always be dreamy unobservant type a be saying even from beginning stopped short always said christina alberta after long pause weve be into said devizes paused be for minute entirely at loss for word said at last heart be beating fast there be flush of excitement on cheek quick wit have filled in gap understood now then again vanished must have liked to have gone away thought over at once that wouldnt do must disregard question surged up within mind went forward like obstinate traveller caught in whirlwind mother for example be trying to recall something about mother have long be stifled in mind went away left to be went off left to mother lying in bed wandering who have left to what that standing perplexity suspicion that dream attend to now christina alberta attend to be observing with being yet seemed deaf to what said be saying that now that agreed with that preemby be sane must see way to real business before be old old story of making lunatic out of sane people encountered in preembys case be old old story of making lunatic out of sane people encountered in preembys case repeated sentence word for word without apparently realizing have said twice exceptional people be in danger of being misunderstood type a preemby original yet incapable of abstract expression philosophical method sought fantastic expression for feeling impulse be particularly liable to give offence awaken suspicion dread hostility be just borderland case be always trying to save from asylum just such case be always going there be last people to bring into contact with real insanity to go back to metaphor basketful of fruit isnt rotten be scarcely speckled with decay be disordered overturned mind be delicate thing to knock about will rot very easily mind like father particularly will rot very easily under asylum condition after rigmarole come to just conclusion youve already reached that have to get preemby out of cummerdown hill away under restful condition a soon a possible when well comb out particular complex get into working relation with world again im quite sure can do somehow make incognito permanent make emperor in exile restore proper name organize common daily round for get back more more to be chastened released preemby paused thats said lambone roused from profound contemplation of two interesting face before isnt easy even to get at isnt easy there will be delay careless magistrate silly doctor can make lunatic in five minute take end of time to unmake one thats what want to set about doing said christina alberta naturally said devizes im with explained one two point in lunacy law began sketching scheme of operation considered people to whom ought to write people to whom ought to write how soon must be possible to see preemby give word of encouragement already devizes have have several brush with lunacy organization be considered troublesome dangerous man for medical superintendent to be up against might arouse hostile obstruction propitiatory spirit must go carefully lambone scarcely interrupted now at have ceased to be acutely interested in preemby immured away there in cummerdown be lost in admiration of self control astonishing friend displayed tried to imagine what undertow of strange excitement of queer thought confused emotion there must be beneath highly intelligent discussion of case of mr preemby wasted very little attention upon onlooker christina alberta face be faintly flushed eye glowed devizes be rather le of conversationalist than usual rather more like university tutor with exceptionally interesting student subject be exhausted at last time came to depart devizes came to door with dont forget im always round corner so to speak said im in telephone directory dont forget christina alberta dont forget im long lost cousin very much at service wont forget said christina alberta meeting eye little pause then rather stiffly shook hand be mad said christina alberta a soon a paul lambone be in street together be dreaming lambone be clumsy mad dreaming how oh dont pretend not to understand that he real father dont pretend please dont pretend be be not lambone did not reply for moment flash at thing like lizard how must have happened then did think dear christina alberta didnt know existed until set eye on im sure of then wasnt plain knew devizes said lambone be ten year younger than be he barely forty must have be not more than eighteen nineteen at most little difficult that make easier never knew mother if be young just possible said lambone there be other explanation what cant imagine suppose be at sheringham perhaps for holiday met must have be something casual kind of accident mother used to have flash never quite understood used to suppress perhaps be suppressing at end said something someone have left to do know at time ive have fancy suspicion seemed a though guessed be guessing now know be incredible yet explains hundred thing certainly never knew of he amazed whats going to happen next legally youre preembys daughter nothing can alter that resemblance coincidence in world wont alter law in world wont alter fact turned on lambone with flushed face do realize what mean to think be daughter of certified lunatic then find be not last night be awake with unendurable thought night at age seemed night last night tried to imagine that something of sort have happened tried couldnt tried to bring back old fancy here be might have known did know wouldnt know tell about real father of mine dont know thing about be good man be bad man have wife adored wife so did be one of loveliest cleverest young woman ive ever known be strong jolly beastly influenza pneumonia got in week cut to ribbon theyd have child theyd have only four year together he attractive to woman dont think therell be second mr devizes for long time cant imagine other woman why house full of presence yes said christina alberta thought for time be detached for time in crossing bond street pavement be too crowded piccadilly be too congested for to talk again until went in st james street daddy said christina alberta seems ten thousand mile away when im over amazement of expect ill get back to all right just for time must wait youll come in for bit said lambone at corner of half moon street must give dinner thanks ill walk way to chelsea said christina alberta want to think out by want to get alone with spinning head of mine try to slow down life gone topsy turvy be topsy turvy suddenly come right side up dont know oh dont know anything ive got to begin over again shook hand paused lambone waited for manifestly have something to say got out at last do think liked liked right christina alberta dont worry about that be little more than two day before christina alberta to use own expression got back to lost daddy two day be full of immense excitement devizes be most wonderful fact in world exploded into love for have most vivid impression of dark tall rather grave watchful amazingly understandable yet vivid a impression be doubted detail of wanted to go back to verify over again be quality of mutual understanding be at once most delightful most incredible aspect of whole affair brain doubt be unlike a two individual brain must be yet unlikeness be not mere accumulation of accidental difference unlikeness of two variation of one theme must feel intention beneath word mind have jumped with realization there must be kink turn in brain kink turn just made difficult queer for most people must find completest parallel in didnt believe there be thing in thought act that must be surprised at knowing comprehending have never before thought of parentage with enthusiasm have viewed rather in spirit of samuel butler bernard shaw conceived of parent generally in relation to child a embarrassed hypocrite with instinctive disposition towards restraint suppression have made exception of own particular pair daddy have be great friend anyhow though mother for most part have be concentrated incarnate dont have never realized there might be something rather intimately interesting in consanguinity then suddenly door have opened man have come in sat down talked to discovered nearest thing in life to to wanted to go to again wanted to see more of be with made sign must think of decent excuse for call upon very intensity of desire made unable to go to easily wrote various letter have agreed must write then decided to master mental science lunacy generally case of daddy perceived to be formal link with devizes set out for reading room of british museum for have student ticket tried to concentrate mind upon book have requisitioned instead of letting wander off into strangest revery about miraculously discovered blood relation in afternoon rang up lambone to be given tea with intention of learning everything that wise man must tell about devizes generally turning over conversationally lambone be out next day craving for devizes be overpowering rang up may have tea asked ive got nothing much to say want to see delighted said devizes when got to found shy a shy a herself for little while made polite conversation might almost have be conversation of two people at formal call in country town called christina alberta called doctor devizes asked if played danced whether have ever be abroad sat in arm chair stood over on hearthrug be clear that only way to intimacy lay in frank treatment of daddy felt that if sort of talk went on for minute must have to scream throw tea cup in fire so plunged when did first know mother devizes attitude stiffened smiled faintly at boldness be cambridge undergraduate reading for natural science tripos went down to sheringham to read picked other up on beach made love in scared furtive desperate ignorant sort of way people be primitive in day compared with what be now daddy wasnt there came in afterwards devizes considered for moment decided that wasnt fair to oblige to go on questioning father said be pretty considerable old bully be sir george devizes man who invented devizes biscuit cured old alphonso be celebrated for being rude to patient must smack stomach tell ought to be scooped out helped make unter magenbad suspected of being bit of soft though a matter of fact wasnt generally have effect of laying up for quarrel with kept pretty short wasnt particularly nice to mother used to get at mother through didnt dare to have scrape of sort be really afraid of if saw scrape blowing up habit disposition be to run away see devizes considered implication of see not that ran away from definite scrape that knew of at sheringham said very carefully what be mother like in day sort of subdued fierceness flushed warm face be pretty know very upright in carriage have swift decision beneath stiffness wish must suddenly crystallize out after there be bending know suppose do wore glass then oh yes be fresh then be happy little too fierce to be happy did ever love be long time ago christina alberta there be seaside love making why do cross examine like want to know why christina alberta have momentary terror at own boldness why didnt marry devizes made pretence of surprise at question there be reason manifest why must have married none at cant conceive what father must have done if have come back from sheringham engaged to chance acquaintance anyhow why must have done anything of sort eye defied hers left address added must have written to never did did letter go astray said christina alberta added hastily imagination be running away with hesitated trembled at next word have resolved to say said with forced offhandedness see might have fancied a father produced catastrophe looked in face then smiled after smile felt that understood other completely be very pleasant to think that instead of have to adopt a cousin said deliberately cousin be christina alberta best can do have to put head together think of daddy he common concern im interested in little man he defended against many thing by dream of very wilful dream may have be who know necessary protective dream christina alberta did not speak for little time nodded be glad at manifest understanding yet be disappointed though must not have told what else have expected man yard away be nearest thing in world to always there might be invisible barrier between be linked by invisible tie be separated by unfathomable necessity never before in life have known what love must be wanted to be free to love wanted to love realized that be standing quite still that devizes be standing just a still upon hearthrug watching face mouth eye be quiet serene imagined must be gripping hand together behind have to obey there be nothing for to do follow lead daddy common concern said suppose will begin to hear from of people to morrow christina alberta got back to daddy in dream be queer dream be going about world with devizes be locked together in such way that must never look at other be always side by side also with sublime incoherence of dream be at same time great ebony image sat stiffly side by side like pharaoh consort looked over great space be very big effigy indeed profile be alike through dream thought of devizes a black space before be sometimes sandy desert sometimes grey cloudy expanse then suddenly something round white came bounding into midst of arena became little man familiar little blue eyed man tied up into ball with rope sorely maimed who rolled about panted struggled to be free oh struggled pitifully christina alberta heart went out to yet impelled by tremendous force within rose devizes rose beside marched stiffly forward must not help must not control rigid movement of hand foot stepped high forcibly be voiceless tried to cry out will trample upon will trample upon there be more than hoarse inarticulate sound of horror in throat be upon felt body of daddy writhe under be like bladder soft ineffectual body with foot upon bent bulged about forgot there be anything else daddy why have treated like devizes disappeared daddy be clinging to knee now crowd of vile figure have appeared sought to drag away save christina alberta be pleading though heard sound save save day torture dragged away must not put out arm to because be made of ebony of one piece with devizes then one bird sphinx with face voice of lambone came into dream listen to daddy said despise simply pity have much to teach world will never learn anything until will learn from ridiculous people people be ridiculous be be ridiculous learn in suffering what teach in song saw that daddy be now sheltering between paw of sphinx that evil men have vanished became intensely aware of revealing absurdity in dream previous incompatibility have shocked at have never thought that be dreaming up to point now became intensely oppressed by idea that sphinx be ancient egyptian classical figure that sargon be still more ancient sumerian dream be going wrong period culture be mixed conveyed to sphinx lambone turned head to answer immediately evil figure be back taking advantage of lambones inattention be dragging daddy away tried to call lambones attention to said there must be plenty of time to recover daddy when point about sphinx be settled wasnt sphinx explained winged bull never have be sphinx why must be wearing long curly stone beard wanted to argue that be false beard that have only just put on anyhow be just like to start inopportune discussion meanwhile daddy be receding into wretchedness became aware of rapidly painfully be daddy still body be different be not human body more basket of fruit overturned unless did something at once must go rotten be bad for ever tried to cry out word of comfort reassurance to poor tragic little figure before dream came to end for now knew surely that be dream of course be suffering intolerably why have not written to telegraphed to surely must give letter telegram profound self detestation for incompetence negligence great horror of pain cruelty came upon awoke completely to black night infinite dismay in little hard bed in stuffy little bedroom in lonsdale mew impression of daddy desolate broken hearted in danger remained with terribly vivid clung to got up in morning anxious depressed by be not doing enough for said be letting day slip by for must be day of despair sure th sylums nt so ba s at said fay sure yr overrating to live among lunatic be classed a lunatic theyve ban play foxhill sylum there buful ban ntainments nors sort treat said fay christina alberta refrained from bad language getting ill ove said fay doing good n lun youffar come dow shorem thes thouse spoilin in la bit of fine wr for october weather be holding out that year quite wonderfully succession of calm golden day crumb have be offered loan of bungalow on beach at shoreham by friend who have used throughout summer wanted to go down to before weather broke going down to meant leaving christina alberta alone in studio did not want to do meant to go to shoreham christina alberta now that have discovered devizes must not endure thought of getting out of telephone range of london argued be manifestly proper centre must get down to cummerdown hill in hour must keep in touch with everything crumb might go must stay fay must not understand pestered about eleven oclock christina alberta went to post office telephone booth rang up devizes cant something be done to hurry thing up asked ive got daddy on nerve cant bear to think of there day after day ive be dreaming of worrying be good ive got bad news for so put control on paused christina alberta for love of devizes have to restrain violent desire to snap oh what be visiting day be yesterday have one visitor suppose thats agreeable relation described what be name wiggle mr widgery daddy cant be seen again by outer world for week not until next tuesday oh damn said christina alberta exactly ill do what can to arrange sort of special access got on to medical superintendent he queer he evidently quite friendly well disposed fence about cant say yes odd im free to day in afternoon im tied up to morrow be for going down to see superintendent mean for talk after lunch better in day so say hope there nothing wrong that he keeping back afterwards promised to ring up later then abruptly switched off so hold ready there whats telephone number havent got one must telegraph ill chase round in taxi pick up sorry to hold up like christina alberta dont mind anything so long a getting towards daddy right o voice be cut off telegram came after interval of two hour two hour have be devoted to rambling dispute with fay about shoreham difficulty message ran a follows have father turned up escaped at dawn morning in slipper dressing gown nothing seen of since if not appeared meet victoria two seven for cummerdown telephone gerrard if there mr preemby did not turn up anywhere just vanished christina alberta in state of incredulous astonishment at fresh disappearance went down with devizes to cummerdown found medical superintendent by mean so amazed a be sargon have be missing at breakfast time everything seemed to point to just walking out of asylum that sort of thing have happened before showed certain sleepy negligence on part of one two attendant must be reprimanded a for wonder medical superintendent refused to wonder lunatic often stray escape unless be dangerous authority made great commotion about kept out of newspaper a far a be possible to do so place isnt portland said medical superintendent get back all right give day he probably coming back now may be hiding up mile away im chiefly anxious about catching cold pneumonia be standard death of lunatic wonderfully warm for time of year ive never known october be much more desirous to talk to devizes about lunacy reform convince that be highly progressive able medical superintendent than to discus special case of mr preemby do what can said be fixed by extreme economy have to practise low grade attendant not enough even of public indifference to lunatic be monstrous everybody even people with insane relation want to forget about how must preemby have got out of ground asked devizes arent there wall round like everything else about lunacy law back be not a good a front said superintendent here have got at least complete wall of sort round original building used to be private mansion with walled park for time in eighteenth century be boy school showed from window over roof of clump of outbuilding limit of garden farm at back dropping towards streamlet defined by roadside wall old thorn oak tree for own part said medical superintendent admit urgency of very drastic reform wonder if cousin widgery can throw light on said devizes widgery be visitor yesterday be said medical superintendent reflected went to desk a if to look for paper thought be different sort of name rather more like goodchild perhaps ive mixed up name mr sam widgery said christina alberta must be last person whod want daddy to get out probably came to make sure that wouldnt may have come just for pleasure of gloating over uncle sam not pretty soul may have wanted to make sure wall went way round medical superintendent forgot doubt about name paper turned with fresh idea to dont think there be animus dont think may have made for mr widgery where doe mr widgery live devizes christina alberta thought there be great possibility of mr preemby beating back to woodford well he much more likely to go to canterbury windsor start straight off for rome said christina alberta mesopotamia british museum said devizes anywhere said christina alberta with note of despair returned to london completely baffled christina alberta be for visit to cummerdown police station for search in village round about devizes explained that might do more harm than good until now christina alberta have never heard of one kindly weakness in british lunacy law release of fourteen day freedom if lunatic can get away from asylum remain at large for period becomes legally sane again can not be touched without fresh examination new certificate to set whole countryside hunting for preemby might merely lead to recapture by asylum authority happened mystery must not get into paper while hing may be lying dead in out of way ditch said christina alberta if he dead wont mind little delay in finding said devizes only thing be to wait at lonsdale mew against chance of returning thither crumb went off to shoreham christina alberta be left alone in studio after one endless day of paul lambone thought of convenient agency called universal aunt suitable lady be sent to relieve from continuous vigil one two three day passed there came sign from sargon news of fresh calling of disciple visit to king have evaporated vision of little crumpled up body in ditch replaced tormented figure in cell in distressed imagination of christina alberta mind refuse to go on with painful fancy lead to nothing christina alberta imagination presently ceased further dealing with daddy until fresh material came to hand will turn up somewhere repeated feebly became great consumer of evening paper will turn up somehow chief anxiety be that must not turn up with too tremendous head line began to adjust like early christian for second coming riddle of daddy disappearance became habit of mind became a be frame proscenium arch to current activity beneath returned to urgent extraordinary problem of herself relationship to devizes be manifest that be almost a excited a be at mutual discovery possible proceeding of sargon fantastic a might prove to be when came to light remained for a for matter of urgent importance thought of strange relationship completely overshadowed have reciprocal desire to get at other to discover what magic of sympathy understanding might not be latent in consanguinity evening after universal aunt be installed took christina alberta out to dine with at pleasant little italian restaurant in corner of sloane square afterwards came back to studio with talked until nearly one in morning showed shyly anxious to find out aim purpose in life what be doing what might be done to let out possibility be evidently disposed to shoulder just a much parental responsibility a must subject to preservation of appearance proper care for self respect of vanished sargon attracted liked feeling for be more tumultuous abundant indefinite didnt particularly want help support from idea of being dependent upon for anything repelled rather than attracted wanted to get hold of to please satisfy to be better than have expected interesting in fresh way wanted to like to care for more than mere liking wanted that anxiously tremendously liked sort of ease confidence have with waiter cabman common service of life seemed to know just what people must do seemed to know just what must do there be tension in matter nervous hrrmping common attribute of habitual prosperity be so little in experience that seemed distinction of threw flavour of knowing what be about being serenely in control over most of conversation when indeed be a curious experimental emotionally stirred almost a be eye met hers when talked be steady friendly interested intimate eye heart went out to over dinner talked at first about music have have music in education now be discovering friend of have be taking to concert have got pianola so a to spell out at home first christina alberta education have missed out music too hadnt a yet discovered so that topic died out presently tried about picture there again wasnt particularly interested have little silence looked across at smiled id like to ask sort of question christina alberta if dared said blushed absurdly question like said immense question said for example generally what do think be up to understood what meant at once be so unprepared with answer that became evasive up to said playing for time suppose im looking for lost daddy what be up to generally what be doing with life where be going im at sea said at last lot of generation be think girl especially be older than be im only beginning dont want to seem cheeky arent better able to say what be up to suppose slightly scared gravity broke into impudent smile devizes found very congenial suppose play first considered that perfectly fair said will have olive im glad like olive do too nobody called to account for long time what be game fair question not easy one evidently suppose one ought to begin right back at one philosophy said long story started idea christina alberta be greatly elated at successful repulse of projected cross examination instead of making display must watch watched over flower on table have to be nudged by waiter when brought pheasant to elbow how must one begin plunged have heard of pragmatism yes be probably better read in sort of thing than be be considered sort of pragmatist most modern minded intelligent people held be pragmatist a understood pragmatist a understood met eye explained in sense meant none of have clear vision of reality nobody perhaps must ever do more than approach reality what perceived be just that much of reality got through to through very defective power of interpretation theyve done pheasant en casserole very well broke off three minute truce ought to give do find im talking comprehensibly doubt im hanging on said christina alberta perhaps im beginning rather too far off pheasant to come back to confession of faith said presently mind christina alberta youve got to say bit afterwards wont be a definite a yours said of yours will steal go on telling well keep hold christina alberta feel im going to be at once hesitating condensed im not sure of what know dont know if say im agnostic about nature of universe how began where end doe that convey anything to just what think said christina alberta well started afresh got into parenthetical difficulty pche melba came to interrupt permit fresh start unfolded psychologist vision of world for inspection curious yet attractive vision to expressed in term of mind understanding be used to hearing everything expressed in term of labour material necessity life said be one continuous thing life be connected tried to illustrate that conscious life of most lower animal be intensely individual lizard for example be just just instinct appetite received teaching tradition handed on nothing to kind higher animal be taught when be young learnt taught others communicated with other men far more than animal have developed picture writing speech oral tradition scientific record there be now common mind of race great growing body of knowledge interpretation people like be just cross section of flow individually receive react to change little pas away be just passing phase of increasing mind may be for can certainly say immortal mind doe sound like greek nonsense to said think get drift of looked at intent face wasnt in least talking down to be simply trying to express a well a possibly must to be treating like equal like equal be general philosophy be coming to question of now said became very earnest over coffee cup ash tray on swept tablecloth spread elucidatory hand before be conscientiously explicit saw in two phase rather two level of existence roughly speaking two have link intermediate stage of course

from asylum doe best very successfully to have a little to do with a possible nestle among tree just off high road to ashford hastings have one cramped little inn gave bleak bedroom accommodated machine side car in open outhouse crowded with two cart ford populous with hen day be still young after have deposited elderly rucksac in have brought thing upstairs set out with walking stick air of detached interest to reconnoitre asylum develop plan for rescue of sargon golden autumn be still holding out pleasant lane followed to high road be patterned with green yellow chestnut leaf tree overhead be full of sunshine be reassuring day encouraged took with kindly seriousness made feel that rescuing people from lunatic asylum be sort of work sun must shine upon nature welcome have needed great effort to get down from london have felt then like midget setting out to attack embattled universe amidst croydon traffic have be half minded to go back have felt that must not face tessy until have be at least definitely defeated be delightful to note increased assurance within a drew nearer to enterprise felt much more on scale of power attacked after be law regulation just thing patched up by men like be prison wall slow work of shirking bricklayer evasive contractor attendant custodian superintendent so forth be setting out to circumvent be a fallible a thing be urgent outrageous seizure of harmless little fantastic frightful imprisonment have to be fought world must be intolerable unless such thing be fought queer world be such beauty on tree stem such glow delightfulness of rustling one foot through leaf be by way real business of life be to fight evil thing came out from between tree saw wide down opening out before blocked mass of asylum with broad bare ground wall eyesore be objective in place somewhere be sargon have to be released seated on convenient stile inspected that heavy architecture tried to frame plan that white building in centre looked like gaunt georgian private house be probably nucleus of whole place two men be visible in front of mowing grass patient perhaps wall railing along road looked implacable two stern looking lodge there be doubt with testy janitor lurking within there be iron gate one open van be coming out furniture dealer van for time bobby mind ran on possibility of becoming tradesman with parcel crate to deliver many difficulty way why frontal attack said bobby with effect of discovery place fell away behind down hill must inspect rear if worked round by open down to right must probably get on to slope commanding view of asylum ground hour later bobby be sitting on heap of flint by side of minor road ran over rising ground behind asylum found rear of place much more hopeful much more interesting than front there be field with number of men working in at one place near building row of men seemed to be digging trench under supervision of attendant there be quite lot of movement closer to building under sort of open shed dozen men seemed to be taking exercise by walking up down vexed bobby to think that one of figure might be sargon if only have elementary common sense to bring field glass reproached might have be able to make out little friend feature clearness of thought whispered decision lot of people seemed to be going about very freely carrying gardening implement so forth one noted walking about gesticulating a if talked to be manifestly patient quite unattended wall bounding asylum on side have none of austerity of front wall seemed to be old estate wall in several place be covered with ivy here there be overhung with tree ground dropped away to right there be little stream ran out of asylum ground at lowest corner corner be shaded by tree seemed to be left to tree undergrowth stream ran under low arch in wall went on down widening valley towards london seclusion shade of corner appealed to bobby very strongly seemed to exactly point at sargon ought to be got out of place decided that presently must stroll down examine possibility a precisely a possible if one must get sargon to come down there found detail difficult meant to have plan worked out in detail to communicate to sargon on next visiting day be very hard to fit plan together did not know when must be most convenient for sargon to attempt to slip away whether be to be daylight night affair saw before great vista of inquiry to be made suspicious people to be faced damn said bobby for time be again for abandoning attempt why couldnt one go in at gate boldly overwhelmingly say there be sane man here have come to set free superman might do archangel how splendid must be to be sort of archangel knight errant great flaming presence of light winged power righting wrong reproving oppressor liberating kind of captive creature then one might do thing bobby lapsed into childish day dream presently roused stood up went down towards exit of stream wall struck a quite climbable even by little old gentleman stream came out meandering among pebble through short tunnel one must have got into asylum ground out of quite easily over wall by ivy through culvert resolved to come again at twilight just to satisfy about own pluck among other thing get into asylum premise walk about little yes must do that tried to imagine assisting sargon over wall one must get on top of wall reach down to hand cripple must do motor bicycle must have to be waiting up there in lane then where must take be new consideration for time bobby mind be appalled paralyzed by complexity of enterprise have not thought of taking anywhere in particular day intervened before visiting day seemed at once interminable frightfully swift have be to dymchurch in summer with malmesburys liked landlady of lodging very much wired to can come with relation not ill overworked for week so will remember last summer roothing feather cummerdown have got reply glad to see time so be right rest of plan failed very largely to materialize made nocturnal visit to asylum ground without misadventure morning of visiting day found with dozen plan have gap none seemed much better worse than others have walked round asylum ground at various discreet distance by night day just twenty three time not counting loop return visit to particular point of interest fortunately asylum be much preoccupied with internal affair keep look out men upon battlement reckon with rescuer from outside bobby made final decision among conflicting project over breakfast bacon with resolute sang froid nerve tingle set out for asylum to see sargon begin work of rescue a have thought out first have to find out what freedom of movement be permitted sargon when might be possible for to get away to corner by culvert have to arrange time for meeting then must have to provide also for alternative time if sargon failed to keep first appointment bobby must be waiting under wall motor bicycle side car must be hidden among bush up by road in trice sargon must be over wall after must laugh at pursuit off must go to dymchurch there safe untrackable sargon must keep indoors until fifteen day needed to make legally sane man again have passed then bobby must find out relation of talk matter over with get thing on proper footing so bobby planned out just at lodge gate decided upon assumed name wasnt quite clear why didnt give own name assumed name seemed to to be more in spirit of adventure when sargon be informed that be to be visited by mr robin goodchild be in depressed mood betrayed surprise at name seemed to to be a good a other name might be name of intelligent inquirer possibly even precursor of release still hoped for spirit rose submitted cheerfully to searching examination of personal tidiness nodded acquiescently to warning not to talk about blessed thing hed seen spirit rose still more when saw dark kindliness of bobby face be one disciple who have ever seemed to believe held out hand in little storm of emotion sort of muddler bobby might be to to sargon in moment at least be strength hope meeting occurred in reception room downstairs for one from outside world may ever penetrate to ward bleak reality of everyday asylum life reception room have baize covered table in middle black horsehair sofa numerous chair be totally devoid of small movable there be b c time table one two illustrated weekly on table wall bore brown spotted steel engraving of prince albert queen victoria in highland of windsor castle from thames there be three four group of two three people with head together conversing in tactful undertone there be several woman one little girl tearful lady in profound mourning sat apart by empty fire place doubt awaited patient two attendant tried hard not to look a though be listening a intently a possible to conversation going on about patient present be in sanest phase fit to be visited there be madness visible at most only little nervous oddity bobby have be watching other group while waited have be impressed by certain quality of furtiveness in behaviour furtiveness connected with alertness of attendant one affected to look out of window other half sat at table holding old graphic ever again there must be quick glance at patient that have not occurred to bobby that talk to sargon must be semi public be disconcerting interference must greatly hamper in giving instruction bobby saw at once sargon be very much thinner than when have taken room in midgard street looked ill worn effect be emphasized by fact that be badly shaven wearing ill fitting clothes eye seemed larger sunken under brow forehead more definitely lined yet if looked unhappier also looked more intelligent seemed more aware of thing about le man in dream have come to see if can be of service to said bobby holding out hand friend disciple be anxious for welfare have come to see said glanced sideways at listening attendant dropped voice sargon bobby understood that note of doubt grieved sargon king out of past must have deny whispered sargon bobby raised eyebrow nodded head a who must say theyd do anything little man manner changed how be one to know said how be one to know sighed nothing seems certain more can sit down talk together said bobby there be much to be said between sargon glanced round there be two chair in corner in corner might be little beyond eavesdropper range can not understand madness said sargon a sat down can not understand riddle have be set why doe power why doe god permit men to be mad when be mad be beyond good evil what be men still what becomes of justice what becomes of righteousness when men go mad voice sank eye became furtive dreadful thing happen here whispered dreadful thing quite dreadful thing ceased for little while bobby said word want to get out of said bobby be friend doing anything asked sargon what be christina alberta doing be well be splendid said haphazard doubt be one of beastly family of sargons be content to leave here want to listen to said sargon have thing to tell everyone in place be always thinking about what friend outside be doing for poor soul come talk to know be different from what be write letter petition tell that when god release will bear in mind mock at have delusion think be king emperor rich men great discoverer that world have plotted against be suspicious cruel darkened soul have dreadful habit can not help see be badly sunken degraded indescribably be very painful very painful blue eye stared blankly at unpleasant memory there can be doubt that be sargon said abruptly looked sharply at bobby call by other name said momentary acuteness faded again that man preemby be unawakened be asleep scarcely dreaming of life have seen have looked at world from high place from dark place too sargon sargon be different person be difficult became silent bobby felt that be getting nowhere in anticipation of conversation have talked sargon have listened there have be no one to overhear be unexpected anyhow plan have to be told sargon have to be instructed in part glanced warily at people nearest to there be among said quietly quickly who must set free want to tell on spur of moment attempted code when speak of city in central asia will mean place asylum do understand place central asia if be sargon everything be possibly something else be still in england nevertheless in reality want to explain to yes yes explain will speak of great discovery in central asia will mean did understand rescue whispered bobby in sargons ear glanced at attendant met eye be discomposed tell about discovery said sargon after little pause a though have not heard that whispered word be symbol for place said bobby sargon looked puzzled attendant be watching face now perhaps suspected already bobby flushed hotly plunged abruptly into account of discovery of amazing russian called bobinsky bobinsky have found walled city with way out yes said sargon interested attendant be now looking away like place said bobby more explicitly mean place there be river ran through city city of confinement went out by lower part there be helper waited rescuer be place for to wait did understand at point where tree grew river went out through wall waited there must wait until captive king came to be curious story said sargon what captive king do mean be meant for river speak of may be euphrates said sargon dream of euphrates have missed be out upon woolgathering of own euphrates what have euphrates to do with central asia asylum bother said bobby say be smaller river mean streamlet in ground here dont understand tall sharp faced woman in hat of hard black straw came near sat down bobby a talked observed out of corner of eye be friend of patient what be doing here speak in symbol said bobby still watching thinking about woman city be prison caught woman exchanging glance of intelligence with male attendant who have moved couple of yard up room knew other then must be observer want other prison than said sargon evidently quite at cross purpose one prison be enough dont mean said bobby can walk about here pretty freely not freely said sargon if must come out into ground to morrow woman turned long sharp foxy nose towards stared at with rather stupid green blue eye bobby nerve be going to piece altogether be always more afraid of woman than men prim sharp nosed figure so manifestly listening listening with faint hostility to said completed discomfiture tried to improvise story of lost recovered city must be crystal clear to sargon yet incomprehensible to listener invention faltered at difficult task where river ran out of city repeated harped upon idea where there be tree ivy there faithful waited when be propitious hour for master to steal away to everything be prepared when must be when might be fragmentally mixed with many irrelevancy bobby tried to get import of suggestion over to hearer now must be explicit now a fear of listener returned vague misleading did convey sense of mystery intention to sargon be plain felt conveyed nothing more time be slipping by bobby must have throttled that infernal woman more more did become audience to floundering effort maundered back to starting point about bobinsky there be such person a bobinsky threw in then how must explore city asked sargon manifestly more more perplexed at bobby rigmarole be dead said bobby be just mask men be dont mind about bobinsky must slip away to corner shes looking dont answer now answer dont understand said sargon bobby felt that be only puzzling sargon what else be to be done must have kicked for not having brought brief statement of plan written plainly on little piece of paper that must have slipped into sargons hand pocket must have be so simple must have made map drawing too late to do now despair came upon bobby everything have gone wrong got up to go then sat down again to make attempt felt murderous towards woman towards even towards slow witted little sargon be very good of to come see said sargon why did come do think anything will be done about will see christina alberta when saw first thought have thing to tell important thing one life on such hope here here when there be visitor nothing happens nothing pleasant one be distressed be interested to hear of city in central asia of course be little puzzling did come specially about just to see will come again even to come down here to sitting room be event then in swift whisper food be frightful so badly cooked disagrees with that woman said bobby a went have spoilt everything cant stand that woman said sargon followed direction of bobby eye poor soul said shes deaf mute come to see brother whole family be defective insane maddened bobby returned towards little inn must chuck whole thing intolerable thought must make fresh plan fresh plan altogether must begin over again little man be evidently wretched be going to be harder to get hold of than bobby have thought bobby have sleep night in night just before daybreak suddenly sargon woke up understood understood quite clearly what young man have be saying to have said rescue of course have meant to say escape city in central asia be only parable have said a much have be describing corner of asylum ground that corner where stream ran out beyond work field shrubbery where patient be supposed not to go have be telling of friend who must wait outside have be trying to arrange hour when friend must come there sargon have failed to understand sat up in bed very still be perfectly clear through sort of dulness came upon at time have not grasped drift of at time young man have shown irritation naturally enough what must do now must try again be friend still waiting who be young man name be unknown forgotten believed have said call by other name sargon there be friend spoke of who waited outside for king must know how must know if there be nothing to be known after perhaps be dream perhaps world be awakening have failed have not understood waited without how still everything be strange unusual stillness be rare for place to be so bereft of noise be dark yet not altogether dark ward be dimly lit by blue shaded light three nearer bed be unoccupied beyond man who tossed muttered almost incessantly lay for little while at peace man who raved have died three day ago man who gave sudden loud shout have be taken away to ward through open door one must see across landing into little yellow lit room where brand ward attendant sat with arm crossed chin on chest slept patience card spread out before seemed to be alone yet must sleep like where must other man be new attendant whose name sargon did not know yet felt one have just gone out uncurtained window showed night outside darkness became translucent streak of very black cloud five pale star across lower edge of oblong picture one must see indistinctly tracery of tree branch lumpish head of young oak still bearing leaf tree along first hedge outline grew distincter a watched be like slow development of photographic plate in dark room star dissolved have there be five there be three other two have dissolved into pale invading light dared one venture on to landing if brand awoke must make natural excuse stood well with brand other fellow there be not trace of where have gone do now wisest of maxim very swiftly sargon slipped out of bed put on dressing gown slipper hush what be that only one snoring nothing more went out stood on landing brand slept on like log stone staircase be lit empty from open door to left downstairs came harsh breathing of sleeper world seemed asleep for once except sargon friendly watcher outside wall far away there be sound of bawling raving be stifled by distance intervening door merely made nearer silence more perceptible something stirred little clicking sound sent sargons heart racing then resonant blow second blow be nothing be clock downstairs striking six very quietly very resolutely walked downstairs intuition instinct impelled felt peered at door behold be ajar unbolted unlocked brand colleague be abroad upon errand of own cold air of freedom blew upon sargons face door opened closed softly sargon stood upon doorstep of left wing of asylum facing dim world of november dawn be dark be clear world of ebony outline colourless form everything looked a if have just be wiped over with wet rag be cold be cold without of hate bitterness of wind crossed gravel drive came to stop stood looking about heavy building of left wing rose above vast bulk went up into paler darkness of sky receded in perspective central block beyond looked like ghost of house here there be orange lit window others fainter lit by remote reflected light in lodge to left of gate there be also light for where there be madness there be never perfect sleep asylum be a near complete silence morning a asylum can ever be looked listened not footfall must not do to be found here by other attendant man be snugly away somewhere one must loiter here in chill air what be sargon have to remember friend believer be waiting for be waiting now where river ran out of city wall be to say where little streamlet ran out of ground must be way to left where field dropped down hill stepped on to grass for foot made loud sound on gravel grass hissed crisply be heavy with white frost footmark made black blot in wet silvery grey walked past away from ponderous dark mass of asylum into open colder air of freedom unlatched went through small iron gate in iron fencing separated trim grass plot of front from cabbage field complained little on hinge opened closed very carefully struck across field path ran before into mist came out of mist to foot vanished behind be a if went past while marked time must not remember whither path ran how lay with regard to corner sought moment thing grew clearer moment thing grew clearer there have be something dark brooding in sky hung over seemed to watch have done best to ignore vague presence because be afraid of own imagination suddenly saw plainly that be just top of tree showing above mist must be line of tree along hedge parallel to asylum front must go through if wanted to go down hill left path made way slowly along frozen ridge of dug earth skirted long row of stalky cabbage black shrivelled unkempt looked like cossack sentinel afoot leant towards a though listened to sound of a drew near hedge tree heard sound like foot of army of midget be drip drip of moisture from tree far away behind quite invisible to motor car scurried along high road have difficulty in finding way through hedge bramble scratched ankle told there be hurry friend waited beyond hedge ground went down hill mist grew whiter thicker daylight be strong enough now to show mist dead white veiled stream altogether walked slowly have sense of being pursued brand must not go into ward for hour yet might not miss for long time what wonderful thing thought sargon be daybreak how little one see of day begin with miraculous drama sleep through a though did not concern rouse ourselves only for trite day little while ago world have be inky monochrome now be touched with colour sky be blue star have gone not one still shone large pale star star of sargon sky about be flushed with faint increasing pinkiness must be east that star must be morning star hanging above outhouse chimney chimney be very distinct butt end of asylum have be black shapeless monster little while ago have now become dark purple shape outlined with exquisite clearness eaves ridge chimney creasings window frame four window shone fading orange two of suddenly blinked vanished must anyone look out of window there see did not matter must go on down towards stream friendly mist must hide be wonderful to be in white mist yet not in be always little way from nevertheless wetted how crisp frosted ground be if one kicked through surface be soft overhead blueness increased there be now rippled patch of pink cloud went deeper deeper into soft mist presently be walking on long wet shrivelled grass when turned presently to look back at asylum have altogether disappeared what be be something talking be beating heart of busy elfin machine listen peer think be stream now everything be plain easy walked beside stream near at hand tree became visible attendant tree with mist about waist white clad sentinel tree dry grass be ranker here what be like denser lower mist within mist be wall beyond wall almost within shouting distance now friend believer must be waiting how discreet be not murmur not footfall for long time sargon stood motionless beside culvert beneath wall at last roused by great effort with help of ivy scrambled to top of wall one waited dim four footed thing bolted from frost bitten weed below then there be silence there be sign of watcher helper matter if be god will must come sat very still did not feel deserted alone be not in least dismayed felt that power who have called into being be about slowly steadily light grew brighter little cloud like floating feather caught fire very suddenly then great beam of light like beam of searchlight only very much broader appeared slanting to north then above whaleback of distant downland came knife edge of dazzling light effulgence like curved knife like cap like dome quivering blazing fire birth then torn clear of hill round red november sun have risen be full daylight mist have dissolved away roof of asylum building be now visible over crest divested of magic bleak commonplace from point in direction dog be barking be strange that there must be one here that young man whose name have never known have made very plain that there be friend in waiting here perhaps have gone away must come back presently still did not matter now very much at rate have seen sunrise of almost incredible beauty how good thing sun be thing of visible thing be most like god perhaps there be helper here at perhaps have misunderstood be stupid knew misunderstood more more perhaps presently keeper must come in search of take back to asylum might be so that thing be decreed must not let distress life be

made everything else seem very trivial there came sort of wonder upon a though world be opening bobby wrote that down also sat very late before fire in ground floor room thinking that over thinking over message must have to send to christina alberta in morning to morrow must have to explain extraordinary intervention in preemby affair be by mean plain to a yet to morrow must have to make plain to probably very indignant young lady why father have so caught sympathy fascinated imagination a to tempt to escapade found thrown back on self analysis found scrutinizing own motif own scheme of existence knew understood feeling a though world be opening so well still better did know that feeling of dead emptiness in life out of arose in own case have thought habitual discontent with daily round urgency towards something strange grandiose be due to dislocation of expectation of life by great war that be subjective aspect of nervous instability in case of little laundryman must not have be war have sent out sort of emigrant from to find fantastic universal kingdom must be something more fundamental than war accident must be normal disposition in men towards detachment from safety

coming by cab business might be strain on must have to tell what to do to considerable extent now have made responsible for fortune of people liked to think that liked to think that perhaps might

have come to before acted then how be to know there be until told of existence in so many case in asylum relative be hostile to release be dreadful to admit be so then rather humorously quite modestly must describe escape be already forgetting uncertainty of visiting day conversation numerous accidental factor in meeting by culvert history have knack of eliminating unnecessary detail so must make statement did not occur to that christina alberta might be sort of person who interrupt speech with elucidatory question lit cigarette strolled about room came to rest standing before fire looking down on glowing coal be sure now that christina alberta be blue eyed fragile shy with deep sweet vein of humorous fantasy hidden away in very probably concealed gift for writing must be for perhaps to discover cultivate bring out together must protect sargon already more than half recovered from intoxication of dream must have to soften humiliation of complete awakening how fortunate a be providential be that have be impelled to rescue little man for otherwise must never have met christina alberta never won timid wealth of love eh be damned nonsense said bobby violently threw cigarette into fire be just fancy havent even seen girl lit candle put out mr plumers oil lamp with device precaution proper to dangerous survival from dark age went up to bed stopped listened outside sargons door patient be asleep breathing rather noisily ever again choking with little cough wish weather have kept warmer said bobby when opened own bedroom door flame of candle writhed flared horizontally curtain streamed into room sheet of paper flapped on dressing table put down candle went to shut window wind be rising there be little patter of raindrop on pane chapter third last phase be part of general unsatisfactoriness of bobby make up that be acutely responsive to meteorological condition late indian summer be over now heaven earth air between began to push hustle wet chill darken distress bully jumbled grey cloud came hurrying across dymchurch from dungeness atlantic torn angular outstretched cloud with malicious expression like witch warlock emitting fierce squirt of rain under skirt came wave in long rolling regiment threatening from afar breaking into premature handful of foam gathering force at last towering up for last culminating thud against sea wall spouting heavenward in white fountain of suddy water face man said bobby face only nature brace up to think of poor girl forced to do morning walk along top of sea wall with wet trouser flapping against leg like flag against stave glorious wind told sargon when went in to see wish there be gleam of sun have news from christina alberta asked sargon there hardly time yet for reply to wire shell surely come said bobby went downstairs to dry leg at fire did not expect summons to hythe to meet young lady very much before half past twelve meanwhile went out to shed assured that motor bicycle side car be in perfect order for hasty journey half past twelve came one half past one have lunch became very restless rose looked out of window frequently to see if messenger girl be coming with christina alberta telegram about two large silent luxurious looking hired daimler car appeared outside stopped at mr plumers gate hatless bobbed head appeared at window exchanged remark with driver who descended opened door car emitted handsome determined young woman of advanced appearance hatless short skirted lean dark prosperous looking man of thirty eight forty in blue serge grey felt hat man opened gate for girl surveyed house a advanced bobby realized that christina alberta have not kept promise to be blue eyed fragile have betrayed yet for treachery have built up sense of personal relationship with gripped still watched approach with excitement found difficult to control wondered who devil dark man be cousin perhaps discovered bobby watching from window eye met bobby with instinct be given to young people for such occasion perceived that interested christina alberta extremely parleyed with devizes in mr plumers little downstairs room spoke chiefly to devizes treated a secondary figure voice at elbow he got nasty cold on chest said he be asking for miss preemby christina alberta said christina alberta christina alberta lot be only last night must get address out of hed forgotten before weve be here over day caught cold coming here how did come here devizes threw in motor bicycle said bobby there be lot of waiting about before must get away be cold raw morning have just nightgown dressing gown slipper so hard to foresee everything how did come to be rescuing bobby smiled at devizes somebody have to be rescuing turned to christina alberta again couldnt bear thought of being under lock key took room see in place where lodged there be something innocent delightful about ive weakness sympathy perhaps with absurdity ought to go up to see yes wed better look at said devizes who devil be fellow bobby asserted christina alberta first think took christina alberta up to daddy closed door on warm embrace now mr de vezes be said to on staircase where do come in descended found devizes standing very irritatingly upon hearthrug before fire a stood there remote resemblance to christina alberta be perceptible bobby have incoherent recognition of fact that in obscure way devizes be responsible for christina alberta failure to produce blue eye be little slow in saying what intended to say devizes be able to take initiative forgive blunt impertinence said may ask who be im writer said bobby refraining from glance at accumulation of aunt suzannah material upon side table youve finished lunch asked devizes in disregarded parenthesis may ask same question of said bobby how be come to be connected with preembys im blood relation said devizes considering on mother side sort of cousin happen to be nervous mental specialist thats why ive be brought in to day see said bobby youve got intention of putting back none at be not antagonist mr roothing be on same side did well to get out be trying to do same thing by le original method be very grateful to lunacy law be rather clumsy indiscriminating machine a probably know if keep clear of for fourteen day have to begin with over again renews sanity be ally in weve got to know other better intervention most surprising strike a being at once eccentric courageous wish youd tell more about how met how got hold of what set thinking of escape hm said bobby came asserted right to hearthrug have thought of way in must tell story to christina original christina alberta with blue eye felt that version needed considerable revision indeed possibly even complete rearrangement for present hearer be by mean sure wanted to tell to present hearer man be doctor mental specialist distant relation be for keeping sargon out of asylum be to good still lingered in bobby mind that be interloper nevertheless made way for bobby quite civilly on hearthrug manner be attentive respectful bobby embarked upon description of sargons first appearance in midgard street devizes showed alert intelligent grasped significance of sargons projected visit to dome of saint paul at once ive doubt did said devizes have said bobby though ive not asked about yet pieced together probable story of calling of disciple before billy bobby have come upon procession touching said devizes immense bobby approved word see how got said bobby distinct flavour of friendliness for devizes crept by imperceptible degree into bobby mind difficulty have seemed to threaten explanation vanished man perceived must understand anything fellow did devizes made feel that extraction of sargon from cummerdown by perfect stranger be most simple natural thing to do imaginable bobby warmed to story sense of humour took heart of grace became frank amusing about difficulty on visiting day a be telling of foxy faced deaf mute christina alberta came back again into downstairs room take a matter of course said seems weak drowsy chest be bad spoke more definitely to devizes think ought to overhaul there be doctor in attendance asked bobby bobby explained devizes considered be sargon dozing yes then let doze for bit bobby working now little more consciously for effect went on with story christina alberta regarded with manifest approval by tea time bobby have adjusted mind to existence of devizes unexpectedness of christina alberta carried over from state of expectation be idea that relation with christina alberta be to be very profound intimate still believed that hidden away in somewhere there must be blue eyed yielding really feminine person be very deeply hidden meanwhile superimposed disguise struck a agreeable alert humorous friendly devizes too saw more more a strong capable understanding personality have seen devizes examining sargon be clever confidence provoking doctoring sargons lung said be badly congested especially on left side be on edge of pneumonia without much vitality to fight ought to be kept in warmer le draughty room with night nurse available mr plumer have room for nurse not hour away by automobile be paul lambones excessively comfortable week end cottage at udimore little masterly telephoning telegraphing cottage be available fire be alight in best bedroom trained nurse be on way to be settled for sargon warmly wrapped up fortified with hot water bottle to go thither bobby found mere accessory in new system of thing be to follow next day to udimore on motor bicycle for there must be room for of in paul lambones cottage apparently paul lambones conception of simple cottage in wilderness involved housekeeper several servant four five visitor room fellow devizes carried out arrangement with smooth competence gave bobby scope for self assertion sargon christina alberta devizes must depart at five get to udimore by six by time nurse must be installed then devizes must go back to london get there in time to dress for dinner have to attend on saturday morning must be busy in london then must come back to udimore see if sargon be recovered enough for beginning of mental treatment perhaps unknown paul lambone must be there too be lazy person bobby gathered hed have to be brought down by devizes bobby be to stay at udimore for day made modest protestation youre in now said devizes cheerfully glanced at christina alberta youre in for sargon like rest of bring work with yes do come said christina alberta only reason bobby have for resisting invitation be that attracted so much cottage at udimore struck bobby a being really very pretty comfortable modern house three people christina alberta devizes paul lambone who now grouped round sargon exercised mind in quite extraordinary way struck a being novel definite to degree hed never met in anyone before even house be fresh decisive in broad white grace like house have ever before held attention made most of other house have ever observed seem accidental aggregatory second hand wandering in purpose house be work of clever young architect who have considered paul lambone intelligently white rough cast wall sat comfortably on hill side looked with honest entirely detached admiration at rye across marsh to winchelsea remote blue sea have seat arbour gazebo for sitting about in up hill be walled garden with broad path up looked from back of house through lead paned window must watch sunset from number of excellent point of view did not shine upon room to weary blind there be kind wall to shelter hollyhock delphinium from south west wind to bear plum so pear fig tree downstairs be mainly one great rambling room with dining recess in one corner power of opening out into loggia with conversational centre about fire place window a season might require there be several little study about house in one must be shut off write bookshelf grew in convenient corner house be everywhere mysteriously warm from unseen scarce suspected radiator house be so like paul lambone paul lambone so much part of house that seemed to be really more than voice eye paul lambone be first successful writer bobby have ever met bobby knew various needy young writer tadpole writer insecure writer be first completely grown up established massively adult writer have ever known man struck bobby a being stupendously secure free prosperous remarkable thing be that be in way great writer dickens scott hardy work wasnt after in bobby opinion anything so very remotely above bobby own effort certain terseness have at time certain penetration be chief difference in bobby imagination literary artistic life have hitherto have unavoidable flavour of casual adventure glorious achievement maddening difficulty wild delight tragic unhappiness swift savage goldsmith carlyle balzac duma edgar allan poe have be type new bright house be a sound comfortable a country house lambone sat in with a safe dignity a though be provincial banker mine owner senior member of widespread firm of solicitor fear of losing job writing out oppressed said did exactly what thought proper policeman saluted a passed if sort of thing must spring from book of everyday wisdom paul amiable novel what hitherto unsuspected possibility of accumulation ease security helpfulness might there not be in aunt suzannahs kindly responsiveness have never before seemed credible to bobby that day might come when must be secure own master able to refuse limitation to release other people from limitation bobby life hitherto have be matter of direction eminent necessity have be sent to school sent to college have be on eve of being put into position of agent upon friendly estate when great war have seized upon rest of generation drilled sent off to mesopotamia after war have have to do something to supplement diminished inheritance life have be so indicated prescribed for at stage parent existence have be so entirely directed by class tradition that bobby mind be exceptionally well prepared to be impressed by paul lambones freedom be curious to note how completely paul lambone arose out of present day world how completely didnt belong to have advantage so little of standard obligation have escaped from with most of gift have to go to court follow season make call perform function be exceptional in circumstance altogether be there lot of people escaping a be escaping prosperously from old decaying social system queer sort of new people who didnt belong bobby sat on terrace looked over back of seat at extremely new very sightly comfortable cottage of lambones with freshly arrived idea of new sort of people getting loose in world living unrelated to old order of thing shaping out new way of living very active in mind house seemed to embody idea be new novel not bit apologetic rebellious be just breaking out like new fashion be just arising like new century have always assumed that revolution came from below through rage of excluded disinherited have thought one took that for granted suppose revolution be merely smash up that hadnt very much to do with real progress way that new age dawned anywhere in social order where people must get free enough to work out new idea new idea sargon be new paul lambone be new devizes new before war there must not have be such people have grown out of own past self be a different from pre war people a nineteenth century people have be different from eighteenth century people newest of be christina alberta who have effaced blue eyed predecessor be so direct free in thought talk that made bobby feel that own mind wore bonnet flounce have gone for two walk with once to brede once to rye liked tremendously whether be in love with didnt yet know falling in love with for anyone be evidently going to be quite unconventional untested difficult series of exercise nothing at like unborn normal affair with non existent blue eyed girl seemed to like particularly way hair grew on head have mentioned twice ruffled once queer aspect of situation be riddle of how sargon came to be guest of paul lambone with devizes in attendance be just part of paul lambones freedom from prescription that must be able to give sanctuary to sargon assemble odd unconventional week end party bobby have sense of hidden link missing clue devizes be natural enough visitor of course be manifestly lambones close friend interest in sargon be stronger than bobby must imagine ought to be be puzzled examined sort of possibility in gingerly fashion impulse like own doubt not quite same lay at bottom of sargonism bobby have begun by feeling very hostile to devizes a unexpected intruder on system of relationship sufficiently interesting without be glad that have to go to london for friday not particularly pleased by return on saturday then found feeling changing to curious respect mingled with defensive element be almost like fear devizes be more aware of than lambone looked at mind came at have habit of coming at people be more actively aggressively interested in thing than lambone more self forgetful lambone observed enough to make bright comment devizes made penetrating observation bobby often felt encumbered with most people thought be encumbered with devizes to conspicuous degree wasnt be man of science man of scientific habit bobby have known one two scientific men before rather wrapped away from ordinary thing interest wrapped be something that wrapped away from one have be concerned chiefly with stress in glass with egg of echinoderm always seemed to be looking at back of fellow head smiling at immense preoccupation man devizes be wrapped up in motif thought of people didnt look away from looked into that grew upon bobby consciousness devizes eye lacked delicacy have come down for week end chiefly to deal with sargon went up have long talk to sargon be treating sargon didnt go up talk to sargon a man to man a bobby must have done went up to sort of mental jiu jitsu with sargon to exercise push about into new attitude devizes be formidable enough in far more formidable a portent have appearance of being precursor most vigorous precursor be precursor of new type of human relationship relationship without delicate reservation without rich accumulation of feeling behind emotion avoided thing unsaid so seemed to bobby who didnt for moment suspect how much people be avoiding suppressing christina alberta thought speech seemed to to be moving about without stitch on like people in horrible utopia by well compared vast impalpable network of understanding tessy have woven between other new people whispered looked paul lambones new house in face to be stupendously new immense discovery war have overstrained realized left too tired for time to see new thing have be one of vast multitude of who have come out of war in expectation of trite obvious old fashioned millennium who expressed disappointment by declaring that nothing have happened except devastation impoverishment be too jaded at first to observe anything else indeed bobby now realized european world have be travelling faster faster since break up of armed peace in here be new type new habit of thought new idea new reaction new moral new way of living discovered in advent of new age new age be coming so fast that there hadnt be time ever to clear form institution of old age away werent reversed abolished werent overthrown be just disregarded be just why be possible to get along for year so without noting tremendous change everything be undergoing new people did that apply to sargon be sargons room two long window between buttress be sargon also escape from established order of relationship into novel thing be real significance of absurd little man with preposterous map of world still more preposterous planisphere who wanted to be lord of earth when bobby came to talk over with sargon seemed to that devizes have taken little man completely to piece presented with disarticulated portion of devizes went back to london on monday took christina alberta with in hired car lambone urged bobby to stay on for day so to cheer up patient lambone so far a must discover own intention meant to stay on at udimore for week more work bobby saw christina alberta off meditated on for hour then gave rest of morning to aunt suzannah afternoon to sargon sargon who be distinctly better sat propped up by two pillow discussed dissected structure of not bit fatigued said sargon im having tonic now three hour considered next remark for moment before made who be mr paul lambone asked be very hospitable for to entertain very hrrmp be friend of yours he quite well known writer he friend of christina alberta have so many friend young people do nowadays what be dr devizes be nervous specialist be consulted be consulted about possibility of getting away from place nervous specialist be wonderful talker most intelligent hrrmp understanding have curious feeling somewhere somewhen somehow have met before in life other be quite vague doe not seem to have corresponding recollection probably coincidence of sort bobby saw nothing in coincidence sargon shut eye for second so talked of recent experience resumed naturally said bobby helping there have be lot of confusion about personality be trouble more frequent nowadays than used to be most of life have thought be person called albert edward preemby limited person most limited person then have light began to realize that nobody must really be such thing a albert edward preemby began to seek for have reason too long to explain to suppose be sargon first great sumerian founder of first empire in world then then came trouble saw something of grasped at sceptre one afternoon in holborn rashly most painful affair be sent to place yes shook humiliation hardship real uncleanness doubted whether wasnt after just little preemby human rabbit faith faltered admit faltered mused painfully for moment then laid hand reassuringly on bobby wrist be sargon said talking to friend devizes have cleared mind greatly be sargon in rather different sense from what have imagined preemby be a have supposed mere accidental covering little face puckered with intellectual effort be not exclusively sargon perhaps be still unawakened be sargon too blood be in vein be co heir be fairly easy to understand sargon regal position naturally many wife political biological necessity offspring numerous again position of advantage many child next generation more like vast expanding beam of intellectual moral force can prove prove by mathematics dr devizes worked out on piece of paper be descended from sargon just a be descended from csar just a nearly english american be descended from william conqueror few people realize little arithmetic be perfectly plain long before christian era blood of sargon be diffused throughout mankind tradition still more so inherit not merely from from great king from noble conqueror from brave beautiful woman statesman inventor creator if not directly from from father mother rich wine from past be in vein thought be just albert edward preemby at woodford well went for silly little walk nearly afternoon with sixpence in pocket to spend nothing in world to do for twenty year seems incredible blue eye sought confirmation from bobby who nodded there be walking about epping forest in suit of clothes never really liked rather exaggerated golfing suit with baggy knickerbockers that wife chose for seemed to get baggier year be quite ignorant be heir of age that whole earth down to centre up to sky be mine yours ours have sense of duty to hadnt woke up to self respect wasnt only sargon men woman who have ever mattered on earth be god everlasting servant instead of be rather timid about horse strange dog often when saw people approaching thought be observing speaking about did not know what to do with arm leg became quite confused about paused to smile at thought of have be interesting to talk to dr devizes of absurdity of contracted blind littleness in lived so long talked of great man really be great men really be incorporated great men same because in past be one in future may come together again have just separated to take hold of thing a hand separate into thumb finger talked of time when spirit be in made first hut launched first ship rode first horse must not remember great moment a exact incident recalled generally recalled blazing day when band of men went out across sandy desert for first time when man first stood upon glacier be slippery then remembered watching people heap up earth wall of first city went out against robber of first herd then dr devizes stood in imagination on sort of quarter deck watched men lugging great oar of galley took to iceland vinland saw planned great wall of china counted lateen sail upon grand canal see have built million wonderful temple made innumerable multititude of lovely sculpture painting jewel decoration have forgotten have have loved billion love have indeed to bring here have talked over dr devizes have not dreamt millionth part of what be when thought be sargon wholly solely still did not realize great inheritance enormous destiny even now be only beginning to see that be preposterous to think that who have past of effort adventure behind must have be content to run about woodford well in ridiculous suit of tweed with four breech be extremely heavy uncomfortable tickled know on hot day yet did did not realizing used to go on until must endure no longer then must have to stop scratch behind knee of course when called sargon king of king proposed to rule world be dr devizes called symbolizing of course everybody be really sargon king of king everybody ought to take hold of world save rule just a have got to do have concluded exposition have spread out disarticulated part before bobby just a devizes have returned to just what be going to do said bobby have be thinking of for little while continued to think becomes different said when one realizes that one be not only sargon thought of being great king great leader with rest of world just following doubt if ever felt quite up to job of sort couldnt see other way of being sargon king now do did best even when went to buckingham palace realized that thing be going to be too big for be telling dr devizes told that since be sargon king just a much a that almost anyone might become sargon king then wasnt case for palace throne longer for being proclaimed crowned such thing be a much out of date a flint implement that real thing be to be just kingly person work with other kingly person in world to make world worthy of high descent anyone who wake up to becomes kingly person can be active king even if remain king incognito one can be laundryman like be when be just preemby think of nothing profit need vanity fear of little laundryman how dull be one can be king descendant of ten thousand king joint heir to inheritance of human affair lord of generation still unborn who happens to be living in exile a laundryman paused agree with most of said bobby attractive so far be a plain a can be after that difficulty begin isnt enough just to say be king have to be king have to do cant be king not do kingly thing just there that dr devizes werent so clear there lot to be thought out what be kingly task in frail body what be be not clear yet mere fact that be not clear show clearly where have to begin have to get clear have to get knowledge find out about kingdom thats reasonable have to learn more about great inheritance great inheritance history of possibility of way of men who misrule have to learn about business economics money then when see plain have to exert vote work have to find out what particular gift have how may best give to kingdom king must glorify particular reign with particular gift agreed about so far know particular gift dr devizes say that so far a be concerned must work out human motif human relationship gift natural interest be for mental science have task meted out for kingly task for at present there isnt that much self knowledge have to begin lower down with broader question have to learn about universe about history of world empire of sargons of thing have neglected in dream littleness have to go to school again to learn how to think harder dont mind fatigue be impatient when think of lie before reading inquiry visit to museum suchlike place want to get up right away begin have lived so unobservant irresponsible life be puzzled how to account for year have spent have mooned away be glad have awakened to kingship before be too late be quite young man still be little past forty be nothing half of be childhood boyhood much of rest inattention for know may live for forty year im not half through may be best year full year can spend three four just learning learning round world will begin to find out politics why men woman be servile little minded will begin to realize how can extend to others great liberation have come to will begin to have political life man who have political life be like rat life in ship rather than like man who navigates then within will begin to find own proper life particular task be premature think be very greatly drawn to riddle of madness asylum understand why there be madness puzzle distress dr devizes agrees with that when thing puzzle distress mind thing to do be to gather knowledge idea one can about scientifically presently cease to distress interest occupies when be in place talked to of poor creature be very sorry for made promise to help when kingdom came now begin to see what kingdom be way in must enter in to posse perhaps in good time will learn spread knowledge about asylum make thing better in so that will not simply imprison people help cure be dr devizes idea think may have worked out together that there be real important purpose in madness be sort of simplification removal of check control sort of natural experiment secret thing of mind be laid bare then if poor soul be to suffer sort of thing to yield knowledge for others ought to be treated properly ought to be cherished made utmost use of not handed over to such brute a have cant tell not yet brute be in sane moment have sane moment lunatic ought to be comforted told queer little round face with sprouting moustache pale blue eye stared at bobby when first saw said sargon did not realize in least how thing really be between be still wrapped up in vaingloriousness thought be great prophet teacher king that world have to obey thought be going to be first best nearest of disciple now know better about about other people be here not to be follower disciple to be fellow king have to work together with others who be awakened for kingdom great progress of mankind went on talking rather to than to bobby have always wanted to know thing now will have will really to know will be different now seems incredible that little while ago be bothered about what must do with time now be only eager to get at thing however long time may be know will be full be astonishing to that there have be flying in kingdom for dozen year have never be in aeroplane must look at world from aeroplane perhaps will need to go to india china suchlike strange wonderful country because too be part of inheritance need to know about jungle wilderness that have to subjugate have to see beast be under have to cherish destroy mercifully a necessity of kingdom may require be terrible thing even to be lord of beast beast wild tame be under dominion there be science wonderful work men do in laboratory marvellous discovery be care if understand may hinder how blind have be to splendour of life when think of thing can hardly endure to be here in bed be so impatient to get on with suppose must be patient with poor wheezing lung patient repeated looked at wrist watch have stopped can tell time at seven ought to take more of excellent tonic be working wonder in dont trouble nurse will be thinking of put fresh life into sargon did not live forty year more thirty twenty lived just day under seven week from conversation stayed in bed for two day after bobby returned to london then lambone also went became intractable a strength returned bothered nurse more more for book couldnt name describe for volume of encyclopdia britannica when declared that seven volume of monumental publication be surely a much a invalid must need at one time got up put on rough little dressing gown came paddling downstairs hrrmping resolutely to library after that got up for three day running fire be made in most bookish corner of downstairs room screen put to keep warm tonic be driving perhaps be too stimulating tonic must not stay in protected corner nurse seems to have be weak complaining character indisposed to act without authority telephoned through to devizes in london did not succeed in making clear to gravity of sargons misbehaviour crowning offence came when wouldnt go to bed at seven instead slipped out in overcoat wrapper indeed in slipper upon terrace before house bare ankle leg be exposed to cold wind slow moving periodic beam of light from lighthouse upon coast sweeping across phantom hill under clear starlight have drawn out processional light sirius that white splendour steadfast sprawling glory of orion be clear november night with frost in air nurse heard cough rushed out to be looking at sirius through lambones field glass have to drag in by main force lost temper there be ungracious struggle next day be in state to leave bed yet tossed about exposed inflamed chest in feeble attempt to read know nothing complained for while got better again then be highly probable that went to open window in night sat for long time wondering at star after came relapse week so of struggle then after phase of delirium came great weakness then one night death be quite alone when died bobby have not expected death at heard of from christina alberta with great astonishment have be told nothing of sargon being worse of misbehaviour have be thinking of rather enviously a growing steadily stronger better gratifying day by day happy expanding curiosity have looked forward presently to talk phase in odd belated adolescence be a though interesting story have come to abrupt end in middle a though concluding chapter have be torn out rudely unreasonably mood of frustrated sympathy lasted over cremation of sargon at golders green bobby went to queer ceremony arrived late with billy coffin held little body stood ready to glide into furnace church of england burial service have already begun there be very few people in chapel christina alberta in black have worn for mother be in front seat a chief mourner between paul lambone devizes behind with air of earnest support be harold fay crumb astonishingly in deep mourning following service meticulously in two prayer book unpleasant looking individual with very long pock marked sheep face small eye habitual looking black turned round stared at bobby a came in be accompanied by very large blonde lady who seemed to have slept in mourning under bed relation of deceased air of relationship be unmistakable behind young woman two detached old lady seemed to be indulging simple propensity for funeral service at large completed congregation christina alberta looked unusually small overshadowed by two odd men friend be grey day outside general effect of gathering be thin scattered damp chilly organ be playing a bobby came in thought have never heard le musical organ service a went on sounded more more trite theological insincere what old second hand damp mackintosh church of england be thought bobby for striving soul to wear then what can religion in world really be in face of normal death theologically one must rejoice when good man dy none of religion have have pluck to brazen out to extent none can get rid of effect of confrontation with blank amazing interrogation be there anything within coffin there heard cared jot for sombre mummery bobby thought converged upon still thing within coffin little face must be wearing waxen unaccustomed dignity round preposterously innocent blue eye must be closed little sunken where be thought hope now that bobby have listened to few week since sargon have talked of flying of visiting india china of doing noble work in world have said that life still lay before have seemed to be opening like flower on first sunny morning of belated spring be delusion door of death have slammed upon be already closing then surely hope have be life in if in anything be something of life life can not die be yonder that in coffin there be more than photographic impression cast garment paring of nail there be more of sargon now in bobby brain alone than in coffin sargon where be where be dream desire bobby became aware of voice of officiating clergyman driving high like flying bird over welter of thought men will say how be dead raised up with what body do come thou fool that thou sowest be not quickened unless die that thou sowest thou sowest not body will be bare grain may chance of wheat other grain god giveth body a hath pleased to seed own body queer tortuous ingenious fellow paul thought bobby now what exactly be driving at there queer fellow bad manner too with thou fool rather strained analogy about seed sown in corruption after seed be cleanest most living bit of vegetable matter must have have to be sown in clean mould growing plant manured perhaps not seed box there be queer insistence in discourse of difference discontinuity of new life what be to come be to be altogether different from what be sown bobby have never noted that before never noted how plainly apostle insisted that body earthly sort of body personality ever came back glory of celestial be one glory of terrestrial be there be one glory of sun glory of moon glory of star for one star differeth from star in glory what be drift of be translated properly what have paul be up against in corinth after why couldnt church speak to one living need instead of disinterring levantine argument that analogy of seed be after good one come from seed must die again be more immortal than plant came before clergyman be going too fast too to follow closely better get prayer book at home afterwards read o grave where be thy sting o death where be thy victory sting of death be sin strength of sin be in law there be following that sounded like nonsense one just missed implication be like listening to one who be too far off to be heard distinctly who made eloquent gesture noise service came to embarrassed pause everyone be motionless arrested man be born of woman hath short time to live cometh up be cut down like flower fleeth a be shadow set in motion by unseen hand coffin went gliding towards furnace door opened to receive there be deep roar sound like mighty rushing wind elemental chaotic sound life be faint dispersed film upon one little planet flame roar like great wind rush whirl out to remotest star in unfathomable depth of space that deep disorderly tumult be true voice of lifeless matter not of dead matter for what have never lived can not be dead of lifeless matter outside of beneath beyond life everyone in chapel seemed still bowed hushed dwarfed to minute dimension until furnace door have closed again upon soulless devouring clamour chapter fourth may at udimore bobby forgot that glimpse of elemental power that furnace door have given altogether for such thing remain naturally in mind inconvenience life voice of clergyman hustling argument of st paul along scene in crematorium chapel with little coffin waiting to be launched into eternity few still black mourner dotted among yellow bench came back to very vividly when paul lambone began to quote twist familiar sentence about contrast between corruptible incorruptible expand fantastic philosophy of own bobby have always intended to read that funeral service over again slowly judicially have never done so regretted now very much left paul of tarsus at mercy of paul lambone knew that paul lambone loved ingenious slight misquotation be very warm serenely still may evening lambones party sat after dinner in twilight just inside house on deck chair upon terrace looked out over marsh over still sea sky be like inside of deep blue globe on ever increasing multitude of starry midge be alighting rye winchelsea crouched low beneath black low lump with street light window so showing minutely receding out to sea be liner quite brightly lit with swift steadiness beam of nearer lighthouse swept distant flat came near lit face of talker lit room called church tower group of tree into existence dropped back into darkness forgot about passed on then presently be coming again thin white streak of light hurrying far away across level when one attention wandered from talk one became aware of abundance of nightingale be nightingale newly come from south one might be two be in tree close at hand others remoter wove gauze curtain of faint sweet sound over visible universe bobby sat on step between room terrace with back against pillar with empty coffee cup beside have put there by foot of christina alberta who be deep in big arm chair very still face be dim except when cigarette glowed showed red lit unfamiliar face yet afternoon have be most familiar thing in world to have kissed pulled ear have kissed bare shoulder clasped in arm devizes too be silent preoccupied sat over against christina alberta on other side of opening of room be so much in twilight except when lighthouse beam lit face only shining shoe sock be clearly visible to bobby there have be time when bobby have thought that devizes be in love with christina alberta have vague inexplicable feeling to extent be have be in love with devizes have sense of unfathomed deep in relationship did not know where deep lay if christina alberta loved devizes must have said so bobby knew of reason why must not to day have hugged kissed bobby so that be impossible to believe loved anyone else yet in last three four month have gone about with devizes lot bobby have seen mind responding changing with talk with man used to quote must say thing exactly like thing said have be great inconvenience trial to bobby preoccupation then suddenly found devizes wasnt lover at never must have be lover that day have proved that up to hilt now in state between pride servitude bobby sat at foot sat at foot close to devizes in darkness be remote full three yard away except for lambones unquenchable flow have not be very talkative party to night be le talkative than ever be too perfect margaret mean have sighed cant talk just thank god be alive have nestled into big deck chair upon terrace be girl have suddenly become apparent to bobby fortnight ago in london whom devizes intended to marry abruptly have come upon scene to destroy triangle have obsessed bobby imagination sweetly pretty fragile thing be in twilight seemed a faint fragrant a nightstock be wonderful pianist last night have played for two hour paul sister miss lambone have be evoked from somewhere in west of england to come be hostess to engaged couple bobby have tried to talk to christina alberta about margaret christina alberta hadnt wanted to talk about see said christina alberta compactly have opened whole world of music to thats what brought together shes clever shes very clear clever id never heard of until mentioned engagement theyve gone to concert together that sort of thing he known much longer than have known when did first meet devizes about time daddy came to midgard street a recently a hardly six month paul lambone took to to get advice about daddy have be going about for more than year thought be just music interested theyd seemed to be friend thought didnt mean to marry again just suddenly decided christina alberta reflected thats way with life bobby thing accumulate then suddenly decide have be undecided have made wait not said christina alberta with remarkable hardness in voice said decided seemed to feel there be still something to express just took hold of situation be bobby second visit to udimore paul lambone have suddenly seen fit to gather party apparently on spur of devizes engagement in interval bobby have seen christina alberta number of time developed immense sense of relationship to filled life have always be dreaming thing about from time when anticipated with blue eye fragile person always be did thing that tore dream to shred made profoundly interesting more more have become dependent upon for interest wanted to marry if only to make sure wouldnt lose interest of have refused twice without of grace proper to occasion fear bobby said wouldnt do im not woman take for never be said dont mind youre dearest companion said like way hair grows then why not make be companion for ever nothing more frightful said so dismissed proposal went about together spent much of spare time together except for distressing occasion when must suddenly throw over to go to theatre walk with devizes to go to devizes to talk never hesitated to throw over for devizes yet bobby got lot of didnt know much about theatre music hall restaurant dancing place sort of thing bobby be discreetly competent in province malmesburys felt deserted susan be vindictive in resentment at frequent absence from bed time ritual tessy bobby declared remained dearest friend when tried to tell about in old old fashion did when christina alberta be away with devizes naturally have to tell about christina alberta tessy declined in most emphatic way to be told about christina alberta be extremely surprising disappointing to bobby to find out how incapable tessy be of appreciating endless interestingness charm of christina alberta be blind spot in mind seemed to assume that christina alberta be better than must be whereas be much better estranged bobby tessy very much be great sorrow to bobby because christina alberta be good interesting beyond dispute be growing with tremendous rapidity mentally in knowledge of world time met seemed more of person with richer fuller more commanding idea seemed to be living moment of time be working now at royal college of science under macbride be taking hold of new study there with tremendous enthusiasm be in love with comparative anatomy bobby have always thought that comparative anatomy be dry pedantic stuff about bone declared lit up whole story of life for changed idea about world about profoundly be most romantic stuff have ever read thought about said make human history seem silly took three time to natural history museum at south kensington to show something of fine realization stirred mind made clear to how bone of wing scratch of flint must restore storm sunlight passion of ten million year ago then suddenly week ago christina alberta have consented to marry bobby have taken back two refusal way did made like everything else did astonishing disconcerting have confession to make for time until must think over thoroughly that confession seemed to bobby to explain refusal completely to clear up everything about got to take to hampton court did not go into garden because saw through park gate that chestnut of bushey avenue be in full blossom went instead by pond up under riotously flowering branch belated spring be coming now in hurry warm brilliant tree be glorious be a if bright green sea be splashing up warm creamy foam under shower of cannon shot blue sky hummed with light spring have come fast now that have begun to come said felt have something to say waited never know bobby year le than ever whether spring be happiest time in

embarrassing young couple have come down to udimore with devizes miss mean under ample protection of miss lambone almost a though have be appointed for other from beginning of thing at udimore there be further surprise perplexity for bobby day saturday christina alberta seemed to be not so much in love a in thoroughly bad temper seemed far more concerned by fact that devizes be going to marry miss mean than by generous devotion that bobby be prepared to lavish upon be inattentive to various little manuvres to get isolated with two couple played tennis after tea until be time to dress for dinner be badly out of practice fundamentally unorthodox margaret played with smoothness sweetness roused to pitch of viciousness only too evident to bobby fine perception seemed to bobby devizes also noted annoyance miss mean be blissfully unobservant of anything in world devizes on sunday morning christina alberta carried off bobby through distant cheerfulness of church bell for walk to brede castle announced to bobby that did not intend to marry bobby protested dont love havent kissed didnt hug havent ruffled hair then why dont want to marry want to marry anyone dont love anybody except of course even cant marry want to be loved bobby yes not to be married why not old reason took word about same dont want to marry bobby think because dont want to be bound up with anyones life dont

thats happened ill wait ten year for said bobby on chance of altering mind be dearest comforter said christina alberta stopped short suddenly have put hand upon shoulder clung to broken into wild passion of weeping wetting instead of wedding sobbed laughed oh poor bobby dear lover clung to for time then detached stood wiping eye christina alberta generally knew except for trace of tear if woman cant control emotion better said theyll have to go back to harem cant have way wont marry there man in world can marry im going to be free independent woman bobby from now on dont understand said bobby not because dont want to love be baffled bobby whispered seemed to glow bobby took back into arm held pressed cheek ear against hers kissed kissed again seemed to to mark own unworthiness that must think at time that there be such wonderful kiss in world a kiss flavoured with salt tear yet wasnt going to marry have snatched back from nevertheless be in arm be enormously perplexed at what be happening be quite clear that end of engagement be not to be end of love making anyhow here be love be so manifestly time for love high may ruled world about there be hawthorn tree white with blossom great bush of elder just breaking into flower bobby sat in gloaming with friend thought of thing have happened to day thought of christina alberta salt tear incessant intriguing strangeness of way be still immensely puzzled now in large restful contented fashion christina alberta be not to marry seemed nevertheless have kissed embraced be free to sit at foot for time be not even to humiliate by telling others be not to marry said nothing thought feeling be beyond word christina alberta too be darkly silent everyone indeed seemed preoccupied talk about view star coming of nightingale about migratory bird lighthouse rambled on for time died away be too full for talking silence lengthened wondered what must happen if nobody spoke more thought of christina alberta close behind began to quiver in being silence be becoming oppressive felt a though must no longer change attitude nobody stirred lambone saved situation be exactly six month ago to night sargon died upstairs said lambone paused seemed to answer unspoken question dont know when died exactly just faded out in night wish must have known said margaret mean after quite long interval bobby thought came round to sargon still young woman sitting in darkness behind ceased to dominate thought be moved to speak have to cough to clear throat hate to think of being burnt scattered said not so disagreeable said miss lambone a to think of body shut up in coffin decaying oh dont cried bobby death death hate to think of now when be spring time when whole world be so full of life remember be hope have be scattered dispersed anyhow be scattered dispersed be not boxed up locked up buried when be here last be like little boy who have just heard of world be going to fly going to india china going to learn about everything then do sort of splendid thing there be beastly bacteria at work in lung beating strength down none of be ever to happen when first heard be dead must not believe be dead said paul lambone there be reply to be made to paul adjusted shoulder blade little more comfortably against back of small deep sofa on sat more think over le dead seems to more important becomes dont agree with roothing dont find anything futile in life think be symbolically perfect have thought about endlessly talked said devizes endlessly given very helpful idea for treatment dont be ungrateful think that sargon be over have only just begun be becoming too professional with success devizes begin to take up case work off drop out of mind dont go on with learn dont sit about think about a do continue to think about sargon go on with because be still living being for have got new religion from religion of sargonism declare prophet of new dispensation be latest new religion there will always be new religion new religion will always be only one that matter religion be living thing what be alive must be continually dying be continually born again differently same believe in immortality mr lambone said miss mean wish must when try to imagine wit fail sometimes one seems to feel what might be on night like perhaps pretty clear voice died away in stillness a trail of falling star dy away paul large dark lump on dim pale sofa went on speaking immortality said be mystery one can only speak of in dark metaphor how can believe that of individual commonplace life be to have endless commonplace sequel be incredible nonsense yet go on living after death nevertheless when die be changed wise teacher have insisted upon that a roothing said be not boxed up buried forgotten real death be escape escape become what did say dispersed immortal life be endless consequence life be like line in great poem be unfinished yet be perfect poem line begin end have to be there once be there be there eternally nothing must follow if be not there star have not same glory life line stand out a more significant than others open new branch of subject start new point of view express something fresh be

parallel said lambone will tell doctrine said began to talk in clear miniature voice of be so like little mouse running out of mountain of person of sargon struggle with individuality of struggle in man between individual life something greater be also in there be streak of fantasy in what be saying touch of burlesque in constant use of theological religious phrasing withal profound sincerity in human being declared little laundryman battled with king of king expanded amplified theme ever again devizes must cut into monologue talk for time not so much to make objection a to restate amend amplify others said little margaret mean twice made soft sweet sound suggestive of intellectual sensuousness once christina alberta said very loudly then never mind go on relapsed for long time into silence must be felt bobby sat still sometimes listening intently sometimes with mind spreading out like uncared for stream into number of parallel channel argument be interesting to follow moving at side of be question of talker sincerity how much of stuff did lambone mean how much of what said be of piece with rest of observant self indulgent life life a humorous comment on universe be profoundly absurd how easily lambone played with phrase idea for men have lived died how widely have read thought to bring so many thing together produced great effect of erudition golden bough have at finger end talked of sacramental mystery of dozen cult from mithraism to ritual sacrifice of varying idea of personality have held swayed human life from fiji to yucatan now be in pre christian

presently devizes be talking devizes be great contrast to lambone talked different language did not seem nearly so clear clever to bobby a lambone did have effect of sincerity solidity of conviction that lambone lacked altogether intervention made that lambone said seem like wild picturesque parody of something be otherwise inexpressible lambone have air of casting verbal net for truth still eluded yet truth so remotely imperfectly apprehended be for of most important thing in life stripped of theological trapping devizes said to lambone new religion be simply statement of race have reached be now receding from maximum of individuation that turn now towards synthesis co operation will move back towards what call sargon great ruler will swallow up individual egotistical men in

mental substance new sort of people said bobby softly went off from listening to lambones lucid little voice into final recapitulation of puzzling thing christina alberta have said done day bobby be recalled to matter of talk by movement in chair behind lambones smooth voice be explaining so that doe not matter so much what achieve a what contribute cherished personal life men woman struggle to round off make noble perfect disappears from scheme of thing what matter more more be work one doe what matter le le be personal romance personal honour rather honour will go out of into work love

lived for noble tomb in order to leave sweet great memory behind soon will matter nothing to man work to know that will probably die in ditch misunderstood so long a get work done with last judgment ever to vindicate said devizes will not matter in least to agree of begin to feel like even now even if one have done nothing worth doing said paul lambone in voice be that faint quality of sigh of one who have crowned rather difficult uncertain card castle even if sargon have died unrescued in asylum world have thought mad same must have escaped imagination must have touched imagination of greater life came pause of edification then sigh of satisfaction from miss lambone never understood in least what brother be talking about adored when talked nobody thought have ever talked like must possibly talk like voice be so clear bright like best sort of print only sometimes wished have spectacle now miss lambone be to receive shock christina alberta suddenly came out of silence in have be sitting dont believe in said christina alberta out of depth of chair bobby be beginning to know voice of christina alberta very well knew now that be terrified at having to talk at same time desperately resolved to get something said knew too that be gripping hard at arm of chair glanced at devizes in instant lighthouse beam touched face bobby saw very intent watching christina alberta

for bringing contrite heart out of mess starting again a good little part of something dont fink oh know beat hand against wall not fault why dont take oh why dont dare miss lambone stirred rustled darkness be devizes spoke to christina alberta miss lambone became still dont take dont dare said dont defy law custom because there be other thing in life in not outside be more important to be why

voice be so young dear said devizes dear not so young not so actually young cried christina alberta if live to be eighty said christina alberta will ever be able to feel more than be feeling now why will always treat like child nowadays feeling isnt only measure said devizes even now to night be talking below belief be not egoistic adventurer take side on score of matter insist be communist for example oh just to smash up thing said christina alberta just to smash up everything no say that to night have told differently before have care for world want to help forward common interest develop

sullenly resolutely know that be faith said told about youve always told about bobby quick ear detected change in voice do remember first talk together do remember talk in lonsdale mew when dined together at italian place night just after have found other found other did not know then that faith meant suppression sacrifice discretion seems to do thought be something robust bold did not understand qualification since then have argued about thing argued day at kew garden day when took for walk over down to shere have threshed thing out why must argue again be giving in what can do give in soon will be sargonite with paul not summer not now night wonderful first night of summer to night rebel against renunciation fobbing off of individual with second best thing be going to be impossible absurd for last time want world from star to bottom of sea for myself for own hungry self between precious thing between love there vague question appeared vanished again on screen of bobby mind what have christina alberta renounced what be renouncing what be anyone renouncing have ear cheated have devizes called dear in front of margaret mean in face of circumstance of case seemed to bobby devizes be last person who ought to call christina alberta dear what be about fobbing off be really shameless plainness of speech atrocious confession something that misunderstood miss lambone stirred uneasily be a if evil spirit possessed christina alberta oh damn renunciation said with bitter gusto seemed to be sitting for moment in profound silence then nightingale became very audible think said miss lambone in silence that be getting just leetle chilly be so beautiful here said miss mean who be warm in miss lambones shawl perfectly beautiful how can talk of frustration added left sentence incomplete think said miss lambone will go in light candle be too wonderful night for electric light far too wonderful will just light candle fire perhaps will play something beautiful be such marvellous fire place here that blaze up at once dont know if have noticed new sort fire be on hearth draught below shape of back draw up love wood fire said miss lambone sighed rose slowly voluminously two day later bobby came into one of little study on garden side of paul lambones house paul have found out that bobby wanted few day of uninterrupted thought in to begin novel have asked to stay on after other guest have returned to london be perfect room for writer of bobby temperament have low writing table close to sill of casemented window on sill be silver bowl of forget nots white tulip little glass paned door released one into garden without one having to go back through house writing table have everything fastidious writer must desire pleasant paper rack wafer real quill pen plenty of elbow room chair sat in be arm chair immensely comfortable not too luxurious hint of repose in only completely loyal support for working occupant garden path ran up hill from window garden path skirted by wonderful cluster of pansy on side of pansy be rose bush though not rosebud be showing yet fresh green leaf tinged with ruddy brown be very exquisite in light stood looking up path for time then sat down drew writing pad towards took one of delightful quill tested delicious flexibility of point dipped in ink wrote in very neat beautiful handwriting ups down pedestrian novel by robert roothing chapter first introduces hero wrote very readily because be very familiar to from first to last have written on fair fresh sheet of paper perhaps dozen time then stopped short sat quite still with head on one side then very neatly corrected introduces into in introduce be nearly two year now since have first begun novel in fashion be still quite uncertain about detail of hero introduction original intention about story still floated pleasantly in sky of mind promise of happy succession of fine various delightful adventure told easily good humouredly fortune of kindly unpretending not too brave brave enough young man on way through world to live happily afterwards with delicious young woman picaresque be magic word none of adventure have a yet assumed concrete form in mind felt must come to definitely enough one day if one sat mused one half saw be assurance enough for so having rewritten title page neatly prettily fell into day dream be presently thinking round about christina alberta a good hero must bobby be always being puzzled by christina alberta always coming upon something seemed to clear up everything then being puzzled again now seemed to that really did know last fact of importance be to be known about overnight paul lambone have described how have taken to devizes to get advice how have blundered upon reality of parentage told story well a story writer must gave dramatic point evidently told tale of set intention because be time bobby knew lambone be aware of christina alberta engagement did not know nobody bobby knew that never intended to be married seemed to bobby made understanding of situation possible explained that watchful tenderness of devizes face suddenly betrayed by light of inadvertent dear explained position a though belonged to paul lambone instead of being rather unaccountable visitor excused vehement jealousy of margaret mean because evidently have become violently possessive of father have counted perhaps upon recognition being very much with doubt margaret mean stood in way of that be natural for christina alberta to want to be with devizes work with natural for to suspect anticipate resent intervening personality apart from magic of kinship be natural that two such subtle abundant personality must attract other greatly that devizes must have decided quite abruptly to marry margaret mean did not present difficulty to bobby be not thinking very closely about devizes margaret mean be pretty enough for anyone to want to marry there be time a bobby knew when sweet prettiness can stab one like arrow have evidently stabbed won devizes almost only thing gave bobby second thought more than second thought be christina alberta fluctuation of purpose why must have consented to marry then have changed mind so quickly definitely yet have retained a lover resolution not to marry seemed after just part of immense modernity because of group of new people in found seemed to bobby to be in way newest be boldest enterprise in living have ever met flare of hungry rebel individuality fascinated where in world be going must win out to free personal life desired must fail to find objective of work come upon disappointment solitude like creature have strayed world have terrified bobby in own person greatly terrified still more when thought of valiant little figure going out to challenge bobby be naturally inherently afraid instinct be for security protection kindliness help clung to aunt suzannah job for safety didnt believe christina alberta knew one tenth of danger ran of insult defeat humiliation neglect repulse fatigue lonely distress imagination presented tormenting picture of away there in dark confused immense blundering london a excessively fragile figure light on foot shock head erect arm akimbo unaware of monstrous ambushed danger now that began to understand began to understand great number of bright eyed adventurous difficult young woman have met in last few year have first dim realization of meaning of deep wide stir among womankind have won vote score of unprecedented freedom many of younger woman be doing work holding own exactly like men be painting drawing like men writing criticism like men writing play novel like men leading movement doing scientific work playing part in politics like men on reflection not exactly no still kept different didnt do thing in fashion one must call womanly without adding strange new meaning to womanly novel be writing interested immensely people like stella benson wrote book like anybody must not tell from work whether be man woman again be new george eliot perhaps be precursor perhaps former sort of woman writing when be not pretty book be kindly auntie book heard petticoat swish in page sexless new one bobby weighed word earlier generation of woman who wanted to be emancipated suppressed sex suppressed so fiercely that negative presence became dominant factor in life ceased to be positive woman became fantastically negative woman newer multitude be not so much repressing a forgetting sex making little of christina alberta have in way made nothing of sex not by struggling against by making cheap for a man make cheap for so that be thing of mere intermittent mood impulse for must go on to other thing going on to other thing imagination recurred to little figure resolved to conquer world for in defiance of tradition there be strong urgency in to start off to london in pursuit of to hover about intervene protect carry off to security knew wouldnt permit that sort of thing to happen anyhow hed have to be just friend companion to be at hand for if did encounter disaster stand by be queer thing that must want to stand by unsexed young woman be just what one must not expect be part perhaps of immense biological change of time in past specie have needed race specialized for child bearing child rearing now plainly didnt tremendous worshipful dignity of wife mother be not for woman longer must remain for certain sort of to take up if must vast multitude of woman be born now to miss that must become pretty nuisance who must presently cease to be pretty parasite on love respect for motherhood sham simulacrum others must break away to real individual life third sex perhaps in new world there must cease to be two sex only there must be recognized variety subdivision so bobby speculated for just a there be woman who did not want to bear child so there be men who did not want to lord over wife child must want to love same individual of social specie needed love to fail in need be to escape out of social life to lonely futility mutual comfort bobby quoted in past bobby have dreamt of love of child even now remembered a fact that have dreamt particularly of little girl of own that must protect explore now thought interest of christina alberta have blotted that out be extraordinary to to perceive how possessed be by must endure prospect of life just now unless be to include christina alberta a principal fact hed be use to unless respected couldnt hope to stand subordinate to more than must hope to be master in latter case shed rebel in former shed despise must have to stand side by side since be clever able resolved to work hard distinguish must word hard also distinguish too have to be equal remain keep equal that in fact be why be going to write great novel not just novel great one looked again at neatly written page ups down read pedestrian novel dawned upon that there be something profoundly wrong about that be to have be story of wandering about in world be story of happy adventure of well tempered mind in well understood scheme of thing bobby be beginning to realize that there be not there never have be world be there be only world have be world be to be new people whispered bobby dipped quill in ink made border of dot round title then suddenly crossed out three word ups down wrote instead new country might be title of novel that matter said bobby mused deeply then altered sub title to history of explorer scratched out explorer involuntary traveller said bobby finally put back pedestrian novel a sub title became aware of intermittent dull tapping following sound discovered thrush trying to break up snail on gravel path gravel path be too fine soft to give firm anvil for beating silly bird ought to find brick potsherd said bobby reflected suppose flower pot be shut up in shed dont like to see that bird wasting morning being disappointed wouldnt take minute got up let out by little glass door beside window went to find brick presently returned with did not go back into study because while have be looking for brick have seen young blackbird have got under strawberry netting be evidently scared out of silly wit so went back to see about blackbird minute passed did not reappear perhaps have found other fellow creature in trouble presently little breeze blew into study through open
