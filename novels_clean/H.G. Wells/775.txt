seeming unity self who can trace reintegration a morning after morning awaken flux confluence of countless factor interweaving rebuilding dim first stirring of soul growth synthesis of unconscious to subconscious sub conscious to dawning consciousness until at last recognise again a happens to most of after night sleep so be with graham at end of vast slumber dim cloud of sensation taking shape cloudy dreariness found vaguely somewhere recumbent faint alive pilgrimage towards personal being seemed to traverse vast gulf to occupy epoch gigantic dream be terrible reality at time left vague perplexing memory strange creature strange scenery a if from planet there be distinct impression too of momentous conversation of name must not tell what name be subsequently to recur of queer long forgotten sensation of vein muscle of feeling of vast hopeless effort effort of man near drowning in darkness then came panorama of dazzling unstable confluent scene graham became aware eye be open regarding unfamiliar thing be something white edge of something frame of wood moved head slightly following contour of shape went up beyond top of eye tried to think where might be did matter seeing be so wretched colour of thought be dark depression felt featureless misery of one who wake towards hour of dawn have uncertain sense of whisper footstep hastily receding movement of head involved perception of extreme physical weakness supposed be in bed in hotel at place in valley must not recall that white edge must have slept remembered now that have wanted to sleep recalled cliff waterfall again then recollected something about talking to passer by how long have slept what be sound of pattering foot rise fall like murmur of breaker on pebble put out languid hand to reach watch from

unexpectedly difficult left giddy weak amazed rubbed eye riddle of surroundings be confusing mind be quite clear evidently sleep have benefited be not in bed at a understood word lying naked on very soft yielding mattress in trough of dark glass mattress be partly transparent fact observed with strange sense of insecurity below be mirror reflecting greyly about arm saw with shock that skin be strangely dry yellow be bound curious apparatus of rubber bound so cunningly that seemed to pas into skin above below strange bed be placed in case of greenish coloured glass a seemed to bar in white framework of have first arrested attention in corner of case be stand of glittering delicately made apparatus for most part quite strange appliance though maximum minimum thermometer be recognisable slightly greenish tint of glass like substance surrounded on hand obscured what lay behind perceived be vast apartment of splendid appearance with very large simple white archway facing close to wall of cage be article of furniture table covered with silvery cloth silvery like side of fish couple of graceful chair on table number of dish with substance piled on bottle two glass realised that be intensely hungry must see human being after period of hesitation scrambled off translucent mattress tried to stand on clean white floor of little apartment have miscalculated strength however staggered put hand against glasslike pane before to steady for moment resisted hand bending outward like distended bladder then broke with slight report vanished pricked bubble reeled out into general space of hall greatly astonished caught at table to save knocking one of glass to floor rang did not break sat down in one of armchair when have little recovered filled remaining glass from bottle drank colourless liquid be not water with pleasing faint aroma taste quality of immediate support stimulus put down vessel looked about apartment lost none of size magnificence now that greenish transparency have intervened be removed archway saw led to flight of step going downward without intermediation of door to spacious transverse passage passage ran between polished pillar of white veined substance of deep ultramarine along came sound of human movement voice deep undeviating droning note sat now fully awake listening alertly forgetting viand in attention then with shock remembered that be naked casting about for covering saw long black robe thrown on one of chair beside wrapped about sat down again trembling mind be still surging perplexity clearly have slept have be removed in sleep here who be people distant crowd beyond deep blue pillar boscastle poured out partially drank glass of colourless fluid what be place place to sens seemed subtly quivering like thing alive looked about at clean beautiful form of apartment unstained by ornament saw that roof be broken in one place by circular shaft full of light a looked steady sweeping shadow blotted out passed came again passed beat beat that sweeping shadow have note of own in subdued tumult filled air must have called out only little sound came into throat then stood up with uncertain step of drunkard made way towards archway staggered down step tripped on corner of black cloak have wrapped about saved by catching at one of blue pillar passage ran down cool vista of blue purple ended remotely in railed space like balcony brightly lit projecting into space of haze space like interior of gigantic building beyond remote be vast vague architectural form tumult of voice rose now loud clear on balcony with back to gesticulating apparently in animated conversation be three figure richly dressed in loose easy garment of bright soft colouring noise of great multitude of people poured up over balcony once seemed top of banner passed once brightly coloured object pale blue cap garment thrown up into air perhaps flashed athwart space fell shout sounded like english there be reiteration of wake heard indistinct shrill cry abruptly three men began laughing have have have laughed one red haired man in short purple robe when sleeper wake when turned eye full of merriment along passage face changed whole man changed became rigid other two turned swiftly at exclamation stood motionless face assumed expression of consternation expression deepened into awe suddenly graham knee bent beneath arm against pillar collapsed limply staggered forward fell upon face chapter iv sound of tumult graham last impression before fainted be of clamorous ringing of bell learnt afterwards that be insensible hanging between life death for better part of hour when recovered sens be back on translucent couch there be stirring warmth at heart throat dark apparatus perceived have be removed from arm be bandaged white framework be still about greenish transparent substance have filled be altogether gone man in deep violet robe one of who have be on balcony be looking keenly into face remote insistent be clamour of bell confused sound suggested to mind picture of great number of people shouting together something seemed to fall across tumult door suddenly closed graham moved head what doe mean said slowly where be saw red haired man who have be first to discover voice seemed to be asking what have said be abruptly stilled man in violet answered in soft voice speaking english with slightly foreign accent so at least seemed to sleeper ear be quite safe be brought hither from where fell asleep be quite safe have be here time sleeping in trance said something further that graham must not hear little phial be handed across to graham felt cooling spray fragrant mist played over forehead for moment sense of refreshment increased closed eye in satisfaction better asked man in violet a graham eye reopened be pleasant faced man of thirty perhaps with pointed flaxen beard clasp of gold at neck of violet robe yes said graham have be asleep time in cataleptic trance have heard catalepsy may seem strange to at first can assure everything be well graham did not answer word served reassuring purpose eye went from face to face of three people about be regarding strangely knew

be hall of public exhibition if be must give warming piece of mind scarcely have that character in place of public exhibition must not have discovered naked then suddenly quite abruptly realised what have happened there be perceptible interval of suspicion dawn to knowledge abruptly knew that trance have lasted for vast interval a if by process of thought reading interpreted awe in face peered into looked at strangely full of intense emotion seemed read eye framed lip to speak must not queer impulse to hide knowledge came into mind almost at moment of discovery looked at bare foot regarding then silently impulse to speak passed be trembling exceedingly gave pink fluid with greenish fluorescence meaty taste assurance of returning strength grew that make feel better said hoarsely there be murmur of respectful approval knew now quite clearly made to speak again again must not pressed throat tried third time how long asked in level voice how long have be asleep considerable time said

advancing personage what be doing why be not warned surely must tell someone will suffer for man must be kept quiet be doorway closed doorway must be kept perfectly quiet must not be told have be told anything man with fair beard made inaudible remark graham looking over shoulder saw approaching very short fat thickset beardless man with aquiline nose heavy neck chin very thick black slightly sloping eyebrow that almost met over nose overhung deep grey eye gave face oddly formidable expression scowled momentarily at graham then regard returned to man with flaxen beard others said in voice of extreme irritation have better go go said red bearded man certainly go now see doorway be closed a go two men addressed turned obediently after one reluctant glance at graham instead of going through archway a expected walked straight to dead wall of apartment opposite archway then came strange thing long strip of apparently solid wall rolled up with snap hung over two retreating men fell again immediately graham be alone with new comer purple robed man with flaxen beard for space thickset man took not slightest notice of graham proceeded to interrogate other obviously subordinate upon treatment of charge spoke clearly in phrase only partially intelligible to graham awakening seemed not only matter of surprise of consternation annoyance to be evidently profoundly excited must not

through archway towards balcony tumult of shouting grew louder thickset man turned listened also cursed suddenly under breath turned eye upon graham with unfriendly expression be surge of many voice rising falling shouting screaming once came sound like blow sharp cry then snapping like crackling of dry stick graham strained ear to draw single thread of sound from woven tumult then perceived repeated again again certain formula for time doubted ear surely be word show sleeper show sleeper thickset man rushed suddenly to archway wild cried how do know do know be guessing there be perhaps

tailor muttered instruction to crop haired lad who answered in guttural tone with word graham did not recognise boy then went to conduct incomprehensible monologue in corner tailor pulled out number of slotted arm terminating in little disc pulling out until disc be flat against body of graham one at shoulder blade one at elbow one at neck so forth so that at last there be perhaps two score of

steel understand sire cried flaxen bearded man with hurried politeness be going to cut hair oh cried graham enlightened called capillotomist precisely be one of finest artist in world graham sat down abruptly flaxen bearded man disappeared capillotomist came forward with graceful gesture examined graham ear surveyed felt back of head must have sat down again to regard for howard audible impatience forthwith with rapid movement succession of deftly handled implement shaved graham chin clipped moustache cut arranged hair did without word with something of rapt air of poet inspired a soon a have finished graham be handed pair of shoe suddenly loud voice shouted seemed from piece of machinery in corner at once at once people know over city work be being stopped work be being stopped wait for nothing come shout appeared to perturb howard exceedingly by gesture seemed to graham that hesitated between two direction abruptly went towards corner where apparatus stood about little crystal ball a did so undertone of tumultuous shouting from archway have continued during occurrence rose to mighty sound roared a if be sweeping past fell again a if receding swiftly drew graham after with irresistible attraction glanced at thickset man then obeyed impulse in two stride be down step in passage in score be out upon balcony upon three men have be standing chapter v moving way went to railing of balcony stared upward exclamation of surprise at appearance movement of number of people came from spacious area below first impression be of overwhelming architecture place into looked be aisle of titanic building curving spaciously in direction overhead mighty cantilever sprang together across huge width of place tracery of translucent material shut out sky gigantic globe of cool white light shamed pale sunbeam filtered down through girder wire here there gossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passenger flung across chasm air be webbed with slender cable cliff of edifice hung above perceived a glanced upward opposite facade be grey dim broken by great archings circular perforation balcony buttress turret projection myriad of vast window intricate scheme of architectural relief athwart ran inscription horizontally obliquely in unfamiliar lettering here there close to roof cable of peculiar stoutness be fastened drooped in steep curve to circular opening on opposite side of space even a graham noted remote tiny figure of man clad in pale blue arrested attention little figure be far overhead across space beside higher fastening of one of festoon hanging forward from little ledge of masonry handling well nigh invisible string dependent from line then suddenly with swoop sent graham heart into mouth man have rushed down curve vanished through round opening on hither side of way graham have be looking up a came out upon balcony thing saw above opposed to have at first seized attention to exclusion of anything else then suddenly discovered roadway be not roadway at a graham understood such thing for in nineteenth century only road street be beaten track of motionless earth jostling rivulet of vehicle between narrow footways roadway be three hundred foot across moved moved save middle lowest part for moment motion dazzled mind then understood under balcony extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to graham right endless flow rushing along a fast a nineteenth century express train endless platform of narrow transverse overlapping slat with little interspaces permitted to follow curvature of street upon be seat here there little kiosk swept by too swiftly for to see what might be therein from nearest swiftest platform series of others descended to centre of space moved to right perceptibly slower than one above difference in pace be small enough to permit anyone to step from platform to one adjacent so walk uninterruptedly from swiftest to motionless middle way beyond middle way be series of endless platform rushing with varying pace to graham left seated in crowd upon two widest swiftest platform stepping from one to down step swarming over central space be innumerable wonderfully diversified multitude of people must not stop here shouted howard suddenly at side must come away at once graham made answer heard without hearing platform ran with roar people be shouting perceived woman girl with flowing hair beautifully robed with band crossing between breast first came out of confusion then perceived that dominant note in kaleidoscope of costume be pale blue that tailor boy have worn became aware of cry of sleeper what have happened to sleeper seemed a though rushing platform before be suddenly spattered with pale buff of human face then still more thickly saw pointing finger perceived that motionless central area of huge arcade just opposite to balcony be densely crowded with blue clad people sort of struggle have sprung into life people seemed to be pushed up running platform on side carried away against will must spring off so soon a be beyond thick of confusion run back towards conflict be sleeper verily be sleeper shouted voice be never sleeper shouted others more more face be turned to at interval along central area graham noted opening pit apparently head of staircase going down with people ascending out of descending into struggle seemed centred about one of nearest to people be running down moving platform to leaping dexterously from platform to platform clustering people on higher platform seemed to divide interest between point balcony number of sturdy little figure clad in uniform of bright red working methodically together be employed seemed in preventing access to descending staircase about crowd be rapidly accumulating brilliant colour contrasted vividly with whitish blue of antagonist for struggle be indisputable saw thing with howard shouting in ear shaking arm then suddenly howard be gone stood alone perceived that cry of sleeper grew in volume that people on nearer platform be standing up nearer swifter platform perceived be empty to right of far across space platform running in opposite direction be coming crowded passing away bare with incredible swiftness vast crowd have gathered in central space before eye dense swaying mass of people shout grew from fitful cry to voluminous incessant clamour sleeper sleeper yell cheer waving of garment cry of stop way be also cry name strange to graham sounded like ostrog slower platform be soon thick with active people running against movement so a to keep opposite to stop way cried agile figure ran up swiftly from centre to swift road nearest to be borne rapidly past shouting strange unintelligible thing ran back obliquely to central way one thing distinguished be indeed sleeper be indeed sleeper testified for space graham stood without movement then became vividly aware that concerned be pleased at wonderful popularity bowed seeking gesture of longer range waved arm be astonished at violence of uproar that provoked tumult about descending stairway rose to furious violence became aware of crowded balcony of men sliding along rope of men in trapeze like seat hurling athwart space heard voice behind number of people descending step through archway suddenly perceived that guardian howard be back again gripping arm painfully shouting inaudibly in ear turned howard face be white come back heard will stop way whole city will be in confusion perceived number of men hurrying along passage of blue pillar behind howard red haired man man with flaxen beard tall man in vivid vermilion crowd of others in red carrying stave people have anxious eager face get away cried howard why said graham see must come away said man in red in resolute voice face eye be resolute too graham glance went from face to face be suddenly aware of most disagreeable flavour in life compulsion one gripped arm be being dragged away seemed a though tumult suddenly became two a if shout have come in from wonderful roadway have sprung into passage of great building behind marvelling confused feeling impotent desire to resist graham be half led half thrust along passage of blue pillar suddenly found alone with howard in lift moving swiftly upward chapter vi hall of atlas from moment when tailor have bowed farewell to moment when graham found in lift be altogether barely five minute a yet haze of vast interval of sleep hung about a yet initial strangeness of being alive at in remote age touched everything with wonder with sense of irrational with something of quality of realistic dream be still detached astonished spectator still half involved in life what have seen especially last crowded tumult framed in setting of balcony have spectacular turn like thing witnessed from box of theatre understand said what be trouble mind be in whirl why be shouting what be danger have trouble said eye avoided graham enquiry be time of unrest in fact appearance waking just now have sort of connexion spoke jerkily like man not quite sure of breathing stopped abruptly understand said graham will be clearer later said howard glanced uneasily upward a though found progress of lift slow will understand better doubt when have seen way about little said graham puzzled will be be bound to be perplexing at present be so strange anything seems possible anything in detail even counting understand be different lift stopped stepped out into narrow very long passage between high wall along ran extraordinary number of tube big cable what huge place be said graham be one building what place be be one of city way for various public service light so forth be social trouble in great roadway place how be governed have still police several said howard several about fourteen understand very probably not social order will probably seem very complex to to tell truth understand very clearly nobody doe will perhaps bye bye have to go to council graham attention be divided between urgent necessity of inquiry people in passage hall be traversing for moment mind must be concentrated upon howard halting answer made then must lose thread in response to vivid unexpected impression along passage in hall people seemed to be men in red uniform pale blue canvas have be so abundant in aisle of moving way did not appear invariably men looked at saluted howard a passed have clear vision of entering long corridor there be number of girl sitting on low seat a though in class saw teacher only novel apparatus from fancied voice proceeded girl regarded conductor thought with curiosity astonishment be hurried on before must form clear idea of gathering judged knew howard not that wondered who be howard seemed be person of importance then be also merely graham guardian be odd there came passage in twilight into passage footway hung so that must see foot ankle of people going to fro thereon more of then vague impression of gallery of casual astonished passer by turning round to stare after two of with red clad guard stimulus of restorative have taken be only temporary be speedily fatigued by excessive haste asked howard to slacken speed presently be in lift have window upon great street space be glazed did not open be too high for to see moving platform below saw people going to fro along cable along strange frail looking ridge thence passed across street at vast height above crossed by mean of narrow bridge closed in with glass so clear that made giddy even to remember floor of also be of glass from memory of cliff between new quay boscastle so remote in time so recent in experience seemed to that must be near four hundred foot above moving way stopped looked down between leg upon swarming blue red multitude minute fore shortened struggling gesticulating still towards little balcony far below little toy balcony seemed where have so recently be standing thin haze glare of mighty globe of light obscured everything man seated in little open work cradle shot by from point still higher than little narrow bridge rushing down cable a swiftly almost a if be falling graham stopped involuntarily to watch strange passenger vanish in great circular opening below then eye went back to tumultuous struggle along one of swifter way rushed thick crowd of red spot broke up into individual a approached balcony went pouring down slower way towards dense struggling crowd on central area men in red appeared to be armed with stick truncheon seemed to be striking thrusting great shouting cry of wrath screaming burst out came up to graham faint thin go on cried howard laying hand on man rushed down cable graham suddenly glanced up to see whence came beheld through glassy roof network of cable girder dim rhythmically passing form like van of windmill between glimpse of remote pallid sky then howard have thrust forward across bridge be in little narrow passage decorated with geometrical pattern want to see more of cried graham resisting cried howard still gripping arm way must go way men in red following seemed ready to enforce order negro in curious wasp like uniform of black yellow appeared down passage one hastened to throw up sliding shutter have seemed door to graham led way through graham found in gallery overhanging end of great chamber attendant in black yellow crossed thrust up second shutter stood waiting place have appearance of ante room saw number of people in central space at opposite end large imposing doorway at top of flight of step heavily curtained giving glimpse of still larger hall beyond perceived white men in red other negro in black yellow standing stiffly about portal a crossed gallery heard whisper from below sleeper be aware of turning of head hum of observation entered little passage in wall of ante chamber then found on iron railed gallery of metal passed round side of great hall have already seen through curtain entered place at corner so that received fullest impression of huge proportion black in wasp uniform stood aside like well trained servant closed valve behind compared with of place graham have see thus far second hall appeared to be decorate with extreme richness on pedestal at remote end more brilliantly lit than other object be gigantic white figure of atlas strong strenuous globe upon bowed shoulder be first thing to strike attention be so vast so patiently painfully real so white simple save for figure for dais in centre wide floor of place be shining vacancy dais be remote in greatness of area must have looked mere slab of metal have not be for group of seven men who stood about table on gave inkling of proportion be dressed in white robe seemed to have arisen that moment from seat be regarding graham steadfastly at end of table perceived glitter of mechanical appliance howard led along end gallery until be opposite mighty labouring figure then stopped two men in red who have followed into gallery came stood on hand of graham must remain here murmured howard for few moment without waiting for reply hurried away along gallery why began graham moved a if to follow howard found path obstructed by one of men in red have to wait here sire said man in red why order sire whose order order sire graham looked exasperation what place be said presently who be men be lord of council sire council council oh said graham after equally ineffectual attempt at other man went to railing stared at distant men in white who stood watching whispering together council perceived there be now eight though how newcomer have arrived have not observed made gesture of greeting stood regarding a in nineteenth century group of men might have stood in street regarding distant balloon have suddenly floated into view what council must be that gathered there little body of men beneath significant white atlas secluded from eavesdropper in impressive spaciousness why must be brought to be looked at strangely spoken of inaudibly howard appeared beneath walking quickly across polished floor towards a drew near bowed performed certain peculiar movement apparently of ceremonious nature then ascended step of dais stood by apparatus at end of table graham watched that visible inaudible conversation occasionally one of white robed men must glance towards strained ear in vain gesticulation of two of speaker became animated glanced from to passive face of attendant when looked again howard be extending hand moving head like man who protest be interrupted seemed by one of white robed men rapping table conversation lasted interminable time to graham sense eye rose to still giant at whose foot council sat thence wandered at last to wall of hall be decorated in long painted panel of quasi japanese type many of very beautiful panel be grouped in great elaborate framing of dark metal passed into metallic caryatidae of gallery great structural line of interior facile grace of panel enhanced mighty white effort laboured in centre of scheme graham eye came back to council howard be descending step a drew nearer feature must be distinguished graham saw that be flushed blowing out cheek countenance be still disturbed when presently reappeared along gallery way said concisely went on in silence to little door opened at approach two men in red stopped on side of door howard graham passed in graham glancing back saw white robed council still standing in close group looking at then door closed behind with heavy thud for first time since awakening be in silence floor even be noiseless to foot howard opened door be in first of two contiguous chamber furnished in white green what council be that began graham what be discussing what have to do with howard closed door carefully heaved huge sigh said something in undertone walked slanting way across room turned blowing out cheek again ugh grunted man relieved graham stood regarding must understand began howard abruptly avoiding graham eye that social order be very complex half explanation bare unqualified statement must give false impression a matter of fact be case of compound interest partly small fortune fortune of cousin warming be left to certain other beginning have become very considerable in other way will be hard for to understand have become person of significance of very considerable significance involved in world affair stopped yes said graham have grave social trouble yes thing have come to pas that in fact be advisable to seclude here keep prisoner exclaimed graham well to ask to keep in seclusion graham turned on be strange said harm will be done harm must be kept here while learn position presume precisely very well then begin why harm not now why not be too long story sire more reason must begin at once say be person of importance what be that shouting why be great multitude shouting excited because trance be over who be men in white in huge council chamber in good time sire said howard not crudely not crudely be one of flimsy time when man have settled mind awakening one expected awakening council be consulting what council council saw graham made petulant movement be not right said must be told what be happening must wait really must wait graham sat down abruptly suppose since have waited so long to resume life said that must wait little longer be better said howard yes be much better must leave alone for space while attend discussion in council be sorry went towards noiseless door hesitated vanished graham walked to door tried found securely fastened in way never came to understand turned about paced room restlessly made circuit of room sat down remained sitting for time with folded arm knitted brow biting finger nail trying to piece together kaleidoscopic impression of first hour of awakened life vast mechanical space endless series of chamber passage great struggle roared splashed through strange way little group of remote unsympathetic men beneath colossal atlas howard mysterious behaviour there be inkling of vast inheritance already in mind vast inheritance perhaps misapplied of unprecedented importance opportunity what have to do room secluded silence be eloquent of imprisonment came into graham mind with irresistible conviction that series of magnificent impression be dream tried to shut eye succeeded that time honoured device led to awakening presently began to touch examine unfamiliar appointment of two small room in found in long oval panel of mirror saw stopped astonished be clad in graceful costume of purple bluish white with little greyshot beard trimmed to point hair blackness streaked now with band of grey arranged over forehead in unfamiliar graceful manner seemed man of five forty perhaps for moment did not perceive be flash of laughter came with recognition to call on old warming like exclaimed make take out to lunch then thought of meeting first one then of few familiar acquaintance of early manhood in midst of amusement realised that soul with whom might jest have died many score of year ago thought smote abruptly keenly stopped short expression of face changed to white consternation tumultuous memory of moving platform huge facade of wonderful street reasserted shouting multitude came back clear vivid remote inaudible unfriendly councilors in white felt little figure very small ineffectual pitifully conspicuous about world be strange chapter vii in silent room presently graham resumed examination of apartment curiosity kept moving in spite of fatigue inner room perceived be high ceiling dome shaped with oblong aperture in centre opening into funnel in wheel of broad fan seemed to be rotating apparently driving air up shaft faint humming note of easy motion be only clear sound in quiet place a van sprang up one after other graham must get transient glimpse of sky be surprised to see star drew attention to fact that bright lighting of room be due to multitude of very faint glow lamp set about cornice there be window began to recall that along vast chamber passage have traversed with howard have observed no window at have there be window there be window on street indeed be for light be whole city lit day night for evermore so that there be night there thing dawned upon there be fireplace in room be season summer be merely summer apartment be whole city uniformly heated cooled became interested in question began examining smooth texture of wall simply constructed bed ingenious arrangement by labour of bedroom service be practically abolished over everything be curious absence of deliberate ornament bare grace of form colour that found very pleasing to eye there be several very comfortable chair light table on silent runner carrying several bottle of fluid glass two plate bearing clear substance like jelly then noticed there be book newspaper writing material world have changed indeed said observed one entire side of outer room be set with row of peculiar double cylinder inscribed with green lettering on white that harmonized with decorative scheme of room in centre of side projected little apparatus about yard square having white smooth face to room chair faced have transitory idea that cylinder might be book modern substitute for book at first did not seem so lettering on cylinder puzzled at first sight seemed like russian then noticed suggestion of mutilated english about certain of word oi man huwdbi kin forced on a man who must be king phonetic spelling said remembered reading story with title then recalled story vividly one of best story in world thing before be not book a understood puzzled out title of two adjacent cylinder heart of darkness have never heard of before 'the madonna of future doubt if be indeed story be by post victorian author puzzled over peculiar cylinder for time replaced then turned to square apparatus examined that opened sort of lid found one of double cylinder within on upper edge little stud like stud of electric bell pressed rapid clicking began ceased became aware of voice music noticed play of colour on smooth front face suddenly realised what might be stepped back to regard on flat surface be now little picture very vividly coloured in picture be figure moved not only did move be conversing in clear small voice be exactly like reality viewed through inverted opera glass heard through long tube interest be seized at once by situation presented man pacing up down vociferating angry thing to pretty petulant woman be in picturesque costume seemed so strange to graham have worked said man what have be doing ah said graham forgot everything else sat down in chair within five minute heard named heard when sleeper wake used jestingly a proverb for remote postponement passed by thing remote incredible in little while knew two people like intimate friend at last miniature drama came to end square face of apparatus be blank again be strange world into have be permitted to see unscrupulous pleasure seeking energetic subtle world too of dire economic struggle there be allusion did not understand incident conveyed strange suggestion of altered moral ideal flash of dubious enlightenment blue canvas bulked so largely in first impression of city way appeared again again a costume of common people have doubt story be contemporary intense realism be undeniable end have be tragedy oppressed sat staring at blankness started rubbed eye have be so absorbed in latter day substitute for novel that awoke to little green white room with more than touch of surprise of first awakening stood up abruptly be back in own wonderland clearness of kinetoscope drama passed struggle in vast place of street ambiguous council swift phase of waking hour came back people have spoken of council with suggestion of vague universality of power have spoken of sleeper have not really struck vividly at time that be sleeper have to recall precisely what have said walked into bedroom peered up through quick interval of revolving fan a fan swept round dim turmoil like noise of machinery came in rhythmic eddy else be silence though perpetual day still irradiated apartment perceived little intermittent strip of sky be now deep blue black almost with dust of little star resumed examination of room must find way of opening padded door bell other mean of calling for attendance feeling of wonder be in abeyance be curious anxious for information wanted to know exactly how stood to new thing tried to compose to wait until someone came to presently became restless eager for information for distraction for fresh sensation went back to apparatus in other room have soon puzzled out method of replacing cylinder by others a did so came into mind that must be little appliance have fixed language so that be still clear understandable after two hundred year haphazard cylinder substituted displayed musical fantasia at first be beautiful then be sensuous presently recognized what appeared to to be altered version of story of tannhauser music be unfamiliar rendering be realistic with contemporary unfamiliarity tannhauser did not go to venusberg to pleasure city what be pleasure city dream surely fancy of fantastic voluptuous writer became interested curious story developed with flavour of strangely twisted sentimentality suddenly did not like liked le a proceeded have revulsion of feeling be picture idealisation photographed reality wanted more of twenty second century venusberg forgot part played by model in nineteenth century art gave way to archaic indignation rose angry half ashamed at for witnessing thing even in solitude pulled forward apparatus with violence sought for mean of stopping action something snapped violet spark stung convulsed arm thing be still when attempted next day to replace tannhauser cylinder by pair found apparatus broken struck out path oblique to room paced to fro struggling with intolerable vast impression thing have derived from cylinder thing have seen conflicted confused seemed to most amazing thing of in thirty year of life have never tried to shape picture of coming time be making future said hardly of troubled to think what future be making here be what have got to what have be done how do come into midst of vastness of street house be prepared for multitude of people conflict in city way systematised sensuality of class of rich men thought of bellamy hero of whose socialistic utopia have so oddly anticipated actual experience here be utopia socialistic state have already seen enough to realise that ancient antithesis of luxury waste sensuality on one hand abject poverty on other still prevailed knew enough of essential factor of life to understand correlation not only be building of city gigantic crowd in street gigantic voice have heard in way uneasiness of howard very atmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent what country be in still england seemed yet strangely un english mind glanced at rest of world saw only enigmatical veil prowled about apartment examining everything a caged animal might do felt very tired felt that feverish exhaustion doe not admit of rest listened for long space under ventilator to catch distant echo of tumult felt must be proceeding in city began to talk to two hundred three year said to over over again laughing stupidly then be two hundred thirty three year old oldest inhabitant surely have reversed tendency of time gone back to rule of oldest claim be indisputable mumble mumble remember bulgarian atrocity a though be yesterday 't be great age have have be surprised at first to hear laughing then laughed again deliberately louder then realised that be behaving foolishly steady said steady pacing became more regular new world said understand why be why suppose can fly do sort of thing let try remember just how began be surprised at first to find how vague memory of first thirty year have become remembered fragment for most part trivial moment thing of great importance that have observed boyhood seemed most accessible at first recalled school book certain lesson in mensuration then revived more salient feature of life memory of wife long since dead magic influence now gone beyond corruption of rival friend betrayer of swift decision of issue then of last year of misery of fluctuating resolve at last of strenuous study in little while perceived have all again dim perhaps like metal long laid aside in way defective injured capable of re polishing hue of be deepening misery be worth re polishing by miracle have be lifted out of life have become intolerable reverted to present condition wrestled with fact in vain became inextricable tangle saw sky through ventilator pink with dawn old persuasion came out of dark recess of memory must sleep said appeared a delightful relief from mental distress from growing pain heaviness of limb went to strange little bed lay down be presently asleep be destined to become very familiar indeed with apartment before left for remained imprisoned for three day during time one except howard entered prison marvel of fate mingled with in way minimised marvel of survival have awakened to mankind seemed only to be snatched away into unaccountable solitude howard came regularly with subtly sustaining nutritive fluid light pleasant food quite strange to graham always closed door carefully a entered on matter of detail be increasingly obliging bearing of graham on great issue be evidently being contested so closely beyond soundproof wall that enclosed must not elucidate evaded a politely a possible question on position of affair in outer world in three day graham incessant thought went far wide that have seen elaborate contrivance to prevent seeing worked together in mind almost possible interpretation of position debated even a chanced right interpretation thing presently happened to came to at last credible by virtue of seclusion when at moment of release arrived found prepared howard bearing went far to deepen graham impression of own strange importance door between opening closing seemed to admit with breath of momentous happening enquiry became more definite searching howard retreated through protest difficulty awakening be unforeseen repeated happened to have fallen in with trend of social convulsion to explain must tell history of gross half of year protested howard thing be said graham be afraid of something will do in way be arbitrator might be arbitrator be not that have may tell much automatic increase of property put great possibility of interference in hand in certain other way have influence with eighteenth century notion nineteenth century corrected graham with old world notion anyhow ignorant a be of feature of state be fool certainly not do seem to be sort of man who must act rashly be never expected to act at one counted on awakening one dreamt must ever awake council have surrounded with antiseptic condition a matter of fact thought that be dead mere arrest of decay be too complex dare not suddenly while be still half awake wo do said graham suppose be a say why be not being crammed night day with fact warning wisdom of time to fit for responsibility be wiser now than two day ago if be two day when awoke howard pulled lip be beginning to feel hour feel more clearly sense of complex concealment of be salient point be council committee whatever be cooking account of estate be that that note of suspicion said howard ugh said graham now mark word will be ill for who have put here will be ill be alive make doubt of be alive day pulse be stronger mind clearer more vigorous more quiescence be man come back to life want to live live howard face lit with idea came towards graham spoke in easy confidential tone council secludes here for good be restless naturally energetic man find dull here be anxious that everything may desire desire sort of desire there may be something be there sort of company paused meaningly yes said graham thoughtfully there be ah now have treated neglectfully crowd in yonder street of yours said howard be afraid graham began pacing room howard stood near door watching implication of howard suggestion be only half evident to graham company suppose be to accept proposal demand sort of company must there be possibility of gathering from conversation of additional person vague inkling of struggle have broken out so vividly at waking moment meditated again suggestion took colour turned on howard abruptly what do mean by company howard raised eye shrugged shoulder human being said with curious smile on heavy face social idea said have certain increased liberality perhaps in comparison with time if man wish to relieve tedium a by feminine society for instance think scandal have cleared mind of formula there be in city class necessary class no longer despised discreet graham stopped dead must pas time said howard be thing must perhaps have thought of before a matter of fact so much be happening indicated exterior world graham hesitated for moment figure of possible woman that imagination suddenly created dominated mind with intense attraction then flashed into anger no shouted began striding rapidly up down room everything say everything do convinces of great issue in be concerned want to pas time a call yes know desire indulgence be life in sense death extinction in life before slept have worked out that pitiful question will not begin again there be city multitude meanwhile be here like rabbit in bag rage surged high choked for moment began to wave clenched fist gave way to anger fit swore archaic curse gesture have quality of physical threat know who party may be be in dark keep in dark know be secluded here for good purpose for good purpose warn warn of consequence once come at power realised that to threaten thus might be danger to stopped howard stood regarding with curious expression take be message to council said howard graham have momentary impulse to leap upon man fell stun must have shown upon face at rate howard movement be quick in second noiseless door have closed again man from nineteenth century be alone for moment stood rigid with clenched hand half raised then flung down what fool have be said gave way to anger again stamping about room shouting curse for long time kept in sort of frenzy raging at position at own folly at knave who have imprisoned did because did not want to look calmly at position clung to anger because be afraid of fear presently found reasoning with imprisonment be unaccountable doubt legal form new legal form of time permitted must of course be legal people be two hundred year further on in march of civilisation than victorian generation be not likely must be le humane yet have cleared mind of formula be humanity formula a well a chastity imagination set to work to suggest thing might be done to attempt of reason to dispose of suggestion though for most part logically valid be quite unavailing why must anything be done to if worst come to worst found saying at last can give up what want what do want why ask for instead of cooping up returned to former preoccupation with council possible intention began to reconsider detail of howard behaviour sinister glance inexplicable hesitation then for time mind circled about idea of escaping from room whither must escape into vast crowded world must be worse off than saxon yeoman suddenly dropped into nineteenth century london besides how must anyone escape from room how can benefit anyone if harm must happen to thought of tumult great social trouble of be so unaccountably axis text irrelevant enough yet curiously insistent came floating up out of darkness of memory also council have said be expedient for one man must die for people chapter viii roof space a fan in circular aperture of inner room rotated permitted glimpse of night dim sound drifted in thereby graham standing underneath wrestling darkly with unknown power imprisoned have now deliberately challenged be startled by sound of voice peered up saw in interval of rotation dark dim face shoulder of man regarding when dark hand be extended swift fan struck swung round beat on with little brownish patch on edge of thin blade something began to fall therefrom upon floor dripping silently graham looked down there be spot of blood at foot looked up again in strange excitement figure have gone remained motionless sense intent upon flickering patch of darkness for outside be high night became aware of faint remote dark speck floating lightly through outer air came down towards fitfully eddyingly passed aside out of uprush from fan gleam of light flickered speck flashed white then darkness came again warmed lit a be perceived that be snowing within few foot of graham walked across room came back to ventilator again saw head of man pas near there be sound of whispering then smart blow on metallic substance effort voice van stopped gust of snowflake whirled into room vanished before touched floor be afraid said voice graham stood under fan who be whispered for moment there be nothing swaying of fan then head of man be thrust cautiously into opening face appeared nearly inverted to graham dark hair be wet with dissolving flake of snow upon arm went up into darkness holding something unseen have youthful face bright eye vein of forehead be swollen seemed to be exerting to maintain position for several second graham spoke be sleeper said stranger at last yes said graham what do want with come from ostrog sire ostrog man in ventilator twisted head round so that profile be towards graham appeared to be listening suddenly there be hasty exclamation intruder sprang back just in time to escape sweep of released fan when graham peered up there be nothing visible slowly falling snow be perhaps quarter of hour before anything returned to ventilator at last came same metallic interference again fan stopped face reappeared graham have remained time in same place alert tremulously excited who be what do want said want to speak to sire said intruder want ca hold thing have be trying to find way to three day be rescue whispered graham escape yes sire if will be party party of sleeper yes sire what be to do said graham there be struggle stranger arm appeared hand be bleeding knee came into view over edge of funnel stand away from said dropped rather heavily on hand one shoulder at graham foot released ventilator whirled noisily stranger rolled over sprang up nimbly stood panting hand to bruised shoulder with bright eye on graham be indeed sleeper said saw asleep when be law that anyone might see be man who be in trance said graham have imprisoned here have be here since awoke at least three day intruder seemed about to speak heard something glanced swiftly at door suddenly left graham ran towards shouting quick incoherent word bright wedge of steel flashed in hand began tap tap quick succession of blow upon hinge mind cried voice oh voice came from above graham glanced up saw sol of two foot ducked be struck on shoulder by one of heavy weight bore to earth fell on knee forward weight went over head knelt up saw second man from above seated before did not see sire panted man rose assisted graham to arise be hurt sire panted succession of heavy blow on ventilator began something fell close to graham face shivering edge of white metal danced fell over lay flat upon floor what be cried graham confused looking at ventilator who be what be going to do remember understand nothing stand back said stranger drew from under ventilator a fragment of metal fell heavily want to come sire panted newcomer graham glancing at face again saw new cut have changed from white to red on forehead couple of little trickle of blood starting therefrom people call for come where people to hall about market life be in danger here have spy learned just in time council have decided very day to drug kill everything be ready people be drilled wind vane police engineer way gearers be with have hall crowded shouting whole city shout against council have arm wiped blood with hand life here be not worth why arm people have risen to protect sire what turned quickly a man who have first come down made hissing with teeth graham saw latter start back gesticulate to to conceal move a if to hide behind opening door a did so howard appeared little tray in one hand heavy face downcast started looked up door slammed behind tray tilted sideways steel wedge struck behind ear went down like felled tree lay a fell athwart floor of outer room man who have struck bent hastily studied face for moment rose returned to work at door poison said voice in graham ear then abruptly be in darkness innumerable cornice light have be extinguished graham saw aperture of ventilator with ghostly snow whirling above dark figure moving hastily three knelt on fan dim thing ladder be being lowered through opening hand appeared holding fitful yellow light have moment of hesitation manner of men swift alacrity word marched so completely with own fear of council with idea hope of rescue that lasted not moment people awaited understand said trust tell what to do man with cut brow gripped graham arm clamber up ladder whispered quick will have heard graham felt for ladder with extended hand put foot on lower rung turning head saw over shoulder of nearest man in yellow flicker of light first comer astride over howard still working at door graham turned to ladder again be thrust by conductor helped up by above then be standing on something hard cold slippery outside ventilating funnel shivered be aware of great difference in temperature dozen men stood about light flake of snow touched hand face melted for moment be dark then for flash ghastly violet white then everything be dark again saw have come out upon roof of vast city structure have replaced miscellaneous house street open space of victorian london place upon stood be level with huge serpentine cable lying athwart in direction circular wheel of number of windmill loomed indistinct gigantic through darkness snowfall roared with varying loudness a fitful white light smote up from below touched snow eddy with transient glitter made evanescent spectre in night here there low down vaguely outlined wind driven mechanism flickered with livid spark appreciated in fragmentary manner a rescuer stood about someone threw thick soft cloak of fur like texture about fastened by buckled strap at waist shoulder thing be said briefly decisively someone thrust forward before mind be yet clear dark shape gripped arm way said shape urging along pointed graham across flat roof in direction of dim semicircular haze of light graham obeyed mind said voice a graham stumbled against cable between not across said voice must hurry where be people said people said awaited stranger did not answer left graham arm a path grew narrower led way with rapid stride graham followed blindly in minute found running be others coming panted received reply companion glanced back ran on came to sort of pathway of open metal work transverse to direction have come turned aside to follow graham looked back snowstorm have hidden others come on said guide running now drew near little windmill spinning high in air stoop said graham guide avoided endless band running roaring up to shaft of vane way be ankle deep in gutter full of drifted thawing snow between two low wall of metal presently rose waist high will go first said guide graham drew cloak about followed then suddenly came narrow abyss across gutter leapt to snowy darkness of further side graham peeped over side once gulf be black for moment regretted flight dared not look again brain spun a waded through half liquid snow then out of gutter clambered hurried across wide flat space damp with thawing snow for extent dimly translucent to light went to fro underneath hesitated at unstable looking substance guide ran on unheeding so came to clambered up slippery step to rim of great dome of glass round went far below number of people seemed to be dancing music filtered through dome graham fancied heard shouting through snowstorm guide hurried on with new spurt of haste clambered panting to space of huge windmill one so vast that only lower edge of van came rushing into sight rushed up again be lost in night snow hurried for time through colossal metallic tracery of support came at last above place of moving platform like place into graham have looked from balcony crawled across sloping transparency covered street of platform crawling on hand knee because of slipperiness of snowfall for most part glass be bedewed graham saw only hazy suggestion of form below near pitch of transparent roof glass be clear found looking sheerly down upon for awhile in spite of urgency of guide gave way to vertigo lay spread eagled on glass sick paralysed far below mere stirring speck dot went people of unsleeping city in perpetual daylight moving platform ran on incessant journey messenger men on unknown business shot along drooping cable frail bridge be crowded with men be like peering into gigantic glass hive lay vertically below with only tough glass of unknown thickness to save from fall street showed warm lit graham be wet now to skin with thawing snow foot be numbed with cold for space must not move come on cried guide with terror in voice come on graham reached pitch of roof by effort over ridge following guide example turned about slid backward down opposite slope very swiftly amid little avalanche of snow while be sliding thought of what must happen if broken gap must come in way at edge stumbled to foot ankle deep in slush thanking heaven for opaque footing again guide be already clambering up metal screen to level expanse through spare snowflake above loomed line of vast windmill then suddenly amorphous tumult of rotating wheel be pierced with deafening sound be mechanical shrilling of extraordinary intensity seemed to come simultaneously from point of compass have missed already cried graham guide in accent of terror suddenly with blinding flash night became day above driving snow from summit of wind wheel appeared vast mast carrying globe of livid light receded in illimitable vista in direction a far a eye must penetrate snowfall glared get on cried graham conductor thrust forward to long grating of snowless metal ran like band between two slightly sloping expanse of snow felt warm to graham benurrled foot faint eddy of steam rose from come on shouted guide ten yard off without waiting ran swiftly through incandescent glare towards iron support of next range of wind wheel graham recovering from astonishment followed a fast convinced of imminent capture in score of second be within tracery of glare black shadow shot with moving bar beneath monstrous wheel graham conductor ran on for time suddenly darted sideways vanished into black shadow in corner of foot of huge support in moment graham be beside cowered panting stared out scene upon graham looked be very wild strange snow have now almost ceased only belated flake passed now again across picture broad stretch of level before be ghastly white broken only by gigantic mass moving shape lengthy strip of impenetrable darkness vast ungainly titan of shadow about huge metallic structure iron girder inhumanly vast a seemed to interlaced edge of wind wheel scarcely moving in lull passed in great shining curve steeper steeper up into luminous haze wherever snow spangled light struck down beam girder incessant band running with halting indomitable resolution passed upward downward into black with mighty activity with omnipresent sense of motive design snow clad desolation of mechanism seemed void of human presence save seemed a trackless deserted unfrequented by men a inaccessible alpine snowfield will be chasing cried leader be scarcely halfway there yet cold a be must hide here for space at least until snow more thickly again teeth chattered in head where be market asked graham staring out where be people other made answer look whispered graham crouched close became very still snow have suddenly become thick again sliding with whirling eddy out of black pit of sky came something vague large very swift came down in steep curve swept round wide wing extended trail of white condensing steam behind rose with easy swiftness went gliding up air swept horizontally forward in wide curve vanished again in steaming speck of snow through rib of body graham saw two little men very minute active searching snowy area about a seemed to with field glass for second be clear then hazy through thick whirl of snow then small distant in minute be gone now cried companion come pulled graham sleeve incontinently two be running headlong down arcade of ironwork beneath wind wheel graham running blindly collided with leader who have turned back on suddenly found within dozen yard of black chasm extended a far a must see right left seemed to cut off progress in direction do a do whispered guide lay down crawled to edge thrust head over twisted until one leg hung seemed to feel for something with foot found went sliding over edge into gulf head reappeared be ledge whispered in dark way along do a did graham hesitated went down upon four crawled to edge peered into velvety blackness for sickly moment have courage neither to go on retreat then sat hung leg down felt guide hand pulling at have horrible sensation of sliding over edge into unfathomable splashed felt in slushy gutter impenetrably dark way whispered voice began crawling along gutter through trickling thaw pressing against wall continued along for minute seemed to pas through hundred stage of misery to pas minute after minute through hundred degree of cold damp exhaustion in little while ceased to feel hand foot gutter sloped downwards observed that be now many foot below edge of building row of spectral white shape like ghost of blind drawn window rose above came to end of cable fastened above one of white window dimly visible dropping into impenetrable shadow suddenly hand came against guide still whispered latter very softly looked up with start saw huge wing of flying machine gliding slowly noiselessly overhead athwart broad band of snow flecked grey blue sky in moment be hidden again keep still be just turning for awhile be motionless then graham companion stood up reaching towards fastening of cable fumbled with indistinct tackle what be asked graham only answer be faint cry man crouched motionless graham peered saw face dimly be staring down long ribbon of sky graham following eye saw flying machine small faint remote then saw that wing spread on side that headed towards that moment grew larger be following edge of chasm towards man movement became convulsive thrust two cross bar into graham hand graham must not see ascertained form by feeling be slung by thin cord to cable on cord be hand grip of soft elastic substance put cross between leg whispered guide hysterically grip holdfast grip tightly grip graham did a be told jump said voice in heaven name jump for one momentous second graham must not speak be glad afterwards darkness face said nothing began to tremble violently looked sideways at swift shadow swallowed up sky a rushed upon jump jump in god name will have cried graham guide in violence of passion thrust forward graham tottered convulsively gave sobbing cry cry in spite of then a flying machine swept over fell forward into pit of darkness seated on cross wood holding rope with clutch of death something cracked something rapped smartly against wall heard pulley of cradle hum on rope heard aeronaut shout felt pair of knee digging into back be sweeping headlong through air falling through air strength be in hand must have screamed have breath shot into blinding light made grip tighter recognised great passage with running way hanging light interlacing girder rushed upward by have momentary impression of great circular aperture yawning to

moment be glowing tall man in black robe stood by shoulder pointed to half open door into hall man be shouting close to ear yet what be said be indistinct because of tremendous uproar from great theatre behind man be girl in silvery grey robe whom graham even in confusion perceived to be beautiful dark eye full of wonder curiosity be fixed on lip trembled apart partially opened door gave glimpse of crowded hall admitted vast uneven tumult hammering clapping shouting that died away began again rose to thunderous pitch so continued intermittently time graham remained in little room watched lip of man in black gathered that be making clumsy explanation stared stupidly for moment at thing then stood up abruptly grasped arm of shouting person tell cried who be who be others came

away drowned rush of people followed on heel of tumult intruder came towards lincoln gesticulating voice without explained soundless lip show sleeper show sleeper be burden of uproar men be bawling for order silence graham glanced towards open doorway saw tall oblong picture of hall beyond waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting face men woman together waving pale blue garment extended hand many be standing one man in rag of dark brown gaunt figure stood on seat waved black cloth met wonder expectation of girl eye what did people expect from be dimly aware that tumult outside have changed character be in way beating marching own mind too changed for space did not recognise influence be transforming moment be near to panic passed tried to make audible inquiry of what be required of lincoln be shouting in ear graham be deafened to that others save woman gesticulated towards hall perceived what have happened to uproar whole mass of people be chanting together be not simply song voice be gathered together upborne by torrent of instrumental music music like music of organ woven texture of sound full of trumpet full of flaunting banner full of march pageantry of opening war foot of people be beating time tramp tramp be urged towards door obeyed mechanically strength of chant took hold of stirred emboldened hall opened to vast welter of fluttering colour swaying to music wave arm to said lincoln wave arm to said voice on other side must have arm be about neck detaining in doorway black subtly folding mantle hung from shoulder threw arm free of followed lincoln perceived girl in grey close to face lit gesture onward for instant became to flushed eager a be embodiment of song emerged in alcove again incontinently mounting wave of song broke upon appearing flashed up into foam of shouting guided by lincoln hand marched obliquely across centre of stage facing people hall be vast intricate space gallery balcony broad space of amphitheatral step great archway far away high up seemed mouth of huge passage full of struggling humanity whole multitude be swaying in congested mass individual figure sprang out of tumult impressed momentarily lost definition again close to platform swayed beautiful fair woman carried by three men hair across face brandishing green staff next group old careworn man in blue canvas maintained place in crush with difficulty behind shouted hairless face great cavity of toothless mouth voice called enigmatical word ostrog impression be vague save massive emotion of trampling song multitude be beating time with

whole world seemed marching tramp tramp tramp tramp brain be tramping garment waved onward face poured by more abundantly tramp tramp tramp tramp at lincoln pressure turned towards archway walking unconsciously in rhythm scarcely noticing movement for melody stir of multitude gesture song moved in direction flow of people smote downward until upturned face be below level of foot be aware of path before of suite about of guard dignity lincoln on right hand attendant intervened ever again blotted out sight of multitude to left before went back of guard in black three three three be marched along little railed way crossed above archway with torrent dipping to flow beneath shouting up to did not know whither went did not want to know glanced back across flaming spaciousness of hall tramp tramp tramp tramp chapter x battle of darkness be no longer in hall be marching along gallery overhanging one of great street of moving platform traversed city before behind tramped guard whole concave of moving way below be congested mass of people marching tramping to left shouting waving hand arm pouring along huge vista shouting a came into view shouting a passed shouting a receded until globe of electric light receding in perspective dropped down seemed hid swarming bare head tramp tramp tramp tramp song roared up to graham now no longer upborne by music coarse noisy beating of marching foot tramp tramp tramp tramp interwove with thunderous irregularity of footstep from undisciplined rabble poured along higher way abruptly noted contrast building on opposite side of way seemed deserted cable bridge laced across aisle be empty shadowy came into graham mind that also must have swarmed with people felt curious emotion throbbing very fast stopped again guard before marched on about stopped a did saw direction of face throbbing have something to do with light too looked up at first seemed to thing affected light simply isolated phenomenon having bearing on thing below huge globe of blinding whiteness be a be clutched compressed in systole be followed by transitory diastole again systole like tightening grip darkness light darkness in rapid alternation graham became aware that strange behaviour of light have to do with people below appearance of house way appearance of packed mass changed became confusion of vivid light leaping shadow saw multitude of shadow have sprung into aggressive existence seemed rushing up broadening widening growing with steady swiftness to leap suddenly back return reinforced song tramping have ceased unanimous march discovered be arrested there be eddy flow sideways shout of light voice be cry together one thing light cried voice light looked down in dancing death of light area of street have suddenly become monstrous struggle huge white globe became purple white purple with reddish glow flickered flickered faster faster fluttered between light extinction ceased to flicker became mere fading speck of glowing red in vast obscurity in ten second extinction be accomplished there be only roaring darkness black monstrosity have suddenly swallowed up glittering myriad of men felt invisible form about arm be gripped something rapped sharply against shin voice bawled in ear be right right graham shook off paralysis of first astonishment struck forehead against lincoln bawled what be darkness council have cut current light city must wait stop people will go on will voice be drowned voice be shouting save sleeper take care of sleeper guard stumbled against graham hurt hand by inadvertent blow of weapon wild tumult tossed whirled about growing a seemed louder denser more furious moment fragment of recognisable sound drove towards be whirled away from a mind reached out to grasp voice seemed to be shouting conflicting order other voice answered there be suddenly succession of piercing scream close beneath voice bawled in ear red police receded forthwith beyond question crackling sound grew to distinctness there with leaping of faint flash along edge of further way by light graham saw head body of number of men armed with weapon like of guard leap into instant dim visibility whole area began to crackle to flash with little instantaneous streak of light abruptly darkness rolled back like curtain glare of light dazzled eye vast seething expanse of struggling men confused mind shout burst of cheering came across way looked up to see source of light man hung far overhead from upper part of cable holding by rope blinding star have driven darkness back wore red uniform graham eye fell to way again wedge of red little way along vista caught eye saw be dense mass of red clad men jammed higher further way back against pitiless cliff of building surrounded by dense crowd of antagonist be fighting weapon flashed rose fell head vanished at edge of contest other head replaced little flash from green weapon became little jet of smoky grey while light lasted abruptly flare be extinguished way be inky darkness once more tumultuous mystery felt something thrusting against be being pushed along gallery someone be shouting might be at be too confused to hear be thrust against wall number of people blundered past seemed to that guard be struggling with one suddenly cable hung star holder appeared again whole scene be white dazzling band of red coat seemed broader nearer apex be half way down way towards central aisle raising eye graham saw that number of men have also appeared now in darkened lower gallery of opposite building be firing over head of fellow below at boiling confusion of people on lower way meaning of thing dawned upon march of people have come upon ambush at very outset thrown into confusion by extinction of light be now being attacked by red police then became aware that be standing alone that guard lincoln be along gallery in direction along have come before darkness fell saw be gesticulating to wildly running back towards great shouting came from across way then seemed a though whole face of darkened building opposite be lined speckled with red clad men be pointing over to shouting sleeper save sleeper shouted multitude of throat something struck wall above head looked up at impact saw star shaped splash of silvery metal saw lincoln near felt arm gripped then pat pat have be missed twice for moment did not understand street be hidden everything be hidden a looked second flare have burned out lincoln have gripped graham by arm be lugging along gallery before next light cried haste be contagious graham instinct of self preservation overcame paralysis of incredulous astonishment became for time blind creature of fear of death ran stumbling because of uncertainty of darkness blundered into guard a turned to run with haste be one desire to escape perilous gallery upon be exposed third glare came close on predecessor with came great shouting across way answering tumult from way red coat below saw have now almost gained central passage countless face turned towards shouted white facade opposite be densely stippled with red wonderful thing concerned turned upon a pivot be guard of council attempting to recapture lucky be for that shot be first fired in anger for hundred fifty year heard bullet whacking over head felt splash of molten metal sting ear perceived without looking that whole opposite facade unmasked ambuscade of red police be crowded bawling firing at down went one of guard before graham unable to stop leapt writhing body in second have plunged unhurt into black passage incontinently someone coming may be in transverse direction blundered violently into be hurling down staircase in absolute darkness reeled be struck again came against wall with hand be crushed by weight of struggling body whirled round thrust to right vast pressure pinned must not breathe rib seemed cracking felt momentary relaxation then whole mass of people moving together bore back towards great theatre from have so recently come there be moment when foot did not touch ground then be staggering shoving heard shout of be coming muffled cry close to foot blundered against something soft heard hoarse scream under foot heard shout of sleeper be too confused to speak heard green weapon crackling for space lost individual will became atom in panic blind unthinking mechanical thrust pressed back writhed in pressure kicked presently against step found ascending slope abruptly face about leapt out of black visible ghastly white astonished terrified perspiring in livid glare one face young man be very near to not twenty inch away at time be passing incident of emotional value afterwards came back to in dream for young man wedged upright in crowd for time have be shot be already dead fourth white star must have be lit by man on cable light came glaring in through vast window arch showed graham that be now one of dense mass of flying black figure pressed back across lower area of great theatre time picture be livid fragmentary slashed barred with black shadow saw that quite near to red guard be fighting way through people must not tell whether saw looked for lincoln guard saw lincoln near stage of theatre surrounded in crowd of black badged revolutionary lifted up staring to fro a if seeking graham perceived that be near opposite edge of crowd behind separated by barrier sloped now vacant seat of theatre sudden idea came to began fighting way towards barrier a reached glare came to end in moment have thrown off great cloak that not only impeded movement made conspicuous have slipped from shoulder heard someone trip in fold in be scaling barrier have dropped into blackness on further side then feeling way came to lower end of ascending gangway in darkness sound of firing ceased roar of foot voice lulled then suddenly came to unexpected step tripped fell a did so pool island amidst darkness about leapt to vivid light again uproar surged louder glare of fifth white star shone through vast fenestration of theatre wall rolled over among seat heard shouting whirring rattle of weapon struggled up be knocked back again perceived that number of black badged men be about firing at rebel below leaping from seat to seat crouching among seat to reload instinctively crouched amidst seat a stray shot ripped pneumatic cushion cut bright slash on soft metal frame instinctively marked direction of gangway most plausible way of escape for so soon a veil of darkness fell again young man in faded blue garment came vaulting over seat hullo said with flying foot within six inch of crouching sleeper face stared without sign of recognition turned to fire fired shouting to hell with council be about to fire again then seemed to graham that half of man neck have vanished drop of moisture fell on graham cheek green weapon stopped half raised for moment man stood still with face suddenly expressionless then began to slant forward knee bent man darkness fell together at sound of fall graham rose up ran for life until step down to gangway tripped scrambled to foot turned up gangway ran on when sixth star glared be already close to yawning throat of passage ran on swifter for light entered passage turned corner into absolute night again be knocked sideways rolled over recovered foot found one of crowd of invisible fugitive pressing in one direction one thought now be thought also to escape out of fighting thrust struck staggered ran be wedged tightly lost ground then be clear again for minute be running through darkness along winding passage then crossed wide open space passed down long incline came at last down flight of step to level place many people be shouting be coming guard be coming be firing get out of fighting guard be firing will be safe in seventh way along here to seventh way there be woman child in crowd a well a men men called name to crowd converged on archway passed through short throat emerged on wider space again lit dimly black figure about spread out ran up what seemed in twilight to be gigantic series of step followed people dispersed to right left perceived that be no longer in crowd stopped near highest step before on level be group of seat little kiosk went up to stopping in shadow of eaves looked about panting everything be vague gray recognised that great step be series of platform of way now motionless again platform slanted up on side tall building rose beyond vast dim ghost inscription advertisement indistinctly seen up through girder cable be faint interrupted ribbon of pallid sky number of people hurried by from shout voice seemed be hurrying to join fighting other le noisy figure flitted timidly among shadow from very far away down street must hear sound of struggle be evident to that be not street into theatre opened that former fight seemed have suddenly dropped out of sound hearing grotesque thought be fighting for for space be like man who pause in reading of vivid book suddenly doubt what have be taking unquestioningly at time have little mind for detail whole effect be huge astonishment oddly enough while flight from council prison great crowd in hall attack of red police upon swarming people be clearly present in mind cost effort to piece in awakening to revive meditative interval of silent room at first memory leapt thing took back to cascade at pentargen quivering in wind sombre splendour of sunlit cornish coast contrast touched everything with unreality then gap filled began to comprehend position be no longer absolutely riddle a have be in silent room at least have strange bare outline now be in way owner of world great political party be fighting to posse on one hand be white council with red police set resolutely seemed on usurpation of property perhaps murder on other revolution have liberated with unseen ostrog a leader whole of gigantic city be convulsed by struggle frantic development of world understand cried understand have slipped out between contending party into liberty of twilight what must happen next what be happening figured redclad men a busily hunting driving blackbadged revolutionist before at rate chance have given breathing space must lurk unchallenged by passer by watch course of thing eye followed up intricate dim immensity of twilight building came to a thing infinitely wonderful that above there sun be rising world be lit glowing with old familiar light of day in little while have recovered breath clothing have already dried upon from snow wandered for mile along twilight way speaking to one accosted by one dark figure among dark figure coveted man out of past inestimable unintentional owner of world wherever there be light dense crowd exceptional excitement be afraid of recognition watched turned back went up down by middle stairway into transverse system of way at lower higher level though came on more fighting whole city stirred with battle once have to run to avoid marching multitude of men swept street everyone abroad seemed involved for most part be men carried what judged be weapon seemed a though struggle be concentrated mainly in quarter of city from came ever again distant roaring remote suggestion of conflict reached ear then caution curiosity struggled together caution prevailed continued wandering away from fighting so far a must judge went unmolested unsuspected through dark after time ceased to hear even remote echo of battle fewer fewer people passed until at last titanic street became deserted frontage of building grew plain harsh seemed to have come to district of vacant warehouse solitude crept upon pace slackened became aware of growing fatigue at time must turn aside seat on one of numerous seat of upper way feverish restlessness knowledge of vital implication in struggle must not let rest in place for long be struggle on behalf alone then in desolate place came shock of earthquake roaring thundering mighty wind of cold air pouring through city smash of glass slip thud of falling masonry series of gigantic concussion mass of glass ironwork fell from remote roof into middle gallery not hundred yard away from in distance be shout running too be startled to aimless activity ran first one way then a aimlessly back man came running towards self control returned what have blown up asked man breathlessly be explosion before graham must speak have hurried on great building rose dimly veiled by perplexing twilight albeit rivulet of sky above be now bright with day noted many strange feature understanding none at time even spelt out many of inscription in phonetic lettering what profit to decipher confusion of odd looking letter resolving after painful strain of eye mind into here be eadhamite labour bureau little side grotesque thought that in probability of cliff like house be perversity of experience came to vividly in actual fact have made leap in time a romancers have imagined again again that fact realised have be prepared mind have a be seated for spectacle spectacle great vague danger unsympathetic shadow veil of darkness somewhere through labyrinthine obscurity death sought must after be killed before saw might be that even at next shadowy corner destruction ambushed great desire to see great longing to know arose in became fearful of corner seemed to that there be safety in concealment where must hide to be inconspicuous when light returned at last sat down upon seat in recess on one of higher way conceiving be alone there squeezed knuckle into weary eye suppose when looked again found dark through of parallel way intolerable altitude of edifice gone suppose be to discover whole story of last few day awakening shouting multitude darkness fighting phantasmagoria new more vivid sort of dream must be dream be so inconsecutive so reasonless why be people fighting for why must saner world regard a owner master so thought sitting blinded then looked again half hoping in spite of ear to see familiar aspect of life of nineteenth century to see perhaps little harbour of boscastle about cliff of pentargen bedroom of home fact take heed of human hope squad of men with black banner tramped athwart nearer shadow intent on conflict beyond rose that giddy wall of frontage vast dark with dim incomprehensible lettering showing faintly on face be dream said dream bowed face upon hand chapter xi old man who knew everything be startled by cough close at hand turned sharply peering saw small hunched up figure sitting couple of yard off in shadow of enclosure have ye news asked high pitched wheezy voice of very old man graham hesitated none said stay here till light come again said old man blue scoundrel be everywhere everywhere graham answer be

speedily lost be told to leave way to have hitherto confined knowing other mean of transit to plunge down one of middle staircase into blackness of crossway thereupon came trivial adventure chief of ambiguous encounter with gruff voiced invisible creature speaking in strange dialect seemed at first strange tongue thick flow of speech with drifting corps of english word therein dialect of latter day vile then voice drew near girl voice singing tralala tralala spoke to graham english touched with something of same quality professed to have lost sister blundered needlessly into thought caught hold of laughed word of vague remonstrance sent into unseen again sound about increased stumbling people passed speaking excitedly have surrendered council surely not council be saying so in way

stumbled against little table on be utensil of glass graham eye now attuned to darkness made out long vista with pallid table on side went down at one two of table heard clang of glass sound of eating there be people then cool enough to dine daring enough to steal meal in spite of social convulsion darkness far off high up presently saw pallid light of semi circular shape a approached black edge came up hid stumbled at step found in gallery heard sobbing found two scared little girl crouched by railing child became silent at near sound of foot tried to console be very still until left then a receded must hear sobbing again presently found at foot of staircase near wide opening saw dim twilight above ascended out of blackness into street of moving way again along disorderly swarm of people marched shouting be singing snatch of song of revolt most of out of tune here there torch flared creating brief hysterical shadow asked way be twice puzzled by same thick dialect third attempt won answer must understand be two mile from wind vane office in westminster way be easy to follow when at last did approach district of wind vane office seemed to from cheering procession came marching along way from tumult of rejoicing finally from restoration of lighting of city that overthrow of council must already be accomplished still news of absence came to ear re illumination of city came with startling abruptness suddenly stood blinking about men halted dazzled world be incandescent light found already upon outskirt of excited crowd choked way near wind vane office sense of visibility exposure came with turned colourless intention of joining ostrog to keen anxiety for time be jostled obstructed endangered by men hoarse weary with cheering name of bandaged bloody in cause frontage of wind vane office be illuminated by moving picture what be must not see because in spite of strenuous attempt density of crowd prevented approaching from fragment of speech caught judged conveyed news of fighting about council house ignorance indecision made slow ineffective in movement for time must not conceive how be to get within unbroken facade of place made way slowly into midst of mass of people until realised that descending staircase of central way led to interior of building gave goal crowding in central path be so dense that be long before must reach even then encountered intricate obstruction have hour of vivid argument first in guard room then in before must get note taken to one man of men who be most eager to see story be laughed to scorn at one place wiser for when at last reached second stairway professed simply to have news of extraordinary importance for ostrog what be must not say sent note reluctantly for long time waited in little room at foot of lift shaft thither at last came lincoln eager apologetic astonished stopped in doorway scrutinising graham then rushed forward effusively yes cried be be not dead graham made brief explanation brother be waiting explained lincoln be alone in wind vane office feared have be killed in theatre doubted thing be very urgent still in spite of what be telling there must have come to ascended lift passed along narrow passage crossed great hall empty save for two hurrying messenger entered comparatively little room whose only furniture be long settee large oval disc of cloudy shifting grey hung by cable from wall there lincoln left graham for space remained alone without understanding shifting smoky shape drove slowly across disc attention be arrested by sound began abruptly be cheering frantic cheering of vast very remote crowd roaring exultation ended a sharply a have begun like sound heard between opening shutting of door in outer room be noise of hurrying step melodious clinking a if loose chain be running over teeth of wheel then heard voice of woman rustle of unseen garment be ostrog heard say little bell rang fitfully then everything be still again presently came voice footstep movement without footstep of one person detached from other sound drew near firm evenly measured step curtain lifted slowly tall white haired man clad in garment of cream coloured silk appeared regarding graham from under raised arm for moment white form remained holding curtain then dropped stood before graham first impression be of very broad forehead very pale blue eye deep sunken under white brow aquiline nose heavily lined resolute mouth fold of flesh over eye drooping of corner of mouth contradicted upright bearing said man be old graham rose to foot instinctively for moment two men stood in silence regarding other be ostrog said graham be ostrog bos so be called graham felt inconvenience of silence have to thank chiefly understand for safety said presently be afraid be killed said ostrog sent to sleep again for ever have be doing everything to keep secret secret of disappearance where have be how did get here graham told briefly ostrog listened in silence smiled faintly do know what be doing when came to tell have come how can guess preparing double double man a like a must find be going to hypnotise to save difficulty of acting be imperative whole of revolt depends on idea that be awake alive with even now great multitude of people have gathered in theatre clamouring to see trust know of course something of position very little said graham be like ostrog walked pace two into room turned be absolute owner said of more than world a result of that be practically king power be limited in many intricate way be figure head popular symbol of government white council council of trustee a be called have heard vague outline of thing wondered came upon garrulous old man see mass word come from day know of course that still have mass regard a actual ruler just a great number of people in day regarded crown a ruler be discontented mass over earth with rule of trustee for most part be old discontent old quarrel of common man with commonness misery of work discipline unfitness trustee have ruled ill in certain matter in administration of labour company for example have be unwise have given endless opportunity already of popular party be agitating for reform when waking came came if have be contrived must not have come more opportunity smiled public mind making allowance for year of quiescence have already hit on thought of waking appealing to flash indicated outbreak by gesture graham moved head to show that understood council muddled quarreled always do must not decide what to do with know how imprisoned see see now win win indeed win tonight in five swift hour suddenly struck everywhere windvane people labour company million burst bond got pull of aeropiles paused yes said graham guessing aeropile meant flying machine be of course essential must have got away city rose third man almost be in blue public service save only just few aeronaut about red police be rescued own police of way not half of must be massed at council house have be broken up disarmed killed london be ours now only council house remains half of who remain to of red police be lost in foolish attempt to recapture lost head when lost flung have at theatre cut off from council house there truly tonight have be night of victory everywhere star have blazed day ago white council ruled a have ruled for gross of year for century half of year then with only little whispering covert arming here there suddenly so be very ignorant said graham suppose clearly understand condition of fighting if must explain where be council where be fight ostrog stepped across room something clicked suddenly save for oval glow be in darkness for moment graham be puzzled then saw that cloudy grey disc have taken depth colour have assumed appearance of oval window looking out upon strange unfamiliar scene at first glance be unable to guess what scene might be be daylight scene daylight of wintry day grey clear across picture halfway a seemed between remoter view stout cable of twisted white wire stretched vertically then perceived that row of great windwheels saw wide interval occasional gulf of darkness be akin to through have fled from council house distinguished orderly file of red figure marching across open space between file of men in black realised before ostrog spoke that be looking down on upper surface of latter day london overnight snow have gone judged that mirror be modern replacement of camera obscura that matter be not explained to saw that though file of red figure be trotting from left to right yet be passing out of picture to left wondered momentarily then saw that picture be passing slowly panorama fashion across oval in moment will see fighting said ostrog at elbow fellow in red notice be prisoner be roof space of london house be practically continuous now street public square be covered in gap chasm of time have disappeared something out of focus obliterated picture form suggested man there be gleam of metal flash something swept across oval a eyelid of bird sweep across eye picture be clear again now graham beheld men running down among wind wheel pointing weapon from jetted out little smoky flash swarmed thicker thicker to right gesticulating might be be shouting of that picture told nothing windwheels passed slowly steadily across field of mirror now said ostrog come council house slowly black edge crept into view gathered graham attention soon be no longer edge cavity huge blackened space amidst clustering edifice from thin spire of smoke rose into pallid winter sky gaunt ruinous mass of building mighty truncated pier girder rose dismally out of cavernous darkness over vestige of splendid place countless minute men be clambering leaping swarming be council house said last stronghold fool wasted enough ammunition to hold out for month in blowing up building about to stop attack heard smash shattered brittle glass in city while spoke graham saw beyond sea of ruin overhanging rising to great height be ragged mass of white building mass have be isolated by ruthless destruction of surroundings black gap marked passage disaster have torn apart big hall have be slashed open decoration of interior showed dismally in wintry dawn down jagged wall hung festoon of divided cable twisted end of line metallic rod amidst vast detail moved little red speck red clothed defender of council now then faint flash illuminated bleak shadow at first sight seemed to graham that attack upon isolated white building be in progress then perceived that party of revolt be not advancing sheltered amidst colossal wreckage encircled last ragged stronghold of red garbed men be keeping up fitful firing not ten hour ago have stood beneath ventilating fan in little chamber within remote building wondering what be happening in world looking more attentively a warlike episode moved silently across centre of mirror graham saw that white building be surrounded on side by ruin ostrog proceeded to describe in concise phrase how defender have sought by such destruction to isolate from storm spoke of loss of men huge downfall have entailed in indifferent tone indicated improvised mortuary among wreckage showed ambulance swarming like cheese mite along ruinous groove have once be street of moving way be more interested in pointing out part of council house distribution of besieger in little while civil contest have convulsed london be no longer mystery to graham be tumultuous revolt have occurred that night equal warfare splendidly organised coup d'etat ostrog grasp of detail be astonishing seemed to know business of even smallest knot of black red speck crawled amidst place stretched huge black arm across luminous picture showed room whence graham have escaped across chasm of ruin course of flight graham recognised gulf across gutter ran wind wheel where have crouched from flying machine rest of path have succumbed to explosion looked again at council house be already half hidden on right hillside with cluster of dome pinnacle hazy dim distant be gliding into view council be really overthrown said overthrown said ostrog be indeed true that be master of world that white flag be flag of council flag of rule of world will fall fight be over attack on theatre be last frantic struggle have only thousand men so of men will be disloyal have little ammunition be reviving ancient art be casting gun help be city world practically be have left to of empire abroad city have revolted with wait issue awakening have perplexed paralysed have council flying machine why be there fighting with have greater part of aeronaut be in revolt with must take risk of fighting on side must not stir against have to get pull with aeronaut quite half be with others knew directly knew have got away looking for dropped killed man who shot at hour ago occupied flying stage at outset in city must so stopped captured airplane a for little flying machine turned out for did kept up too straight steady fire for to get near council house if dropped must rise again because there be clear space about there for to get up several have smashed several others have dropped surrendered rest have gone off to continent to find friendly city if can before fuel run out most of men be only too glad to be taken prisoner kept out of harm way upsetting in flying machine be very attractive prospect there be chance for council way day be done laughed turned to oval reflection again to show graham what meant by flying stage even four nearer one be remote obscured by thin morning haze graham must perceive be very vast structure judged even by standard of thing about then a dim shape passed to left there came again sight of expanse across disarmed men in red have be marching then black ruin then again beleaguered white fastness of council appeared no longer ghostly pile glowing amber in sunlight for cloud shadow have passed about pigmy struggle still hung in suspense now red defender be no longer firing so in dusky stillness man from nineteenth century saw closing scene of great revolt forcible establishment of rule with quality of startling discovery came to that be world not that other have left behind that be spectacle to culminate cease in world lay life be still before lay duty danger responsibility turned with fresh question ostrog began to answer then broke off abruptly thing must explain more fully later at present there be duty people be coming by moving way towards ward from part of city market theatre be densely crowded be just in time for be clamouring to see abroad want to see paris new york chicago denver capri thousand of city be up in tumult undecided clamouring to see have clamoured that must be awakened for year now be done will scarcely believe surely ca go ostrog answered from other side of room picture on oval disc paled vanished a light jerked back again there be kinetotele photograph said a bow to people here over world myriad of myriad of people packed still in darkened hall will see also in black white of course not like will hear shout reinforcing shouting in hall there be optical contrivance will use said ostrog used by of posturer woman dancer may be novel to stand in very bright light see not magnified image of thrown on screen so that even furtherest man in remotest gallery can if chooses count eyelash graham clutched desperately at one of question in mind what be population of london eight twaindy myriad eight what more than thirty three million figure went beyond graham imagination will be expected to say something said ostrog not what used to call speech what people call word just one sentence six seven word something formal if might suggest have awakened heart be with ' be sort of thing want what be asked graham ' be awakened heart be with bow bow royally first must get black robe for black be colour do mind then will disperse to home graham hesitated be in hand said ostrog be clearly of opinion thought for moment turned to curtain called brief direction to unseen attendant almost immediately black robe very fellow of black robe graham have worn in theatre be brought a threw about shoulder there came from room without shrilling of high pitched bell ostrog turned in interrogation to attendant then suddenly seemed to change mind pulled curtain aside disappeared for moment graham stood with deferential attendant listening to ostrog retreating step there be sound of quick question answer of men running curtain be snatched back reappeared massive face glowing with excitement crossed room in stride clicked room into darkness gripped graham arm pointed to mirror even a turned away said graham saw index finger black colossal above mirrored council house for moment did not understand then perceived that flagstaff have carried white banner be bare do mean began council have surrendered rule be at end for evermore look ostrog pointed to coil of black crept in little jerk up vacant flagstaff unfolding a rose oval picture paled a lincoln pulled curtain aside entered be clamourous said kept grip of graham arm have raised people said have given arm for today at least wish must be law lincoln held curtain open for graham ostrog to pas through on way to market graham have transitory glance of long narrow white walled room in men in universal blue canvas be carrying covered thing like bier about men in medical purple hurried to fro from room came groan wailing have impression of empty blood stained couch of men on other couch bandaged blood stained be just glimpse from railed footway then buttress hid place be going on towards market roar of multitude be near now leapt to thunder arresting attention fluttering of black banner waving of blue canvas brown rag swarming vastness of theatre near public market came into view down long passage picture opened out perceived be entering great theatre of first appearance great theatre have last seen a chequer work of glare blackness in flight from red police time entered along gallery at level high above stage place be now brilliantly lit again sought gangway up have fled must not tell from among dozen of fellow must see anything of smashed seat deflated cushion such like trace of fight because of density of people except stage whole place be closely packed looking down effect be vast area of stippled pink dot still upturned face regarding at appearance with cheering died away singing died away common interest stilled unified disorder seemed a though individual of myriad be watching chapter xiii end of old order so far a graham be able to judge be near midday when white banner of council fell hour have to elapse before be possible to effect formal capitulation so after have spoken word retired to new apartment in wind vane office continuous excitement of last twelve hour have left inordinately fatigued even curiosity be exhausted for space sat inert passive with open eye for space slept be roused by two medical attendant come prepared with stimulant to sustain through next occasion after have taken drug bathed by advice in cold water felt rapid return of interest energy be presently able willing to accompany ostrog through several mile a seemed of passage lift slide to closing scene of white council rule way ran deviously through maze of building came at last to passage curved about showed broadening before oblong opening cloud hot with sunset ragged skyline of ruinous council house tumult of shout came drifting up to in moment have come out high up on brow of cliff of torn building overhung wreckage vast area opened to graham eye none le strange wonderful for remote view have have of in oval mirror rudely amphitheatral space seemed now better part of mile to outer edge be gold lit on left hand catching sunlight below to right clear cold in shadow above shadowy grey council house stood in midst of great black banner of surrender still hung in sluggish fold against blazing sunset severed room hall passage gaped strangely broken mass of metal projected dismally from complex wreckage vast mass of twisted cable dropped like tangled seaweed from base came tumult of innumerable voice violent concussion sound of trumpet about great white pile be ring of desolation smashed blackened mass gaunt foundation ruinous lumber of fabric have be destroyed by council order skeleton of girder titanic mass of wall forest of stout pillar amongst sombre wreckage beneath running water flashed glistened far away across space out of midst of vague vast mass of building there thrust twisted end of water main two hundred foot in air thunderously spouting shining cascade everywhere great multitude of people wherever there be space foothold people swarmed little people small minutely clear except where sunset touched to indistinguishable gold clambered up tottering wall clung in wreath group about high standing pillar swarmed along edge of circle of ruin air be full of shouting be pressing swaying towards central space upper storey of council house seemed deserted not human being be visible only drooping banner of surrender hung heavily against light dead be within council house hidden by swarming people carried away graham must see only few neglected body in gap corner of ruin amidst flowing water will let see sire said ostrog be very anxious to see graham hesitated then walked forward to where broken verge of wall dropped sheer stood looking down lonely tall black figure against sky very slowly swarming ruin became aware of a did so little band of black uniformed men appeared remotely thrusting through crowd towards council house saw little black head become pink looking at saw by mean wave of recognition sweep across

beneath temporary edifice stage have small higher portion on graham stood with ostrog lincoln close beside little in advance of group of minor officer broader lower stage surrounded quarter deck on be black uniformed guard of revolt armed with little green weapon whose very name graham still did not know standing about perceived that eye wandered perpetually from swarming people in twilight ruin about to darkling mass of white council house whence trustee must presently come to gaunt cliff of ruin encircled so back to people voice of crowd swelled to deafening tumult saw councillor first afar off in glare of one of temporary light marked path little group of white figure blinking in black archway in council house have be in darkness watched approaching drawing nearer past first blazing electric star then that minatory roar of crowd over whom power have lasted for hundred fifty year marched along beside a drew still nearer face came out weary white anxious saw blinking up through glare about ostrog contrasted strange cold look in hall of atlas presently must recognise several of man who have rapped table at burly man with red beard one delicate featured short dark man with peculiarly long skull noted that two be whispering together looking behind at ostrog next there came tall dark handsome man walking downcast abruptly glanced up eye touched graham for moment passed beyond to ostrog way have be made for be so contrived that have to march past curve about before came to sloping path of plank ascended to stage where surrender be to be made master master god master shouted people to hell with council graham looked at multitude receding beyond counting into shouting haze then at ostrog beside white steadfast still eye went again to little group of white councillor then looked up at familiar quiet star overhead marvellous element in fate be suddenly vivid must be indeed little life in memory two hundred year gone by a well chapter xiv from crow nest

dancing web of melody about kept air of great marching song from memory lady to whom be talking repeated remark graham recalled to quasiregal flirtation upon be engaged from moment vague restlessness feeling grew to dissatisfaction came into mind be troubled a if by half forgotten duty by sense of thing important slipping from amidst light brilliance attraction that bright lady who crowded about be beginning to exercise ceased no longer made vague clumsy response to subtly amorous advance that be now assured be being made to eye wandered for sight of face have appealed so strongly to sense of

reasserted motif of marching song once have begun lingered in mind bright eyed lady be still struggling with mystery of eadhamite when perceived girl have seen in theatre again be coming now along

have followed crude beginning of aerial navigation very keenly in previous life be delighted to find familiar name of maxim pilcher langley chanute above of aerial proto martyr lillienthal still honoured by men even during previous life two line of investigation have pointed clearly to two distinct type of contrivance a possible of have be realised on one hand be great engine driven aeroplane

must have be caused by descent of great expanse of sail metal impossibility of rising again concussion of irregular surface tree set hillside for instance embankment must be sufficient to pierce damage framework to smash rib of body perhaps kill aboard at first graham felt disappointed with cumbersome contrivance speedily grasped fact that smaller machine must have be unremunerative for simple reason that carrying power must be disproportionately diminished with diminished size moreover huge size of thing enabled be consideration of primary importance to traverse air at enormous

engineer through rib of machine looking sideways there be nothing very startling in what saw rapid funicular railway might have given same sensation recognised council house highgate ridge then looked straight down between foot for moment physical terror possessed passionate sense of insecurity held tight for second so must not lift eye hundred foot more sheer below be one of big windvanes of south west london beyond southernmost flying stage crowded with little black dot thing seemed to be falling away from for second have impulse to pursue earth set teeth lifted eye by muscular effort moment of panic passed remained for space with teeth set hard eye staring into sky throb throb throb beat went engine throb throb throb beat gripped bar tightly glanced at aeronaut saw smile upon sun tanned face smiled in return perhaps little artificially little strange at first shouted before recalled dignity dared not look down again for time stared over aeronaut head to where rim of vague blue horizon crept up sky for little while must not banish thought of possible accident from mind throb throb throb beat suppose trivial screw went wrong in supporting engine suppose made grim effort to dismiss such supposition after while did at least abandon foreground of thought up went steadily higher higher into clear air once mental shock of moving unsupported through air be over sensation ceased to be unpleasant became very speedily pleasurable have be warned of air sickness found pulsating movement of aeropile a drove up faint south west breeze be very little in excess of pitching of boat head on to broad roller in moderate gale be constitutionally good sailor keenness of more rarefied air into ascended produced sense of lightness exhilaration looked up saw blue sky above fretted with cirrus cloud eye came cautiously down through rib bar to shining flight of white bird hung in lower sky for space watched then going lower le apprehensively saw slender figure of wind vane keeper crow nest shining golden in sunlight growing smaller moment a eye fell with more confidence now there came blue line of hill then london already to leeward intricate space of roofing near edge came sharp clear banished last apprehension in shock of surprise for boundary of london be like wall like cliff steep fall of three four hundred foot frontage broken only by terrace here there complex decorative facade gradual passage of town into country through extensive sponge of suburb be so characteristic feature of great city of nineteenth century existed longer nothing remained of waste of ruin here variegated dense with thicket of heterogeneous growth have once adorned garden of belt interspersed among levelled brown patch of sown ground verdant stretch of winter green latter even spread among vestige of house for most part reef skerries of ruin wreckage of suburban villa stood among street road queer island amidst levelled expanse of green brown abandoned indeed by inhabitant year since too substantial seemed ' to be cleared out of way of wholesale horticultural mechanism of time vegetation of waste undulated frothed amidst countless cell of crumbling house wall broke along foot of city wall in surf of bramble holly ivy teazle tall grass here there gaudy pleasure palace towered amidst puny remains of victorian time cable way slanted to from city winter day seemed deserted deserted too be artificial garden among ruin city limit be indeed a sharply defined a in ancient day when gate be shut at robber foreman prowled to very wall huge semi circular throat poured out vigorous traffic upon eadhamite bath road so first prospect of world beyond city flashed on graham dwindled when at last must look vertically downward again saw below vegetable field of thames valley innumerable minute oblong of ruddy brown intersected by shining thread sewage ditch exhilaration increased rapidly became sort of intoxication found drawing deep breath of air laughing aloud desiring to shout after time desire became too strong for shouted machine have now risen a high a be customary with aeropiles began to curve about towards south steering graham perceived be effected by opening closing of one two thin strip of membrane in one other of otherwise rigid wing by movement of whole engine backward forward along support aeronaut set engine gliding slowly forward along rail opened valve of leeward wing until stem of aeropile be horizontal pointing southward in direction drove with slight list to leeward with slow alternation of movement first short sharp ascent then long downward glide be very swift pleasing during downward glide propellor be inactive altogether ascent gave graham glorious sense of successful effort descent through rarefied air be beyond experience wanted never to leave upper air again for time be intent upon minute detail of landscape that ran swiftly northward beneath minute clear detail pleased exceedingly be impressed by ruin of house have once dotted country by vast treeless expanse of country from farm village have gone save for crumbling ruin have known thing be so seeing so be altogether different matter tried to make out place have known within hollow basin of world below at first must distinguish data now that thames valley be left behind soon however be driving over sharp chalk hill that recognised a guildford hog back because of familiar outline of gorge at eastward end because of ruin of town rose steeply on lip of gorge from that made out other point hill sandy waste of aldershot so forth down escarpment be set with gigantic slow moving wind wheel save where broad eadhamite portsmouth road thickly dotted with rushing shape followed course of old railway gorge of wey be choked with thicket whole expanse of down escarpment so far a grey haze permitted to see be set with wind wheel to largest of city be younger brother stirred with stately motion before south west wind here there be patch dotted with sheep of british food trust here there mounted shepherd made spot of black then rushing under stern of aeropile came wealden height line of hindhead pitch hill leith hill with second row of wind wheel seemed striving to rob downland whirler of share of breeze purple heather be speckled with yellow gorse on further side drove of black ox stampeded before couple of mounted men swiftly swept behind dwindled lost colour became scarce moving speck be swallowed up in haze when have vanished in distance graham heard peewit wailing close at hand perceived be now above south down staring over shoulder saw battlement of portsmouth landing stage towering over ridge of portsdown hill in moment there came into sight spread of shipping like floating city little white cliff of needle dwarfed sunlit grey glittering water of narrow sea seemed to leap solent in moment in few second isle of wight be running past then beneath spread wider wide extent of sea here purple with shadow of cloud here grey here burnished mirror here spread of cloudy greenish blue isle of wight grew smaller smaller in few more minute strip of grey haze detached from other strip be cloud descended out of sky became coastline sunlit pleasant coast of northern france rose took colour became definite detailed counterpart of downland of england be speeding by below in little time a seemed paris came above horizon hung there for space sank out of sight again a aeropile circled about to north again perceived eiffel tower still standing beside huge dome surmounted by pinpoint colossus perceived too though did not understand at time slanting drift of smoke aeronaut said something about trouble in underways graham did not heed at time marked minaret tower slender mass streamed skyward above city windvanes knew that in matter of grace at least paris still kept in front of larger rival even a looked pale blue shape ascended very swiftly from city like dead leaf driving up before gale curved round soared towards growing rapidly larger larger aeronaut be saying something what said graham loath to take eye from aeroplane sire bawled aeronaut pointing rose curved about northward a drew nearer nearer came nearer larger larger throb throb throb beat of aeropile flight have seemed so potent so swift suddenly appeared slow by comparison with tremendous rush how great monster seemed how swift steady passed quite closely beneath driving along silently vast spread of wirenetted translucent wing thing alive graham have momentary glimpse of row row of wrapped up passenger slung in little cradle behind wind screen of white clothed engineer crawling against gale along ladder way of spouting engine beating together of whirling wind screw of wide waste of wing exulted in sight in instant thing have passed rose slightly own little wing swayed in rush of flight fell grew smaller scarcely have moved a seemed before be again only flat blue thing dwindled in sky be aeroplane went to fro between london paris in fair weather in peaceful time came went four time day beat across channel slowly a seemed now to graham enlarged idea beachy head rose greyly to left of land called aeronaut voice small against whistling of air over wind screen not yet bawled graham laughing not land yet want to learn more of machine meant said aeronaut want to learn more of machine repeated graham be coming to said have flung free of chair taken step along guarded rail between stopped for moment colour changed hand tightened step be clinging close to aeronaut felt weight on shoulder pressure of air hat be whirling speck behind wind came in gust over wind screen blew hair in streamer past cheek aeronaut made hasty adjustment for shifting of centre of gravity pressure want to have thing explained said graham what do do when move that engine forward aeronaut hesitated then answered be complex sire mind shouted graham mind there be moment pause aeronautics be secret privilege know be master mean to know laughed full of novel realisation of power be gift from upper air aeropile curved about keen fresh wind cut across graham face garment lugged at body a stem pointed round to west two men looked into other eye sire there be rule not where be concerned said graham seem to forget aeronaut scrutinised face no said forget sire in earth man who be not sworn aeronaut have ever chance come a passenger have heard something of sort be not going to argue point do know why have slept two hundred year to fly sire said aeronaut rule if break rule graham waved penalty aside then if will watch said graham swaying gripping tight a machine lifted nose again for ascent be not game want to do do if smash for will see be going to clamber by to come share seat steady mean to fly of own accord if smash at end of will have something to pay for sleep of other thing in past be dream to fly now keep balance dozen spy be watching sire graham temper be at end perhaps chose must be swore swung round intervening mass of lever aeropile swayed be master of earth said be society now take hand off lever hold wrist yes so now how do turn nose down to glide sire said aeronaut what be will protect lord yes if have to burn london now with promise graham bought first lesson in aerial navigation be clearly to advantage journey said with loud laugh for air be like strong wine to teach quickly well do pull ah so hullo back sire back back right one two three good god ah up go be living now machine began to dance strangest figure in air now must sweep round spiral of scarcely hundred yard diameter now must rush up into air swoop down again steeply swiftly falling like hawk to recover in rushing loop swept high again in one of descent seemed driving straight at drifting park of balloon in southeast only curved about cleared by sudden recovery of dexterity extraordinary swiftness smoothness of motion extraordinary effect of rarefied air upon constitution threw graham into careless fury at last queer incident came to sober to send flying down once more to crowded life below with dark insoluble riddle a swooped came tap something flying past drop like drop of rain then a went on down saw something like white rag whirling down in wake what be that asked did not see aeronaut glanced then clutched at lever to recover for be sweeping down when aeropile be rising again drew deep breath replied indicated white thing still fluttering down be swan never saw said graham aeronaut made answer graham saw little drop upon forehead drove horizontally while graham clambered back to passenger place out of lash of wind then came swift rush down with wind screw whirling to check fall flying stage growing broad dark before sun sinking over chalk hill in west fell with left sky blaze of gold soon men must be seen a little speck heard noise coming up to meet noise like sound of wave upon pebbly beach saw that roof about flying stage be dark with people rejoicing over safe return dark mass be crushed together under stage darkness stippled with innumerable face quivering with minute oscillation of waved white handkerchief waving hand chapter xvii three day lincoln awaited graham in apartment beneath flying stage seemed curious to learn have happened pleased to hear of extraordinary delight interest graham took in flying graham be in mood of enthusiasm must learn to fly cried must master that pity poor soul who have died without opportunity sweet swift air be most wonderful experience in world will find new time full of wonderful experience said lincoln know what will care to do now have music may seem novel for present said graham flying hold let learn more of aeronaut be saying there be trade union objection to one learning there be believe said lincoln for if must ' like to occupy with can make sworn aeronaut tomorrow graham expressed wish vividly talked of sensation for while a for affair asked abruptly how be thing going on lincoln waved affair aside ostrog will tell that tomorrow said everything be settling down revolution accomplishes over world friction be inevitable here there of course rule be assured may rest secure with thing in ostrog hand must be possible for to be made sworn aeronaut a call forthwith before sleep said graham pacing then must be at very first thing tomorrow again must be possible said lincoln thoughtfully quite possible indeed will be done laughed came prepared to suggest amusement have found one for will telephone to aeronautical office from here will return to apartment in wind vane control by time have dined aeronaut will be able to come think that after have dined might prefer paused yes said graham have prepared show of dancer have be brought from capri theatre hate ballet said graham shortly always did that other be not what want to see have dancer in old day for matter of that have in ancient egypt flying true said lincoln though dancer can afford to wait said graham can afford to wait know be not latin there be question want to ask expert about machinery be keen want distraction have world to choose from said lincoln whatever want be yours asano appeared under escort of strong guard returned through city street to graham apartment far larger crowd have assembled to witness return than departure have gathered shout cheering of mass of people sometimes drowned lincoln answer to endless question graham aerial journey have suggested at first graham have acknowledged cheering cry of crowd by bow gesture lincoln warned that recognition must be considered incorrect behaviour graham already little wearied by rhythmic civility ignored subject for remainder of public progress directly arrived at apartment asano departed in search of kinematographic rendering of machinery in motion lincoln despatched graham command for model of machine small machine to illustrate various mechanical advance of last two century little group of appliance for telegraphic communication attracted master so strongly that delightfully prepared dinner served by number of charmingly dexterous girl waited for space habit of smoking have almost ceased from face of earth when expressed wish for indulgence inquiry be made excellent cigar be discovered in florida sent to by pneumatic dispatch while dinner be still in progress afterwards came aeronaut feast of ingenious wonder in hand of latter day engineer for time at rate neat dexterity of counting numbering machine building machine spinning engine patent doorway explosive motor grain water elevator slaughter house machine harvesting appliance be more fascinating to graham than bayadere be savage be refrain be savage be in stone age compared with what else have there came also practical psychologist with very interesting development in art of hypnotism name of

child of labouring class so soon a be of sufficient age to be hypnotised be thus converted into beautifully punctual trustworthy machine minder released forthwith from long long thought of youth aeronautical pupil who gave way to giddiness must be relieved from imaginary terror in street be hypnotist ready to print permanent memory upon mind if anyone desired to remember name series of number

amorous widow must obliterate previous husband angry lover release from slavery to graft desire however be still impossible fact of thought transference be yet unsystematised psychologist illustrated exposition with astounding experiment in mnemonic made through agency of troupe of pale faced child in blue graham like most of people of former time distrusted hypnotist might then there have eased mind of many painful preoccupation in spite of lincoln assurance held to old theory to be hypnotised be in way surrender of personality abdication of will at banquet of wonderful experience be beginning wanted very keenly to remain absolutely next day day yet day passed in such interest a day graham spent many hour in glorious entertainment of flying on third day soared across middle france within sight of snow clad alp vigorous exercise gave restful sleep day saw great stride in health from spiritless anaemia of first awakening whenever be not in air awake lincoln be assiduous in cause of amusement be novel curious in contemporary invention be brought to until at last appetite for novelty be well nigh glutted one might fill dozen inconsecutive volume with strange thing exhibited afternoon held court for hour so speedily found interest in contemporary becoming personal intimate at first have be alert chiefly for unfamiliarity peculiarity foppishness in dress discordance with preconception of nobility in status manner have jarred upon be remarkable to how soon strangeness faint hostility arose from disappeared how soon came to appreciate true perspective of position see old victorian day remote quaint found particularly amused by red haired daughter of manager of european piggery on second day after dinner made acquaintance of latter day dancing girl found astonishing artist after more hypnotic wonder on third day lincoln be moved to suggest that master must repair to pleasure city graham declined must accept service of hypnotist in aeronautical experiment link of locality held to london found perpetual wonder in topographical identification that must have missed abroad here hundred foot below here must say used to eat midday cutlet during london university day underneath here be waterloo perpetual hunt for confusing train often have stood waiting down there bag in hand stared up into sky above forest of signal little thinking must walk day hundred yard in air now in very sky that be once grey smoke canopy circle in aeropile during three day graham be so occupied with such distraction that vast political movement in progress outside quarter have small share of attention about told little daily came ostrog bos grand vizier mayor of palace to report in vague term steady establishment of rule little trouble soon to be settled in city slight disturbance in song of social revolt came to no more never learned that have be forbidden in municipal limit great emotion of crow nest slumbered in mind on second third of three day found in spite of interest in daughter of pig manager may be by reason of thought conversation suggested remembering girl helen wotton who have spoken to so oddly at wind vane keeper gathering impression have made be deep one albeit incessant surprise of novel circumstance have kept from brooding upon for space now memory be coming to own wondered what have meant by broken half forgotten sentence picture of eye earnest passion of face became more vivid a mechanical interest faded beauty came compellingly between certain immediate temptation of ignoble passion did not see again until three full day be past chapter xviii graham remembers came upon at last in little gallery ran from wind vane office toward state apartment gallery be long narrow with series of recess with arched fenestration that looked upon court of palm came upon suddenly in one of recess be seated turned head at sound of footstep started at sight of touch of colour vanished from face rose instantly made step toward a

beautiful worshipful enthusiasm greatness of theme be like great gulf fixed between to touch to clasp hand be thing beyond hope then will rule indeed said slowly will rule paused with there came tense silence then beating clock striking hour made answer graham rose even now said ostrog will be waiting hesitated facing when have asked certain question there be much know may be will go to see with own eye thing of have spoken when return will know of going coming will wait for here again stood for moment regarding knew said stopped waited said more regarded one steadfastly questioningly then turned from towards wind vane office chapter xix ostrog point of view graham found ostrog waiting to give formal account of day stewardship on previous occasion have passed over ceremony a speedily a possible in order to resume aerial experience now began to ask quick short question be very anxious to take up empire forthwith ostrog brought flattering report of development of affair abroad in paris berlin graham perceived that be saying there have be trouble not organised resistance indeed insubordinate proceeding after year said ostrog when graham pressed enquiry commune have lifted head again be real nature of struggle to be explicit order have be restored in city graham more deliberately judicial for stirring emotion felt asked if there have be fighting little said ostrog in one quarter only senegalese division of african agricultural police consolidated african company have very well drilled police be ready so be aeroplane expected little trouble in continental city in america thing be very quiet in america be satisfied with overthrow of council for time why must expect trouble asked graham abruptly there be lot of discontent social discontent labour company be learning said ostrog with touch of surprise yes be chiefly discontent with labour company be that discontent supplied motive force of overthrow awakening yes ostrog smiled became explicit have to stir up discontent have to revive old ideal of universal happiness men equal men happy luxury that everyone may not share idea have slumbered for two hundred year know that have to revive ideal impossible a be in order to overthrow council now well revolution be accomplished council be overthrown people whom have stirred up remain surging there be scarcely enough fighting made promise of course be extraordinary how violently rapidly vague out of date humanitarianism have revived spread who sowed seed even have be astonished in paris a say have have to call in little external help here there be trouble multitude will not go back to work there be general strike factory be empty people be swarming in way be talking of commune men in silk satin have be insulted in street blue canvas be expecting sort of thing from of course there be need for to trouble be setting babble machine to work with counter suggestion in cause of law order must keep grip tight be graham thought perceived way of asserting spoke with restraint even to pitch of bringing negro police said be useful said ostrog be fine loyal brute with wash of idea in head such a rabble have council must have have a police of way thing might have be different of course there be nothing to fear except rioting wreckage can manage own wing now can soar away to capri if there be smoke fuss have pull of great thing aeronaut be privileged rich closest trade union in world so be engineer of wind vane have air mastery of air be mastery of earth one of ability be organising against have leader only sectional leader of secret society organised before very opportune awakening mere busy body sentimentalist be bitterly jealous of other none of be man enough for central figure only trouble will be disorganised upheaval to be frank may happen wo interrupt aeronautics day when people must make revolution be past suppose be said graham suppose be mused world of yours have be full of surprise to in old day dreamt of wonderful democratic life of time when men must be equal happy ostrog looked at steadfastly day of democracy be past said past for ever day began with bowman of crecy ended when marching infantry when common men in mass ceased to win battle of world when costly cannon great ironclad strategic railway became mean of power to day be day of wealth wealth now be power a never be power before command earth sea sky power be for who can handle wealth must accept fact be fact world for crowd crowd a ruler even in day that creed have be tried condemned to day have only one believer multiplex silly one mall in crowd graham did not answer immediately stood lost in sombre preoccupation said ostrog day of common man be past on open countryside one man be a good a nearly a good earlier aristocracy have precarious tenure of strength audacity be tempered tempered there be insurrection duel riot first real aristocracy first permanent aristocracy came in with castle armour vanished before musket bow be second aristocracy real one day of gunpowder democracy be only eddy in stream common man now be helpless unit in day have great machine of city organisation complex beyond understanding yet said graham there be something resists something be holding down something that stir press will see said ostrog with forced smile must brush difficult question aside have not roused force to destroy trust wonder said graham ostrog stared must world go way said graham with emotion at speaking point must indeed go in way have hope be vain what do mean said ostrog hope came from democratic age find aristocratic tyranny well be chief tyrant graham shook head well said ostrog take general question be way that change have always travelled aristocracy prevalence of best suffering extinction of unfit so to better thing aristocracy people met oh not said ostrog for most part go to death vice pleasure have child that sort of stuff will die out if world keep to one road be if there be turning back easy road to excess convenient euthanasia for pleasure seeker singed in flame be way to improve race pleasant extinction said graham yet thought for instant there be that other thing crowd great mass of poor men will die out will not die out suffers suffering be force even ostrog moved impatiently when spoke spoke rather le evenly than before trouble about thing said everything will be settled in few day now crowd be huge foolish beast what if doe not die out even if doe not die can still be tamed driven have sympathy with servile men heard people shouting singing two night ago be taught that song if have taken man there in cold blood asked why shouted must not have told think be shouting for that be loyal devoted to just then be ready to slaughter council to day be already murmuring against who have overthrown council said graham shouted because life be dreary without joy pride because in in hoped what be hope what be hope what right have to hope work ill want reward of who work well hope of mankind what be that day over man may come that day inferior weak bestial may be subdued eliminated subdued if not eliminated world be place for bad stupid enervated duty be fine duty too be to die death of failure be path by beast rose to manhood by man go on to higher thing ostrog took pace seemed to think turned on graham can imagine how great world state of ours seems to victorian englishman regret old form of representative government spectre still haunt world voting council parliament eighteenth century tomfoolery feel moved against pleasure city might have thought of have not be busy will learn better people be mad with envy must be in sympathy with even in street now clamour to destroy pleasure city pleasure city be excretory organ of state attractive place that year after year draw together be weak vicious be lascivious lazy easy roguery of world to graceful destruction go there have time die childless pretty silly lascivious woman die childless mankind be better if people be sane must not envy rich way of death must emancipate silly brainless worker that have enslaved try to make life easy pleasant again just a have sunk to what be fit for smiled smile irritated graham oddly will learn better know idea in boyhood read shelley dreamt of liberty there be liberty save wisdom self control liberty be within not without be man own affair suppose be impossible that swarming yelping fool in blue get upper hand of then will only fall to other master so long a there be sheep nature will insist on beast of prey must mean few hundred year delay coming of aristocrat be fatal assured end will be over man for mad protest of humanity let revolt let win kill like others will arise other master end will be same wonder said graham doggedly for moment stood downcast must see thing for said suddenly assuming tone of confident mastery only by seeing can understand must learn be what want to tell ostrog want to be king in pleasure city be not pleasure have spent enough time with aeronautics other thing must learn how people live now how common life have developed then will understand thing better must learn how common people live labour people more especially how work marry bear child die get that from realistic novelist suggested ostrog suddenly preoccupied want reality said graham not realism there be difficulty said ostrog thought on whole perhaps did not expect have thought yet perhaps say want to go through way of city see common people suddenly came to conclusion must need to go disguised said city be intensely excited discovery of presence among might create fearful tumult still wish of yours to go into city idea of yours yes now think thing over seems to not altogether can be contrived if must really find interest in be of course master can go soon if like disguise for excursion asano will be able to manage must go with after be not bad idea of yours will not want to consult in matter asked graham suddenly struck by odd suspicion oh dear think may trust affair to for time at rate said ostrog smiling even if differ graham glanced at sharply there be fighting likely to happen soon asked abruptly certainly not have be

hall of trance have be on further side where now shapeless pile of smashed shattered masonry be heaped together be already high day sun be shining brightly out of tall cavern of blue electric light came swift way crowded with multitude of people who poured off gathered ever denser over wreckage confusion of ruin air be full of shouting be pressing swaying towards central building for most part that shouting mass consisted of shapeless swarm here there graham must see that rude discipline struggled to establish voice clamoured for order in chaos to ward man to ward cable carried into hall graham recognised a ante chamber to hall of atlas about gallery of have walked day ago with howard to show to vanished council hour from awakening now place be empty except for two cable attendant men seemed hugely astonished to recognise sleeper in man who swung down from cross seat where be helen wotton demanded where be helen wotton did not know then where be ostrog must see ostrog forthwith have disobeyed have come back to take thing out of hand without waiting for asano went straight across place ascended step at further end pulling curtain aside found facing perpetually labouring titan hall be empty appearance have changed very greatly since first sight of have suffered serious injury in violent struggle of first outbreak on right hand side of great figure upper half of wall have be torn away for nearly two hundred foot of length sheet of same glassy film have enclosed graham at awakening have be drawn across gap deadened did not altogether exclude roar of people outside ward ward ward seemed to be saying through there be visible beam support of metal scaffolding rose fell according to requirement of great crowd of workman idle building machine with lank arm of red painted metal caught still plastic block of mineral paste swung neatly into position stretched gauntly across green tinted picture on be still number of workman staring at crowd below for moment stood regarding thing asano overtook ostrog said asano will be in small office beyond there little man looked livid now eye searched graham face have scarcely advanced ten pace from curtain before little panel to left of atlas rolled up ostrog accompanied by lincoln followed by two black yellow clad negro appeared crossing remote corner of hall towards second panel be raised open ostrog shouted graham at sound of voice little party turned astonished ostrog said something to lincoln advanced alone graham be first to speak voice be loud dictatorial what be hear asked be bringing negro here to keep people down be none too soon said ostrog have be getting out of hand more more since revolt under estimated do mean that infernal negro be on way on way a be have seen people outside wonder after what be said have taken too much on ostrog ostrog said nothing drew nearer negro must not come to london said graham be master will not come ostrog glanced at lincoln who at once came towards with two attendant close behind why not asked ostrog white men must be mastered by white men besides negro be only instrument be not question be master mean to be master tell negro will not come people believe in people because be anachronism be man out of past accident be owner perhaps of property in world be not master know enough to be master glanced at lincoln again know now what think can guess something of what mean to do even now be not too late to warn dream of human equality of socialistic order have worn out dream of nineteenth century fresh vivid in mind must rule age that understand listen said graham can hear sound like sea not voice voice do altogether understand taught said ostrog perhaps can teach to forget enough of negro must not come there be pause ostrog looked in eye will said forbid said graham have started will not have said ostrog sorry a be to follow method of council for own good must not side with disorder now that be here be kind of to come here lincoln laid hand on graham shoulder abruptly graham realized enormity of blunder in coming to council house turned towards curtain separated hall from antechamber clutching hand of asano intervened in moment lincoln have grasped graham cloak turned struck at lincoln face incontinently negro have by collar arm wrenched away sleeve tore noisily stumbled back to be tripped by other attendant then struck ground heavily be staring at distant ceiling of hall shouted rolled over struggling fiercely clutched attendant leg threw headlong struggled to foot lincoln appeared before went down heavily again with blow under point of jaw lay still graham made two stride stumbled then ostrog arm be round neck be pulled over backward fell heavily arm be pinned to ground after few violent effort ceased to struggle lay staring at ostrog heaving throat be prisoner panted ostrog exulting be rather fool to come back graham turned head about perceived through irregular green window in wall of hall men who have be working building crane gesticulating excitedly to people below have seen ostrog followed eye started shouted something to lincoln lincoln did not move bullet smashed among moulding above atlas two sheet of transparent matter have be stretched across gap be rent edge of torn aperture darkened curved ran rapidly towards framework in moment council chamber stood open to air chilly gust blew in by gap bringing with war of voice from ruinous space without elvish babblement save master be doing to master master be betrayed then realised that ostrog attention be distracted that ostrog grip have relaxed wrenching arm free struggled to knee in moment have thrust ostrog back be on one foot hand gripping ostrog throat ostrog hand clutching silk about neck now men be coming towards from dais men whose intention misunderstood have glimpse of someone running in distance towards curtain of antechamber then ostrog have slipped from newcomer be upon to infinite astonishment seized obeyed shout of ostrog be lugged dozen yard before realised that be not friend that be dragging towards open panel when saw pulled back tried to fling down shouted for help with strength time there be answering cry grip upon neck relaxed behold in lower corner of rent upon wall first one then number of little black figure appeared shouting waving arm came leaping down from gap into light gallery have led to silent room ran along so near be that graham must see weapon in hand then ostrog be shouting in ear to men who held once more be struggling with strength against endeavour to thrust towards opening yawned to receive ca come down panted ostrog dare fire be all right will save from yet for long minute a seemed to graham inglorious struggle continued clothes be rent in dozen place be covered in dust one hand have be trodden upon must hear shout of supporter once heard shot must feel strength giving way feel effort wild aimless help came surely irresistibly that black yawning opening came nearer pressure upon relaxed struggled up saw be grey head receding perceived that be no longer held turned about came full into man in black one of green weapon cracked close to drift of pungent smoke came into face steel blade flashed huge chamber span about saw man in pale blue stabbing one of black yellow attendant not three yard from face then hand be upon again be being pulled in two direction now seemed a though people be shouting to wanted to understand must not someone be clutching about thigh be being hoisted in spite of vigorous effort understood suddenly ceased to struggle be lifted up on men shoulder carried away from that devouring panel ten thousand throat be cheering saw men in blue black hurrying after retreating ostrogites firing lifted up saw now across whole expanse of hall beneath atlas image saw that be being carried towards raised platform in centre of place far end of hall be already full of people running towards be looking at cheering became aware that sort of body guard surrounded active men about shouted vague order saw close at hand black moustached man in yellow who have be among who have greeted in public theatre shouting direction hall be already densely packed with swaying people little metal gallery sagged with shouting load curtain at end have be torn away ante chamber be revealed densely crowded must scarcely make man near hear for tumult about where have ostrog gone asked man questioned pointed over head towards lower panel about hall on side opposite gap stood open armed men blue clad with black sash be running through vanishing into chamber passage beyond seemed to graham that sound of firing drifted through riot be carried in staggering curve across great hall towards opening beneath gap perceived men working with sort of rude discipline to keep crowd off to make space clear about passed out of hall saw crude new wall rising blankly before topped by blue sky be swung down to foot someone gripped arm guided found man in yellow close at hand be taking up narrow stairway of brick close at hand rose great red painted mass crane lever still engine of big building machine be at top of step be hurried across narrow railed footway suddenly with vast shouting amphitheatre of ruin opened again before master be with master master shout swept athwart lake of face like wave broke against distant cliff of ruin came back in welter of cry master be on side graham perceived that be no longer encompassed by people that be standing upon little temporary platform of white metal part of flimsy seeming scaffolding that laced about great mass of council house over huge expanse of ruin swayed eddied shouting people here there black banner of revolutionary society ducked swayed formed rare nucleus of organisation in chaos up steep stair of wall scaffolding by rescuer have reached opening in atlas chamber clung solid crowd little energetic black figure clinging to pillar projection be strenuous to induce congested mass to stir behind at higher point on scaffolding number of men struggled upwards with flapping fold of huge black standard through yawning gap in wall below must look down upon packed attentive multitude in hall of atlas distant flying stage to south came out bright vivid brought nearer a seemed by unusual translucency of air solitary aeropile beat up from central stage a if to meet coming aeroplane what have become of ostrog asked graham even a spoke saw that eye be turned from towards crest of council house building looked also in direction of universal attention for moment saw nothing jagged corner of wall hard clear against sky then in shadow perceived interior of room recognised with start green white decoration of former prison coming quickly across opened room up to very verge of cliff of ruin came little white clad figure followed by two other smaller seeming figure in black yellow heard man beside exclaim ostrog turned to ask question never did because of startled exclamation of of who be with lank finger suddenly pointing looked behold aeropile have be rising from flying stage when last have looked in direction be driving towards swift steady flight be still novel enough to hold attention nearer came growing rapidly larger larger until have swept over further edge of ruin into view of dense multitude below drooped across space rose passed overhead rising to clear mass of council house filmy translucent shape with solitary aeronaut peering down through rib vanished beyond skyline of ruin graham transferred attention to ostrog be signalling with hand attendant busy breaking down wall beside in moment aeropile came into view again little thing far away coming round in wide curve going slower then suddenly man in yellow shouted what be doing what be people doing why be ostrog left there why be not captured will lift aeropile will lift ah exclamation be echoed by shout from ruin rattling sound of green weapon drifted across intervening gulf to graham looking down saw number of black yellow uniform running along one of gallery lay open to air below promontory upon ostrog stood fired a ran at men unseen then emerged number of pale blue figure in pursuit minute fighting figure have oddest effect seemed a ran like little model soldier in toy queer appearance of house cut open gave that struggle amidst furniture passage quality of unreality be perhaps two hundred yard away from very nearly fifty above head in ruin below black yellow men ran into open archway turned fired volley one of blue pursuer striding forward close to edge flung up arm staggered sideways seemed to graham sense to hang over edge for several second fell headlong down graham saw strike projecting corner fly out head over heel head over heel vanish behind red arm of building machine then shadow came between graham sun looked up sky be clear knew aeropile have passed ostrog have vanished man in yellow thrust before zealous perspiring pointing blatent be grounding cried man in yellow be grounding tell people to fire at tell to fire at graham must not understand heard loud voice repeating enigmatical order suddenly over edge of ruin saw prow of aeropile come gliding stop with jerk in moment graham understood that thing have grounded in order that ostrog might escape by saw blue haze climbing out of gulf perceived that people below be now firing up at projecting stem man beside cheered hoarsely saw that blue rebel have gained archway have be contested by men in black yellow moment before be running in continual stream along open passage suddenly aeropile slipped over edge of council house fell dropped tilting at angle of forty five degree dropping so steeply that seemed to graham seemed perhaps to most of below must not possibly rise again fell so closely past that must see ostrog clutching guide of seat with grey hair streaming see white faced aeronaut wrenching over lever drove engine along guide heard apprehensive vague cry of innumerable men below graham clutched railing before gasped second seemed age lower fan of aeropile passed within ace of touching people who yelled screamed trampled one below then rose for moment looked a if must not possibly clear opposite cliff then that must not possibly clear wind wheel rotated beyond behold be clear soaring still heeling sideways upward upward into wind swept suspense of moment gave place to fury of exasperation a swarming people realised that ostrog have escaped with belated activity renewed fire until rattling wove into roar until whole area became dim blue air pungent with thin smoke of weapon too late aeropile dwindled smaller smaller curved about swept gracefully downward to flying stage from have so lately risen ostrog have escaped for while confused babblement arose from ruin then universal attention came back to graham perched high among scaffolding saw face of people turned towards heard shout at rescue from throat of way came song of revolt spreading like breeze across swaying sea of men little group of men about shouted congratulation on escape man in yellow be close to with set face shining eye song be rising louder louder tramp tramp tramp tramp slowly realisation came of full meaning of thing to perception of swift change in position ostrog who have stood beside whenever have faced that shouting multitude before be beyond there antagonist there be one to rule for longer even people about leader organiser of multitude looked to see what must do looked to to act awaited order be king indeed puppet reign be at end be very intent to do thing be expected of nerve muscle be quivering mind be perhaps little confused felt fear anger hand have be trodden upon throbbed be hot be little nervous about bearing knew be not afraid be anxious not to seem afraid in former life have often be more excited in playing game of skill be desirous of immediate action knew must not think too much in detail of huge complexity of struggle about lest must be paralysed by sense of intricacy over there square blue shape flying stage meant ostrog against ostrog be fighting for world chapter xxiii while aeroplane be coming for time master of earth be not even master of own mind even will seemed will not own own act surprised be part of confusion of strange experience poured across being thing be definite aeroplane be coming helen wotton have warned people of coming be master of earth of fact seemed struggling for complete possession of thought protruded from background of swarming hall elevated passage room jammed with ward leader in council kinematograph telephone room window looking out on seething sea of marching men man in yellow men whom fancied be called ward leader be either propelling forward following obediently be hard to tell perhaps be doing little of perhaps power unseen unsuspected propelled be aware that be going to make proclamation to people of earth aware of certain grandiose phrase floating in mind a thing meant to say many little thing happened then found with man in yellow entering little room where proclamation of be to be made room be grotesquely latter day in appointment in centre be bright oval lit by shaded electric light from above rest be in shadow double finely fitting door through came from swarming hall of atlas made place very still dead thud of a closed behind sudden cessation of tumult in have be living for hour quivering circle of light whisper quick noiseless movement of vaguely visible attendant in shadow have strange effect upon graham huge ear of phonographic mechanism gaped in battery for word black eye of great photographic camera awaited beginning beyond metal rod coil glittered dimly something whirled about with droning hum walked into centre of light shadow drew together black sharp to little blot at foot vague shape of thing meant to say be already in mind silence isolation sudden withdrawal from contagious crowd silent audience of gaping glaring machine have not be in anticipation support seemed withdrawn together seemed to have dropped into suddenly suddenly to have discovered in moment be changed found that now feared to be inadequate feared to be theatrical feared quality of voice quality of wit astonished turned to man in yellow with propitiatory gesture for moment said must wait did not think must be like must think of thing have to say while be still hesitating there came agitated messenger with news that foremost aeroplane be passing over arawan arawan said where be that anyhow be coming will be here when by twilight great god in only few hour what news of flying stage asked people of south west ward be ready ready turned impatiently to blank circle of lens again suppose must be sort of speech must to god knew certainly thing must be said aeroplane at arawan must have started before main fleet people only ready surely oh what doe matter whether speak well ill said felt light grow brighter have framed vague sentence of democratic sentiment when suddenly doubt overwhelmed belief in heroic quality calling found have altogether lost assured conviction picture of little strutting futility in windy waste of incomprehensible destiny replaced abruptly be perfectly clear to that revolt against ostrog be premature foredoomed to failure impulse of passionate inadequacy against inevitable thing thought of swift flight of aeroplane like swoop of fate towards be astonished that must have seen thing in other light in final emergency debated thrust debate resolutely aside determined at cost to go through with thing have undertaken must find word to begin even a stood awkward hesitating with indiscrete apology for inability trembling on lip came noise of many people cry out running to fro of foot wait cried someone door opened be coming said voice graham turned watching light waned through open doorway saw slight grey figure advancing across spacious hall heart leapt be helen wotton behind about marched riot of applause man in yellow came out of nearer shadow into circle of light be girl who told what ostrog have dune said face be aflame heavy coil of black hair fell about shoulder fold of soft silk robe wore streamed from floated in rhythm of advance drew nearer nearer heart be beating fast doubt be gone shadow of doorway fell athwart face be near have not betrayed cried be with where have be said graham at office of south west ward until ten minute since did not know have returned went to office of south west ward to find ward leader in order that might tell people came back so soon a heard knew cried knew must be with be be that told have risen world be rising people have awakened thank god did not act in vain be master still told said slowly saw that in spite of steady eye lip trembled throat rose fell told knew of order be here heard that negro be to come to london to guard to keep people down to keep prisoner stopped came out told people be master still graham glanced at black lens of camera vast listening ear back to face be master still said slowly swift rush of fleet of aeroplane passed across thought did who be niece of ostrog for cried for that for whom world have waited must not be cheated of power graham stood for space wordless regarding doubt questioning have fled before presence remembered thing that have meant to say faced camera again light about grew brighter turned again towards have saved said have saved power battle be beginning god know what night will see not dishonour paused addressed to unseen multitude who stared upon through grotesque black eye at first spoke slowly men woman of new age said have arisen to do battle for race there be easy victory before stopped to gather word thought have be in mind before came returned transfigured no longer touched with shadow of possible irrelevance night be beginning cried battle be coming battle rush upon to night be only beginning life may be must fight take thought though be beaten though be utterly overthrown found thing in mind too vague for word paused momentarily broke into vague exhortation then rush of speech came upon much that said be humanitarian commonplace of vanished age conviction of voice touched to vitality stated case of old day to people of new age to woman at side come out of past to said with memory of age hoped age be age of dream of beginning age of noble hope throughout world have made end of slavery throughout world have spread desire anticipation that war might cease that men woman might live

out of shadow through doubtful place sense of silent spectator beside sustained sincerity for few glorious moment be carried away felt doubt of heroic quality doubt of heroic word have straight plain eloquence limped longer at last made end to speaking here now cried make will be mine in world give to people of world be mine in world give to people of world give to give to a god will will live for will die ended with florid gesture turned about found light of present exaltation reflected in face of girl eye met eye be swimming with tear of enthusiasm seemed to be urged towards other clasped hand stood gripped facing one in eloquent silence whispered knew whispered knew must not speak crushed hand in mind be theatre of gigantic passion man in yellow be beside have noted coming be saying that south west ward be marching never expected so soon cried have done wonder must send word to help on way graham dropped helen hand stared at absent mindedly then with start returned to previous preoccupation about flying stage yes said that be good that be good weighed message tell well done south west turned eye to helen wotton again face expressed struggle between conflicting idea must capture flying stage explained unless can do will land negro at cost must prevent that felt even a spoke that be not what have be in mind before interruption saw touch of surprise in eye seemed about to speak shrill bell drowned voice occurred to graham that expected to lead marching people that be thing have to do made offer abruptly addressed man in yellow spoke to saw face respond here be doing nothing said be impossible protested man in yellow be fight in warren place be here explained elaborately motioned towards room where graham must wait insisted other course be possible must know where be said at moment crisis may arise needing presence decision room be luxurious little apartment with news machine broken mirror have once be en rapport with crow nest speculum seemed matter of course to graham that helen must stop with picture have drifted through mind of such vast dramatic struggle a mass in ruin have suggested here be spectacular battle field such a imagined instead be seclusion suspense be only a afternoon wore on that pieced together truer picture of fight be raging inaudibly invisibly within four mile of beneath roehampton stage strange unprecedented contest be battle be hundred thousand little battle battle in sponge of way channel fought out of sight of sky sun under electric glare fought out in vast confusion by multitude untrained in arm led chiefly by acclamation multitude dulled by mindless labour enervated by tradition of two hundred year of servile security against multitude demoralised by life of venial privilege sensual indulgence have artillery differentiation into force that only weapon on side be little green metal carbine whose secret manufacture sudden distribution in enormous quantity have be one of ostrog culminating move against council few have have experience with weapon many have never discharged one many who carried came unprovided with ammunition never be wilder firing in history of warfare be battle of amateur hideous experimental warfare armed rioter fighting armed rioter armed rioter swept forward by word fury of song by tramping sympathy of number pouring in countless myriad towards smaller way disabled lift gallery slippery with blood hall passage choked with smoke beneath flying stage to learn there when retreat be hopeless ancient mystery of warfare overhead save for few sharpshooter upon roof space for few band thread of vapour multiplied darkened towards evening day be clear serenity ostrog seems have bomb at command in earlier phase of battle aeropiles played part not smallest cloud be there to break empty brilliance of sky seemed a though held vacant until aeroplane must come ever again there be news of drawing nearer from mediterranean port then presently from south of france of new gun that ostrog have made be known to be in city came news in spite of graham urgency report of success from dense felt of fighting strand about flying stage section after section of labour society reported assembled reported marching vanished from knowledge into labyrinth of warfare what be happening there even busy ward leader did not know in spite of opening closing of door hasty messenger ringing of bell perpetual clitter clack of recording implement graham felt isolated strangely inactive inoperative isolation seemed at time strangest most unexpected of thing have happened since awakening have something of quality of inactivity come in dream tumult stupendous realisation of world struggle between ostrog then confined quiet little room with mouthpiece bell broken mirror now door must be closed be alone together seemed sharply marked off then from unprecedented world storm rushed together without vividly aware of one only concerned with one then door must open again messenger must enter sharp bell must stab quiet privacy be like window in well built brightly lit house flung open suddenly to hurricane dark hurry tumult stress vehemence of battle rushed in overwhelmed be no longer person mere spectator mere impression of tremendous convulsion became unreal even to miniature of personality indescribably small two antagonistic reality only reality in being be first city throbbed roared yonder in belated frenzy of defence secondly aeroplane hurling inexorably towards over round shoulder of world at first mood have be one of exalted confidence great pride have possessed pride in one for greatness of issue have challenged at first have walked room eloquent with transitory persuasion of tremendous destiny slowly uneasy intimation of coming defeat touched spirit there came long period in be alone changed theme became egotistical spoke of wonder of sleep of little life of memory remote yet minute clear like something seen through inverted opera glass brief play of desire error have made former life said little emotion in face followed tone in voice seemed to have at last perfect understanding reverted from pure reminiscence to sense of greatness imposed upon through destiny be before said vast inheritance of did not dream insensibly heroic preoccupation with revolutionary struggle passed to question of relationship began to question told of day before awakening spoke with brief vividness of girlish dream have given bias to life of incredulous emotion awakening have aroused told too of tragic circumstance of girlhood have darkened life quickened sense of injustice opened heart prematurely to wider sorrow of world for little time so far a be concerned great war about be vast ennobling background to personal thing in instant personal relation be submerged there came messenger to tell that great fleet of aeroplane be rushing between sky avignon went to crystal dial in corner assured that thing be so went to chart room consulted map to measure distance of avignon new arawan london made swift calculation went to room of ward leader to ask for news of fight for stage there be one there after time came back to face have changed have dawned upon that struggle be perhaps more than half over ostrog be holding own that arrival of aeroplane must mean panic might leave helpless chance phrase in message have given glimpse of reality came of soaring giant bore thousand half savage negro to death grapple of city suddenly humanitarian enthusiasm showed flimsy only two of ward leader be in room when presently repaired hall of atlas seemed empty fancied change in bearing of attendant in outer room sombre disillusionment darkened mind looked at anxiously when returned to news said with assumed carelessness in answer to eye then be moved to frankness rather bad news be losing be gaining ground aeroplane draw nearer nearer walked length of room turned unless can capture flying stage in next hour there will be horrible thing will be beaten said have justice have people have god on side ostrog have discipline have plan do know out there just now felt when heard that aeroplane be stage nearer felt a

savage ruled by force used a force have be under rule of white two hundred year be not race quarrel race sinned race pay labourer poor people of london vicarious atonement to stand wrong be to share guilt looked keenly at astonished at new aspect presented without came shrill ringing of bell sound of foot gabble of phonographic message man in yellow appeared yes said graham be at vichy where be attendant who be in great hall of atlas asked graham abruptly presently babble machine rang again may win yet said man in yellow going out to if only can find where ostrog have hidden gun everything hang on now perhaps graham followed only news be of aeroplane have reached orleans graham returned to helen news said news can hing nothing paced impatiently suddenly swift anger be nature swept upon curse complex world cried invention of men that man must die like rat in snare never see foe oh for one blow turned with abrupt change in manner be nonsense said be savage paced stopped after london paris be only two city temperate zone have risen what if london be doomed paris destroyed be accident again came mockery of news to call to fresh enquiry returned with graver face sat down beside end must be near said people seems have fought died in ten of thousand way about roehampton must be like smoked beehive have died in vain be still only at sub stage aeroplane be near paris even be gleam of success to come now there must be nothing to do there must be time to do anything before be upon gun might have saved be mislaid mislaid think of disorder of thing think of foolish tumult can not

little grasped too hastily paused be ashamed of avowal there be one thing make up for have known across gulf of time have come to rest be done be done with too have be something more something paused with face searching hers without clamoured unheeded message that aeroplane be rising into sky of amiens put hand to throat lip be white stared before a if saw horrible possibility suddenly feature changed oh have be honest cried then have be honest loved world freedom hated cruelty oppression surely be that yes said yes have done what lay in to do have given message message have started armageddon now now that have may be last hour together now that greater thing be done stopped sat in silence face be white riddle for moment heeded nothing of sudden stir outside running to fro cry then helen started to attitude of tense attention be cried stood up speechless incredulous triumphant graham too heard metallic voice be shouting victory yes be victory stood up also with light of desperate hope in eye bursting through curtain appeared man in yellow startled dishevelled with excitement victory cried victory people be winning ostrog people have collapsed rose victory voice be hoarse faint what do mean asked graham tell what have driven out of under gallery at norwood streatham be afire burning wildly roehampton be ours ours have taken aeropile lay thereon for instant graham helen stood in silence heart be beating fast looked at one for one last moment there gleamed in graham dream of empire of kingship with helen by side gleamed passed shrill bell rang agitated grey headed man appeared from room of ward leader be over cried what matter now that have roehampton aeroplane have be sighted at boulogne channel said man in calculated swiftly hour still have three of flying stage said old man gun cried graham can not mount in hour do mean be found too late said old man if must stop hour cried man in yellow nothing can stop now said old man have near hundred aeroplane in first fleet hour asked graham to be so near said ward leader now that have found gun to be so near if once must get out upon roof space how long must take asked graham suddenly hour certainly too late cried ward leader too late be too late said graham even now hour have suddenly perceived possibility tried to speak calmly face be white there be one chance said there be aeropile on roehampton stage sire smashed be lying crossway to carrier might be got upon guide easily there be aeronaut graham glanced at two men then at helen spoke after long pause have aeronaut none aeroplane be clumsy said thoughtfully compared with aeropiles turned suddenly to helen decision be made must do do what go to flying stage to aeropile what do mean be aeronaut after day for reproached be not wasted turned to old man in yellow put aeropile upon guide man in yellow hesitated what do mean to do cried helen aeropile be chance mean to fight yes to fight in air have thought before aeroplane be clumsy thing resolute man never since flying began cried man in yellow there have be need now time have come tell now send message to put upon guide old man dumbly interrogated man in yellow nodded hurried out helen made step towards graham face be white how can one fight will be killed perhaps yet not to do to let someone else attempt stopped must speak more swept alternative aside by gesture stood looking at one be right said at last in low tone be right if can be done must go day for not altogether moved step towards stepped back white face struggled against resisted gasped can not bear go now extended hand stupidly clenched fist go now cried go now hesitated understood threw hand up in queer half theatrical gesture have word to say turned from man in yellow moved towards door with clumsy belated tact graham stepped past went striding through room where ward leader bawled at telephone directing that aeropile must be put upon guide man in yellow glanced at helen still figure hesitated hurried after graham did not once look back did not speak until curtain of ante chamber of great hall fell behind then turned head with curt swift direction upon bloodless lip chapter xxiv coming of aeroplane two men in pale blue be lying in irregular line that stretched along edge of captured roehampton stage from end to end grasping carbine peering into shadow of stage called wimbledon park now then spoke to one spoke mutilated english of class period fire of ostrogites have dwindled ceased few of enemy have be seen for time echo of fight be going on now far below in lower gallery of stage came now then between staccato of shot from popular side one of men be describing to other how have seen man down below there dodge behind girder have aimed at guess hit cleanly a dodged too far be down there still said marksman see little patch yes between bar few yard behind lay dead stranger face upward to sky with blue canvas of jacket smoldering in circle about neat bullet hole on chest close beside wounded man with leg swathed about sat with expressionless face watched progress of burning gigantic behind athwart carrier lay captured aeropile ca see now said second man in ton of provocation marksman became foul mouthed high voiced in earnest endeavour to make thing plain suddenly interrupting came noisy shouting from substage what be going on now said raised on one arm to stare at stairhead in central groove of stage number of blue figure be coming up swarming across stage to aeropile want fool said friend only crowd up spoil shot what be after ssh be shouting something two men listened swarming new comer have crowded densely about aeropile three ward leader conspicuous by black mantle badge clambered into body appeared above rank file flung upon van gripping hold of edge until entire outline of thing be manned in place three deep one of marksman knelt up be putting on carrier be what be after rose to foot friend rose also what be good said friend have got aeronaut be what be doing anyhow looked at rifle looked at struggling crowd suddenly turning to wounded man mind mate said handing carbine cartridge belt in moment be running towards aeropile for quarter of hour be perspiring titan lugging thrusting shouting heeding shout then thing be done stood with multitude of others cheering own achievement by time knew what indeed everyone in city knew that master raw learner though be intended to fly machine be coming even now to take control of must let other man attempt who take greatest danger who bear heaviest burden man be king so master be reported to have spoken even a man cheered while bead of sweat still chased one from disorder of hair heard thunder of greater tumult in fitful snatch beat impulse of revolutionary song saw through gap in people that thick stream of head still poured up stairway master be coming shouted voice master be coming crowd about grew denser denser began to thrust towards central groove master be coming sleeper master god master roared voice suddenly quite close to be black uniform of revolutionary guard for first last time in life saw graham saw quite nearly tall dark man in flowing black robe with white resolute face eye fixed steadfastly before man who for little thing about held ear eye thought for day that man remembered passing of graham bloodless face in moment have gone be fighting in swaying crowd lad weeping with terror thrust against pressing towards stairway yelling clear for aeropile bell clear flying stage became loud unmelodious clanging with clanging in ear graham drew near aeropile marched into shadow of tilting wing became aware that number of people about be offering to accompany waved offer aside wanted to think how one started engine bell clanged faster faster foot of retreating people roared faster louder man in yellow be assisting to mount through rib of body clambered into aeronaut place fixing very carefully deliberately what be man in yellow be pointing to two aeropiles driving upward in southern sky doubt be looking for coming aeroplane presently thing to do now be to start thing be being shouted at question warning bothered wanted to think about aeropile to recall item of previous experience waved people from saw man in yellow dropping off through rib saw crowd cleft down line of girder by gesture for moment be motionless staring at lever wheel by engine shifted delicate appliance of knew so little eye caught spirit level with bubble towards remembered something spent dozen second in swinging engine forward until bubble floated in centre of tube noted that people be not shouting knew watched deliberation bullet smashed on bar above head who fired be line clear of people stood up to see sat down again in second propeller be spinning be rushing down guide gripped wheel swung engine back to lift stem then be people shouted in moment be throbbing with quiver of engine shout dwindled swiftly behind rushed down to silence wind whistled over edge of screen world sank away from very swiftly throb throb throb throb throb throb up drove fancied free of excitement felt cool deliberate lifted stem still more opened one valve on left wing swept round up looked down with steady head up one of ostrogite aeropiles be driving across course so that drove obliquely towards must pas below at steep angle little aeronaut be peering down at what did mean to do mind became active one saw held weapon pointing seemed prepared to fire what did think meant to do in moment understood tactic resolution be taken momentary lethargy be past opened two more valve to left swung round end on to hostile machine closed valve shot straight at stem wind screen shielding from shot tilted little a if to clear flung up stem throb throb throb pause throb throb set teeth face into involuntary grimace crash struck struck upward beneath nearer wing very slowly wing of antagonist seemed to broaden a impetus of blow turned up saw full breadth of then slid downward out of sight felt stem going down hand tightened on lever whirled rammed engine back felt jerk of clearance nose of machine jerked upward steeply for moment seemed to be lying on back machine be reeling staggering seemed to be dancing on screw made huge effort hung for moment on lever slowly engine came forward again be driving upward no longer so steeply gasped for moment flung at lever again wind whistled about one further effort be almost level must breathe turned head for first time to see what have become of antagonist turned back to lever for moment looked again for moment must have believed be annihilated then saw between two stage to east be chasm down something slender edge fell swiftly vanished a sixpence fall down crack at first did not understand then wild joy possessed shouted at top of voice inarticulate shout drove higher higher up sky throb throb throb pause throb throb throb where be other aeropile thought too a looked round empty heaven have momentary fear that machine have risen above then saw alighting on norwood stage have meant shooting to risk being rammed headlong two thousand foot in air be beyond latter day courage combat be declined for little while circled then swooped in steep descent towards westward stage throb throb throb throb throb throb twilight be creeping on apace smoke from streatham stage have be so dense dark be now pillar of fire laced curve of moving way translucent roof dome chasm between building be glowing softly now lit by tempered radiance of electric light that glare of way overpowered three efficient stage that ostrogites held for wimbledon park be useless because of fire from roehampton streatham be furnace be glowing with guide light for coming aeroplane a swept over roehampton stage saw dark mass of people thereon heard clap of frantic cheering bullet from wimbledon park stage tweet through air went beating up above surrey waste felt breath of wind from south west lifted westward wing a have learnt to do so drove upward heeling into rare swift upper air throb throb throb throb throb throb up drove up to that pulsating rhythm until country beneath be blue indistinct london spread like little map traced in light like mere model of city near brim of horizon south west be sky of sapphire over shadowy rim of world ever a drove upward multitude of star increased behold in southward low down glittering swiftly nearer be two little patch of nebulous light then two more then nebulous glow of swiftly driving shape presently must count there be four twenty first fleet of aeroplane have come beyond appeared yet greater glow swept round in half circle staring at advancing fleet flew in wedge like shape triangular flight of gigantic phosphorescent shape sweeping nearer through lower air made swift calculation of pace spun little wheel brought engine forward touched lever throbbing effort of engine ceased began to fall fell swifter swifter aimed at apex of wedge dropped like stone through whistling air seemed scarce second from that soaring moment before struck foremost aeroplane man of black multitude saw coming of fate man among dreamt of hawk struck downward upon out of sky who be not limp in agony of air sickness be craning black neck staring to see filmy city be rising out of haze rich splendid city to massa bos have brought obedient muscle bright teeth gleamed glossy face shone have heard of paris knew be to have lordly time among poor white trash suddenly graham struck have aimed at body of aeroplane at very last instant better idea have flashed into mind twisted about struck near edge of starboard wing with accumulated weight be jerked back a struck prow went gliding across smooth expanse towards rim felt forward rush of huge fabric sweeping aeropile along with for moment seemed age must not tell what be happening heard thousand throat yelling perceived that machine be balanced on edge of gigantic float driving down down glanced over shoulder saw backbone of aeroplane opposite float swaying up have vision through rib of sliding chair staring face hand clutching at tilting guide bar fenestration in further float flashed open a aeronaut tried to right beyond saw second aeroplane leaping steeply to escape whirl of heeling fellow broad area of swaying wing seemed to jerk upward felt aeropile have dropped clear that monstrous fabric clean overturned hung like sloping wall above did not clearly understand that have struck side float of aeroplane slipped off perceived that be flying free on down glide rapidly nearing earth what have done heart throbbed like noisy engine in throat for perilous instant must not move lever because of paralysis of hand wrenched lever to throw engine back fought for two second against weight of felt righting driving horizontally set engine beating again looked upward saw two aeroplane glide shouting far overhead looked back saw main body of fleet opening out rushing upward outward saw one have struck fall edgewise on strike like gigantic knife blade along wind wheel below put down stern looked again drove up heedless of direction a watched saw wind vane give saw huge fabric strike earth saw downward van crumple with weight of descent then whole mass turned over smashed upside down upon sloping wheel throb throb throb pause suddenly from heaving wreckage thin tongue of white fire licked up towards zenith then be aware of huge mass flying through air towards turned upwards just in time to escape charge if be charge of second aeroplane whirled by below sucked down fathom nearly turned over in gust of close passage became aware of three others rushing towards aware of urgent necessity of beating above aeroplane be about circling wildly to avoid a seemed drove past above below eastward westward far away to westward be sound of collision two falling flare far away to southward second squadron be coming steadily beat upward presently aeroplane be below for moment doubted height have of did not swoop again then came down upon second victim load of soldier saw coming big machine heeled swayed a fear maddened men scrambled to stern for weapon score of bullet sung through air there flashed star in thick glass wind screen protected aeroplane slowed dropped to foil stroke dropped too low just in time saw wind wheel of bromley hill rushing up towards spun about up a aeroplane have chased crashed among voice wove into felt of yelling great fabric seemed to be standing on end for second among heeling splintering van then flew to piece huge splinter came flying through air engine burst like shell hot rush of flame shot overhead into darkling sky two cried with bomb from overhead bursting a fell forthwith be beating up again glorious exhilaration possessed now giant activity trouble about humanity about inadequacy be gone for ever be man in battle rejoicing in power aeroplane seemed radiating from in direction intent only upon avoiding yelling of packed passenger came in short gust a swept by chose third quarry struck hastily did turn on edge escaped to smash against tall cliff of london wall flying from impact skimmed darkling ground so nearly must see frightened rabbit bolting up slope jerked up steeply found driving over south london with air about vacant to right of wild riot of signal rocket from ostrogites banged tumultuously in sky to south wreckage of dozen air ship flamed east west north air ship fled before drove away to east north went about in south for must not pause in air in present confusion attempt at evolution must have meant disastrous collision must scarcely realize thing have done in quarter aeroplane be receding be receding dwindled smaller smaller be in flight passed two hundred foot so above roehampton stage be black with people noisy with frantic shouting why be wimbledon park stage black cheering too smoke flame of streatham now hid three further stage curved about rose to see northern quarter first came square mass of shooter hill into sight from behind smoke lit orderly with aeroplane have landed disembarking negro then came blackheath then under corner of reek norwood stage on blackheath aeroplane have landed aeropile lay upon guide norwood be covered by swarm of little figure running to fro in passionate confusion why abruptly understood stubborn defence of flying stage be over people be pouring into under way of last stronghold of ostrog usurpation then from far away on northern border of city full of glorious import to came sound signal note of triumph leaden thud of gun lip fell apart face be disturbed with emotion drew immense breath win shouted to empty air people win sound of second gun came like answer then saw aeropile on blackheath be running down guide to launch lifted clean rose shot up into air driving straight southward away from in instant came to what meant must need be ostrog in flight shouted dropped towards have momentum of elevation fell slanting down air very swiftly rose steeply at approach allowed for velocity drove straight upon suddenly became mere flat edge behold be past driving headlong down with force of futile blow be furiously angry reeled engine back along shaft went circling up saw be machine beating up spiral before rose straight towards won above by virtue of impetus of swoop by advantage weight of man dropped headlong dropped missed again a rushed past saw face of ostrog aeronaut confident cool in ostrog attitude wincing resolution ostrog be looking steadfastly away from to south realized with gleam of wrath how bungling flight must be below saw croyden hill jerked upward once more gained on enemy glanced over shoulder attention be arrested by strange thing eastward stage one on shooter hill appeared to lift flash changing to tall grey shape cowled figure of smoke dust jerked into air for moment cowled figure stood motionless dropping huge mass of metal from shoulder then began to uncoil dense head of smoke people have blown up aeroplane a suddenly second flash grey shape sprang up from norwood stage even a stared at came dead report air wave of first explosion struck be flung up sideways for moment aeropile fell nearly edgewise with nose down seemed to hesitate whether to overset altogether stood on wind shield wrenching wheel swayed up over head then shock of second explosion took machine sideways found clinging to one of rib of machine air be blowing past upward seemed to be hanging quite still in air with wind blowing up past occurred to that be falling then be sure that be falling must not look down found recapitulating with incredible swiftness have happened since awakening day of doubt day of empire at last tumultuous discovery of ostrog calculated treachery be beaten be saved london be saved thought have quality of utter unreality who be why be holding so tightly with hand why must not leave go in fall a countless dream have ended in moment must wake thought ran swifter swifter wondered if must see helen again seemed so unreasonable that must not see again must be dream yet surely must meet at least be real be real must wake meet although must not look at be suddenly aware that earth be very near
