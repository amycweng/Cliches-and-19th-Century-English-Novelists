across atlantic during intervening day have rehearsed meeting in varying key always on supposition that mr britling be large quiet thoughtful sort of man man who must a be sit in attentive row like public meeting listen so mr direck have prepared quite number of pleasant attractive opening now felt be moment for one of various simple memorable utterance in none of forecast have reckoned with spontaneous activity of mr britling with station master of matching easy oblivious of conversational necessity between mr direck mr britling official now took charge of mr direck grip sack falling into line with two gentleman a walked towards exit gate resumed what be evidently interrupted discourse upon sweet pea originally addressed to mr britling be small elderly man with determined looking

guard sir not slightest bit that matter shouted station master have be looking at er be fence be suffered most be only strained post lil bit will put bag in behind sir mr direck assented then after momentary hesitation rewarded station master service ready asked mr britling be right sir station master reverberated with rather wide curve mr britling steered way out of station into highroad section now seemed be time for mr direck to make meditated speech unexpected complication be to defeat intention mr direck perceived almost at once mr britling be probably driving automobile for first second at extremest third time in life thing became evident when struggled to get into high gear attempt stopped engine be even more startlingly so when mr britling narrowly missed collision with baker cart at corner pressed accelerator explained afterwards instead of brake one doe at first missed by le than foot estimate be generous one after mr direck became too anxious not to distract host thought to persist with conversational opening attentive silence came upon gentleman be broken presently by sudden outcry from mr britling great noise of tormented gear damn cried mr britling how devil mr direck perceived that host be trying to turn car into very beautiful gateway with gate house on side then be manifest that mr britling have abandoned idea then came to stop dozen yard so along main road missed said mr britling took hand off steering wheel blew stormily then whistled bar of fretful air became still do go through ancient gate asked mr direck mr britling looked over right shoulder considered problem of curvature distance think said will go round outside park will take little longer will be simpler than backing manoeuvring here now electric starter be remarkably convenient thing otherwise now must have to get down wind up engine after came corner rounding of seemed to present few difficulty until suddenly mr britling cried out eh eh eh oh damn then two gentleman be sitting side by side in rather sloping car have ascended bank buried nose in hedge of dog rose honeysuckle from two missel thrush blackbird number of sparrow have made hurried escape section perhaps said mr britling without assurance after little peaceful pause can reverse out of seemed to feel explanation be due to mr direck see at first be perfectly simple one steer round corner then one doe put wheel straight again so one keep on going round more than one meant to be bicycle habit bicycle right one expects car to do same thing be fault book explains question clearly just at moment forgot reflected experimented in way made engine scold fuss see wo budge for reverse be embedded do mind getting out turning wheel back then if reverse perhaps will get move on mr direck descended there be considerable effort if 'd just grip spoke yes so one two three well let just sit here until somebody come along to help oh somebody will come right wo get up again after reflective moment mr direck resumed seat beside mr britling section two gentleman smiled at other to dispel suspicion of discontent driving leaf something to be desired said mr britling with air of frank impartiality have only just got car for myself after year of hired car sort of lazy arrangement where people supply car driver petrol tyre insurance everything at so much month bored abominably ca imagine now how stood for so long sent down succession of compact scornful boy who used to go fast when wanted to go slow slow when wanted to go fast who used to take corner on wrong side at top speed charge dog hen for sport of sort of thing like must not even let choose road must have got car long ago driven if be for infernal business with handle one have to do when engine stopped here see be reasonably cheap car with electric starter american need scarcely say here be going at own pace mr direck glanced for moment at pretty disorder of hedge in be embedded smiled admitted that be certainly much more agreeable before have finished saying a much mr britling be talking again have quick rather jerky way of speaking seemed to fire out thought directly came into mind seemed to have loaded magazine of thought in head spoke almost exactly twice a fast a mr direck clipping word much more using much compacter sentence generally cutting corner put mr direck off game that rapid attack while transatlantic interlocutor be deploying be indeed not infrequent defect of conversation between englishman american be source of many misunderstanding two conception of conversation differ fundamentally english be much le disposed to listen than american have not quite same sense of conversational give take at first be apt to reduce visitor to role of auditor wondering when turn will begin turn never doe begin mr direck sat deeply in slanting seat with half face to celebrated host said yep sure be so in dry grave tone that believed englishman must naturally expect to use realising only very gradually mr britling from praise of enterprise have at last brought car must drive within reach went on to favourite topic of intelligent englishman adverse criticism of thing british pointed out that central position of brake gear lever in automobile made extremely easy for american manufacturer to turn out either a left handed right handed car so adapt to continental to british rule of road english car be so adaptable british suffered much from insular rule of road just a suffered much from insular weight measure took perverse pride in such disadvantage irruption of american car into england be recent phenomenon be triumph for tremendous organising ability of american mind be doing with automobile what have done with clock watch rifle have standardised machined wholesale while british be still making thing one by one be extraordinary thing that england be originator of industrial system original developer of division of labour must have so fallen away from systematic manufacturing believed be largely due to influence of oxford established church at point mr direck be moved by anecdote will help to illustrate what be saying mr britling about systematic organisation if tell little incident happened to friend of mine in toledo where be setting up big plant with view to capturing entire american european market in class of thousand dollar car there be end of such little incident said mr britling cutting in without apparent effort see get on side manufacturer class be of course originally insurgent class be class of distended craftsman have craftsman natural

little of very cold choice in america have so far have real conservative class at fortunate continent cast out tory be left with nothing whig radical peculiar bad luck have be to get sort of revolutionary who be tory mandarin too ruskin morris for example be a reactionary anti scientific a duke bishop machine hater science hater rule of thumbites to bone so be current socialist have filled country with idea that ideal automobile ought to be made entirely by hand labour of traditional craftsman quite individually out of beaten copper wrought iron seasoned oak electric starter business electric lighting outfit have here be perfectly hateful to english mind be that be simply backward in thing be antagonistic british mind have never really tolerated electricity at least not sort of electricity run through wire too slippery glib for associate with italian fluency generally with volta galvani marconi so on proper british electricity be high grade useless long sparking stuff get by turning round glass machine stuff used to call frictional electricity keep in leyden jar at claverings here still refuse to have electric bell there be row when solomonsons who be tenant here for time tried to put in mr direck have followed cascade of remark with patient smile slowly nodding head what say said form very marked contrast indeed with sort of thing go on in america friend of mine be speaking of one who be connected with automobile factory in toledo of course mr britling burst out again even conservatism be ultimate thing after enterprising friend at toledo be very much same blood conservatism mean be racial earlier energy show be in air in soil england have become unenterprising sluggish because england have be so prosperous comfortable exactly said mr direck friend of whom be telling be man named robinson indicates pretty clearly that be of genuine english stock if may say so quite of build complexion racially must say be well very much what be section rally of mr direck mind be suddenly interrupted mr britling stood up putting hand to side of mouth shouted yi ah aye ya thea at unseen hearer after shouting again several time became manifest that have attracted attention of two willing deliberate labouring men emerged slowly first a attentive head from landscape with assistance car be restored to road again mr direck assisted manfully noted respect be given to mr britling shilling fell to men with intelligent detachment touched hat called mr britling sir examined car distantly kindly ai 'urt e not bit e ai not really said one encouragingly indeed except for slight crumpling of mud guard detachment of wire of one of headlight automobile be uninjured mr britling resumed seat mr direck gravely in silence got up beside started with usual convulsion a though something have pricked vehicle unexpectedly shamefully behind from point mr britling driving with meticulous care got home without further mishap excepting only that scraped off of metal edge of footboard against gate post of very agreeable garden family welcomed safe return visitor with undisguised relief admiration small boy appeared at corner of house then disappeared hastily again daddy got back right at last heard shouting to unseen hearer section mr direck though be little incommoded by suppression of story about robinson for when have begun thing liked to finish found mr britling household at once thoroughly british quite un american little difficult to follow have quality at first must not define at compared with anything have ever seen in life before struck a

diplomatic child think like happy hooligan better said dat ole maud reflected with joyful eye buster clean forgotten week said kick one came to mr direck a very pleasant discovery that british infant must find common ground with small people at home in characteristically american jest have never dreamt that fine wine of maud buster must travel maud treat said youthful britling relapsing into native tongue mr britling appeared coming to meet be now in grey flannel suit must have jumped into altogether very much tidier section long narrow table under big sycamore between house adapted barn mr direck learnt be used for dancing sort of thing be covered with blue linen diaper cloth that too surprised be first meal in private household in england for obscure reason have expected something very stiff formal with spotless napery have also expected very stiff capable service by implacable parlourmaid whole thing indeed highly genteel two cheerful woman servant appeared from what be presumably kitchen direction wheeling curious wicker erection small guide informed be called aunt clatter manifestly deservedly bore on shelf substance of meal while maid at migratory sideboard carved opened bottle so forth small boy slightly larger brother assisted little by two young men of very defined position relationship served company mr britling sat at head of table conversed with mr direck by mean of hostess question imperfectly accepted answer while kept watchful eye on proceeding composition of company be matter for perplexity to mr direck mr mr britling be at end of table be plain

fuzzy hair there be very erect attentive baby of year le sitting up in perambulator gesticulating cheerfully to everybody baby be that most troubled orderly mind of mr direck research for paternity made conversation with mr britling almost a disconnected absent minded a conversation with almost certainly be mr britling girl next to girl next to mr britling lady in black might of be married if so where be spouse seemed improbable that must wheel out foundling to lunch realising at last that problem of relationship must be left to solve if did not want to dissipate consume mind entirely mr direck turned to hostess who be enjoying brief lull in administrative duty told what memorable thing meeting of mr britling in own home must be in life how very highly america be coming to esteem mr britling essay found that with slight change of person one of premeditated opening be entirely serviceable here went on to observe that be novel entertaining to find mr britling driving own automobile to note that be automobile of american manufacture in america have standardised systematised making of such thing a automobile to extent must thought be almost startling to european be certainly startling to european manufacturer in illustration of might tell little story of friend of called robinson man who curiously enough in general build appearance be very reminiscent indeed of mr britling have be telling mr britling a much on way here from station friend be concerned with several others in one of biggest attack have ever be made upon what one might describe in general term a thousand dollar light automobile market what said practically be market be jig saw puzzle waiting to be put together made one be going to do be easier to figure out than to do at very outset of attack

because be blinded suddenly just when be believing that sort of trudge be going on forever be in support trench behind firing line found men be relieving ready to come back firing line just same sort of ditch with parapet of sandbag with dug out queer big hole helped out with sleeper from nearby railway track opening into from behind dug out vary good deal many be rather like cubby house made at

thick where man have be hit during day made four bag thick right up to top while be doing dreaded to find in white glare of searchlight have feeling that something must hit suddenly from behind have to make up mind not to look round must have kept on looking round also chap kept shooting over within foot of one head just to persuade german that be not out of trench nothing happened to got back all right be silly to have left parapet only one bag thick there be truth of first time in trench german tell there be actual fighting at never saw head of one now see what good bruddykins be have

like wasp there be little crackling like brushing hair in frosty weather be shooting at other then lieutenant called out 'hit by jove handed glass to park instantly wanted back say saw bit of machine flying off when said that must fancy saw too up there in blue anyhow little machine cocked up on end rather slowly then down came like dropping knife made say 'ooooo ' to see that dive came down seemed to get little bit under control then dive down again must hear engine roar louder louder a came down never saw anything fall so fast saw hit ground among lot of smashed up building on crest behind went right over flew to piece to smithereens hurt nose to see hit ground somehow be sort of overcome by thought of men in dive be trying to imagine how felt from moment when realised be going what on earth must have seemed like at last fell seven thousand foot men say say nine thousand foot mile half chap be cheering there be machine hanging in sky wanted to reach up pat on back went up

do remember how manning used to hide from section mr britling read through then thought went back to teddy disappearance then returned to hugh youngster be right in front now one have to steel to possibility of case somehow mr britling have not expected to find hugh so speedily in firing line though must have be puzzled to find reason why must not have happened found have to begin lesson of stoicism over again read letter twice then searched for indication of date suspected that letter be sometimes held back four day later suspicion be confirmed by arrival of letter from hugh in told of second spell in trench time thing have be much more lively have be heavily shelled there have be german attack time be writing to father wrote more freely have scribbled in pencil thing be much livelier here than be gun be getting to work be firing in spell of hour so three four time day just when seem to be leaving off begin again german suddenly got range of trench day before yesterday begun to pound with high explosive well be trying never seem quite to know when next bang be coming that keep nerve hung up seems to tighten muscle tire have done nothing lie low day feel a weary a if have marched twenty mile then 'whop ' one near there be flash everything fly be mad sort of smash about one came much too close to be pleasant a near a old oil jar be from barn court door bowled clean over sent lot of gravel over when got up there be twenty yard of trench smashed into mere hole men lying about of groaning one three quarter buried have to turn to get out a well a must felt stunned insensitive be well to have something to do gun behind felt for german gun be damnest racket like giant lunatic smashing about amidst colossal pot pan fired different sort of shell stink shell a well a jack johnson though did get much of at corner there be sting of chlorine in air through afternoon most of stink shell fell short have mask rigged up sort of protection with handkerchief did amount to very much be rather like chemistry room after heinrich kid have be mixing thing most of time be busy helping with men who have got hurt suddenly there came lull then one said german be coming have glimpse of look at anything steadily while gun be going when big gun go off shell burst anywhere near seem to see hear for moment keep on being intermittently stunned one see in kind of flicker in between impact well there be time saw be coming out running little way dropping shell be bursting among behind lot of be going too far watched what men be doing poured out lot of cartridge ready to hand began to blaze away german attack never came out of trench if really intended business against doubt be half hearted in carrying out did show for five minute left two three score men on ground whenever saw man wriggle be told to fire at might be unwounded man trying to crawl back for time gun gave bean then be practically over about sunset gun got back at again artillery fight went on until be moonlight chap in third company caught rather badly then gun seemed to find something get upper hand in night of men went out to repair wire entanglement one man crawled halfway to enemy trench to listen have done bit for day be supposed to sleep in dug out be far too excited to sleep nerve be jumping about mind be like lot of flying fragment flying about very fast shelled again next day tea dixy be hit so that did get tea slept thirty hour after got back here now be slowly digesting experience most of fellow be mind nerve have be rather bumped bruised by shelling not so much a might think feel a though 'd presently not think very much of of men have got stun of lot more than have get at older men more everybody say that men of over thirty five recover from shelling for week go about sort of hesitatingly life be very primitive here doe mean that one be getting down to anything fundamental only going back to something immediate simple be fetching carrying getting water getting food going up to firing line coming back one go on for week then one day one find cry out 'what be for when be to end ' seemed to have something ahead of before war began education science work discovery sort of thing be hard to feel that there be anything ahead of here somehow last spell in fire trench have shaken up mind lot be getting used to war before now have got back to original amazement at whole business find wondering what be really up to why war began why be caught into amazing routine look feel orderly methodical purposeful officer give order get order men back there get order everybody be getting order back suppose to lord kitchener go on for week with effect of being quite sane intended right thing then then suddenly come whacking into one head 'but be utterly mad ' going to fro to fro to fro monotony break ever again into violence violence never get anywhere be exactly life that lunatic lead melancholia mania be just collective obsession by war world be really quite mad happen to be having just one gleam of sanity wo last after have finished letter suppose when individual man go mad get out of window because imago door be magically impossible dance about in street without trouser jabbing at passer by with toasting fork have just same sombre sense of unavoidable necessity that have of when go off with pack into trench be only by effort can recall how life felt in spring of do remember heinrich attempt to make table chart of rose so that must sit outside barn read name of rose in barn court like mountain chart have on table in switzerland what inconceivable thing be now for know shot heinrich other night for know be one of lump that counted after attack went back be queer thing daddy have sort of seditious feeling in writing thing like one

by be arthur jewell have of trouble b y german butted into belgium ' say have got to 'oof out again that be abart leastways be know know nothing about serbia know nothing about anything except that german got to stop sort of gime for everlasting amen sometimes think be righter than be sometimes think be only madder section letter weighed heavily upon mr britling mind perceived that precociously wise subtle youngster of be now close up to line of injury death going to fro from in perpetual fluctuating danger at time now in day night evil thing might wing way to if mr britling must have prayed must have prayed for hugh began never finished ineffectual prayer tried to persuade of roman stoicism that must be sternly proud sternly satisfied if last sacrifice for country be demanded from perceived be merely humbugging war have longer simple greatness must make such stern happiness possible disaster to teddy mr teddy hit hard winced at thought of mr teddy white face unspoken accusation in eye felt must never bring to say one excuse to did not keep hugh back if have done that then might have right to blame if have overcome other difficulty in way to heroic pose there be still be unconquerable lucidity of outlook war be madness what else be to be done what else must be done must not give in to germany if lunatic struggle sane men must struggle too mr britling have ceased to write about war at later writing about have be abandoned unfinished must not imagine counting affecting one producing effect indeed be writing now very intermittently contribution to time have fallen away be perpetually thinking now about war about life death about religious problem have seemed so remote in day of peace none of thinking must become clear definite enough for writing clear star of

anything else be gradual loss of touch with essential issue of war at first militarism aggression of germany have seemed so bad that must not see action of britain ally a anything entirely righteous have seen war plainly simply in phrase now militarism must end have seen germany a system a imperialism junkerism a callous materialist aggression a spirit make war ally a protest of humanity against

full play did best to provoke mr britling into dispute throw sort of imputation upon patriotism a distinguished from own noisy intolerant conception of loyalty tried first with conscription threw out insult at shirker funk class middle class people clung on to wretched little business made sort of excuse mr britling be stung to defend business said acidly be like land wait grows rich for owner

frensham be men be thinking of mr britling ran through little list of aristocratic stay at home began with duke not soul speaks to in consequence said shifted attack to labour people must rather see

humanitarianism in conquered province prisoner compound have to be healer arbitrator remonstrance not smiting hand surely there be enough smiting hand idea of america judicial remonstrating aloof led to conclusion scandalised if america will not must not use force in end of justice argued then america have right to make export munition of war must not trade in what disavows have quite exaggerated idea of amount of munition that america be sending to ally be inclined to believe that be entirely dependent upon transatlantic supply so found persuaded that victory of ally honour of america be

will wait for six month after war dear then will go off to germany learn way about there will murder german not just common german german who belongs to guilty kind sacrifice ought for instance to be comparatively easy to kill of child of crown prince of bavarian prince will prefer german child will sacrifice to teddy ought not to be difficult to find people who can be made directly responsible people who invented poison gas for instance kill to kill people who be dear to necessary to woman can do so much more easily than men that perhaps be only way in war of kind will ever be brought to end by woman insisting on killing kind of people who make rooting out by campaign of pursuit assassination will go on for year year after war be over murder be such little gentle punishment for crime
