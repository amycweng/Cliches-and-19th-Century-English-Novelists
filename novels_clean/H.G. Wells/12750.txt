slipping glass slide under microscope be preparation of celebrated bacillus of cholera cholera germ pale faced man peered down microscope be evidently not accustomed to kind of thing held limp white hand over disengaged eye see very little said touch screw said bacteriologist perhaps microscope be out of focus for eye vary so much just fraction of turn way that ah now see said visitor not so very much to see after little streak shred of pink yet little particle mere atomies might multiply devastate city wonderful stood up releasing glass slip from microscope held in hand towards window scarcely visible said scrutinising preparation hesitated be alive be dangerous now have be stained killed said bacteriologist wish for own part must kill stain one of in universe suppose pale man said with slight smile that scarcely care to have such thing about in living in active state on contrary be obliged to said bacteriologist here for instance walked across room took up one of several sealed tube here be living thing be cultivation of actual living disease bacteria hesitated bottled cholera so to speak slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in face of pale man be deadly thing to have in possession said devouring little tube with eye bacteriologist watched morbid pleasure in visitor expression man who have visited afternoon with note of introduction from old friend interested from very contrast of disposition lank black hair deep grey eye haggard expression nervous manner fitful yet keen interest of visitor be novel change from phlegmatic deliberation of ordinary scientific worker with whom bacteriologist chiefly associated be perhaps natural with hearer evidently so impressionable to lethal nature of topic to take most effective aspect of matter held tube in hand thoughtfully yes here be pestilence imprisoned only break such little tube a into supply of drinking water say to minute particle of life that one must need stain examine with highest

to use bomb when kind of thing be attainable think gentle rap mere light touch of finger nail be heard at door bacteriologist opened just minute dear whispered wife when re entered laboratory visitor be looking at watch have idea have wasted hour of time said twelve minute to four ought to have left here by half past three thing be really too interesting positively can not stop moment longer have engagement at four passed out of room reiterating thanks bacteriologist accompanied to door then returned thoughtfully along passage to laboratory be musing on ethnology of visitor certainly man be not teutonic type common latin one morbid product anyhow be afraid said bacteriologist to how gloated on cultivation of disease germ disturbing thought struck turned to bench by vapour bath then very quickly to writing table then felt hastily in pocket then rushed to door may have put down on hall table said minnie shouted hoarsely in hall yes dear came remote voice have anything in hand when spoke to dear just now pause nothing dear because remember blue ruin cried bacteriologist incontinently ran to front door down step of house to street minnie hearing door slam violently ran in alarm to window down street slender man be getting into cab bacteriologist hatless in carpet slipper be running gesticulating wildly towards group one slipper came off did not wait for have gone mad said minnie be that horrid science of opening window must have called after slender man suddenly glancing round seemed struck with same idea of mental disorder pointed hastily to bacteriologist said something to cabman apron of cab slammed whip swished horse foot clattered in moment cab bacteriologist hotly in pursuit have receded up vista of roadway disappeared round corner minnie remained straining out of window for minute then drew head back into room again be dumbfounded of course be eccentric meditated running about london in height of season too in sock happy thought struck hastily put bonnet on seized shoe went into hall took down hat light overcoat from peg emerged upon doorstep hailed cab opportunely crawled by drive up road round havelock crescent see if can find gentleman

whirled on down haverstock hill camden town high street with eye ever intent on animated back view of old george who be driving vagrant husband so incomprehensibly away from man in foremost cab sat crouched in corner arm tightly folded little tube contained such vast possibility of destruction gripped in hand mood be singular mixture of fear exultation chiefly be afraid of being caught before must accomplish purpose behind be vaguer larger fear of awfulness of crime exultation far exceeded fear anarchist before have ever approached conception of ravachol vaillant distinguished person whose fame have envied dwindled into insignificance beside have only to make sure of water supply break little tube into reservoir how brilliantly have planned forged letter of introduction got into laboratory how brilliantly have seized opportunity world must hear of at last people who have sneered at neglected preferred other people to found company undesirable must consider at last death death death have always treated a man of importance world have be in conspiracy to keep under must teach yet what be to isolate man what be familiar street great saint andrew street of course how fared chase craned out of cab bacteriologist be scarcely fifty yard behind be bad must be caught stopped yet felt in pocket for money found sovereign thrust up through trap in top of cab into man face more shouted if only get away money be snatched out of hand right be said cabman trap slammed lash lay along glistening side of horse cab swayed anarchist half standing under trap put hand containing little glass tube upon apron to preserve balance felt brittle thing crack broken half of rang upon floor of cab fell back into seat with curse stared dismally at two three drop of moisture on apron shuddered well suppose will be first phew anyhow will be martyr be something be filthy death nevertheless wonder if hurt a much a say presently thought occurred to groped between foot little drop be still in broken end of tube drank that to make sure be better to make sure at rate must not fail then dawned upon that there be further need to escape bacteriologist in wellington street told cabman to stop got out slipped on step head felt queer be rapid stuff cholera poison waved cabman out of existence so to speak stood on pavement with arm folded upon breast awaiting arrival of bacteriologist there be something tragic in pose sense of imminent death gave certain dignity greeted pursuer with defiant laugh vive l'anarchie be too late friend have drunk cholera be abroad bacteriologist from cab beamed curiously at through spectacle have drunk anarchist see now be about to say something more then checked smile hung in corner of mouth opened apron of cab a if to descend at anarchist waved dramatic farewell strode off towards waterloo bridge carefully jostling infected body against a many people a possible bacteriologist be so preoccupied with vision of that scarcely manifested slightest surprise at appearance of minnie upon pavement with hat shoe overcoat very good of to bring thing said remained lost in contemplation of receding figure of anarchist have better get in said still staring minnie felt absolutely convinced now that be mad directed cabman home on own responsibility put on shoe certainly dear said a cab began to turn hid strutting black figure now small in distance from eye then suddenly something grotesque struck laughed then remarked be really very serious though see that man came to house to see be anarchist faint can not possibly tell rest wanted to astonish not knowing be anarchist took up cultivation of new specie of bacterium be telling of infest think cause blue patch upon various monkey like fool said be asiatic cholera ran away with to poison water of london certainly might have made thing look blue for civilised city now have swallowed of course can not say what will happen know turned that kitten blue three puppy in patch sparrow bright blue bother be will have trouble expense of preparing more put on coat on hot day why because might meet mr jabber dear mr jabber be not draught why must wear coat on hot day because of mr oh very well flowering of strange orchid buying of orchid always have in certain speculative flavour have before brown shrivelled lump of tissue for rest must trust judgment auctioneer good luck a taste may incline plant may be moribund dead may be just respectable purchase fair value for money perhaps for thing have happened again again there slowly unfolds before delighted eye of happy purchaser day after day new variety novel richness strange twist of labellum subtler colouration unexpected mimicry pride beauty profit blossom together on one delicate green spike may be even immortality for new miracle of nature may stand in need of new specific name what so convenient a of discoverer johnsmithia there have be worse name be perhaps hope of such happy discovery that made winter wedderburn frequent attendant at sale hope also maybe fact that have nothing else of slightest interest to do in world be shy lonely rather ineffectual man provided with just enough income to keep off spur of necessity not enough nervous energy to make seek exacting employment might have collected stamp coin translated horace bound book invented new specie of diatom a happened grew orchid have one ambitious little hothouse have fancy said over coffee that something be going to happen to to day spoke a moved thought slowly oh say said housekeeper who be also remote cousin for something happening be euphemism meant only one thing to misunderstand mean nothing unpleasant though what do mean scarcely know to day continued after pause peter be going to sell batch of plant from andamans indie will go up see what have may be will buy something good unawares may be passed cup for second cupful of coffee be thing collected by poor young fellow told of other day asked cousin a filled cup yes said became meditative over piece of toast nothing ever doe happen to remarked presently beginning to think aloud wonder why thing enough happen to other people there be harvey only other week on monday picked up sixpence on wednesday chick have stagger on friday cousin came home from australia on saturday broke ankle what whirl of excitement compared to think must rather be without so much excitement said housekeeper ca be good for suppose be troublesome still see nothing ever happens to when be little boy never have accident never fell in love a grew up never married wonder how feel to have something happen to something really remarkable that orchid collector be only thirty six twenty year younger than when died have be married twice divorced once have have malarial fever four time once broke thigh killed malay once once be wounded by poisoned dart in end be killed by jungle leech must have be very troublesome then must have be very interesting know except perhaps leech be sure be not good for said lady with conviction perhaps not then wedderburn looked at watch twenty three minute past eight be going up by quarter to twelve train so that there be plenty of time think will wear alpaca jacket be quite warm enough grey felt hat brown shoe suppose glanced out of window at serene sky sunlit garden then nervously at cousin face think have better take umbrella if be going to london said in voice admitted of denial there be between here station coming back when returned be in state of mild excitement have made purchase be rare that must make up mind quickly enough to buy time have done so there be vanda said dendrobe palaeonophis surveyed purchase lovingly a consumed soup be laid out on spotless tablecloth before be telling cousin about a slowly meandered through dinner be custom to live visit to london over again in evening for own entertainment knew something must happen to day have bought of of feel sure do know that of will be remarkable know how be feel just a sure a if someone have told that of will turn out remarkable that one pointed to shrivelled rhizome be not identified may be palaeonophis may not may be new specie even new genus be last that poor batten ever collected like look of said housekeeper be such ugly shape to scarcely seems to have shape like thing stick out said housekeeper will be put away in pot to morrow look said housekeeper like spider shamming dead wedderburn smiled surveyed root with head on one side be certainly not pretty lump of stuff can never judge of thing from dry appearance may turn out to be very beautiful orchid indeed how busy will be to morrow must see to night just exactly what to do with thing to morrow will set to work found poor batten lying dead dying in mangrove swamp forget began again presently with one of very orchid crushed up under body have be unwell for day with kind of native fever suppose fainted mangrove swamp be very unwholesome drop of blood say be taken out of by jungle leech may be very plant that cost life to obtain think none better of for men must work though woman may weep said wedderburn with profound gravity fancy dying away from comfort in nasty swamp fancy being ill of fever with nothing to take chlorodyne quinine if men be left to must live on chlorodyne quinine one round horrible native say andaman islander be most disgusting wretch anyhow can scarcely make good nurse not having necessary training just for people in england to have orchid suppose be comfortable men seem to enjoy kind of thing said wedderburn anyhow native of party be sufficiently civilised to take care of collection until colleague who be ornithologist came back again from interior though must not tell specie of orchid have let wither make thing more interesting make disgusting must be afraid of of malaria clinging to just think there have be dead body lying across ugly thing never thought of before there declare can not eat mouthful of dinner will take off table if like put in window seat can see just a well there next few day be indeed singularly busy in steamy little hothouse fussing about with charcoal lump of teak moss other mystery of orchid cultivator considered be having wonderfully eventful time in evening must talk about new orchid to friend over over again reverted to expectation of something strange several of vanda dendrobium died under care presently strange orchid began to show sign of life be delighted took housekeeper right away from jam making to see at once directly made discovery be bud said presently there will be lot of leaf there little thing coming out here be aerial rootlet look to like little white finger poking out of brown said housekeeper like why not know look like finger trying to get at ca help like dislike know for certain think there be orchid know have aerial rootlet quite like that may be fancy of course see be little flattened at end like said housekeeper suddenly shivering turning away know be very silly of be very sorry particularly a like thing so much ca help thinking of corpse may not be that particular plant be merely guess of mine housekeeper shrugged shoulder anyhow like said wedderburn felt little hurt at dislike to plant did not prevent talking to about orchid generally orchid in particular whenever felt inclined there be such queer thing about orchid said one day such possibility of surprise know darwin studied fertilisation showed that whole structure of ordinary orchid flower be contrived in order that moth might carry pollen from plant to plant well seems that there be lot of orchid known flower of can not possibly be used for fertilisation in way of cypripedium for instance there be insect known that can possibly fertilise of have never be found with seed how do form new plant by runner tuber kind of outgrowth be easily explained puzzle be be flower for very likely added orchid may be something extraordinary in way if so will study have often thought of making research a darwin did hitherto have not found time something else have happened to prevent leaf be beginning to unfold now do wish must come see said that orchid house be so hot gave headache have seen plant once again aerial rootlet be now of more than foot long have unfortunately reminded her of tentacle reaching out after something got into dream growing after with incredible rapidity so that have settled to entire satisfaction that must not see plant again wedderburn have to admire leaf alone be of ordinary broad form deep glossy green with splash dot of deep red towards base knew of other leaf quite like plant be placed on low bench near thermometer close by be simple arrangement by tap dripped on hot water pipe kept air steamy spent afternoon now with regularity meditating on approaching flowering of strange plant at last great thing happened directly entered little glass house knew that spike have burst out although great palaeonophis lowii hid corner where new darling stood there be new odour in air rich intensely sweet scent overpowered other in crowded steaming little greenhouse directly noticed hurried down to strange orchid behold trailing green spike bore now three great splash of blossom from overpowering sweetness proceeded stopped before in ecstasy of admiration flower be white with streak of golden orange upon petal heavy labellum be coiled into intricate projection wonderful bluish purple mingled there with gold must see at once that genus be altogether new one insufferable scent how hot place be blossom swam before eye must see if temperature be right made step towards thermometer suddenly everything appeared unsteady brick on floor be dancing up down then white blossom green leaf behind whole greenhouse seemed to sweep sideways then in curve upward at half past four cousin made tea according to invariable custom wedderburn did not come in for tea be worshipping that horrid orchid told waited ten minute watch must have stopped will go call went straight to hothouse opening door called name there be reply noticed that air be very close loaded with intense perfume then saw something lying on brick between hot water pipe for minute perhaps stood motionless be lying face upward at foot of strange orchid tentacle like aerial rootlet no longer swayed freely in air be crowded together tangle of grey rope stretched tight with end closely applied to chin neck hand did not understand then saw from under one of exultant tentacle upon cheek there trickled little thread of blood with inarticulate cry ran towards tried to pull away from leech like sucker snapped two of tentacle sap dripped red then overpowering scent of blossom began to make head reel how clung to tore at tough rope white inflorescence swam about felt be fainting knew must not left hastily opened nearest door after have panted for moment in fresh air have brilliant inspiration caught up flower pot smashed in window at end of green house then re entered tugged now with renewed strength at wedderburn motionless body brought strange orchid crashing to floor still clung with grimmest tenacity to victim in frenzy lugged into open air then thought of tearing through sucker rootlet one by one in minute have released be dragging away from horror be white bleeding from dozen circular patch odd job man be coming up garden amazed at smashing of glass saw emerge hauling inanimate body with red stained hand for moment thought impossible thing bring water cried voice dispelled fancy when with unnatural alacrity returned with water found weeping with excitement with wedderburn head upon knee wiping blood from face what be matter said wedderburn opening eye feebly closing again at once go tell annie to come out here to then go for doctor haddon at once said to odd job man so soon a brought water added seeing hesitated will tell about when come back presently wedderburn opened eye again seeing that be troubled by puzzle of position explained to fainted in hothouse orchid will see to said wedderburn have lost good deal of blood beyond that have suffered no very great injury gave brandy mixed with pink extract of meat carried upstairs to bed housekeeper told incredible story in fragment to dr haddon come to orchid house see said cold outer air be blowing in through open door sickly perfume be almost dispelled most of torn aerial rootlet lay already withered amidst number of dark stain upon brick stem of inflorescence be broken by fall of plant flower be growing limp brown at edge of petal doctor stooped towards then saw that one of aerial rootlet still stirred feebly hesitated next morning strange orchid still lay there black now putrescent door banged intermittently in morning breeze array of wedderburn orchid be shrivelled prostrate wedderburn be bright garrulous upstairs in glory of strange adventure in avu observatory observatory at avu in borneo stand on spur of mountain to north rise old crater black at night against unfathomable blue of sky from little circular building with mushroom dome slope plunge steeply downward into black mystery of tropical forest beneath little house in observer assistant live be about fifty yard from observatory beyond be hut of native attendant thaddy chief observer be down with slight fever assistant woodhouse paused for moment in silent contemplation of tropical night before commencing solitary vigil night be very still now then voice laughter came from native hut cry of strange animal be heard from midst of mystery of forest nocturnal insect appeared in ghostly fashion out of darkness fluttered round light thought perhaps of possibility of discovery still lay in black tangle beneath for to naturalist virgin forest of borneo be still wonderland full of strange question half suspected discovery woodhouse carried small lantern in hand yellow glow contrasted vividly with infinite series of tint between lavender blue black in landscape be painted hand face be smeared with ointment against attack of mosquito even in day of celestial photography work done in purely temporary erection with only most primitive appliance in addition to telescope still involves very large amount of cramped motionless watching sighed a thought of physical fatigue before stretched entered observatory reader be probably familiar with structure of ordinary astronomical observatory building be usually cylindrical in shape with very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from interior telescope be supported upon stone pillar in centre clockwork arrangement compensates for earth rotation allows star once found to be continuously observed besides there be compact tracery of wheel screw about point of support by astronomer adjusts there be of course slit in movable roof follows eye of telescope in survey of heaven observer sits lie on sloping wooden arrangement can wheel to part of observatory a position of telescope may require within be advisable to have thing a dark a possible in order to enhance brilliance of star observed lantern flared a woodhouse entered circular den general darkness fled into black shadow behind big machine from presently seemed to creep back over whole place again a light waned slit be profound transparent blue in six star shone with tropical brilliance light lay pallid gleam along black tube of instrument woodhouse shifted roof then proceeding to telescope turned first one wheel then great cylinder slowly swinging into new position then glanced through finder little companion telescope moved roof little more made further adjustment set clockwork in motion took off jacket for night be very hot pushed into position uncomfortable seat to be condemned for next four hour then with sigh resigned to watch upon mystery of space there be sound now in observatory lantern waned steadily outside there be occasional cry of animal in alarm pain calling to mate intermittent sound of malay dyak servant presently one of men began queer chanting song in others joined at interval after must seem that turned in for night for further sound came from direction whispering stillness became more more profound clockwork ticked steadily shrill hum of mosquito explored place grew shriller in indignation at woodhouse ointment then lantern went out observatory be black woodhouse shifted position presently when slow movement of telescope have carried beyond limit of comfort be watching little group of star in milky way in one of chief have seen fancied remarkable colour variability be not part of regular work for establishment existed for reason perhaps woodhouse be deeply interested must have forgotten thing terrestrial attention be concentrated upon great blue circle of telescope field circle powdered so seemed with innumerable multitude of star luminous against blackness of setting a watched seemed to to become incorporeal a if too be floating in ether of space infinitely remote be faint red spot be observing suddenly star be blotted out flash of blackness passed be visible again queer said woodhouse must have be bird thing happened again immediately after great tube shivered a though have be struck then dome of observatory resounded with series of thundering blow star seemed to sweep aside a telescope have be undamped swung round away from slit in roof great scott cried woodhouse what be huge vague black shape with flapping something like wing seemed to be struggling in aperture of roof in moment slit be clear again luminous haze of milky way shone warm bright interior of roof be perfectly black only scraping sound marked whereabouts of unknown creature woodhouse have scrambled from seat to foot be trembling violently in perspiration with suddenness of occurrence be thing whatever be inside out be big whatever else might be something shot across skylight telescope swayed started violently put arm up be in observatory then with be clinging to roof apparently what devil be must see stood for perhaps minute in state of stupefaction beast whatever be clawed at interior of dome then something flapped almost into face saw momentary gleam of starlight on skin like oiled water bottle be knocked off little table with smash sense of strange bird creature hovering few yard from face in darkness be indescribably unpleasant to woodhouse a thought returned concluded that must be night bird large bat at risk must see what be pulling match from pocket tried to strike on telescope seat there be smoking streak of phosphorescent light match flared for moment saw vast wing sweeping towards gleam of grey brown fur then be struck in face match knocked out of hand blow be aimed at temple claw tore sideways down to cheek reeled fell heard extinguished lantern smash blow followed a fell be partly stunned felt own warm blood stream out upon face instinctively felt eye have be struck at turning over on face to protect tried to crawl under protection of telescope be struck again upon back heard jacket rip then thing hit roof of observatory edged a far a must between wooden seat eyepiece of instrument turned body round so that be chiefly foot be exposed with must at least kick be still in mystified state strange beast banged about in darkness presently clung to telescope making sway gear rattle once flapped near kicked out madly felt soft body with foot be horribly scared now must be big thing to swing telescope like that saw for moment outline of head black against starlight with sharply pointed upstanding ear crest between seemed to to be a big a mastiff then began to bawl out a loudly a must for help at that thing came down upon again a did so hand touched something beside on floor kicked out next moment ankle be gripped held by row of keen teeth yelled again tried to free leg by kicking with other then realised have broken water bottle at hand snatching struggled into sitting posture feeling in darkness towards foot gripped velvety ear like ear of big cat have seized water bottle by neck brought down with shivering crash upon head of strange beast repeated blow then stabbed jobbed with jagged end of in darkness where judged face might be small teeth relaxed hold at once woodhouse pulled leg free kicked hard felt sickening feel of fur bone giving under boot there be tearing bite at arm struck over at face a judged hit damp fur there be pause then heard sound of claw dragging of heavy body away from over observatory floor then there be silence broken only by own sobbing breathing sound like licking everything be black except parallelogram of blue skylight with luminous dust of star against end of telescope now appeared in silhouette waited a seemed interminable time be thing coming on again felt in trouser pocket for match found one remaining tried to strike floor be wet spat went out cursed must not see where door be situated in struggle have quite lost bearing strange beast disturbed by splutter of match began to move again time called woodhouse with sudden gleam of mirth thing be not coming at again must have hurt thought with broken bottle felt dull pain in ankle probably be bleeding there wondered if must support if tried to stand up night outside be very still there be sound of one moving sleepy fool have not heard wing battering upon dome shout be good wasting strength in shouting monster flapped wing startled into defensive attitude hit elbow against seat fell over with crash cursed then cursed darkness suddenly oblong patch of starlight seemed to sway to fro be going to faint must never do to faint clenched fist set teeth to hold together where have door got to occurred to must get bearing by star visible through skylight patch of star saw be in sagittarius south eastward door be north be north by west tried to think if must get door open might retreat might be thing be wounded suspense be beastly look here said if come on will come at then thing began clambering up side of observatory saw black outline gradually blot out skylight be in retreat forgot about door watched a dome shifted creaked somehow did not feel very frightened excited now felt curious sinking sensation inside sharply defined patch of light with black form moving across seemed to be growing smaller smaller be curious began to feel very thirsty yet did not feel inclined to get anything to drink seemed to be sliding down long funnel felt burning sensation in throat then perceived be broad daylight that one of dyak servant be looking at with curious expression then there be top of thaddy face upside down funny fellow thaddy to go about like then grasped situation better perceived that head be on thaddy knee thaddy be giving brandy then saw eyepiece of telescope with lot of red smear on began to remember have made observatory in pretty mess said thaddy dyak boy be beating up egg in brandy woodhouse took sat up felt sharp twinge of pain ankle be tied up so be arm side of face smashed glass red stained lay about floor telescope seat be overturned by opposite wall be dark pool door be open saw grey summit of mountain against brilliant background of blue sky pah said woodhouse who be be killing calf here take out of then remembered thing fight have have with be said to thaddy thing fought with know best said thaddy anyhow worry now about have more to drink thaddy however be curious enough be hard struggle between duty inclination to keep woodhouse quiet until be decently put away in bed have slept upon copious dose of meat extract thaddy considered advisable then talked over together be said woodhouse more like big bat than anything else in world have sharp short ear soft fur wing be leathery teeth be little devilish sharp jaw must not have be very strong else must have bitten through ankle have pretty nearly said thaddy seemed to to hit out with claw pretty freely be about a much a know about beast conversation be intimate so to speak yet not confidential dyak chap talk about big colugo klang utang may be doe not often attack man suppose made nervous say there be big colugo little colugo something else that sound like gobble fly about at night for own part know there be flying fox flying lemur about here be none of very big beast there be more thing in heaven earth said woodhouse thaddy groaned at quotation more particularly in forest of borneo than be dreamt of in philosophy on whole if borneo fauna be going to disgorge more of novelty upon must prefer that did so when be not occupied in observatory at night alone triumph of taxidermist here be of secret of taxidermy be told by taxidermist in mood of elation told in time between first glass of whisky fourth when man be no longer cautious yet not drunk sat in den together library be sitting eating room separated by bead curtain so far a sense of sight went from noisome den where plied trade sat on deck

must study ornithology find out be what be more have be approached by syndicate of dealer to stock one of unexplored skerries to north of iceland with specimen may day have little thing in hand just now ever heard of dinornis be one of big bird recently extinct in new zealand beoa be common name so called because extinct there be moa now see well have got bone of from of marsh even feather dried

a threatened to fall to piece feather be peculiar have got simply lovely way of dodging up singed bit of ostrich plume yes be new smell noticed can only discover fraud with microscope will hardly care to pull nice specimen to bit for in way see give little push in advancement of science be merely imitating nature have done more than in time have beaten took foot down from mantel board leant over

charge of bird laughing fit to split be rummy way of losing jewel come to think of man in charge have be about just at moment so that did know bird be clean lost see did feel half sorry to tell truth beggar have be swaggering over blessed diamond ever since came aboard thing like go from stem to stern of ship in time one be talking about padishah went below to hide feeling at dinner pigged at table by two other hindoo captain kind of jeered at about got very excited turned round talked into ear must not buy bird must have diamond demanded right a british subject diamond must be found be firm upon that must appeal to house of lord man in charge of bird be one of wooden headed chap ca get new idea into anyhow refused proposal to interfere with bird by way of medicine instruction be to feed so so treat so so be a much a place be worth not to feed so so treat so so padishah have wanted stomach pump though ca do to bird know padishah be full of bad law like most of blessed bengali talked of having lien on bird so forth old boy who said son be london barrister argued that what bird swallowed became ipso facto part of bird that padishah only remedy lay in action for damage even then might be possible to show contributory negligence have right of way about ostrich did belong to that upset padishah extremely more so a most of expressed opinion that be reasonable view there be lawyer aboard to settle matter so talked pretty free at last after aden appears that came round to general opinion went privately to man in charge made offer for five ostrich next morning there be fine shindy at breakfast man have authority to deal with bird nothing on earth must induce to sell seems told padishah that eurasian named potter have already made offer on padishah denounced potter before think most of thought rather smart of potter know that when potter said that 'd wired at aden to london to buy bird must have answer at suez cursed pretty richly at lost opportunity at suez padishah gave way to tear actual wet tear when potter became owner of bird offered two hundred fifty right off for five being more than two hundred per cent on what potter have given potter said 'd be hanged if parted with feather of that meant to kill off one by one find diamond afterwards thinking over relented little be gambling hound be potter little queer at card kind of prize packet business must have suited down to ground anyhow offered for lark to sell bird separately to separate people by auction at starting price of l for bird one of said meant to keep for luck must understand diamond be valuable one little jew chap diamond merchant who be with have put at three four thousand when padishah have shown to idea of ostrich gamble caught on now happened that 'd be having few talk on general subject with man who looked after ostrich quite incidentally 'd said one of bird be ailing fancied have indigestion have one feather in tail almost white by knew so when next day auction started with capped padishah eighty five by ninety fancy be bit too sure eager with bid of others spotted fact be in know padishah went for particular bird like irresponsible lunatic at last jew diamond merchant got for l padishah said l just after hammer came down so potter declared at rate jew merchant secured there then got gun shot potter made hades of fuss because said must injure sale of other three padishah of course behaved like idiot of be very much excited can tell be precious glad when dissection be over diamond have turned up precious glad 'd gone to one forty on particular bird little jew be like most jew did make great fuss over bad luck potter declined to go on with auction until be understood that good must not be delivered until sale be over little jew wanted to argue that case be exceptional a discussion ran pretty even thing be postponed until next morning have lively dinner table that evening can tell in end potter got way since must stand to reason must be safer if stuck to bird that owed consideration for sportsmanlike behaviour old gentleman whose son be lawyer said 'd be thinking thing over that be very doubtful if when bird have be opened diamond recovered ought not to be handed back to proper owner remember suggested came under law of treasure trove be really truth of matter there be hot argument settled be certainly foolish to kill bird on board ship then old gentleman going at large through legal talk tried to make out sale be lottery illegal appealed to captain potter said sold bird a ostrich did want to sell diamond said did offer that a inducement three bird put up to best of knowledge belief did not contain diamond be in one kept so hoped price ruled high next day same fact now there be four chance instead of five of course caused rise blessed bird averaged oddly enough padishah did secure one of not one made too much shindy when ought to have be bidding be talking about lien besides potter be bit down on one fell to quiet little officer chap to little jew third be syndicated by engineer then potter seemed suddenly sorry for having sold said 'd flung away clear thousand pound very likely 'd draw blank that always have be fool when went have bit of talk to with idea of getting to hedge on last chance found 'd already sold bird 'd reserved to political chap be on board chap who 'd be studying indian moral social question in vacation that last be three hundred pound bird well landed three of blessed creature at brindisi though old gentleman said be breach of custom regulation potter padishah landed too hindoo seemed half mad a saw blessed diamond going way so to speak kept on saying 'd get injunction have injunction on brain giving name address to chap who 'd bought bird so that 'd know where to send diamond none of wanted name address none of must give own be fine row can tell on platform went off by different train came on to southampton there saw last of bird a came ashore be one engineer bought be standing up near bridge in kind of crate looking a leggy silly setting for valuable diamond a ever saw if be setting for valuable diamond how did end oh like well perhaps yes there be one more thing may throw light on week so after landing be down regent street doing bit of shopping who must see arm in arm having purple time of padishah potter if come to think of yes have thought that only see there be doubt diamond be real padishah be eminent hindoo have seen name in paper often whether bird swallowed diamond certainly be matter a say through window after leg be set carried bailey into study put on couch before open window there lay live even feverish man down to loin below double barrelled mummy swathed in white wrapping tried to read even tried to write little most of time looked out of window have thought window cheerful to begin with now thanked god for many time day within room be dim grey in reflected light wear of furniture showed plainly medicine drink stood on

balcony railing of hammered iron in foreground be weltering silver of river never quiet yet never tiresome beyond be reedy bank broad stretch of meadow land then dark line of tree ending in group of poplar at distant bend of river upstanding behind square church tower up down river day long thing be passing now string of barge drifting down to london piled with lime barrel of beer then steam launch disengaging heavy mass of black smoke disturbing whole width of river with long rolling wave then impetuous electric launch then boatload of pleasure seeker solitary sculler four from rowing club perhaps river be quietest of morning late at night one moonlight night people drifted down singing with zither playing sounded very pleasantly across water in few day bailey began to recognise of craft in week knew intimate history of dozen launch luzon from fitzgibbon two mile up must go fretting by sometimes three four time day conspicuous with colouring of indian red yellow two oriental attendant one day to bailey vast amusement house boat purple emperor came to stop outside breakfasted in most shameless domesticity then one afternoon captain of slow moving barge began quarrel with wife a came into sight from left have carried to personal violence before vanished behind window frame to right bailey regarded a entertainment got up to while away illness applauded more moving incident mr green coming in at rare interval with meal must catch clapping hand softly cry encore river player have other engagement encore went unheeded must never have thought must take such interest in thing did not concern said bailey to wilderspin who used to come in in nervous friendly way try to comfort sufferer by being talked to thought idle capacity be distinctive of little child old maid be just circumstance simply ca work thing have to drift be good to fret struggle so lie here be a amused a baby with rattle at river affair sometimes of course get bit dull not often must give anything wilderspin for swamp just one swamp once head swimming steam launch to rescue chap so hauled out with boat hook there go fitzgibbon launch have new boat hook see little blackie be still in dump think be very well wilderspin be be like for two three day squatting sulky fashion meditating over churning of water unwholesome for to be always staring at frothy water running away from stern watched little steamer fuss across patch of sunlit river suffer momentary occultation from acacia glide out of sight behind dark window frame be getting wonderful eye for detail said bailey spotted that new boat hook at once other nigger be funny little chap never used to swagger with old boat hook like malay be said wilderspin know said bailey thought one called sort of manner lascar then began to tell wilderspin what knew of private affair of houseboat purple emperor funny said how people come from point of compass from oxford windsor from asia africa gather pas opposite window just to entertain one man floated out of infinite day before yesterday caught one perfect crab opposite lost recovered scull passed on again probably will never come into life again so far a be concerned have lived have little trouble perhaps thirty perhaps forty year on earth merely to make as of for three minute in front of window wonderful thing wilderspin if come to think of yes said wilderspin be day two after bailey have brilliant morning indeed towards end of affair became almost a exciting a window show very well must be will however begin at beginning bailey be alone in house for housekeeper have gone into town three mile away to pay bill servant have holiday morning began dull canoe went up about half past nine later boat load of camping men came down be mere margin thing became cheerful about ten o'clock began with something white fluttering in remote distance where three poplar marked river bend pocket handkerchief said bailey when saw too big flag perhaps however be not flag for jumped about man in white running fast way said bailey be luck white be precious loose then singular thing happened there be minute pink gleam among dark tree in distance little puff of pale grey began to drift vanish eastward man in white jumped continued running presently report of shot arrived what devil said bailey look a if someone be shooting at sat up stiffly stared hard white figure be coming along pathway through corn be one of nigger from fitzgibbon said bailey may be hanged wonder why keep sawing with arm then three other figure became indistinctly visible against dark background of tree abruptly on opposite bank man walked into picture be black bearded dressed in flannel have red belt vast grey felt hat walked leaning very much forward with hand swinging before behind one must see grass swept by towing rope of boat be dragging be steadfastly regarding white figure be hurrying through corn suddenly stopped then with peculiar gesture bailey must see that began pulling in tow rope hand over hand over water must be heard voice of people in still invisible boat what be after hagshot said someone individual with red belt shouted something be inaudible went on lugging in rope looking over shoulder at advancing white figure a did so came down bank rope bent lane among reed lashed water between pull then just bow of boat came into view with towing mast tall fair haired man standing up trying to see over bank boat bumped unexpectedly among reed tall fair haired man disappeared suddenly having apparently fallen back into invisible part of boat there be curse indistinct laughter hagshot did not laugh hastily clambered into boat pushed off abruptly boat passed out of bailey sight be still audible melody of voice suggested that occupant be busy telling other what to do running figure be drawing near bank bailey must now see clearly that be one of fitzgibbon oriental began to realise what sinuous thing man carried in hand might be three other men followed one through corn foremost carried what be probably gun be perhaps two hundred yard more behind malay be man hunt by be holy said malay stopped for moment surveyed bank to right then left path breaking through corn vanished in direction three pursuer followed suit head gesticulating arm above corn after brief interval also went out of bailey field of vision bailey so far forgot a to swear just a thing be getting lively said something like woman shriek came through air then shout howl dull whack upon balcony outside made bailey jump then report of gun be precious hard on invalid said bailey more be to happen yet in picture in fact great deal more malay appeared again running now along bank up stream stride have more swing le pace in than before be threatening someone ahead with ugly krees carried blade bailey noticed be dull did not shine a steel must then came tall fair man brandishing boat hook after three other men in boating costume running clumsily with oar man with grey hat red belt be not with after interval three men with gun reappeared still in corn now near river bank emerged upon towing path hurried after others opposite bank be left blank desolate again sick room be disgraced by more profanity must give life to see end of said bailey there be indistinct shout up stream once seemed to be coming nearer disappointed bailey sat grumbled be still grumbling when eye caught something black round among wave hullo said looked narrowly saw two triangular black body frothing now then about yard in front of be still doubtful when little band of pursuer came into sight again began to point to floating object be talking eagerly then man with gun took aim be swimming river by george said malay looked round saw gun went under came up so close to bailey bank of river that one of bar of balcony hid for moment a emerged man with gun fired malay kept steadily onward bailey must see wet hair on forehead now krees between teeth be presently hidden by balcony seemed to bailey unendurable wrong man be lost to for ever now so thought why must brute have got decently caught on opposite bank shot in water be worse than edwin drood said bailey over river too thing have become absolute blank seven men have gone down stream again probably to get boat follow across bailey listened waited there be silence surely be not over like said bailey five minute passed ten minute then tug with two barge went up stream attitude of men upon be attitude of who see nothing remarkable in earth water sky clearly whole affair have passed out of sight of river probably hunt have gone into beech wood behind house confound said bailey to be continued again chance time of sequel be hard on sick man heard step on staircase behind looking round saw door open mr green came in sat down panting still have bonnet on purse in hand little brown basket upon arm oh there said left bailey to imagine rest have little whisky water mr green tell about said bailey sipping little lady began to recover power of explanation one of black creature at fitzgibbon have gone mad be running about with big knife stabbing people have killed groom stabbed under butler almost cut arm off boating gentleman running amuck with krees said bailey thought be be hiding in wood when came through from town what did run after asked bailey with certain touch of glee in voice be horrible part of mr green explained have be right through wood have never known be there be only when met young mr fitzgibbon carrying gun in shrubbery that heard anything about apparently what upset mr green be lost opportunity for emotion be determined however to make most of what be left to think be there time said over over again bailey endured patiently enough for perhaps ten minute at last thought advisable to assert be twenty past one mr green said think time got something to eat brought mr green suddenly to knee oh lord sir said oh go making go out of room sir till know be caught might have got into house sir might be creeping creeping with knife of along passage very broke off suddenly glared over at window lower jaw dropped bailey turned head sharply for space of second thing seemed just a be there be tree balcony shining river distant church tower then noticed that acacia be displaced about foot to right that be quivering leaf be rustling tree be shaken violently heavy panting be audible in moment hairy brown hand have appeared clutched balcony railing in face of malay be peering through at man on couch expression be unpleasant grin by reason of krees held between teeth be bleeding from ugly wound in cheek hair wet to drying stuck out like horn from head body be bare save for wet trouser clung to bailey first impulse be to spring from couch leg reminded that be impossible by mean of balcony tree man slowly raised until be visible to mr green with choking cry made for door fumbled with handle bailey thought swiftly clutched medicine bottle in hand one flung smashed against acacia silently deliberately keeping bright eye fixed on bailey malay clambered into balcony bailey still clutching second bottle with sickening sinking feeling about heart watched first one leg come over railing then other be bailey impression that malay took about hour to get second leg over rail period elapsed before sitting position be changed to standing one seemed enormous day week possibly year so yet bailey have clear impression of anything going on in mind during vast period except vague wonder at inability to throw second medicine bottle suddenly malay glanced over shoulder there be crack of rifle flung up arm came down upon couch mr green began dismal shriek seemed likely to last until doomsday bailey stared at brown body with shoulder blade driven in writhed painfully across leg rapidly staining soaking spotless bandage then looked at long krees with reddish streak upon blade that lay inch beyond trembling brown finger upon floor then at mr green who have backed hard against door be staring at body shrieking in gusty outburst a if must wake dead then body be shaken by one last convulsive effort malay gripped krees tried to raise with left hand collapsed then raised head stared for moment at mr green twisting face round looked at bailey with gasping groan dying man succeeded in clutching bed clothes with disabled hand by violent effort hurt bailey leg exceedingly writhed sideways towards what must be last victim then something seemed released in bailey mind brought down second bottle with strength on to malay face krees fell heavily upon floor easy with leg said bailey a young fitzgibbon one of boating party lifted body off young fitzgibbon be very white in face did mean to kill said be just a well said bailey temptation of harringay be quite impossible to say whether thing really happened depends entirely on word of rm harringay who be artist following version of affair narrative deposes harringay went into studio about ten o'clock to see what must make of head that have be working at day before head in question be that of italian organ grinder harringay thought be not quite sure that title must be vigil so far be frank narrative bear stamp of truth have seen man expectant for penny with promptness suggested genius have have in at once kneel look up at bracket said harringay a if expected penny grin said harringay want to paint gum look a though be unhappy now after night rest picture proved decidedly unsatisfactory be good work said harringay little bit in neck walked about studio looked at thing from point from then said wicked word in original word be given painting say said just painting of organ grinder mere portrait if be live organ grinder must mind somehow never make thing alive wonder if imagination be wrong too have truthful air imagination be wrong that creative touch to take canvas pigment make man a adam be made of red ochre thing if met walking about street must know be only studio production little boy must tell to 'garnome git frimed little touch well wo do a be went to blind began to pull down be made of blue holland with roller at bottom of window so that pull down to get more light gathered palette brush mahl stick from table then turned to picture put speck of brown in corner of mouth shifted attention thence to pupil of eye then decided that chin be trifle too impassive for vigil presently put down impedimenta lighting pipe surveyed progress of work be hanged if thing be sneering at said harringay still belief sneered animation of figure have certainly increased scarcely in direction wished there be mistake about sneer vigil of unbeliever said harringay rather subtle clever left eyebrow be cynical enough went dabbed at eyebrow added little to lobe of ear to suggest materialism further consideration ensued vigil off be afraid said harringay why not mephistopheles be bit too common ' friend of doge ' not so seedy armour wo do though too camelot how about scarlet robe call 'one of sacred college ' humour in appreciation of middle italian history there be always benvenuto cellini said harringay with clever suggestion of gold cup in one corner must scarcely suit complexion describes a babbling in way in order to keep down unaccountably unpleasant sensation of fear thing be certainly acquiring anything pleasing expression yet be a certainly becoming far more of living thing than have be if sinister one far more alive than anything have ever painted before call 'portrait of gentleman ' said certain gentleman wo do said harringay still keeping up courage kind of thing call bad taste that sneer will have to come out that gone little more fire in eye never noticed how warm eye be before might do for what price passionate pilgrim that devilish face wo do side of channel little inaccuracy doe said eyebrow probably too oblique therewith pulling blind lower to get better light resuming palette brush face on canvas seemed animated by spirit of own where expression of diablerie came in found impossible to discover experiment be necessary eyebrow must scarcely be eyebrow altered be better in fact if anything trifle more satanic corner of mouth pah more than ever leer now retouched be ominously grim eye then catastrophe have filled brush with vermilion instead of brown yet have felt sure be brown eye seemed now to have rolled in socket be glaring at eye of fire in flash of passion possibly with something of courage of panic struck brush full of bright red athwart picture then very curious thing very strange thing indeed occurred if did occur diabolified italian before shut eye pursed mouth wiped colour off face with hand then red eye opened again with sound like opening of lip face smiled be rather hasty of said picture harringay state now that worst have happened self possession returned have saving persuasion that devil be reasonable creature why do keep moving about then said making face that sneering squinting while be painting said picture do said harringay be said picture be not said harringay be said picture go hitting with paint again because be true have be trying to fluke expression on face morning really have idea what picture ought to look like have said harringay have not said picture never have with picture always start with vaguest presentiment of what be going to do be to be something beautiful be sure of devout perhaps tragic beyond that be experiment chance dear fellow think can paint picture like now must be remembered that for what follows have only harringay word will paint picture exactly a like said harringay calmly seemed to disconcert picture little ca paint picture without inspiration remarked have inspiration for inspiration sneered sardonic figure fancy came from seeing organ grinder looking up at window vigil have have just started painting on chance of something coming be what did when saw at came want talk with art with said picture be poor business potter know how be seem able to throw soul into know too much hamper in midst of enthusiasm ask whether something like have not be done before look here said harringay who have expected something better than criticism from devil be going to talk studio to filled number twelve hoghair with red paint true artist said picture be always ignorant man artist who theorises about work be no longer artist critic wagner say what be red paint for be going to paint out said harringay want to hear tommy rot if think just because be artist by trade be going to talk studio to make precious mistake one minute said picture evidently alarmed want to make offer genuine offer be right what be saying lack inspiration well doubt have heard of cathedral of cologne devil bridge rubbish said harringay do think want to go to perdition simply for pleasure of painting good picture getting slated take that blood be up danger only nerved to action so say so planted dab of vermilion in creature mouth italian spluttered tried to wipe off evidently horribly surprised then according to harringay there began very remarkable struggle harringay splashing away with red paint picture wriggling about wiping off a fast a put on two masterpiece said demon two indubitable masterpiece for chelsea artist soul be bargain harringay replied with paint brush for few minute nothing must be heard brush going spluttering ejaculation of italian lot of stroke caught on arm hand though harringay got over guard often enough presently paint on palette gave out two antagonist stood breathless regarding other picture be so smeared with red that looked a if have be rolling about slaughterhouse be painfully out of breath very uncomfortable with wet paint trickling down neck still first round be in favour on whole think said sticking pluckily to point two supreme masterpiece in different style equivalent to cathedral know said harringay rushed out of studio along passage towards wife boudoir in minute be back with large tin of enamel hedge sparrow egg tint be brush at sight of that artistic devil with red eye began to scream three masterpiece culminating masterpiece harringay delivered cut two across demon followed with thrust in eye there be indistinct rumbling four masterpiece spitting sound harringay have upper hand now meant to keep with rapid bold stroke continued to paint over writhing canvas until at last be uniform field of shining hedge sparrow tint once mouth reappeared got a far a five master before filled with enamel near end red eye opened glared at indignantly at last nothing remained save gleaming panel of drying enamel for little while faint stirring beneath surface puckered slightly here there presently even that died away thing be perfectly still then harringay according to harringay account lit pipe sat down stared at enamelled canvas tried to make out clearly what have happened then walked round behind to see if back of be at remarkable then be began to regret have not photographed devil before painted out be story not mine support by small canvas by enamelled pale green by violent asseveration be also true that never have produced masterpiece in opinion of intimate friend probably never will flying man ethnologist looked at bhimraj feather thoughtfully seemed to part with said be sacred to chief said lieutenant just a yellow silk know be sacred to chinese emperor ethnologist did not answer hesitated then opening topic abruptly what on earth be cock bull story have of flying man lieutenant smiled faintly what did tell see said ethnologist that know of fame lieutenant rolled cigarette mind hearing about once more how doe stand at present be so confoundedly childish said ethnologist becoming irritated how did play off upon

did at last wearied to trade so said on unsophisticated child of mountain how must bring to do man be sorry said lieutenant truly thing be forced upon can assure be driven to at time have not faintest idea of how chin imagination must take curiosity can only plead be indiscretion not malice that made replace folk lore by new legend a seem aggrieved will try explain business to be in time of last lushai expedition one walter thought people have be visiting be friendly so with airy confidence in capacity for taking care of sent up gorge fourteen mile of with three of derbyshire men dozen sepoys two mule blessing to see what popular feeling be like at village visited force of ten not counting mule fourteen mile during war saw road road said ethnologist be better now than be when went up have to wade in river for mile where valley narrow with smart stream frothing round knee stone a slippery a ice there be dropped rifle afterwards sapper blasted cliff with dynamite made convenient way came by then below where very high cliff come have to keep on dodging across river must say crossed dozen time in couple of mile got in sight of place early next morning know how lie on spur halfway between big hill a began to appreciate how wickedly quiet village lay under sunlight came to stop to consider at fired lump of filed brass idol at just by way of welcome came twanging down slope to right of where boulder be missed shoulder by inch so plugged mule carried provision utensil never heard death rattle before since at became aware of number of gentleman carrying matchlock dressed in

trot down valley again hitherward did not wait to save anything dead have carried kept second mule with carried tent other rubbish out of feeling of friendship so ended battle ingloriously glancing back saw valley dotted with victor shouting firing at one be hit chin gun be very little good except at sitting shot will sit finick over boulder for hour taking aim when fire running be chiefly for stage effect hooker one of derbyshire men fancied rather with rifle stopped behind for minute to try luck a turned bend got nothing be not xenophon to spin much of yarn about retreating army have to pull enemy up twice in next two mile when became bit pressing by exchanging shot with be fairly monotonous affair hard breathing chiefly until got near place where hill run in towards river pinch valley into gorge there very luckily caught glimpse of dozen round black head coming slanting way over hill to left of east be almost parallel with at called halt here ' say to hooker other englishman be to do now pointed to head 'headed orf be nigger said one of men will be ' said 'you know chin way george ' 'they can pot one of at fifty yard say hooker 'in place where river be narrow be just suicide to go on down looked at hill to right of grew steeper lower down valley still seemed climbable chin have seen hitherto have be on other side of stream stopping ' say one of sepoys so started slanting up hill there be something faintly suggestive of road running obliquely up face of that followed chin presently came into view up valley heard shot then saw one of sepoys be sitting down about thirty yard below have simply sat down without word apparently not wishing to give trouble at called halt again told hooker to try shot went back found man be hit in leg took up carried along to put on mule already pretty well laden with tent other thing have time to take off when got up to rest with hooker have empty martini in hand be grinning pointing to motionless black spot up valley

following more more of shelf at last be mere cliff above below be best road have seen yet in chin lushai land ' said to encourage men though have fear of what be coming in few minute way bent round corner of cliff then finis ledge came to end a soon a grasped position one of derbyshire men fell swearing at trap have fallen into sepoys halted quietly hooker grunted reloaded went back to bend then two of sepoy chap helped comrade down began to unload mule now when came to look about began to think have not be so very unfortunate after be on shelf perhaps ten yard across at widest above cliff

blazed like near furnace towards evening of first day one of derbyshire men said something nobody heard what went off round bend of cliff heard shot when hooker looked round corner be gone in morning sepoy whose leg be shot be in delirium jumped fell over cliff then took mule shot must need go over cliff too in last struggle leaving eight of must see body of sepoy down below with head in water be lying face downwards so far a must make out be scarcely smashed at badly a chin might covet head have sense to leave alone until darkness came at first talked of chance there be of main body hearing firing reckoned whether must begin to miss kind of thing dried up a evening came on sepoys played game with bit of stone among afterwards told story night be rather chilly second day nobody spoke lip be black throat afire lay about on ledge glared at one perhaps be a well kept thought to ourselves one of british soldier began writing blasphemous rot on rock with bit of pipeclay about last dying will until stopped a looked over edge down into valley saw river rippling be nearly tempted to go after sepoy seemed pleasant desirable thing to go rushing down through air with something to drink more thirst at rate at bottom remembered in time though be officer in command duty to set good example kept from such foolishness yet thinking of put idea into head got up looked at tent tent rope wondered why have not thought of before then came peered over cliff again time height seemed greater pose of sepoy rather more painful be that nothing to cut short parachuted got big circle of canvas out of tent about three time size of table cover plugged hole in centre tied eight rope round to meet in middle make parachute other chap lay about watched a though thought be new kind of delirium then explained notion to two british soldier how meant to do a soon a short dusk have darkened into night risked held thing high up took run whole length of ledge thing filled with air like sail at edge will confess funked pulled up a soon a stopped be ashamed of a well might be in front of private went back started again off jumped time with kind of sob remember clean into air with big white sail bellying out above must have thought at frightful pace seemed long time before be sure that thing meant to keep steady at first heeled sideways then noticed face of rock seemed to be streaming up past motionless then looked down saw in darkness river dead sepoy rushing up towards in indistinct light also saw three chin seemingly aghast at sight of that sepoy be decapitated at wanted to go back again then boot be in mouth of one in moment be in heap with canvas fluttering down on top of fancy dashed out brain with foot expected nothing more than to be brained by other two poor heathen have never heard of baldwin incontinently bolted struggled out of tangle of dead chin canvas looked round about ten pace off lay head of sepoy staring in moonlight then saw water went drank there be sound in world footstep of departing chin faint shout from above gluck of water so soon a have drunk full started off down river that about end explanation of flying man story never met soul whole eight mile of way got to walter camp by ten o'clock born idiot of sentinel have cheek to fire at a came trotting out of darkness so soon a have hammered story into winter thick skull about fifty men started up valley to clear chin out get men down for own part have too good thirst to provoke by going with have heard what kind of yarn chin made of wing a long a mule eh black feather gay lieutenant bird well well lieutenant meditated cheerfully for moment then added must scarcely credit when got to ridge at last found two more of sepoys have jumped over rest be right asked ethnologist yes said

display banter under circumstance be in very vile taste spoke on spur of contrast of appearance speech be sorry even while be speaking turned haggard very composed face upon said forget of course must not understand measured for moment doubt be very absurd will not believe even when tell so that be fairly safe to tell will be comfort to tell someone really have big business in hand very big business there be trouble just now fact be make diamond suppose said be out of work just at present be sick of being disbelieved said impatiently suddenly unbuttoning wretched coat pulled out little canvas bag be hanging by cord round neck from produced brown pebble wonder if know enough to know what be handed to now year so ago have occupied leisure in taking london science degree so that have smattering of physic mineralogy thing be not unlike uncut diamond of darker sort though far too large being almost a big a top of thumb took saw have form of regular octahedron with curved face peculiar to most precious of mineral took out penknife tried to scratch vainly leaning forward towards gas lamp tried thing on watch glass scored white line across with greatest ease looked at interlocutor with rising curiosity certainly be rather like diamond if so be behemoth of diamond where did get tell made said give back to replaced hastily buttoned jacket will sell for one hundred pound suddenly whispered eagerly with suspicion returned thing might after be merely lump of almost equally hard substance corundum with accidental resemblance in shape to diamond if be diamond how came by why must offer at hundred pound looked into one eye seemed eager honestly eager at moment believed be diamond be trying to sell yet be poor man hundred pound must leave visible gap in fortune sane man must buy diamond by gaslight from ragged tramp on personal warranty only still diamond size conjured up vision of many thousand of pound then thought stone must scarcely exist without being mentioned in book on gem again called to mind story of contraband light fingered kaffir at cape put question of purchase on one side how did get said made have heard something of moissan knew artificial diamond be very small shook head seem to know something of kind of thing will tell little about perhaps then may think better of purchase turned round with back to river put hand in pocket sighed know will not believe diamond began a spoke voice lost faint flavour of tramp assumed something of easy tone of educated man be to be made by throwing carbon out of combination in suitable flux under suitable pressure carbon crystallises out not a black lead charcoal powder a small diamond so much have be known to chemist for year one yet have hit upon exactly right flux in to melt up carbon exactly right pressure for best result consequently diamond made by chemist be small dark worthless a jewel now know have given up life to problem given life to began to work at condition of diamond making when be seventeen now be thirty two seemed to that might take thought energy of man for ten year twenty year even if did game be still worth candle suppose one to have at last just hit right trick before secret got out diamond became a common a coal one might realise million million paused looked for sympathy eye shone hungrily to think said be on verge of here have proceeded about thousand pound when be twenty one thought eked out by little teaching must keep research going year two be spent in study at berlin chiefly then continued on own account trouble be secrecy see if once have let out what be doing other men might have be spurred on by belief in practicability of idea pretend to be such genius a to have be sure of coming in first in case of race for discovery see be important that if really meant to make pile people must not know be artificial process capable of turning out diamond by ton so have to work alone at first have little laboratory a resource began to run out have to conduct experiment in wretched unfurnished room in kentish town where slept at last on straw mattress on floor among apparatus money simply flowed away grudged everything except scientific appliance tried to keep thing going by little teaching be not very good teacher have university degree very much education except in chemistry found have to give lot of time labour for precious little money got nearer nearer thing three year ago settled problem of composition of flux got near pressure by putting flux of mine certain carbon composition into closed up gun barrel filling up with water sealing tightly heating paused rather risky said yes burst smashed window lot of apparatus got kind of diamond powder nevertheless following out problem of getting big pressure upon molten mixture from thing be to crystallise hit upon research of daubree at paris laboratorie de poudres et salpetres exploded dynamite in tightly screwed steel cylinder too strong to burst found must crush rock into muck not unlike south african bed in diamond be found be tremendous strain on resource got steel cylinder made for purpose after pattern put in stuff explosive built up fire in furnace put whole concern in went out for walk must not help laughing at matter of fact manner did not think must blow up house be there other people in place be in interest of science said ultimately there be costermonger family on floor below begging letter writer in room behind mine two flower woman be upstairs perhaps be bit thoughtless possibly of be out when came back thing be just where left among white hot coal explosive have burst case then have problem to face know time be important element in crystallisation if hurry process crystal be small be only by prolonged standing that grow to size resolved to let apparatus cool for two year letting temperature go down slowly during time be now quite out of money with big fire rent of room a well a hunger to satisfy have scarcely penny in world can hardly tell shift be put to while be making diamond have sold newspaper held horse opened cab door for many week addressed envelope have place a assistant to man who owned barrow used to call down one side of road while called down other once for week have absolutely nothing to do begged what week be one day fire be going out have eaten nothing day little chap taking girl out gave sixpence to show off thank heaven for vanity how fish shop smelt went spent on coal have furnace bright red again then well hunger make fool of man at last three week ago let fire out took cylinder unscrewed while be still so hot that punished hand scraped out crumbling lava like mass with chisel hammered into powder upon iron plate found three big diamond five small one a sat on floor hammering door opened neighbour begging letter writer came in be drunk a usually be `` nerchist ' said 'you be drunk ' said `` structive scoundrel ' said 'go to father ' said meaning father of lie 'never mind ' said gave cunning wink hiccuped leaning up against door with other eye against door post began to babble of how have be prying in room how have gone to police that morning how have taken down everything have to say `` siffiwas ge be ' said then suddenly realised be in hole either must have to tell police little secret get whole thing blown upon be lagged a anarchist so went up to neighbour took by collar rolled about bit then gathered up diamond cleared out evening newspaper called den kentish town bomb factory now can not part with thing for love money if go in to respectable jeweller ask to wait go whisper to clerk to fetch policeman then say can not wait found out receiver of stolen good simply stuck to one gave told to prosecute if wanted back be going about now with several hundred thousand pound worth of diamond round neck without food shelter be first person have taken into confidence like face be hard driven looked into eye must be madness said for to buy diamond under circumstance besides carry hundred of pound about in pocket yet more than half believe story will if like do come to office to morrow think be thief said keenly will tell police be not coming into trap somehow be assured be thief here be card take that anyhow need not come to appointment come when will took card earnest of good will think better of come said shook head doubtfully will pay back half crown with interest day such interest a will amaze said anyhow will keep secret follow crossed road went into darkness towards little step under archway leading into essex street let go be last ever saw of afterwards have two letter from asking to send bank note not cheque to certain address weighed matter over took what conceived to be wisest course once called upon when be out urchin described a very thin dirty ragged man with dreadful cough left message be finish of so far a story go wonder sometimes what have become of be ingenious monomaniac fraudulent dealer in pebble have really made diamond a asserted latter be just sufficiently credible to make think at time have missed most brilliant opportunity of life may of course be dead diamond carelessly thrown aside one repeat be almost a big a thumb may be still wandering about trying to sell thing be just possible may yet emerge upon society passing athwart heaven in serene altitude sacred to wealthy well advertised reproach silently for want of enterprise sometimes think might at least have risked five pound aepyornis island man with scarred face leant over table looked at bundle orchid asked few said cypripedium said chiefly said anything new thought not did island twenty five twenty seven year ago if find anything new here well be brand new did leave much be not collector said be young then went on lord how used to fly round seemed to take measure be in east indie two year in brazil seven then went to madagascar know few explorer by name said anticipating yarn whom did collect for dawson wonder if have heard name of butcher ever butcher butcher name seemed vaguely present in memory then recalled butcher v dawson why said be man who sued for four year salary got cast away on desert island servant said man with scar bowing funny case be here be making little fortune on island doing nothing for quite unable to give notice often used to amuse thinking over while be there did calculation of big over blessed atoll in ornamental figuring how did happen said rightly remember case well have heard of aepyornis rather andrew be telling of new specie be working on only month so ago just before sailed have got thigh bone seems nearly yard long monster thing must have be believe said man with scar be monster sinbad roc be just legend of 'em when did find bone three four year ago fancy why why because found lord be nearly twenty year ago if dawson have be silly about salary might have made perfect ring in 'em must help infernal boat going adrift paused suppose be same place kind of swamp about ninety mile north of antananarivo do happen to know have to go to along coast by boat happen to remember perhaps fancy andrew said something about swamp must be same be on east coast somehow there be something in water keep thing from decaying like creosote smell reminded of trinidad did get more egg of egg found be foot half long swamp go circling round know cut off bit be mostly salt too well what time have of found thing quite by accident went for egg two native chap in one of rum canoe tied together found bone at same time have tent provision for four day pitched on one of firmer place to think of brings that odd tarry smell back even now be funny work go probing into mud with iron rod know usually egg get smashed wonder how long be since aepyornis really lived missionary say native have legend about when be alive never heard such story myselfa certainly egg got be a fresh a if have be new laid fresh carrying down to boat one of nigger chap dropped one on rock smashed how lammed into beggar sweet be a if be new laid not even smelly mother dead four hundred year perhaps said centipede have bit however be getting off straight with story have taken day to dig into slush get egg out unbroken be covered with beastly black mud naturally be cross so far a knew be only egg have ever be got out not even cracked went afterwards to see one have at natural history museum in london of be cracked just stuck together like mosaic bit missing mine be perfect meant to blow when got back naturally be annoyed at silly duffer dropping three hour work just on account of centipede hit about rather footnote european be known to have seen live aepyornis with doubtful exception of macandrew who visited madagascar in hgw man with scar took out clay pipe placed pouch before filled up absent mindedly how about others did get home remember be queer part of story have three others perfectly fresh egg well put in boat then went up to tent to make coffee leaving two heathen down by beach one fooling about with sting other helping never occurred to that beggar must take advantage of peculiar position be in to pick quarrel suppose centipede poison kicking have given have upset one be always cantankerous sort persuaded other remember be sitting smoking boiling up water over spirit lamp business used to take on expedition incidentally be admiring swamp under sunset black blood red be in streak beautiful sight up beyond land rose grey hazy to hill sky behind red like furnace mouth fifty yard behind back of be blessed heathen quite regardless of tranquil air of thing plotting to cut off with boat leave alone with three day provision canvas tent nothing to drink whatsoever beyond little keg of water heard kind of yelp behind there be in canoe affair be properly boat perhaps twenty yard from land realised what be up in moment gun be in tent besides have bullet only duck shot knew that have little revolver in pocket pulled out a ran down to beach back ' say flourishing jabbered something at man broke egg jeered aimed at other because be unwounded have paddle missed laughed however be beat knew have to keep cool tried again made jump with whang of did laugh time third time got head over went paddle with be precious lucky shot for revolver reckon be fifty yard went right under know if be shot simply stunned drowned then began to shout to other chap to come back huddled up in canoe refused to answer so fired out revolver at never got near felt precious fool can tell there be on rotten black beach flat swamp behind flat sea cold after sunset just black canoe drifting steadily out to sea tell damned dawson jamrachs museum rest of just to right bawled to nigger to come back until voice went up into scream there be nothing for to swim after take luck with shark so opened clasp knife put in mouth took off clothes waded in a soon a be in water lost sight of canoe aimed a judged to head off hoped man in be too bad to navigate that must keep on drifting in same direction presently came up over horizon again to south westward about afterglow of sunset be well over now dim of night creeping up star be coming through blue swum like champion though leg arm be soon aching however came up to by time star be fairly out a got darker began to see manner of glowing thing in water phosphorescence know at time made giddy hardly knew be star be phosphorescence whether be swimming on head heel canoe be a black a sin ripple under bow like liquid fire be naturally chary of clambering up into be anxious to see what be up to first seemed to be lying cuddled up in lump in bow stern be out of water thing kept turning round slowly a drifted kind of waltzing know went to stern pulled down expecting to wake up then began to clamber in with knife in hand ready for rush never stirred so there sat in stern of little canoe drifting away over calm phosphorescent sea with host of star above waiting for something to happen after long time called by name never answered be too tired to take risk by going along to so sat there fancy dozed once twice when dawn came saw be a dead a doornail puffed up purple three egg bone be lying in middle of canoe keg of water coffee biscuit wrapped in cape argus by foot tin of methylated spirit underneath there be paddle in fact anything except spirit tin that one must use a one so settled to drift until be picked up held inquest on brought in verdict against snake scorpion centipede unknown sent overboard after have drink of water few biscuit took look round suppose man low down a be see very far leastways madagascar be clean out of sight trace of land at saw sail going south westward looked like schooner hull never came up presently sun got high in sky began to beat down upon lord pretty near made brain boil tried dipping head in sea after while eye fell on cape argus lay down flat in canoe spread over wonderful thing newspaper never read one through thoroughly before be odd what get up to when be alone a be suppose read blessed old cape argus twenty time pitch in canoe simply reeked with heat rose up into big blister drifted ten day said man with scar be little thing in telling be day be like last except in morning evening never kept look out even blaze be so infernal did see sail after first three day saw took notice of about sixth night ship went by scarcely mile away from with light ablaze port open looking like big firefly there be music aboard stood up shouted screamed at second day broached one of aepyornis egg scraped shell away at end bit by bit tried be glad to find be good enough to eat bit flavoury not bad mean with something of taste of duck egg there be kind of circular patch about six inch across on one side of yolk with streak of blood white mark like ladder in thought queer did not understand what meant at time be inclined to be particular egg lasted three day with biscuit drink of water chewed coffee berry too invigorating stuff second egg opened about eighth day scared man with scar paused yes said developing dare say find hard to believe did with thing before there egg have be sunk in cold black mud perhaps three hundred year there be mistaking there be what be embryo with big head curved back heart beating under throat yolk shrivelled up great membrane spreading inside of shell over yolk here be hatching out egg of biggest of extinct bird in little canoe in midst of indian ocean if old dawson have known that be worth four year salary what do think however have to eat precious thing up bit of before sighted reef of mouthful be beastly unpleasant left third one alone held up to light shell be too thick for to get notion of what might be happening inside though fancied heard blood pulsing might have be rustle in own ear like what listen to in seashell then came atoll came out of sunrise a be suddenly close up to drifted straight towards until be about mile from shore not more then current took turn have to paddle a hard a must with hand bit of aepyornis shell to make place however got there be just common atoll about four mile round with few tree growing spring in one place lagoon full of parrot fish took egg ashore put in good place well above tide line in sun to give chance must pulled canoe up safe loafed about prospecting be rum how dull atoll be a soon a have found spring interest seemed to vanish when be kid thought nothing must be finer more adventurous than robinson crusoe business place be a monotonous a book of sermon went round finding eatable thing generally thinking tell be bored to death before first day be out show luck very day landed weather changed thunderstorm went by to north flicked wing over island in night there came drencher howling wind slap over must have taken much know to upset canoe be sleeping under canoe egg be luckily among sand higher up beach first thing remember be sound like hundred pebble hitting boat at once rush of water over body 'd be dreaming of antananarivo sat up holloaed to intoshi to ask what devil be up clawed out at chair where match used to be then remembered where be there be phosphorescent wave rolling up a if meant to eat rest of night a black a pitch air be simply yelling cloud seemed down on head almost rain fell a if heaven be sinking be baling out water above firmament one great roller came writhing at like fiery serpent bolted then thought of canoe ran down to a water went hissing back again thing have gone wondered about egg then felt way to be right well out of reach of maddest wave so sat down beside cuddled for company lord what night be storm be over before morning there be rag of cloud left in sky when dawn came along beach there be bit of plank scattered be disarticulated skeleton so to speak of canoe however gave something to do for taking advantage of two of tree being together rigged up kind of storm shelter with vestige day egg hatched hatched sir when head be pillowed on be asleep heard whack felt jar sat up there be end of egg pecked out rum little brown head looking out at 'lord said be welcome with little difficulty came out be nice friendly little chap at first about size of small hen very much like most other young bird only bigger plumage be dirty brown to begin with with sort of grey scab fell off very soon scarcely feather kind of downy hair can hardly express how pleased be to see tell robinson crusoe make near enough of loneliness here be interesting company looked at winked eye from front backwards like hen gave chirp began to peck about at once a though being hatched three hundred year too late be just nothing 'glad to see man friday say for have naturally settled be to be called man friday if ever be hatched a soon a ever found egg in canoe have developed be bit anxious about feed so gave lump of raw parrot fish at once took opened beak for more be glad of for under circumstance if 'd be at fanciful must have have to eat after 'd be surprised what interesting bird aepyornis chick be followed about from very beginning used to stand by watch while fished in lagoon go share in anything caught be sensible too there be nasty green warty thing like pickled gherkin used to lie about on beach tried one of upset never even looked at of again grew must almost see grow a be never much of society man quiet friendly way suited to t for nearly two year be a happy a must be on island have business worry for knew salary be mounting up at dawson must see sail now then nothing ever came near amused too by decorating island with design worked in sea urchin fancy shell of various kind put aepyornis island round place very nearly in big letter like what see done with coloured stone at railway station in old country mathematical calculation drawing of various sort used to lie watching blessed bird stalking round growing growing think how must make living out of by showing about if ever got taken off after first moult began to get handsome with crest blue wattle lot of green feather at behind of then used to puzzle whether dawson have right to claim not stormy weather in rainy season lay snug under shelter have made out of old canoe used to tell lie about friend at home after storm must go round island together to see if there be drift be kind of idyll might say if only have have tobacco must have be simply just like heaven be about end of second year little paradise went wrong friday be then about fourteen foot high to bill of with big broad head like end of pickaxe two huge brown eye with yellow rim set together like man not out of sight of other like hen plumage be fine none of half mourning style of ostrich more like cassowary a far a colour texture go then be began to cock comb at give air show sign of nasty temper at last came time when fishing have be rather unlucky began to hang about in queer meditative way thought might have be eating sea cucumber something be really just discontent on part be hungry too when at last landed fish wanted for temper be short that morning on side pecked at grabbed gave whack on head to make leave go at that went for lord gave in face man indicated scar then kicked be like cart horse got up seeing have finished started off full tilt with arm doubled up over face ran on gawky leg of faster than racehorse kept landing out at with sledge hammer kick bringing pickaxe down on back of head made for lagoon went in up to neck stopped at water for hated getting foot wet began to make shindy something like peacock only hoarser started strutting up down beach will admit felt small to see blessed fossil lording there head face be bleeding well body just one jelly of bruise decided to swim across lagoon leave alone for bit until affair blew over shinned up tallest palm tree sat there thinking of suppose ever felt so hurt by anything before since be brutal ingratitude of creature 'd be more than brother to 'd hatched educated great gawky out of date bird human being heir of age thought after time 'd begin to see thing in light feel little sorry for behaviour thought if be to catch nice little bit of fish perhaps go to presently in casual kind of way offer to might do sensible thing took time to learn how unforgiving cantankerous extinct bird can be malice wo tell little device tried to get bird round again simply ca make cheek burn with shame even now to think of snub buffet have from infernal curiosity tried violence chucked lump of coral at from safe distance only swallowed shied open knife at almost lost though be too big for to swallow tried starving out struck fishing took to picking along beach at low water after worm rubbed along on that time spent up to neck in lagoon rest up palm tree one of be scarcely high enough when caught up have regular bank holiday with calf of leg got unbearable know if have ever tried sleeping up palm tree gave most horrible nightmare think of shame of too here be extinct animal mooning about island like sulky duke not allowed to rest sole of foot on place used to cry with weariness vexation told straight that did mean to be chased about desert island by damned anachronism told to go peck navigator of own age only snapped beak at great ugly bird leg neck must like to say how long went on altogether 'd have killed sooner if 'd known how however hit on way of settling at last be south american dodge joined fishing line together with stem of seaweed thing made stoutish string perhaps twelve yard in length more fastened two lump of coral rock to end of took time to do because now then have to go into lagoon up tree a fancy took whirled rapidly round head then let go at first time missed next time string caught leg beautifully wrapped round again again over went threw standing waist deep in lagoon a soon a went down be out of water sawing at neck with knife like to think of even now felt like murderer while did though anger be hot against when stood over saw bleeding on white sand beautiful great leg neck writhing in last agony pah with tragedy loneliness came upon like curse good lord ca imagine how missed that bird sat by corpse sorrowed over shivered a looked round desolate silent reef thought of what jolly little bird have be when be hatched of thousand pleasant trick have played before went wrong thought if 'd only wounded might have nursed round into better understanding if 'd have mean of digging into coral rock 'd have buried felt exactly a if be human a be must think of eating so put in lagoon little fish picked clean did even save feather then one day chap cruising about in yacht have fancy to see if atoll still existed did come moment too soon for be about sick enough of desolation of only hesitating whether must walk out into sea finish up business way fall back on green thing sold bone to man named winslow dealer near british museum say sold to old havers seems havers did understand be extra large be only after death attracted attention called aepyornis what be aepyornis vastus said be funny very thing be mentioned to by friend of mine when found aepyornis with thigh yard long thought have reached top of scale called aepyornis maximus then someone turned up thighbone four foot six more that called aepyornis titan then vastus be found after old havers died in collection then vastissimus turned up winslow be telling a much said man with scar if get more aepyornis reckons scientific swell will go burst bloodvessel be queer thing to happen to man be altogether remarkable case of davidson eye transitory mental aberration of sidney davidson remarkable enough in be still more remarkable if wade explanation be to be credited set one dreaming of oddest possibility of intercommunication in future of spending intercalary five minute on other side of world being watched in most secret operation by unsuspected eye happened that be immediate witness of davidson seizure so fall naturally to to put story upon paper when say be immediate witness of seizure mean be first on scene thing happened at harlow technical college just beyond highgate archway be alone in larger laboratory when thing happened be in smaller room where balance be writing up note thunderstorm have completely upset work of course be just after one of louder peal thought heard glass smash in other room stopped writing turned round to listen for moment heard nothing hail be playing devil tattoo on corrugated zinc of roof then came sound smash doubt of time something heavy have be knocked off bench jumped up at once went opened door leading into big laboratory be surprised to hear queer sort of laugh saw davidson standing unsteadily in middle of room with dazzled look on face first impression be that be drunk did not notice be clawing out at something invisible yard in front of face put out hand slowly rather hesitatingly then clutched nothing what be come to said held up hand to face finger spread out great scot said thing happened three four year ago when everyone swore by personage then began raising foot clumsily a though have expected to find glued to floor davidson cried what be matter with turned round in direction looked about for looked over at on side of without slightest sign of seeing wave said remarkably neat schooner 'd swear be bellow voice hullo shouted suddenly at top of voice thought be up to foolery then saw littered about foot shattered remains of best of electrometer what be up man said have smashed electrometer bellow again said friend left if hand be gone something about electrometer way be bellow suddenly came staggering towards damned stuff cut like butter said walked straight into bench recoiled none so buttery that said stood swaying felt scared davidson said what on earth come over looked round in direction must swear be bellow why show like man bellow occurred to that must be suddenly struck blind walked round table laid hand upon arm never saw man more startled in life jumped away from came round into attitude of self defence face fairly distorted with terror good god cried what be that be bellow confound davidson jumped when answered stared how can express right through began talking not to to here in broad daylight on clear beach not place to hide in looked about wildly here be off suddenly turned ran headlong into big electro magnet so violently that a found afterwards bruised shoulder jawbone cruelly at that stepped back pace cried out with almost whimper what in heaven name have come over stood blanched with terror trembling violently with right arm clutching left where have collided with magnet by time be excited fairly scared davidson said be afraid be startled at voice not so excessively a before repeated word in a clear firm tone a must assume bellow said be that ca see be laughed ca even see be where devil be here said in laboratory laboratory answered in puzzled tone put hand to forehead be in laboratory till flash came be hanged if be there now what ship be that there be ship said do be sensible old chap ship repeated seemed to forget denial forthwith suppose said slowly be dead rummy part be feel just a though still have body get used to at once suppose old shop be struck by lightning suppose jolly quick thing bellow eigh talk nonsense be very much alive be in laboratory blundering about have just smashed new electrometer envy when boyce arrives stared away from towards diagram of cryohydrates must be deaf said have fired gun for there go puff of smoke never heard sound put hand on arm again time be le alarmed seem to have sort of invisible body said by jove there be boat coming round headland be very much like old life after in different climate shook arm davidson cried wake up ii be just then that boyce came in so soon a spoke davidson exclaimed old boyce dead too what lark hastened to explain that davidson be in kind of somnambulistic trance boyce be interested at once did must to rouse fellow out of extraordinary state answered question asked of own attention seemed distracted by hallucination about beach ship kept interpolating observation concerning boat davit sail filling with wind made one feel queer in dusky laboratory to hear saying such thing be blind helpless have to walk down passage one at elbow to boyce private room while boyce talked to there humoured about ship idea went along corridor asked old wade to come look at voice of dean sobered little not very much asked where hand be why have to walk about up to waist in ground wade thought over long time know how knit brow then made feel couch guiding hand to be couch said couch in private room of professor boyce horsehair stuffing davidson felt about puzzled over answered presently that must feel right must see do see asked wade davidson said must see nothing lot of sand broken up shell wade gave other thing to feel telling what be watching keenly ship be almost hull down said davidson presently apropos of nothing never mind ship said wade listen to davidson do know what hallucination mean rather said davidson well everything see be hallucinatory bishop berkeley said davidson mistake said wade be alive in room of boyce something have happened to eye can not see can feel hear not see do follow seems to that see too much davidson rubbed knuckle into eye well said that be let perplex bellow here will take home in cab wait bit davidson thought help to sit down said presently now be sorry to trouble will tell over again wade repeated very patiently davidson shut eye pressed hand upon forehead yes said be quite right now eye be shut know be right be bellow sitting by on couch be in england again be in dark then opened eye there said be sun just rising yard of ship tumbled sea couple of bird flying never saw anything so real be sitting up to neck in bank of sand bent forward covered face with hand then opened eye again dark sea sunrise yet be sitting on sofa in old boyce room god help iii be beginning for three week strange affection of davidson eye continued unabated be far worse than being blind be absolutely helpless have to be fed like newly hatched bird led about undressed if attempted to move fell over thing stuck against wall door after day so got used to hearing voice without seeing willingly admitted be at home that wade be right in what told sister to whom be engaged insisted on coming to see must sit for hour day while talked about beach of holding hand seemed to comfort immensely explained that when left college drove home lived in hampstead village appeared to a if drove right through sandhill be perfectly black until emerged again through rock tree solid obstacle when be taken to own room made giddy almost frantic with fear of falling because going upstairs seemed to lift thirty forty foot above rock of imaginary island kept saying must smash egg end be that have to be taken down into father consulting room laid upon couch stood there described island a being bleak kind of place on whole with very little vegetation except peaty stuff lot of bare rock there be multitude of penguin made rock white disagreeable to see sea be often rough once there be thunderstorm lay shouted at silent flash once twice seal pulled up on beach only on first two three day said be very funny way in penguin used to waddle right through how seemed to lie among without disturbing remember one odd thing be when wanted very badly to smoke put pipe in hand almost poked eye out with lit must taste anything have since found be same with know if be usual case can not enjoy tobacco at unless can see smoke queerest part of vision came when wade sent out in bath chair to get fresh air davidsons hired chair got that deaf obstinate dependent of theirs widgery to attend to be idea of healthy expedition be peculiar sister who have be to dog home met in camden town towards king cross widgery trotting along complacently davidson evidently most distressed trying in feeble blind way to attract widgery attention positively wept when sister spoke to oh get out of horrible darkness said feeling for hand must get out of will die be quite incapable of explaining be matter sister decided must go home presently a went up hill towards hampstead horror seemed to drop from said be good to see star again though be then about noon blazing day seemed told afterwards a if be being carried irresistibly towards water be not very much alarmed at first of course be night there lovely night of course asked for struck a odd of course said be always night there when be day here well went right into water be calm shining under moonlight just broad swell seemed to grow broader flatter a came down into surface glistened just like skin might have be empty space underneath for must tell to contrary very slowly for rode slanting into water crept up to eye then went under skin seemed to break heal again about eye moon gave jump up in sky grew green dim fish faintly glowing came darting round thing seemed made of luminous glass passed through tangle of seaweed shone with oily lustre so drove down into sea star went out one by one moon grew greener darker seaweed became luminous purple red be very faint mysterious everything seemed to quiver while must hear wheel of bath chair creaking footstep of people going by man in distance selling special pall mall kept sinking down deeper deeper into water became inky black about not ray from above came down into darkness phosphorescent thing grew brighter brighter snaky branch of deeper weed flickered like flame of spirit lamp after time there be more weed fish came staring gaping towards into through never imagined such fish before have line of fire along side of a though have be outlined with luminous pencil there be ghastly thing swimming backwards with lot of twining arm then saw coming very slowly towards through gloom hazy mass of light resolved a drew nearer into multitude of fish struggling darting round something drifted drove on straight towards presently saw in midst of tumult by light of fish bit of splintered spar looming over dark hull tilting over glowing phosphorescent form be shaken writhed a fish bit at then be began to try to attract widgery attention horror came upon ugh must have driven right into half eaten thing if sister have not come have great hole in bellow never mind be ghastly iv for three week davidson remained in singular state seeing what at time imagined be altogether phantasmal world stone blind to world around then one tuesday when called met old davidson in passage can see thumb old gentleman said in perfect transport be struggling into overcoat can see thumb bellow said with tear in eye lad will be right yet rushed in to davidson be holding up little book before face looking at laughing in weak kind of way be amazing said there be kind of patch come there pointed with finger be on rock a usual penguin be staggering flapping about a usual there be be whale showing now then be got too dark now to make out put something there see do see be very dim broken in place see same like faint spectre of found out morning while be dressing be like hole in infernal phantom world just put hand by mine no not there ah yes see base of thumb bit of cuff

cousin incidentally took out kind of pocket photograph case to show new rendering of fiancee by by said here be old fulmar davidson looked at casually then suddenly face lit up good heaven said must almost swear what said atkins that have seen that ship before see how can have have be out of south sea for six year before then began davidson then yes be ship dreamt of be sure be ship dreamt of be standing off island swarmed with penguin fired gun good lord said atkins who have now heard particular of seizure how deuce must dream then bit by bit came out that on very day davidson be seized hm fulmar have actually be off little rock to south of antipode island boat have landed overnight to get penguin egg have be delayed thunderstorm drifting up boat crew have waited until morning before rejoining ship atkins have be one of corroborated word for word description davidson have given of island boat there be not slightest doubt in of mind davidson have really seen place in unaccountable way while moved hither thither in sight moved hither thither in manner corresponded about distant island how be absolutely mystery completes remarkable story of davidson eye be perhaps best authenticated case in existence of real vision at distance explanation there be none forthcoming except what professor wade have thrown out explanation invokes fourth dimension dissertation on theoretical kind of space to talk of there being kink in space seems mere nonsense to may be because be mathematician when said that nothing must alter fact that place be eight thousand mile away answered that two point might be yard away on sheet of paper yet be brought together by bending paper round reader may grasp argument certainly idea seems to be that davidson stooping between pole of big electro magnet have extraordinary twist given to retinal element through sudden change in field of force due to lightning think a consequence of that may be possible to live visually in one part of world while one life bodily in have even made experiment in support of view so far have simply succeeded in blinding few dog believe be net result of work though have not seen for week latterly have be so busy with work in connection with saint pancras installation have have little opportunity of calling to see whole of theory seems fantastic to fact concerning davidson stand on altogether

thought incessant whirling shindy set up within curly black cranium must explain in most graphic manner dozen so way in man might be killed by once gave azuma zi shock a sample of quality after in

took shape in thought at last in act when came into roaring shed one morning salaamed to lord of dynamo then when holroyd be away went whispered to thundering machine that be servant prayed to have pity on save from holroyd a did so rare gleam of light came in through open archway of throbbing machine shed lord of dynamo a whirled roared be radiant with pale gold then azuma zi knew that service be acceptable to lord after that did not feel so lonely a have done have indeed be very much alone in london even when work time be over be rare loitered about shed then next time holroyd maltreated azuma zi went presently to lord of dynamo whispered thou seest o lord angry whirr of machinery seemed to answer thereafter appeared to that whenever holroyd came into shed different note came into sound of dynamo lord bides time said azuma zi to iniquity of fool be not yet ripe waited watched for day of reckoning one day there be evidence of short circuiting holroyd making unwary examination be in afternoon got rather severe shock azuma zi from behind engine saw jump off curse at peccant coil be warned said azuma zi to surely lord be very patient holroyd have at first initiated nigger into such elementary conception of dynamo working a must enable to take temporary charge of shed in absence when noticed manner in azuma zi hung about monster became suspicious dimly perceived assistant be

off besides if pleased azuma zi to be near big machine be plain sense decency to keep away from azuma zi obeyed at time later be caught bowing before lord of dynamo at holroyd twisted arm kicked a turned to go away a azuma zi presently stood behind engine glared at back of hated noise of machinery took new rhythm sounded like four word in native tongue be hard to say exactly what madness be fancy azuma zi be mad incessant din whirl of dynamo shed may have churned up little store of knowledge big store of superstitious fancy at last into something akin to frenzy at rate when idea of making sacrifice to dynamo fetich be thus suggested to filled with strange tumult of exultant emotion night two men black shadow be alone in shed together shed be lit with one big arc light winked flickered purple shadow lay black behind dynamo ball governor of engine whirled from light to darkness piston beat loud steady world outside seen through open end of shed seemed incredibly dim remote seemed absolutely silent too since riot of machinery drowned external sound far away be black fence of yard with grey shadowy house behind above be deep blue sky pale little star azuma zi suddenly walked across centre of shed above leather band be running went into shadow by big dynamo holroyd heard click spin of armature changed what be dewin ' with switch bawled in surprise have told then saw set expression of azuma zi eye a asiatic came out of shadow towards in moment two men be grappling fiercely in front of great dynamo coffee headed fool gasped holroyd with brown hand at throat keep off contact ring in moment be tripped reeling back upon lord of dynamo instinctively loosened grip upon antagonist to save from machine messenger sent in furious haste from station to find out what have happened in dynamo shed met azuma zi at porter lodge by gate azuma zi tried to explain something messenger must make nothing of black incoherent english hurried on to shed machine be noisily at work nothing seemed to be disarranged there be however queer smell of singed hair then saw odd looking crumpled mass clinging to front of big dynamo approaching recognised distorted remains of holroyd man stared hesitated moment then saw face shut eye convulsively turned on heel before opened so that must not see holroyd again went out of shed to get advice help when azuma zi saw holroyd die in grip of great dynamo have be little scared about consequence of act yet felt strangely elated knew that favour of lord dynamo be upon plan be already settled when met man coming from station scientific manager who speedily arrived on scene jumped at obvious conclusion of suicide expert scarcely noticed azuma zi except to ask few question did see holroyd kill azuma zi explained have be out of sight at engine furnace until heard difference in noise from dynamo be not difficult examination being untinctured by suspicion distorted remains of holroyd electrician removed from machine be hastily covered by porter with coffee stained somebody by happy inspiration fetched medical man expert be chiefly anxious to get machine at work again for seven eight train have stopped midway in stuffy tunnel of electric railway azuma zi answering misunderstanding question of people who have by authority impudence come into shed be presently sent back to stoke hole by scientific manager of course crowd collected outside gate of yard crowd for known reason always hovers for day two near scene of sudden death in london two three reporter percolated somehow into engine shed one even got to azuma zi scientific expert cleared out again being amateur journalist presently body be carried away public interest departed with azuma zi remained very quietly at furnace seeing over over again in coal figure wriggled violently became still hour after murder to anyone coming into shed must have looked exactly a if nothing remarkable have ever happened there peeping presently from engine room black saw lord dynamo spin whirl beside little brother driving wheel be beating round steam in piston went thud thud exactly a have be earlier in evening after from mechanical point of view have be most insignificant incident mere temporary deflection of current now slender form slender shadow of scientific manager replaced sturdy outline of holroyd travelling up down lane of light upon vibrating floor under strap between engine dynamo have not served lord said azuma zi inaudibly from shadow note of great dynamo rang out full clear a looked at big whirling mechanism strange fascination of have be little in abeyance since holroyd death resumed sway never have azuma zi seen man killed so swiftly pitilessly big humming machine have slain victim without wavering for second from steady beating be indeed mighty god unconscious scientific manager stood with back to scribbling on piece of paper shadow lay at foot of monster be lord dynamo still hungry servant be ready azuma zi made stealthy step forward then stopped scientific manager suddenly stopped writing walked down shed to endmost of dynamo began to examine brush azuma zi hesitated then slipped across noiselessly into shadow by switch there waited presently manager footstep must be heard returning stopped in old position unconscious of stoker crouching ten foot away from then big dynamo suddenly fizzled in moment azuma zi have sprung out of darkness upon first scientific manager be gripped round body swung towards big dynamo then kicking with knee forcing antagonist head down with hand loosened grip on waist swung round away from machine then black grasped again putting curly head against chest swayed panted a seemed for age so then scientific manager be impelled to catch black ear in teeth bite furiously black yelled hideously rolled over on floor black who have apparently slipped from vice of teeth parted with ear scientific manager wondered at time tried to throttle scientific manager be making ineffectual effort to claw something with hand to kick when welcome sound of quick footstep sounded on floor next moment azuma zi have left darted towards big dynamo there be splutter amid roar officer of company who have entered stood staring a azuma zi caught naked terminal in hand gave one horrible convulsion then hung motionless from machine face violently distorted be jolly glad came in when did said scientific manager still sitting on floor looked at still quivering figure be not nice death to die apparently be quick official be still staring at body be man of slow apprehension there be pause scientific manager got up on foot rather awkwardly ran finger along collar thoughtfully moved head to fro several time poor holroyd see now then almost mechanically went towards switch in shadow turned current into railway circuit again a did so singed body loosened grip upon machine fell forward on face core of dynamo roared out loud clear armature beat air so ended prematurely worship of dynamo deity perhaps most short lived of religion yet withal must at least boast martyrdom human sacrifice hammerpond park burglary be moot point whether burglary be to be considered a sport trade art for trade technique be scarcely rigid enough claim to be considered art be vitiated by mercenary element qualifies triumph on whole seems to be most justly ranked a sport sport for

sensation in small circle in mr teddy watkins be undisputed leader be decided that accompanied by duly qualified assistant must visit village of hammerpond in professional capacity being man of naturally retiring modest disposition mr watkins determined to make visit incog after due consideration of condition of enterprise selected role of landscape artist unassuming surname of smith preceded assistant who be decided must join only on last afternoon of stay at hammerpond now village of hammerpond be perhaps one of prettiest little corner in sussex many thatched house still survive flint built church with tall spire nestling under down be one of finest least restored in county beech wood bracken jungle through road run to great house be singularly rich in what vulgar artist photographer call bit so mr watkins on arrival with two virgin canvas brand new easel paint box portmanteau ingenious little ladder made in section after pattern of late lamented master charles peace crowbar wire coil found welcomed with effusion curiosity by dozen other brother of brush rendered disguise have chosen unexpectedly plausible inflicted upon considerable amount of aesthetic conversation for be very imperfectly prepared have exhibited very much said young porson in bar parlour of coach horse where mr watkins be skilfully accumulating local information on night of arrival very little said mr watkins just snack here there academy in course crystal palace did hang well said porson rot said mr watkins like mean did put in good place whadyer mean said mr watkins suspiciously one 'ud think be trying to make out 'd be put away porson have be brought up by aunt be gentlemanly young man even for artist did not know what being put away meant thought best to explain that intended nothing of sort a question of hanging seemed sore point with mr watkins tried to divert conversation little do do figure work at never have head for figure said mr watkins miss mr smith mean doe that paint too said porson be rather jolly very said mr watkins though really did not think so feeling conversation be drifting little beyond grasp added came down here to paint hammerpond house by moonlight really said porson be rather novel idea yes said mr watkins thought rather good notion when occurred to expect to begin to morrow night what mean to paint in open by night do though how will see canvas have bloomin ' cop began mr watkins rising too quickly to question then realising bawled to miss durgan for glass of beer be goin ' to have thing called dark lantern said to porson be about new moon now objected porson there wo be moon there will be house said watkins at rate be goin ' see to paint house first moon afterwards oh said porson too staggered to continue conversation doo say said old durgan landlord who have maintained respectful silence during technical conversation a there be le than three p'licemen from 'azelworth on dewty night in house 'count of lady aveling jewellery one be won fower six last night off second footman tossin towards sunset next day mr watkins virgin canvas easel very considerable case of other appliance in

lady hammerpond butler have just terminated that individual surrounded by three pet dog be duty to take for airing after dinner have be served be receding in distance mr watkins be mixing colour with air of great industry sant approaching more nearly be surprised to see colour in question be a harsh brilliant emerald green a be possible to imagine having cultivated extreme sensibility to colour from earliest year drew air in sharply between teeth at very first glimpse of brew mr watkins turned round looked annoyed what on earth be going to do with beastly green said sant mr watkins realised that zeal to appear busy in eye of butler have evidently betrayed into technical error looked at sant hesitated pardon rudeness said sant really green be altogether too amazing came a shock what do mean to do with mr watkins be collecting resource nothing must save situation decision if come here interrupting work said be goin ' to paint face with sant retired for be humourist peaceful man going down hill met porson wainwright that man be genius be dangerous lunatic said just go up look at green continued way countenance brightened by pleasant anticipation of cheerful affray round easel in gloaming shedding of much green paint to porson wainwright mr watkins be le aggressive explained that green be intended to be first coating of picture be admitted in response to remark absolutely new method invented by subsequently became more reticent explained be not going to tell passer by secret of own particular style added scathing remark upon meanness of people hanging about to pick up such trick of master a must immediately relieved of company twilight deepened first one then star appeared rook amid tall tree to left of house have long since lapsed into slumbrous silence house lost detail of architecture became dark grey outline then window of salon shone out brilliantly conservatory be lighted up here there bedroom window burnt yellow have anyone approached easel in park must have be found deserted one brief uncivil word in brilliant green sullied purity of canvas mr watkins be busy in shrubbery with assistant who have discreetly joined from carriage drive mr watkins be inclined to be self congratulatory upon ingenious device by have carried apparatus boldly in sight of men right up to scene of operation be dressing room said to assistant a soon a maid take candle away go down to supper will call in how nice house do look to be sure against starlight with window light swopme jim almost wish be painter chap have fixed that there wire across path from laundry cautiously approached house until stood below dressing room window began to put together folding ladder be much too experienced practitioner to feel unusual excitement jim be reconnoitring smoking room suddenly close beside mr watkins in bush there be violent crash stifled curse someone have tumbled over wire assistant have just arranged heard foot running on gravel pathway beyond mr watkins like true artist be singularly shy man incontinently dropped folding ladder began running circumspectly through shrubbery be indistinctly aware of two people hot upon heel fancied that distinguished outline of assistant in front of in moment have vaulted low stone wall bounding shrubbery be in open park two thud on turf followed own leap be close chase in darkness through tree mr watkins be loosely built man in good training gained hand over hand upon hoarsely panting figure in front spoke a mr watkins pulled up alongside qualm of awful doubt came over other man turned head at same moment gave exclamation of surprise be not jim thought mr watkins simultaneously stranger flung a be at watkin knee be forthwith grappling on ground together lend hand bill cried stranger a third man came up bill did two hand in fact accentuated foot fourth man presumably jim have apparently turned aside made off in different direction at rate did not join trio mr watkins memory of incident of next two minute be extremely vague have dim recollection of having thumb in corner of mouth of first man feeling anxious about safety for second at least held head of gentleman answering to name of bill to ground by hair be also kicked in great number of different place apparently by vast multitude of people then gentleman who be not bill got knee below mr watkins diaphragm tried to curl up upon when sensation became le entangled be sitting upon turf eight ten men night be dark be rather too confused to count standing round apparently waiting for to recover mournfully assumed that be captured must probably have made philosophical reflection on fickleness of fortune have not internal sensation disinclined for speech noticed very quickly that wrist be not handcuffed then flask of brandy be put in hand touched little be such unexpected kindness be comin round said voice fancied recognised a belonging to hammerpond second footman have got sir of 'em said hammerpond butler man who have handed flask thanks to one answered remark yet failed to see how applied to be fair dazed said strange voice villain half murdered mr teddy watkins decided to remain fair dazed until have better grasp of situation perceived that two of black figure round stood side by side with dejected air there be something in carriage of shoulder suggested to experienced eye hand be bound together two in flash rose to position emptied little flask staggered obsequious hand assisting to foot there be sympathetic murmur shake hand sir shake hand said one of figure near permit to introduce be very greatly indebted to be jewel of wife lady aveling attracted scoundrel to house very glad to make lordship acquaintance said teddy watkins presume saw rascal making for shrubbery dropped down on be exactly how happened said mr watkins must have waited till got in at window said lord aveling must get hotter if have actually committed burglary be lucky for two of policeman be out by gate followed up three of doubt if must have secured two of though be confoundedly plucky of all same yes ought to have thought of said mr watkins one ca think of everythink certainly not said lord aveling be afraid have mauled little added party be now moving towards house walk rather lame may offer arm instead of entering hammerpond house by dressing room window mr watkins entered slightly intoxicated inclined now to cheerfulness again on arm of real live peer by front door thought mr watkins be burgling in style scoundrel seen by gaslight proved to be mere local amateur unknown to mr watkins be taken down into pantry there watched over by three policeman two gamekeeper with loaded gun butler ostler carman until dawn allowed of removal to hazelhurst police station mr watkins be made much of in saloon devoted sofa to must not hear of return to village night lady aveling be sure be brilliantly original said idea of turner be just such rough half inebriated deep eyed brave clever man one brought up remarkable little folding ladder have be picked up in shrubbery showed how be put together also described how wire have be found in shrubbery evidently placed there to trip up unwary pursuer be lucky have escaped snare showed jewel mr watkins have sense not to talk too much in conversational difficulty fell back on internal pain at last be seized with stiffness in back yawning everyone suddenly awoke to fact that be shame to keep talking after affray so retired early to room little red room next to lord aveling dawn found deserted easel bearing canvas with green inscription in hammerpond park found hammerpond house in commotion if dawn found mr teddy watkins aveling diamond did not communicate information to police moth genus novo probably have heard of hapley not wt hapley son celebrated hapley hapley of periplaneta hapliia hapley entomologist if so know at least of great feud between hapley professor pawkins though certain of consequence may be new to for who have not word

pawkins began year year ago with revision of microlepidoptera whatever may be by pawkins in extinguished new specie created by hapley hapley who be always quarrelsome replied by stinging impeachment of entire classification of pawkinsa pawkins in rejoinderb suggested that hapley microscope be a defective a power of observation called irresponsible meddler hapley be not professor at time hapley in retortc spoke of blundering collector described a if inadvertently pawkins revision a miracle of ineptitude be war to knife however must scarcely interest reader to detail how two great men quarrelled how split between widened until from microlepidoptera be at war upon open question in entomology there be memorable occasion at time royal entomological society meeting resembled nothing so much a chamber of deputy on whole fancy pawkins be nearer truth than hapley hapley be skilful with rhetoric have turn for ridicule rare in scientific man be endowed with vast energy have fine sense of injury in matter of extinguished specie while pawkins be man of dull presence prosy of speech in shape not unlike water barrel over conscientious with testimonial suspected of jobbing museum appointment so young men gathered round hapley applauded be long struggle vicious from beginning growing at last to pitiless antagonism successive turn of fortune now advantage to one side now to now hapley

mistaking will to wound hapley incapacity to do few of who heard be absent from meeting realised how ill man be hapley have got opponent down meant to finish followed with simply brutal attack upon

consequence there must be reasonable doubt fret of defeat have contributed to death of pawkins there be limit even to scientific controversy said serious people crushing attack be already in press appeared on day before funeral think hapley exerted to stop people remembered how hapley have hounded down rival forgot that rival defect scathing satire read ill over fresh mould thing provoked comment in daily paper be that made think that have probably heard of hapley controversy a have already remarked scientific worker live very much in world of own people dare say who go along piccadilly to academy year must not tell where learned society abide many even think that research be kind of happy family cage in kind of men lie down together in peace in private thought hapley must not forgive pawkins for dying in first place be mean dodge to escape absolute pulverisation hapley have in hand for in second left hapley mind with queer gap in for twenty year have worked hard sometimes far into night seven day week with microscope scalpel collecting net pen almost entirely with reference to pawkins european reputation have won have come a incident in great antipathy have gradually worked up to climax in last controversy have killed pawkins have also thrown hapley out of gear so to speak doctor advised to give up work for time rest so hapley went down into quiet village in kent thought day night of pawkins good thing be now impossible to say about at last hapley began to realise in what direction pre occupation tended determined to make fight for started by trying to read novel must not get mind off pawkins white in face making last speech sentence beautiful opening for hapley turned to fiction found have grip on read island night entertainment until sense of causation be shocked beyond endurance by bottle imp then went to kipling found proved nothing besides being irreverent vulgar scientific people have limitation then unhappily tried besant inner house opening chapter set mind upon learned society pawkins at once so hapley turned to chess found little more soothing soon mastered move chief gambit commoner closing position began to beat vicar then cylindrical contour of opposite king began to resemble pawkins standing up gasping ineffectually against check mate hapley decided to give up chess perhaps study of new branch of science must after be better diversion best rest be change of occupation hapley determined to plunge at diatom have one of smaller microscope halibut monograph sent down from london thought that perhaps if must get up vigorous quarrel with halibut might be able to begin life afresh forget pawkins very soon be hard at work in habitual strenuous fashion at microscopic denizen of way side pool be on third day of diatom hapley became aware of novel addition to local fauna be working late at microscope only light in room be brilliant little lamp with special form of green shade like experienced

delusion be crawling slowly towards foot of lamp genus novo by heaven in england said hapley staring then suddenly thought of pawkins nothing must have maddened pawkins more pawkins be dead something about head body of insect became singularly suggestive of pawkins just a chess king have be confound pawkins said hapley must catch looking round for mean of capturing moth rose slowly out of chair suddenly insect rose edge of lampshade hapley heard ping vanished into shadow in moment hapley have whipped off shade so that whole room be illuminated thing have disappeared soon practised eye

hapley suddenly rushed at door slammed hastily hapley be left alone in dark then in pause heard landlady scuttle upstairs lock door drag something heavy across room put against became evident to hapley that conduct appearance have be strange alarming confound moth pawkins however be pity to lose moth now felt way into hall found match after sending hat down upon floor with noise like drum with lighted candle returned to sitting room moth be to be seen yet once for moment seemed that thing be fluttering round head hapley very suddenly decided to give up moth go to bed be excited night long sleep be broken by dream of moth pawkins landlady twice in night turned out soused head in cold water one thing be very clear to landlady must not possibly understand about strange moth

bearing ingot went forward perhaps hundred yard in silence evans began to breathe heavily ca speak said what be matter with said hooker evans stumbled then with sudden curse flung coat from stood for moment staring at hooker then with groan clutched at own throat come near said went leant against tree then in steadier voice will be better in minute presently grip upon trunk loosened slipped slowly down stem of tree until be crumpled heap at foot hand be clenched convulsively face became distorted with pain hooker approached touch touch said evans in stifled voice put gold back on coat ca do anything for said hooker put gold back on coat a hooker handled ingot felt little prick on ball of thumb looked at hand saw slender thorn perhaps two inch in length evans gave inarticulate cry rolled over hooker jaw dropped stared at thorn for moment with dilated eye then looked at evans who be now crumpled together on ground back bending straitening spasmodically then looked through pillar of
