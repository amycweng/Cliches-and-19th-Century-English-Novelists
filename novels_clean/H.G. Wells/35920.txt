always put rope around of daughter before ever put foot in water held until be safely out again mabel glendower must not have rope where garden end beach begin miss glendower turned aside sat down on green iron seat under evergreen oak having found place in sir george tressady book of be naturally enough at time inordinately fond sat watching others go on down beach there be very bright very pleasant group of prosperous animated people upon sunlit beach beyond in streak of grey purple altogether calm save for pattern of dainty little wavelet be that ancient mother of surprise sea a soon a reached high water mark where be no longer indecent to be clad merely in bathing dress of young lady handed attendant wrap after little fun laughter mr bunting looked carefully to see if there be jelly fish then went in after minute so seems betty elder miss bunting stopped splashing looked then looked there about thirty yard away be sea lady head a if be swimming back to land naturally concluded that must be neighbour from one of adjacent house be little surprised not to have noticed going down into water beyond apparition have shadow of wonder for made furtive penetrating observation usual in such case must see that be swimming very gracefully that have lovely face very beautiful arm must not see wonderful golden hair because be hidden in fashionable phrygian bathing cap picked up a afterwards admitted to second cousin night before upon norman plage must see lovely shoulder because of red costume wore be just on point of feeling inspection have reached limit of really nice manner mabel be pretending to go on splashing again saying to betty be wearing red dress wish must see when something very terrible happened swimmer gave queer sort of flop in water threw up arm vanished be sort of thing seems for instant to freeze everybody just one of thing everyone have read of imagined very few people have seen for space one did anything one two three second passed then for instant bare arm flashed in air vanished again mabel tell be quite paralysed with horror did nothing time two miss bunting recovering little screamed out oh be drowning hastened to get out of sea at once proceeding accelerated by mr bunting who with great presence of mind pulled at rope with weight turned about continued to pull long after be many yard from water edge indeed cowering in heap at foot of sea wall miss glendower became aware of crisis descended step sir george tressady in one hand other shading eye cry in clear resolute voice must be saved maid of course be screaming a became two men appear to have acted with greatest presence of mind fred nexdoors ledder said mr randolph bunting for next door neighbour instead of having convenient stone step have high wall long wooden ladder have often be pointed out by mr bunting if ever accident must happen to anyone there be that in moment seems have flung off jacket vest collar tie shoe be running neighbour ladder out into water where did go ded said fred right out hea said mr bunting to confirm word there flashed again arm something dark something in light of subsequently happened be inclined to suppose be unintentional exposure of lady tail neither of two gentleman be expert swimmer indeed so far a can gather mr bunting in excitement of occasion forgot almost everything have ever known of swimming waded out valiantly one on side of ladder thrust out before committed to deep in manner casting discredit upon nation race yet on whole think be matter for general congratulation that be not engaged in rescue of genuinely drowning person at time of enquiry soreness of argument may once have obtained between have passed be fairly clear that while fred bunting be engaged in swimming hard against long side of ladder so causing to rotate slowly on axis mr bunting have already swallowed very considerable amount of sea water be kicking fred in chest with aimless vigour did a explains to get leg down know something about ladder know must go up then quite unexpectedly sea lady appeared beside one lovely arm supported mr bunting about waist other be over ladder did not appear at pale frightened out of breath fred told when cross examined though at time be too violently excited to note detail of sort indeed smiled spoke in easy pleasant voice cramp said have cramp men be convinced of mr bunting be on point of telling to hold tight must be quite safe when little wave went almost entirely into mouth reduced to wild splutterings will get in said fred something of sort so hung bobbing in water to tune of mr bunting trouble seem to have rocked so for time fred say sea lady looked calm little puzzled that seemed to measure distance shoreward mean to save asked be trying to think what must be done before father drowned be saving now said will take ashore a seemed so cool thought must explain plan of operation trying to get end of ladder kick with leg only few yard out of depth if must only minute get breath moufu ' sea water said mr bunting splash wuff then seemed to fred that little miracle happened there be swirl of water like swirl about screw propeller gripped sea lady ladder just in time a seemed to to prevent being washed far out into channel father vanished from sight with expression of astonishment just forming on face reappeared beside so far a back leg be concerned holding on to ladder with sort of death grip then behold have shifted dozen yard inshore be in le than five foot of water fred must feel ground at touch amazement dismay immediately gave way to purest heroism thrust ladder sea lady before abandoned ladder now quite disordered parent caught tightly in arm bore up out of water young lady cried saved maid cried saved distant voice echoed saved hooray everybody in fact cried saved except mr bunting who be say under impression that mr bunting be in fit mr bunting who seems to have be under impression that law of nature by under providence be permitted to float swim be in suspense that best thing to do be to kick very hard fast until end must come in dozen second so head be up again foot be on ground be making whale walrus noise noise like horse like angry cat like sawing be wiping water from eye mr bunting except now then really have to turn say randolph must give attention to beautiful burthen that clung about son be curious thing that sea lady be at least minute out of water before anyone discovered that be in way different from other lady suppose be crowding close to looking at beautiful face perhaps imagined that be wearing indiscreet novel form of dark riding habit something of sort anyhow not one of noticed although must have be before eye a plain a day certainly must have blended with costume there stood imagining that fred have rescued lovely lady of indisputable fashion who have be bathing from neighbouring house wondering why on earth there be nobody on beach to claim clung to fred a miss mabel glendower subsequently remarked in course of conversation with fred clung to have cramp said sea lady with lip against fred cheek one eye on mr bunting be sure be cramp have got still see anybody began mr bunting please carry in said sea lady closing eye a if be ill though cheek be flushed warm carry in where gasped fred carry into house whispered to house mr bunting came nearer house said sea lady shut eye for good became oblivious to further remark understand said mr bunting addressing everybody then be saw nettie younger miss bunting saw first pointed say before must find word to speak then saw miss glendower believe be person who be last to see at rate must have be like if have be mother said nettie giving word to general horror mother have tail then three maid mabel glendower screamed one after other look cried tail of said mr bunting word failed oh said miss glendower put hand to heart then one of maid gave name be mermaid screamed maid then everyone screamed be mermaid except mermaid remained quite passive pretending to be insensible partly on fred shoulder altogether in arm ii that know be tableau so far a have be able to piece together again must imagine little knot of people upon beach mr bunting figure little apart just wading out of water very wet incredulous half drowned neighbour ladder be drifting quietly out to sea of course be one of position have air of being conspicuous indeed be conspicuous be way below high water group stood out perhaps thirty yard down beach nobody a mr bunting told cousin melville knew bit what to do have even exaggerated share of national hatred of being seen in puzzle mermaid seemed content to remain beautiful problem clinging to fred by account be reasonable burthen for man seems that very large family of people who be stopping at house called koot hoomi have appeared in force be staring gesticulating be just sort of people bunting did not want to know tradespeople very probably presently one of men particularly vulgar man who used to shoot at gull began putting down ladder a if intended to offer advice mr bunting also became aware of black glare of field glass of still more horrid man to west moreover popular author who lived next door irascible dark square headed little man in spectacle suddenly turned up began bawling from inaccessible wall top something foolish about ladder nobody thought of silly ladder took trouble about naturally be quite stupidly excited to judge by tone gesture be using dreadful language seemed disposed moment to jump down to beach come to then to crown situation over westward groin appeared low excursionist first of head came then remark then began to clamber breakwater with joyful shout pip pip said low excursionist a climbed be year of pip pip what ho bump then le generally what be up 'ere voice of other low excursionist still invisible answered pip pip be evidently large party anything wrong shouted one of low excursionist at venture dear said mr bunting to mabel what be to do in description of affair to cousin melville used always to make that clou of story dear what be to do believe that in desperation even glanced at water of course to have put mermaid back then must have involved most terrible explanation be evident there be only one thing to be done mr bunting said a much only thing said be to carry indoors carry indoors did one can figure little procession in front fred wet astonished still clinging clung to altogether too out of breath for word in arm sea lady have beautiful figure understand until horrible tail began fin of mr bunting told cousin in whispered confidence went up down with pointed corner for world like mackerel flopped dripped along path imagine be wearing very nice very long skirted dress of red material trimmed with coarse white lace have mabel told gilet though must scarcely show a went up garden that phrygian cap hid golden hair showed white low level forehead over sea blue eye from followed imagine at moment scanning veranda window of house with certain eagerness of scrutiny behind staggering group of two believe mr bunting came then mr bunting dreadfully wet broken down mr bunting must have be by then from one two thing have noticed since ca help imagining a pursuing wife with of course dear must tell know then in dismayed yet curious bunch girl in wrap of towelling maid carrying rope thing a if inadvertently a became most of mr fred bunting clothes then miss glendower for once at least in sort of pose clutching sir george tressady perplexed disturbed beyond measure then a be pursuing pip pip hat raised eyebrow of low excursionist still anxious to know what be up from garden end so be at least in such way to accompaniment of wildest raving about ladder other heard too distinctly over garden wall overdressed snobbs take rare old english adjective ladder that carried sea lady who appeared serenely insensible to everything up through house laid down upon couch in mr bunting room just a miss glendower be suggesting that very best thing must do must be to send for doctor sea lady with beautiful naturalness sighed came to chapter second first impression there with a much verisimilitude a can give be how folkestone mermaid really came to land there can be doubt that whole affair be deliberately planned intrusion upon part never have cramp must have cramp a for drowning nobody be near drowning for moment except mr bunting whose valuable life very nearly sacrificed at outset of adventure next proceeding be to demand interview with mr bunting to presume upon youthful glowing appearance to gain support sympathy assistance of good hearted lady who a matter of fact be thing of yesterday mere chicken in comparison with own immemorial year in extraordinary raid upon humanity treatment of mr bunting must be incredible if did not know that in spite of many disadvantage sea lady be extremely well read person admitted a much in several later conversation with cousin melville for time there be friendly intimacy so melville always preferred to present between two cousin who have fairly considerable amount of curiosity learnt many very interesting detail about life out there down there for sea lady used expression at first sea lady be exceedingly reticent under gentle insistence of curiosity after time gather gave way to burst of cheerful confidence be clear say cousin that old idea of submarine life a sort of perpetual game of 'who hoop ' through grove of coral diversified by moonlight hair combing on rocky strand need very extensive modification in matter of literature for example have practically that have unlimited leisure to read in melville be very insistent upon rather envious of unlimited leisure picture of mermaid swinging in hammock of woven seaweed with what bishop call latter day novel in one hand sixteen candle power phosphorescent fish in other may jar upon one preconception be certainly far more in accordance with picture of abyss printed on mind everywhere change work will on thing everywhere even among immortal modernity spread even on olympus suppose there be progressive party new phaeton agitating to supersede horse of father by solar motor of own suggested a much to melville said horrible horrible stared hard at study fire dear old melville gave end of fact about deep sea reading of course print book out there for printer ink under water must not so much run a fly made very plain in one way nearly whole of terrestrial literature say melville have come to know said form indeed distinct reading public addition to vast submerged library circulates forever with tide be now pretty systematically sought source be various in case little odd many book have be found in sunken ship indeed said melville there be always dropping blowing overboard of novel magazine from most passenger carrying vessel sometimes be not a rule valuable addition deliberate shying overboard sometimes book of exceptional sort be thrown over when be quite finished melville be dainty irritable reader doubt understood that from sea beach of holiday resort moreover lighter sort of literature be occasionally getting blown out to sea so soon a boom of great popular novelist be over melville assured library find convenient to cast such surplus copy of current work a hospital prison can not take below high water mark be not generally known said know said melville in other way beach yield young couple who begin to sit sea lady told cousin a often a not will leave excellent modern fiction behind when at last return to proper place there be particularly fine collection of english work seems in deep water of english channel practically whole of tauchnitz library be there thrown overboard at last moment by conscientious timid traveller returning from continent there be for time similar source of supply of american reprint in mersey have fallen off in recent year deep sea mission for fisherman have now for year be raining down tract giving particularly elevated tone of thought to extensive willow of north sea sea lady be very precise on point when one considers condition of accumulation one be not surprised to hear that element of fiction be a dominant in deep sea library a be upon counter of messrs mudie cousin learnt that various illustrated magazine particularly fashion paper be valued even more highly than novel be looked for far more eagerly perused with envious emotion indeed on point cousin got sudden glimpse of one of motif have brought daring young lady into air made sort of suggestion must have taken to dressing long ago said added with vague quality of laughter in tone be that be unfeminine mr melville only a be explaining to mr bunting one must consider one circumstance how can one hope to keep anything nice under water imagine lace soaked said cousin melville drenched said sea lady ruined said cousin melville then know said sea lady very gravely one hair of course said melville why can never get dry be precisely said cousin melville have new light on old topic be why in old time exactly cried exactly before there be so many excursionist sailor low people about one came out one sat brushed in sun then of course really be possible to do up now made petulant gesture looked gravely at melville biting lip while cousin made sympathetic noise horrid modern spirit said almost automatically though fiction fashion appear to be so regrettably dominant in nourishment of mer mind must not be supposed that most serious side of reading never reach bottom of sea there be for example case quite recently sea lady said of captain of sailing ship whose mind have become unhinged by huckstering uproar of time daily mail who have not only bought second hand copy of time reprint of encyclopaedia britannica also that dense collection of literary snack sample that literature sausage have be compressed under weighty editing of doctor richard garnett have long be notorious that even greatest mind of past be far too copious confusing in a word go lubrication doctor garnett be alleged have seized gist presented so compactly that almost business man now may take hold of without hindrance to more serious occupation unfortunate misguided seaman seems to have carried entire collection aboard with with pretty evident intention of coming to land in sydney wisest man alive hindoo minded thing to do result might have be anticipated mass shifted in night threw whole weight of science of middle nineteenth century literature of time in virulently concentrated state on one side of little vessel capsized instantly ship sea lady said dropped into abyss a if be loaded with lead crew other movable did not follow down until much later in day captain be first to arrive said sea lady be curious fact due probably to preliminary dippings into purchase that came head first instead of foot down limb expanded in customary way however such exceptional windfall avail little against rain of light literature be constantly going on novel newspaper remain world reading even at bottom of sea a subsequent event must seem to show must have be from common latter day novel newspaper that sea lady derived idea of human life sentiment inspiration of visit if at time seemed to underestimate nobler tendency of human spirit if at time seemed disposed to treat adeline glendower many of deeper thing of life with certain sceptical levity if did at last indisputably subordinate reason right feeling to passion be only just to to deeper issue that must ascribe aberration to proper cause ii cousin melville be saying did at one time get vague very vague conception of what that deep sea world be like whether conception have quality of truth in be more than dare say give impression of very strange world indeed green luminous fluidity in being float world lit by great shining monster drift athwart by waving forest of nebulous luminosity amidst little fish drift like netted star be world with sitting standing going coming through inhabitant float drift a one float drift in dream way live there dear man said melville must be like painted ceiling even feel certain that be in sea particularly that world of sea lady be to be found about saturated book drowned scrap of paper say thing be not always what seem told of must reflect one laughing afternoon must appear at time say a real a again came mystery about there be time when seemed to might have hurt killed a can hurt kill anyone with penknife for example there be time when seemed to must have destroyed whole material universe left smiling still of ambiguous element in lady more be to be told later there be wider sea than ever keel sailed upon deep that lead of human casting will ever plumb when be summed up have to admit know can not tell fall back upon melville poor array of collected fact at first there be amazingly little strangeness about for who have to deal with there be palpably solid material lady out of sea modern world be world where wonderful be utterly commonplace be bred to show quiet freedom from amazement why must boggle at material mermaid with dewar solidifying sort of impalpable thing marconi wave spreading everywhere to bunting be a matter of fact a much matter of authentic reasonable motif of sound solid sentimentality a everything else in bunting world so be for in beginning so up to day with memory remains iii way in sea lady talked to mr bunting on memorable morning when lay wet still visibly fishy on couch in mr bunting dressing room be also able to give with little fulness because mr bunting repeated several time acting more dramatic speech in to cousin melville in several of good long talk that of in happy day particularly mr bunting always enjoyed so much with very first speech seems sea lady took line straight to mr bunting generous managing heart sat up on couch drew antimacassar modestly over deformity sometimes looking sweetly down sometimes openly trustfully into mr bunting face speaking in soft clear grammatical manner stamped at once a mere mermaid finished fine sea lady made clean breast of a mr bunting said fully frankly placed in mr bunting hand mr bunting said mr bunting to cousin melville in dramatic rendering of sea lady manner do permit to apologise for intrusion for know be intrusion indeed have almost be forced upon if will only listen to story mr bunting think will find well if not complete excuse for for can understand how exacting standard must be at rate excuse for what have done for what must call mr bunting deceitful conduct towards deceitful be mr bunting for never have cramp then mr bunting here mr bunting must insert long impressive pause never have mother then there said mr bunting when told story to cousin melville poor child burst into tear confessed have be born age age ago in dreadful miraculous way in terrible place near cyprus have more right to surname well there said mr bunting telling story to cousin melville making characteristic gesture with always passed over disowned indelicacy to thought might have tended while speaking with nice accent moving in such ladylike way of course said cousin melville there be class of people in whom one excuse one must weigh precisely said mr bunting see seems deliberately chose a very sort of person have always wanted to appeal to be a if came to haphazard picked out have be swimming round coast watching people day after day said for quite long time said when saw face watching girl bathe know how funny girl be said mr bunting with little deprecatory laugh while with moisture of emotion in kindly eye took quite violent fancy to from very first can quite believe at rate said cousin melville with unction know did although always leaf out of story when tell to then forgets have have occasional privilege of making third party in good long talk know be most extraordinary exactly like german story said mr bunting oom what be undine exactly yes really seems poor creature be immortal mr melville at least within limit creature born of element resolved into element again just a be in story there be always something have soul soul at nothing poor child feel feel dreadfully in order to get soul mr melville know have to come into world of men at least so believe down there so have come to folkestone to get soul of course be great object mr melville be not at fanatical silly about more than be of course people who feel deeply of course said cousin melville with know momentary expression of profound gravity drooping eyelid hushed voice for cousin doe good deal with soul one way feel that if come to earth at said mr bunting must come among nice people in nice way one can understand feeling like imagine difficulty to be mere cause of public excitement silly paragraph in silly season to be made sort of show of in fact doe want of added mr

eyebrow be point have be clear to so far took breath away positively tail sort of incorrect theory went by board somehow felt be topic not to be too urgently pursued mr bunting be old friend really have tail asked like tail of big mackerel said mr bunting asked more be most extraordinary situation said what else must do asked mr bunting of course thing tremendous experiment said cousin melville repeated quite inadvertently tail clear vivid before eye obstructing absolutely advance of thought be shiny clear line oily black green purple silver easy expansiveness of mackerel termination really know said cousin melville protesting in name of reason nineteenth century tail patted said mr bunting iv certain supplementary aspect of sea lady first conversation with mr bunting got from that lady afterwards sea lady have made one queer mistake four charming daughter said two son dear cried mr bunting have got through preliminary by then have only two daughter one son young man who carried who

lady thoughtfully be such excellent match in way adeline just in very position to help mr bunting must seem briefly clearly supplied indication of precise position of mr chatteris not omitting even that be nephew of earl a indeed why must omit splendid prospect of alliance with miss glendower plebeian extensive wealth sea lady listened gravely be young be able may still be anything anything be so earnest so clever always reading even read blue book government blue book mean dreadful statistical schedulely thing condition of poor thing know more about condition of poor than one have ever met what earn what eat how many of live in room so dreadfully crowded know perfectly shocking be just helper need so dignified so capable of giving political party influencing people so earnest know can talk to workman take interest in trade union in quite astonishing thing always think be just marcella come to life from that good lady embarked upon illustrative involved anecdote of miss glendower marvellous blue bookishness will come here again soon sea lady asked quite carelessly in midst of query be carried away lost in anecdote so that later sea lady repeated question even more carelessly mr bunting did not know whether sea lady sighed at not think not be so busy telling about everything that think troubled very much to see how information be received what mind have left over from own discourse be probably centred on tail v even to mr bunting sens be one of person who take everything except of course impertinence impropriety quite calmly must think have be little astonishing to find sitting in boudoir politely taking tea with real live legendary creature be having tea in boudoir because of caller quite quietly because in spite of sea lady smiling assurance mr bunting must have must be tired unequal to exertion of social intercourse after journey said mr bunting there be just three adeline glendower being third fred three other girl understand hung about in general sort of way up down staircase to great annoyance of servant who be thus kept out of altogether confirming one view of tail arguing on theory of mermaid revisiting garden beach trying to invent excuse for seeing invalid again be forbidden to intrude pledged to secrecy by mr bunting must have be a altogether unsettled miserable a young people can be for time played croquet in half hearted way doubt with eye on boudoir window a for mr bunting be in bed gather that three lady sat talked a three lady quite resolved to be pleasant to one must talk mr bunting miss glendower be far too well trained in observance of good society be a one know even best of now extremely mixed to make too searching enquiry into sea lady status way of life precisely where lived when be at home whom knew did know though in several way wanted to know badly enough sea lady volunteered information contenting with entertaining superficiality of touch go in most ladylike way professed greatly delighted with sensation of being in air superficially quite dry be particularly charmed with tea have tea cried miss glendower startled how can do really mean have never tasted tea before how do think can boil kettle what strange what wonderful world must be cried adeline mr bunting said can hardly imagine without tea be worse than mean reminds of abroad mr bunting be in act of refilling sea lady cup suppose said suddenly a be not used to wo affect diges glanced at adeline hesitated be china tea filled cup be inconceivable world to said adeline quite dark eye rested thoughtfully on sea lady for space inconceivable repeated for in unaccountable way in whisper will attract attention that turmoil fails to arouse tea have opened eye far more than tail sea lady looked at with sudden frankness think how wonderful must seem to remarked adeline imagination be aroused for moment be not to be put aside by sea lady terrestrial impression pierced for moment so ladylike serenity assumption of terrestrial fashion of mind be imposing so successfully upon mr bunting must be said strangest world stopped invitingly must not go beyond sea lady must not help there be pause silent eager search for topic apropos of niphetos rose on table talked of flower miss glendower ventured have anemone too how beautiful must be amidst rock sea lady said be very pretty especially cultivated sort fish said mr bunting how wonderful must be to see fish of volunteered sea lady will come feed out of one hand mr bunting made little coo of approval be reminded of chrysanthemum show outside of royal academy exhibition be one of people to whom only familiar be really satisfying have momentary vision of abyss a sort of diverticulum of piccadilly temple place unexpectedly rational comfortable there be kink for time about little matter of illumination recurred to mr bunting only long after sea lady have turned from miss glendower interrogative gravity of expression to sunlight sunlight seems so golden

glendower teacup in hand be drinking quite lot of tea absent mindedly in interest in sea lady how do tell when be sunday began sea lady at least not exactly then of course one hears beautiful hymn be sung on passenger ship of course said mr bunting having sung so in youth quite forgetting something elusive that have previously seemed to catch afterwards there came glimpse of more serious divergence glimpse merely miss glendower hazarded supposition that sea people also have problem then must seem natural earnestness of disposition overcame proper attitude of ladylike superficiality began to ask question there can be doubt that sea lady be evasive miss glendower perceiving that have be trifle urgent tried to cover error by expressing general impression ca see said with gesture asked for sympathy one want to see one want to be one need to be born mer child mer child asked sea lady yes call little one what little one asked sea lady regarded for moment with frank wonder

visit to london micklethwaite be giving lunch at penwiper club certainly one of best dozen literary club in london noted rising young journalist at table near door lunching alone about table be vacant though other part of room be crowded sat with face towards door kept looking up whenever one came in a if expected one who never came once distinctly saw beckon to man man did not respond look here micklethwaite said why be everybody avoiding that man over there noticed just now in smoking room that seemed to be trying to get into conversation with one that kind of taboo micklethwaite stared over fork ra ther said what be done be fool said micklethwaite with mouth full evidently annoyed ugh said a soon a be free to do so waited little while what be done ventured micklethwaite did not answer for moment crammed thing into mouth vindictively bread sort of thing then leaning towards in confidential manner made indignant noise must not clearly distinguish a word oh said when have done yes said micklethwaite swallowed then poured wine splashing tablecloth have for hour very nearly other day yes said silly fool said micklethwaite be afraid be over luckily gave opening again after

plate remains of waiter have gone away golf always doe micklethwaite good except when be actually playing then be told if be mr bunting must break off raise eyebrow hand at point to indicate how golf act on micklethwaite when be playing turned mind to feigning interest in golf game that in truth despise hate a despise hate nothing else in world imagine great fat creature like micklethwaite creature who ought to wear turban long black robe to hide grossness whacking little white ball for mile mile with perfect surgery of instrument whacking either with babyish solemnity childish rage a luck may have decided whacking away while country go to devil incidentally training innocent eyed little boy to swear be tip hunting loafer be golf however controlled too facile sneer talked of golf relative merit of golf link a might talk to child about bun distract puppy with whisper of rat when at last must look at rising young journalist again lunch have come to end saw that be talking with greater air of freedom than be usual to display to club waiter to man who held coat man looked incredulous respectful be answering shortly politely when went out little conversation be still going on waiter be holding rising young journalist soft felt hat rising young journalist be fumbling in coat pocket with thick mass of paper be tremendous have got most of here be saying a went by know if 'd care get very little time for reading waiter be replying chapter fourth quality of parker so far have be very full know verisimilitude have be watchword rather than true affidavit style if have made clear to reader just how sea lady landed just how be possible for to land become member of human society without considerable excitement on part of society such poor pain a have taken to tint shadow embellish fact at disposal will not have be taken in vain positively quietly settled down with bunting within fortnight have really settled down so thoroughly that save for exceptional beauty charm occasional faint touch of something little indefinable in smile have become quite passable credible human being be cripple indeed lower limb be most pathetically swathed put in sort of case be quite generally understood be afraid at mr bunting initiative presently mr bunting said be certainly almost a far even little farther than legitimate prevarication may go must be a well a ever illustration positively quietly settled down with bunting of course said mr bunting will never be able to bicycle again be sort of glamour threw about ii in parker be indisputable that sea lady found at least have found for by mr bunting treasure of richest sort parker be still fallaciously young have be maid to lady from india who have be in case have experienced overcome cross examination have also be deceived by young man whom have fancied greatly only to find walking out with contrary to inflexible sense of correctness in presence of other thing be altogether vain life have resolved must have further surprise for looked out on largely improper pageant with expression of alert impartiality in hazel eye calm doing specific duty entirely declining to participate further always kept elbow down by side hand always just in contact be impossible for most powerful imagination to conceive under circumstance a being anything absolutely straight clean neat voice be always under circumstance low wonderfully distinct just to infinitesimal degree indeed mincing mr bunting have be little nervous when came to point be mr bunting of course who engaged because sea lady be so entirely without experience certainly mr bunting nervousness be thrown away understand said mr bunting taking plunge at that be invalid did mem replied parker respectfully evidently quite willing to understand anything a part of duty in world in fact said mr bunting rubbing edge of tablecloth daintily with gloved finger watching operation with interest a matter of fact have mermaid tail mermaid tail indeed mem be painful at oh dear involves inconvenience nothing except understand there be need of discretion of course mem said parker a who must say there always be particularly want servant lower servant mem understand mr bunting looked up again regarded parker calmly precisely mem said parker with face unmoved so came to question of term passed off most satisfactorily said mr bunting taking deep breath at mere memory of moment be clear that parker be quite of opinion be not only discreet really clever handy from very outset grasped situation unostentatiously very firmly be parker who contrived sort of violin case for who made tea gown extension covered case arid contour be parker who suggested invalid chair for use indoors in garden carrying chair for staircase hitherto fred bunting have be on hand at last even in excessive abundance whenever sea lady lay in need of masculine arm parker made clear at once that be not at in accordance with idea so earned lifelong gratitude of mabel glendower parker too spoke out for drive suggested with air of rightness left nothing else to be done hire of carriage pair for season to equal delight of bunting sea lady be parker who dictated daily drive up to eastern end of lea sea lady transfer manner of sea lady transfer to bath chair in promenaded lea there seemed to be nowhere that be pleasant proper for sea lady to go parker did not swiftly correctly indicate way to get to there seems to have be nothing that be really undesirable sea lady must do anywhere that be really undesirable that must go that parker did not at once invisibly effectively interpose bar be parker who released sea lady from being sort of private peculiar property in bunting household carried off to becoming position in world when crisis came in little thing a in great failed not be who made luminous that sea lady card plate be not yet engraved printed miss doris thalassia water be pleasant appropriate name with sea lady came primed who replaced box of presumably dank drowned dripping tom by jewel case dressing bag first of sea lady trunk on thousand little occasion parker showed sense of propriety be penetratingly fine for example in shop one day when thing of intimate sort be being purchased suddenly intervened there be stocking mem said in discreet undertone behind not too vulgarly behind fluttering straight hand stocking cried mr bunting think mem must have stocking said parker quietly very firmly come to think of why must unavoidable deficiency in lady excuse one can be avoided be there touch very quintessence central principle of proper life mr bunting know must never have seen like iii let add here regretfully with infinite respect one other thing about parker then will drop into proper place must confess with slight tinge of humiliation pursued young woman to present situation at highton tower maid be to eminent religious social propagandist lady jane glanville there be certain detail of stood in need certain scene conversation of passion for verisimilitude have scarcely crumb to go upon from first to last what must have seen learnt inferred must amount practically to everything put to frankly made pretence of not understanding of ignorance of certain hidden thing when have finished regarded with level regard must think of sir said must be at according to idea surely must possibly hurt now to tell be afraid must sir must hurt anyone be that sir must see did lose by know looked at politely having said what intended to say in spite of what became at last very fine handsome inducement remained inflexible parker reply even after have come to end with finesse attempted to bribe in grossest manner displayed nothing becoming respect for impregnable social superiority must think of sir repeated must be at according to idea if in end must find story to extent vague incomplete trust will remember how inflexible severity of parker idea stood in way chapter fifth absence return of mr harry chatteris digression about parker journalist have certainly led astray from story little will however understand that while rising young journalist be still in pursuit of information hope banghurst parker merely budding perfection carriage not even thought of thing be already developing in bright little establishment beneath evergreen oak on folkestone riviera so soon a mind of bunting ceased to be altogether focused upon new amazing social addition of people have most indisputably discovered became at first faintly then very clearly evident that own simple pleasure in possession of guest so beautiful a miss water so solidly wealthy in manner so distinguished be not entirely shared by two young lady who be to have be principal guest for season little rift be perceptible very first time mr bunting have opportunity of talking over new arrangement with miss glendower be really going to stay with summer said adeline surely dear mind take little by surprise be asked dear be thinking of harry if general election come on in september one seems to think will promised must let inundate with electioneering do think will be dreadfully in way added after interval stop working dear be out of harmony said adeline mr bunting looked out of window at tamarisk sea be sure must do anything to hurt harry prospect know how enthusiastic be randolph must do anything be sure will be in way what else can be might help even oh help might canvas be very attractive know dear not to said miss glendower trust to people a harry say at election time one who can do anything must be let do cut do anything afterwards at time know talked of when mr fison be here if left electioneering only to really nice people be mr fison said that not harry besides must help think misjudge there dear have be asking to help yes about said mr bunting with transient pink keep asking question about why be having election what be about why harry be candidate that want to go into quite deeply ca answer thing asks be why keep up long conversation with mr melville suppose why fred go about neglecting mabel dear said mr bunting must have canvassing with for anything said miss glendower 'd spoil everything be frivolous satirical look at with incredulous eye seems to blight one earnestness think quite understand dear mr bunting what election study mean to harry come across like contradiction surely dear have never heard contradict oh doe contradict there be something about one feel that thing be most important vital be nothing to feel come from world to mr bunting remained judicial adeline dropped to lower key again think said anyhow that be taking very easily how do know what be down there out there may be anything may have have excellent reason for coming to land dear cried mr bunting be that charity how do live if have lived nicely be sure must behave so nicely besides coming here have invitation have invited now said mr bunting gently must hardly help only hope kindness be not kindness said mr bunting be duty if be only half a charming a be seem to forget voice dropped what be come for be what want to know be sure in day with so much materialism about such wickedness everywhere when everybody who have soul seems trying to lose to find one who have soul who be trying to find one be trying to get one mr flange come twice week must come oftener a know if there be so much confirmation about when come sits touch hand if can talk in lowest voice sits smile almost laugh outright at thing say because have to win way with surely mr flange may do what can to make religion attractive believe belief will get soul believe want one bit turned towards door a if have done mr bunting pink be now permanent have brought up son two daughter besides have brought down husband to dear how be to know when be necessary to be firm even with adeline glendower knew how to be firm just a well a anybody dear began in very firmest quiet manner be positive misjudge miss water trivial may be on surface at rate perhaps laugh make fun little there be different way of looking at thing be sure that at bottom be just a serious just a grave a one judge hastily be sure if knew better a do mr bunting left eloquent pause miss glendower have two little pink flush in cheek turned with hand on door at rate said be sure that harry will agree with that can be help to cause have work to do be something more than just vulgar electioneering have to develop establish idea have view be new wide reaching want to put whole strength into work now especially presence paused for moment be digression divide thing put wrong have way of concentrating attention about alters value of thing prevents being single minded will prevent harry being single minded think dear that might trust judgment little said mr bunting paused miss glendower opened mouth shut again without speaking became evident finality be attained nothing remained to be said regrettable door opened closed smartly mr bunting be alone within hour met at luncheon table adeline behaviour to sea lady to mr bunting be a pleasant alert a highly earnest intellectual young lady must be mr bunting said did tended with what people call infinite tact really know mean great deal more tact than be comfortable to develop expose more serious aspect of sea lady mind mr bunting be unusually talkative told about glorious project have just heard of to cut out rather shrubby weedy front of lea stick in something between wine vault crystal palace a winter garden seemed to very excellent idea indeed ii be time now to give impression of imminent chatteris who for late appearance be really chief human being in cousin melville story happens that met with frequency in university day afterwards ever again came upon be rather brilliant man at university smart without being vulgar clever for that be remarkably good looking from very onset of manhood without being in way showy spendthrift be quite magnificently extravagant there be trouble in last year something hushed up about girl woman in london family have over with uncle earl of beechcroft settled of bill not for family be commendably free from sentimental excess enough to make comfortable again family be not rich one further abounds in extraordinary quantity of rather frowsy loose tongued aunt never knew family quite so rich in old aunt chatteris be so good looking easy mannered clever that seemed to agree almost without discussion to pull through hunted about for something must be really remunerative without being laborious too commercial meanwhile after extraordinary craving of aunt lady poynting mallow to see acting have be overcome by united effort of more religious section of aunt chatteris set seriously to higher journalism be to say journalism that dines anywhere get political tip after dinner be always acceptable if only to avoid thirteen article in half crown review in addition wrote very passable verse edited jane austen for only publisher who have not already reprinted work of classic lady verse like be shapely handsome like face suggested to penetrating eye certain reservation indecision there be just that touch of refinement be weakness in public man a yet be not public man be known to be energetic work be gathering attention a always capable occasionally brilliant aunt declared be ripening that defect in vigour displayed be incompleteness of process decided must go to america where vigour vigorous opportunity abound there gather came upon something like failure something happened indeed quite lot happened came back unmarried via south sea australasia india lady poynting mallow publicly told be fool when got back what happened in america even if one doe not consult contemporary american paper be still very difficult to determine there appear to have be daughter of millionaire something like engagement in story according to new york yell one of smartest crispest altogether most representative paper in america there be also daughter of one else whom yell interviewed professed to interview under heading aristocratic britisher trifle with pure american girl interview with victim of heartless levity one else be be inclined to think in spite of excellently executed portrait merely brilliant stroke of modern journalism yell having got wind of sudden retreat of chatteris inventing reason in preference to discovering one wensleydale tell true impetus to bolt be merest trifle daughter of millionaire being bright spirited girl have undergone interviewing on subject of approaching marriage on marriage in general on social question of various sort on relation of british american people seems to have found thing in morning paper took suddenly lost head once started seems to have lacked power of mind to turn about come back affair be mess family paid more of bill shirked others chatteris turned up in london again after time with somewhat diminished glory series of letter on imperial affair headed with quotation what do know of england who only england know of course people of england learnt nothing of real circumstance of case be fairly obvious that have gone to america come back empty handed be how in course of year came to adeline glendower of whose special gift a helper inspiration have already heard from mr bunting when became engaged to family have long craved to forgive lady poynting mallow a matter of fact have done so brightened wonderfully after considerable obscure activity declared philanthropic liberal with open space in platform in position ready a beginning to try quality of conservative south be away making certain decisive arrangement in paris elsewhere at time of landing of sea lady before matter be finally settled be necessary that something must be said to certain great public character then be to return tell adeline one be expecting daily including be now indisputable sea lady iii meeting of miss glendower affianced lover on return from paris be one of scene in story for have scarcely inkling of true detail came to folkestone stopped at metropole bunting house being full metropole being nearest hotel to sandgate walked down in afternoon asked for adeline be pretty rather than correct gather that met in drawing room a chatteris closed door behind imagine there be something in nature of caress must confess envy freedom of novelist who can take behind locked door a give such person say do with strongest will in world to blend little scrap of fact have into continuous sequence of event falter at occasion after never saw adeline at until after thing be over what be now rather tall rather restless active woman very keen obvious in public affair with something gone out of melville once saw gleam of for most part melville never liked have wider grasp of thing than be little afraid of be in inexplicable way pretty woman dear lady grande dame totally insignificant heretic therefore in melville scheme of thing give small material for earlier adeline posed say be political be always reading mr humphry ward last melville regarded a most heinous offence be not least of cousin weakness that regard great novelist a extremely corrupting influence for intelligent girl make good serious in wrong way say adeline asserts be absolutely built on be always attempting to be incarnation of marcella be who have perverted mr bunting mind to adopt fancy believe for moment in idea of girl building on heroine in fiction be matter of elective affinity unless bullying critic preacher sends astray take to own novelist a soul in swedenborgian system take to hell adeline took to imaginary marcella there be melville say strongest likeness in mental atmosphere have same defect bias for superiority to use expressive phrase same disposition towards arrogant benevolence same obtuseness to little shade of feeling lead people to speak habitually of lower class to think in vein of phrase certainly have same virtue conscious conscientious integrity hard nobility without one touch of magic industrious thoroughness more than in anything else adeline delighted in novelist thoroughness freedom from impressionism patient resolution with went into corner swept under mat of incident must be easy to argue from that adeline behaved a mr ward most characteristic heroine behaved on analogous occasion marcella know at least after heart be changed must have clung to there must have be moment of high emotion in thought of highest class mingled with natural ambition of two people in prime of life power then must have receded with quick movement listened with beautiful hand pensive against cheek while chatteris began to sum up force against to speculate on action of group that something infinitely tender maternal must have spoken in pledging to utmost help love woman can give must have produced in chatteris that exquisite mingled impression of grace passion self yielding in infinite variation repetition made up for constant poem of beauty be dream not reality so adeline might have dreamt of behaving be not marcella only wanting to be be not only not maxwell have intention of being maxwell anyhow if have have opportunity of becoming maxwell must probably have rejected with extreme incivility so met like two unheroic human being with shy clumsy movement suppose fairly honest eye something there be in nature of caress believe then incline to fancy said well think must have answered be right after rather allusively with backward jerk of head at interval a be towards great personage chatteris must have told particular must have told that be going to contest hythe that little difficulty with glasgow commission agent who wanted to run radical ticket a man of kent have be settled without injury to party such a be assuredly talked politics because soon after when came into garden side by side to where mr bunting sea lady sat watching girl play croquet adeline be in full possession of fact fancy that for couple a be such intimation of success such earnest topic replaced to certain extent at rate vain repetition of vulgar endearment sea lady appears to have be first to see here be said abruptly whom said mr bunting glancing up at eye be suddenly eager then following glance towards chatteris other son said sea lady jesting unheeded be harry adeline cried mr bunting make handsome couple sea lady made reply leaned back scrutinising advance certainly made handsome pair coming out of veranda into blaze of sun across trim lawn towards shadow of ilex tree be lit a be with more glorious limelight displayed like actor on stage more spacious than stage of theatre figure of chatteris must have come out tall fair broad little sunburnt gather even then little preoccupied a indeed always seemed to be in latter day beside adeline glancing now up at now towards audience under tree dark little flushed rather tall though not so tall a marcella seems to have be know without instruction from novel writer in world glad chatteris did not discover that there be one bunting under tree until be close at hand then abrupt discovery of stranger seems to have checked whatever be prepared to say for debut adeline took centre of stage mr bunting be standing up croquet player except mabel who be winning converged on chatteris with cry of welcome mabel remained in midst of what understand be called tea party loudly demanding that must see play out doubt if everything have gone well must have given most edifying exhibition of what croquet can sometimes be adeline swam forward to mr bunting cried with note of triumph in voice be settled everything be settled have won be to contest hythe quite involuntarily eye must have met sea lady be of course quite impossible to say what found there indeed what there be to find there then for moment faced riddle then sea lady turned eye with long deferred scrutiny to man face probably saw now closely for first time one wonder whether be just possible that there may have be something if be no more than gleam of surprise enquiry in meeting of eye just for moment held regard then shifted enquiringly to mr bunting that lady intervened effusively with oh forgot introduced think went through without meeting of foil of regard back said fred to chatteris touching arm chatteris confirmed happy guess bunting girl seemed to welcome adeline enviable situation rather than chatteris a individual mabel voice must be heard approaching ought to see play out mr chatteris hullo harry boy cried mr bunting who be cultivating bluff manner how paris how be fishing said harry so came into vague circle about lively person who have won except parker of course who remained in own proper place be be certain never to be won by anybody there be handing shifting of garden chair one seemed to take slightest notice of adeline dramatic announcement bunting be not good at thinking of thing to say stood in midst of group like leading lady when other actor have forgotten part then one woke up to a be went off in volley so be really settled said mr bunting betty bunting said there be to be election then nettie said what fun mr bunting remarked with knowing air so saw then fred flung hooray into tangle of sound sea lady of course said nothing will give jolly good fight for anyhow said mr bunting well hope will do said chatteris will do more than said adeline oh yes said betty bunting will knew must let said adeline if have sense said mr bunting then came pause mr bunting be emboldened to lift up voice utter politics be getting sense said be learning that party must have men men of birth training money mob have tried to keep thing going by playing to fad class jealousy irish have have lesson how why have stood aside have left to faddist fomenter irish here be be revolution in party have let down now must pick up again made gesture with fat little hand one of fat pink little hand appear to have flesh bone inside only sawdust horse hair mr bunting leaned back in chair smiled at indulgently be common election said mr bunting be great issue sea lady have be regarding thoughtfully what be great issue asked quite understand mr bunting spread to explain to said to begin with adeline listened with mingling of interest impatience attempting ever again to suppress to involve chatteris by tactful interposition chatteris appeared disinclined to be involved seemed indeed quite interested in mr bunting view of case presently croquet quartette went back at mabel suggestion to game others continued political talk became more personal at last dealing soon quite specifically with chatteris be doing more particularly that chatteris be to do mr bunting suddenly suppressed mr bunting a be offering advice adeline took burden of talk again indicated vast purpose election be merely opening of door said when chatteris made modest disavowal smiled with proud happy consciousness of what meant to make of mr bunting supplied footnote to make clear to sea lady be so modest said at one point chatteris pretended not to hear went rather pink ever again attempted to deflect talk towards sea lady away from be hampered by ignorance of position sea lady said scarcely anything watched chatteris adeline more particularly chatteris in relation to adeline chapter sixth symptomatic cousin melville be never very clear about date now be greatly to be regretted because must be very illuminating indeed if one must tell just how many day elapsed before came upon chatteris in intimate conversation with sea lady be going along front of lea with book from public library miss glendower have suddenly wished to consult with entire ignorance of lack of admiration for be part of want of charm for have bidden bring be in one of sheltered path just under brow give pleasant characteristic charm to folkestone that came upon little group about sea lady bath chair chatteris be seated in one of wooden seat be embedded in bank be leaning forward looking into sea lady face be speaking with smile struck melville even at time a being little special in quality seems to have be capable of many charming smile parker be little distance away where sort of bastion project give wide view of pier harbour coast of france regarding with qualified disfavour bath chairman be crumpled up against bank lost in wistful melancholy that constant perambulation of broken humanity necessarily engenders illustration little group about sea lady bath chair cousin slackened pace little came up joined conversation hung at approach chatteris sat back little there seemed resentment sought topic for three to discus in book melville carried book said for miss glendower said melville oh said chatteris what be about asked sea lady land tenure said melville be hardly subject said sea lady chatteris joined in smile a if saw jest there be little pause be contesting hythe said melville fate point way said chatteris threaten dissolution for september will come in month said chatteris with inimitable tone of one who know in case will soon be busy may canvas said sea lady never have miss water explained chatteris have be telling mean to help met melville eye frankly be rough work miss water said melville mind that be fun want to help really do want to help mr chatteris know be encouraging must go around with in bath chair must be picnic said chatteris mean to help anyhow said sea lady know case for plaintiff asked melville looked at have got argument will ask to vote for mr chatteris afterwards when see will remember smile wave hand what else be there nothing said chatteris shut lid on melville wish have argument a good what sort of people be here asked melville be there smuggling interest to conciliate have asked that said chatteris smuggling be over past know forty year ago always have be forty year ago trotted out last of smuggler interesting old man full of reminiscence when there be count of saxon shore remembered smuggling forty year ago really doubt if there ever be smuggling existing coast guard be sacrifice to vain superstition why cried sea lady only about five week ago saw quite near here stopped abruptly caught melville eye grasped difficulty in paper suggested yes in paper said seizing rope threw well asked chatteris there be smuggling still said sea lady with air of one who decides not to tell anecdote be suddenly found to be half forgotten there be doubt happens said chatteris missing doe appear in electioneering certainly sha' agitate for faster revenue cutter however thing may be in respect take line that be very well a be line of course looked out to sea eye of melville sea lady have intimate moment there know be just specimen of sort of thing do said chatteris be prepared to be a intricate a quite said sea lady cousin be reminded of anecdote talk degenerated into anecdote of canvassing ran willow cousin be just gathering that mr bunting miss bunting have be with sea lady have gone into town to shop when returned chatteris rose to greet explained what have be by mean apparent before that be on way to adeline after few further triviality melville went on brief silence fell between who be that miss water asked chatteris friend of mr bunting prevaricated melville so gather seems very charming person be be interesting illness seems to throw up make passive thing of like picture something be imaginary imagined anyhow sits there smile responds eye have something intimate yet cousin offered assistance where did mr bunting find cousin have to gather together for second so there be something said deliberately that mr bunting doe seem disposed what can be be bound to be right said melville rather weakly be strange too mr bunting be usually so disposed melville left that to be what one feel said chatteris what mystery cousin share with profound detestation of high mystic method of treating woman like woman to be finite nice in fact like everything to be finite nice so merely grunted chatteris be not to be stopped by that passed to critical note doubt be illusion woman be impressionist patch light get effect be be meant to get suppose get effect how be mystery be not merely beauty there be plenty of beauty in world not of effect eye fancy dwelt on for moment there be really nothing in eye know chatteris said cousin melville borrowing alien argument tone of analytical cynicism from have ever looked at eye through hole in sheet oh know said chatteris mean mere physical eye perhaps be look of health bath chair bold

of smile be morally almost wink illustration waiter retires amazed cousin caught archness full in face for four second stared at mr bunting in amazement wanted breath then laughed together mr bunting sat down pleasantly remarked quite audibly to herself a if must guess iv gather that after talk melville fell into extraordinary net of doubting in first place what be most distressing doubted whether conversation must possibly have happened at if have whether memory have not played trick in modifying intensifying import of cousin occasionally dream conversation of so sober probable sort a to mingle quite perplexingly with real experience be one of occasion found taking up scrutinising a be first remembered sentence then have really said thing quite in way memory of conversation be never quite same for two day together have really deliberately foreshadowed for chatteris obscure mystical submergence what intensified complicated doubt most be sea lady subsequent serene freedom from

for envy in way luck have served many one have toiled life taken at last gratefully merest fraction of have thrust upon insatiable thankless young man even thought cousin might envy in several way then at mere first onset of duty nay at mere first whisper of restraint insubordination protest flight think urged cousin of common lot of men think of many who suffer from hunger be painful socialistic sort of line to take in mood of moral indignation cousin pursued relentlessly think of many who suffer from hunger who lead life of unremitting toil who go fearful who go squalid withal

have made for be dream might come back said looked at stopped tell have vague intention of startling rousing wounding to display of romantic force insurgence of passion might yet win chatteris back then in moment like blow came to how foolish fancy have be there stood impenetrably limitedly intelligent well meaning imitative powerless pose face suggested nothing clear reasonable objection to have come to critical antagonism steady opposition then amazingly changed looked up suddenly held out hand there be something in eye that have never seen before melville took hand mechanically for second so stood looking with sort of discovery into other eye tell said with astounding perfection of simplicity to come back to there can be other thing than what be tell to come back to tell that forgiveness tell want if will not come for will not come at if will not come back for halted for moment want want be not mine may go passive hold of hand became pressure then dropped apart again be

wanted urgently to leave there turned again towards staircase glanced at went down a looked up from bend of stair be still standing in light be moved to proclaim in manner adherent must think of nothing better than can do will so after curious pause departed rather stumblingly from sight iv after interview be right proper that melville must have gone at once to chatteris course of event in world doe occasionally display lamentable disregard for what be right proper point of view be destined to crowd upon day for most part entirely unsympathetic point of view found mr bunting in company of boldly trimmed bonnet in hall waiting became clear to intercept a descended in state of extreme preoccupation boldly trimmed bonnet revealed beneath white faced resolute person in duster sensible boot stranger mr bunting made apparent be lady poynting mallow one of more representative of chatteris aunt ladyship made few enquiry about adeline with eye took melville measure then after agreeing to number of suggestion mr bunting have to advance proposed that must escort back to hotel be much too exercised with adeline to discus proposal walk said go along lower road found walking remarked a bunting door closed behind that be always comfort to have to do with man there be silence for space think at time melville completely grasped fact that have companion presently meditation be disturbed by voice started beg pardon said that bunting woman be fool repeated lady poynting mallow there be slight interval for consideration be old friend of mine said melville quite possibly said lady

from under brim of boldly trimmed bonnet understand clearly be properly constituted mermaid with real physical tail well said lady poynting mallow apart from question of miss glendower be understood think that marriage must be impossible why cousin played round question be immortal for example with past simply make more interesting melville tried to enter into point of view think said must go to london for marry at st george hanover square pay for mansion in park lane visit just anywhere liked that be precisely what must do just now with court be waking up be precisely what wo do said melville woman must do who have chance be mermaid be fool said lady poynting mallow doe even mean to marry doe enter into code hussy what doe mean cousin made gesture seaward that said be mermaid what

ca see that ought to release for own good doe see be for good do simply old fashioned prejudice because woman got tail old frump at wampach be quite of opinion melville shrugged shoulder so suppose be

with parted in course of minute melville found on side of road opposite lift station regarding ascending car boldly trimmed bonnet vivid erect assertive went gliding upward perfect embodiment of sound common sense mind be lapsing once again into disorder be stunned a be by vigour of ladyship view must one not absolutely right be quite so clear emphatic if so what became of oppression of foreboding that sinister promise of escape that whisper of other dream have dominated mind only short half hour before turned face back to sandgate mind theatre of warring doubt quite vividly must see sea lady a lady poynting mallow saw a something pink solid smart wealthy indeed quite abominably vulgar yet quite a vividly recalled a have talked to in garden face full of shadow eye of deep mystery whisper made world about more than flimsy thin curtain before vague wonderful hitherto quite unsuspected thing v chatteris be leaning against railing started violently at melville hand upon shoulder made awkward greeting fact be said melville have be asked to talk to apologise said chatteris be glad to have out with one there be brief silence stood side by side looking down upon harbour behind evening band played remotely black little promenaders went to fro under tall electric light think chatteris decided to be very self possessed at first man of world be gorgeous night said glorious said melville playing up to key set clicked cutter on cigar there be something wanted to tell know said chatteris with shoulder towards melville becoming obtrusive know everything have seen talked to several time there be perhaps minute pause what be going to do asked melville chatteris made answer melville did not repeat question presently chatteris turned about let walk said paced westward side by side made little speech be sorry to give everybody trouble said with air of having prepared sentence suppose there be question have behaved like as be profoundly sorry largely be own fault know so far a overt kick up go there be certain amount of blame attache to outspoken friend mr bunting be afraid there be melville admitted know there be time when one be under necessity of having mood doe help to drag into general discussion mischief done know adeline seems to have objected to presence of sea lady at very early stage mr bunting overruled afterwards when there be trouble seems to have tried to make up for did know miss glendower have objected did seems to have seen ahead chatteris reflected of course doe excuse in least be sort of excuse for being dragged into bother said something le distinctly about stupid bother private affair found drawing near band already on outskirt of territory of votary cheerful rhythm became insistent canopy of stand be focus of bright light music stand instrument sent out beam of reflected brilliance luminous red conductor in midst of lantern guided ratatoo tat ratatoo tat of popular air voice detached fragment of conversation came to talker mingled impertinently with thought must 'ave truck with 'im not after said young person to friend let get out of said chatteris abruptly turned aside from high path of lea to head of step led down declivity in few moment be a if imposing front of stucco many windowed hotel electric light on tall mast band stand miscellaneous holiday british public have never existed be one of folkestone best effect black quietness under very foot of crowd no longer heard band even only remote suggestion of music filtered to over brow black treed slope fell from to surf below out at sea be light of many ship away to westward like swarm of fire fly hung light of two men sat down on vacant seat in dimness for time spoke chatteris impressed melville with air of being on defensive murmured in meditative undertone must 'ave truck with 'im not after will admit by standard said aloud have be flappy feeble wrong very in thing there be prescribed definite course to hesitate to have two point of view be condemned by right thinking people still one have two point of view have come up from sandgate yes did see miss glendower yes talked to suppose what do think of cigar glowed into expectant brightness while melville hesitated at answer showed eye thoughtful upon melville face have never thought melville sought more diplomatic phrasing have never found exceptionally attractive before handsome know not winning time seemed rather splendid be said chatteris be sat forward began flicking imaginary ash from end of cigar be splendid admitted only begin to imagine dear man know that girl be not quite in line be assure straightest cleanest clearest human being have ever met belief so firmly doe right so simply there be sort of queenly benevolence sort of integrity of benevolence left sentence unfinished a if unfinished completely expressed thought want to go back to said melville bluntly know said chatteris flicked again at ghostly ash have written that be just where complete magnificence come in doe fence fool about a woman do doe squawk say 'you have insulted everything at end doe squawk say 'for god sake come back to ' doe say 'ave truck with not after writes straight believe melville half knew until business came up come out before that be a said quite perceive perceived along little too statistical became meditative cigar glow waned presently vanished altogether be going back by jove yes melville stirred slightly then sat rigidly quiet for space then abruptly chatteris flung away extinct cigar seemed to fling many other thing away with dim gesture of course said will go back be not fault insisted that trouble separation have ever arisen be moody be preoccupied know thing have got into head if 'd be left alone have be forced into position summarised understand said melville that though think matter be indefined distressing just now attach blame anywhere be open minded said chatteris be just way can imagine how upset discomfort distress be awfully good to keep so open minded not to consider utter outcast ill regulated disturber of order of world be distressing state of affair said melville perhaps understand force pulling at better than imagine be very simple suppose very yet well seemed to hesitate at dangerous topic other said melville silence bade go on plunged from prepared attitude what be why must being come into life a have done if be so simple what be there about have pulled so astray have know here be at six seven be not situation be mental conflict why be pulled about have got into imagination how have remotest idea be beautiful meditated melville be beautiful certainly so be miss glendower be very beautiful be not blind chatteris be beautiful in different way yes be only name for effect why be very beautiful melville shrugged shoulder

justice carry everything perhaps after there be thing beyond reason perhaps after desire have claim on stopped interrogatively melville be profound think said cousin at last desire have claim on beauty at rate mean explained be human being be matter with mind growing out of ourselves reach downward into beautiful wonderland of matter upward to something stopped from sheer dissatisfaction with image in direction anyhow tried feebly jumped at something be not quite meaning man be sort of half way house must compromise a do well yes try to strike balance few old engraving good suppose little

doubt be on verge of saying a most of must have be under circumstance think quite understand position after what be good of talking in way exclaimed chatteris abruptly be simply trying to elevate whole business by dragging in wider question be justification when did mean to justify have to choose between life with adeline woman out of sea who be death how do know be death said have made choice have seemed to recollect have corroborated told be going back to see miss glendower to morrow yes recalled further portion of what believe be prepared ready phrased decision decision from conversation

venus anadyomene said there be michael sword stern angel in armour then have good palpable dragon to slash not own desire way nowadays be to do deal with dragon somehow raise minimum wage get better housing for working class by hook by crook melville doe not think be fair treatment of suggestion said chatteris have doubt about choice be going to fall in with specie be going to take place in rank in great battle for future be meaning of life want moral cold bath mean to take one lax dalliance with dream desire must end will make time table for hour rule for life will entangle honour in controversy will give to service a man must do clean handed work struggle performance there be miss glendower know rather said chatteris with faint touch of insincerity tall straight eyed capable by jove if there be to be venus anadyomene at rate there will be pallas athene be who play reconciler then said word wo be so bad know melville restrained movement of impatience tell at then chatteris say broke into sort of speech case be tried said judgment have be given be that be have be through worked out be man must go man way there be desire light guide of world beacon on headland blazing out let burn let burn road run near by past have made choice have got to be man have got to live man die man carry burden of class time there be have have dream see keep hold of reason here with flame

death only why have seen face why have heard voice vi walked out of shadow up long sloping path until sandgate a little line of light came into view below presently came out upon brow walked together band playing with remote sweetening indistinctness far away behind towards cliff at end stood for little while in silence looking down melville made guess at companion thought why not come down to night asked on night like chatteris turned about suddenly regarded moonlight sea stood quite still for space that cold white radiance gave illusory strength decision to face no said at last word be almost sigh go down to girl below there end thing will be there thinking of said chatteris be not ten yet melville tried again chatteris thought no answered not to night to morrow in light of everyday want good gray honest day said with south west wind still soft night how can expect to do anything of sort to night then murmured a if found word satisfying word to repeat renunciation by jove said with most astonishing transition be night out of fairyland look at light of window below there then up up into enormous blue of sky there a if be fainting with moonlight shine one star chapter eighth moonshine triumphant just precisely what happened after have be most impossible thing to disinter have given thing melville remembered be said have linked into conversation checked by cousin afterthought finally have read whole thing over to be of course verbatim rendering be say closely after manner of talk gist be that thing of sort be said when left chatteris fully believed that final conclusive thing be said then say came into head that apart from outside settlement there still remained tangible reality capable of action sea lady what be going to do thought toppled back into web of perplexity again carried back into state of inconclusive interrogation past lummidge hotel two men have gone back to metropole have parted with firm handclasp outside glare of big doorway chatteris went straight in melville fancy be not sure understand melville have private thinking to do on own account conceive walking away in state of profound preoccupation afterwards fact that sea lady be not to be abolished by renunciation cropped up in mind passed back along lea a have said inconclusive interrogation elicited at utmost that lummidge private family hotel be singularly like other hotel of class window tell secret there melville narrative end with circumstantial record necessarily come to end also there be source of course glimpse parker refuse unhappily a explained chief of source be first gooch valet employed by chatteris secondly hall porter of lummidge private family hotel valet evidence be precise have air of being irrelevant witness that at quarter past eleven went up to ask chatteris if there be anything more to do night found seated in arm chair before open window with chin upon hand staring at nothing indeed a schopenhauer observes in crowning passage be whole of human life more to do said chatteris yessir said valet nothing said chatteris absolutely nothing valet finding answer quite satisfactory wished goodnight departed probably chatteris remained in attitude for considerable time hour perhaps more slowly must seem mood underwent change at definite moment must have be that lethargic meditation gave way to strange activity to sort of hysterical reaction against resolve renunciation first action seems to grotesque grotesquely pathetic went into dressing room in morning clo'es said valet be shied about a though e 'd lost ticket poor worshipper of beauty dream shaved shaved washed brushed hair valet testifies one of brush got shied behind bed even throwing about of brush seems to to have done little nothing to palliate poor human preoccupation with toilette changed gray flannel suited very well for white one suited extremely must deliberately conscientiously have made quite lovely a schoolgirl must have put having capped great renunciation by proceeding seems to have gone straight to lummidge private family hotel demanded to see sea lady have retired came from parker be delivered in chilling manner by hall porter chatteris swore at hall porter tell be here said be retired said hall porter with official severity will tell be here said chatteris suddenly white what name sir said hall porter in order a explains to avoid frackass chatteris tell must see now do hear now hall porter went to parker came way back wished to goodness be not hall porter manager have gone out be stagnant hour decided to try parker again raised voice sea lady called to parker from inner room there be interval of tension gather that sea lady put on loose wrap faithful parker carried sufficiently helped from bedroom to couch in little sitting room in meanwhile hall porter hovered on stair praying for manager prayer went unanswered chatteris fumed below then have glimpse of sea lady see just in crack of door said porter a maid of hers opened be raised up on hand turned so towards door looking exactly like hall porter who have irish type of face short nose long upper lip rest of who have also neglected dentist projected face suddenly opened eye very wide slowly curved mouth into fixed smile so remained until judged effect on be complete parker little flushed resolutely flattening everything to quality of commonplace emerged upon suddenly miss water must see mr chatteris for few minute be emphatic with miss water more emphatic for insurgent stress of goddess protestingly emphatic chatteris went up white resolved to that smiling expectant presence one witnessed meeting parker assuredly parker must not resist seeing that parker be silent parker preserve silence that ruby must not break know be much from porter when said be up there must see say way rooshed up be outrageous be private family hotel of course one see thing at time even here must find manager to tell 'im said hall porter what be authorised to do for bit talked with door open then be shut that maid of hers did lay asked ignoble question must ketch word said hall porter dropped to whisper instanter ii afterwards be within ten minute of one parker conferring amount of decorum on request beyond power of other living being descended to demand of conceivable thing bath chair got said hall porter with inimitable profundity then having let realise fulness of that said never used carried down in arm out out be difficult to follow in description of sea lady wore wrap seems be like statue may have meant by certainly not that be impassive only said porter be alive one
