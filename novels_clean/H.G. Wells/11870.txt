for rest must trust judgment auctioneer good luck a taste may incline plant may be moribund dead may be just respectable purchase fair value for money perhaps for thing have happened again again there slowly unfolds before delighted eye of happy purchaser day after day new variety novel richness strange twist of labellum subtler colouration unexpected mimicry pride beauty profit blossom together on one delicate green spike may be even immortality for new miracle of nature may stand in need of new specific name what so convenient a of discoverer john smithia there have be worse name be perhaps hope of such happy discovery that made winter wedderburn frequent attendant at sale hope also maybe fact that have nothing else of slightest interest to do in world be shy lonely rather ineffectual man provided with just enough income to keep off spur of necessity not enough nervous energy to make seek exacting employment might have collected stamp coin translated horace bound book invented new specie of diatom a happened grew orchid have one ambitious little hothouse have fancy said over coffee that something be going to happen to to day spoke a moved thought slowly oh say said housekeeper who be also remote cousin for something happening be euphemism meant only one thing to misunderstand mean nothing unpleasantthough what do mean scarcely know to day continued after pause peter be going to sell batch of plant from andamans indie will go up see what have may be will buy something good unawares may be passed cup for second cupful of coffee be thing collected by poor young fellow told of other day asked cousin a filled cup yes said became meditative over piece of toast nothing ever doe happen to remarked presently beginning to think aloud wonder why thing enough happen to other people there be harvey only other week on monday picked up sixpence on wednesday chick have stagger on friday cousin came home from australia on saturday broke ankle what whirl of excitement compared to think must rather be without so much excitement said housekeeper ca be good for suppose be troublesome still see nothing ever happens to when be little boy never have accident never fell in love a grew up never married wonder how feel to have something happen to something really remarkable that orchid collector be only thirty six twenty year younger than when died have be married twice divorced once have have malarial fever four time once broke thigh killed malay once once be wounded by poisoned dart in end be killed by jungle leech must have be very troublesome then must have be very interesting know except perhaps leech be sure be not good for said lady with conviction perhaps not then wedderburn looked at watch twenty three minute past eight be going up by quarter to twelve train so that there be plenty of time think will wear alpaca jacket be quite warm enough grey felt hat brown shoe suppose glanced out of window at serene sky sunlit garden then nervously at cousin face think have better take umbrella if be going to london said in voice admitted of denial there be between here station coming back when returned be in state of mild excitement have made purchase be rare that must make up mind quickly enough to buy time have done so there be vanda said dendrobe palaeonophis surveyed purchase lovingly a consumed soup be laid out on spotless tablecloth before be telling cousin about a slowly meandered through dinner be custom to live visit to london over again in evening for own entertainment knew something must happen to day have bought of of feel sure do know that of will be remarkable know how be feel just a sure a if one have told that of will turn out remarkable that one pointed to shrivelled rhizome be not identified may be palaeonophis may not may be new specie even new genus be last that poor batten ever collected like look of said housekeeper be such ugly shape to scarcely seems to have shape like thing stick out said housekeeper will be put away in pot to morrow look said housekeeper like spider shamming dead wedderburn smiled surveyed root with head on one side be certainly not pretty lump of stuff can never judge of thing from dry appearance may turn out to be very beautiful orchid indeed how busy will be to morrow must see to night just exactly what to do with thing to morrow will set to work found poor batten lying dead dying in mangrove swamp forget began again presently with one of very orchid crushed up under body have be unwell for day with kind of native fever suppose fainted mangrove swamp be very unwholesome drop of blood say be taken out of by jungle leech may be very plant that cost life to obtain think none better of for men must work though woman may weep said wedderburn with profound gravity fancy dying away from comfort in nasty swamp fancy being ill of fever with nothing to take chlorodyne quinine if men be left to must live on chlorodyne quinine one round horrible native say andaman islander be most disgusting wretch anyhow can scarcely make good nurse not having necessary training just for people in england to have orchid suppose be comfortable men seem to enjoy kind of thing said wedderburn anyhow native of party be sufficiently civilised to take care of collection until colleague who be ornithologist came back again from interior though must not tell specie of orchid have let wither make thing more interesting make disgusting must be afraid of of malaria clinging to just think there have be dead body lying across ugly thing never thought of before there declare can not eat mouthful of dinner will take off table if like put in window seat can see just a well there next few day be indeed singularly busy in steamy little hothouse fussing about with charcoal lump of teak moss other mystery of orchid cultivator considered be having wonderfully eventful time in evening must talk about new orchid to friend over over again reverted to expectation of something strange several of vanda dendrobium died under care presently strange orchid began to show sign of life be delighted took housekeeper right away from jam making to see at once directly made discovery be bud said presently there will be lot of leaf there little thing coming out here be aerial rootlet look to like little white finger poking out of brown said housekeeper like why not know look like finger trying to get at ca help like dislike know for certain think there be orchid know have aerial rootlet quite like that may be fancy of course see be little flattened at end like said housekeeper suddenly shivering turning away know be very silly of be very sorry particularly a like thing so much ca help thinking of corpse may not be that particular plant be merely guess of mine housekeeper shrugged shoulder anyhow like said wedderburn felt little hurt at dislike to plant did not prevent talking to about orchid generally orchid in particular whenever felt inclined there be such queer thing about orchid said one day such possibility of surprise know darwin studied fertilisation showed that whole structure of ordinary orchid flower be contrived in order that moth might carry pollen from plant to plant well seems that there be lot of orchid known flower of can not possibly be used for fertilisation in way of cypripedium for instance there be insect known that can possibly fertilise of have never be found with seed how do form new plant by runner tuber kind of outgrowth be easily explained puzzle be be flower for very likely added orchid may be something extraordinary in way if so will study have often thought of making research a darwin did hitherto have not found time something else have happened to prevent leaf be beginning to unfold now do wish must come see said that orchid house be so hot gave headache have seen plant once again aerial rootlet be now of more than foot long have unfortunately reminded her of tentacle reaching out after something got into dream growing after with incredible rapidity so that have settled to entire satisfaction that must not see plant again wedderburn have to admire leaf alone be of ordinary broad form deep glossy green with splash dot of deep red towards base knew of other leaf quite like plant be placed on low bench near thermometer close by be simple arrangement by tap dripped on hot water pipe kept air steamy spent afternoon now with regularity meditating on approaching flowering of strange plant at last great thing happened directly entered little glass house knew that spike have burst out although great paloeonophis lowii hid corner where new darling stood there be new odour in air rich intensely sweet scent overpowered other in crowded steaming little greenhouse directly noticed hurried down to strange orchid behold trailing green spike bore now three great splash of blossom from overpowering sweetness proceeded stopped before in ecstasy of admiration flower be white with streak of golden orange upon petal heavy labellum be coiled into intricate projection wonderful bluish purple mingled there with gold must see at once that genus be altogether new one insufferable scent how hot place be blossom swam before eye must see if temperature be right made step towards thermometer suddenly everything appeared unsteady brick on floor be dancing up down then white blossom green leaf behind whole greenhouse seemed to sweep sideways then in curve upward at half past four cousin made tea according to invariable custom wedderburn did not come in for tea be worshipping that horrid orchid told waited ten minute watch must have stopped will go call went straight to hothouse opening door called name there be reply noticed that air be very close loaded with intense perfume then saw something lying on brick between hot water pipe for minute perhaps stood motionless be lying face upward at foot of strange orchid tentacle like aerial rootlet no longer swayed freely in air be crowded together tangle of grey rope stretched tight with end closely applied to chin neck hand did not understand then saw from under one of exultant tentacle upon cheek there trickled little thread of blood with inarticulate cry ran towards tried to pull away from leech like sucker snapped two of tentacle sap dripped red then overpowering scent of blossom began to make head reel how clung to tore at tough rope white inflorescence swam about felt be fainting knew must not left hastily opened nearest door after have panted for moment in fresh air have brilliant inspiration caught up flower pot smashed in window at end of greenhouse then re entered tugged now with renewed strength at wedderburn motionless body brought strange orchid crashing to floor still clung with grimmest tenacity to victim in frenzy lugged into open air then thought of tearing through sucker rootlet one by one in minute have released be dragging away from horror be white bleeding from dozen circular patch odd job man be coming up garden amazed at smashing of glass saw emerge hauling inanimate body with red stained hand for moment thought impossible thing bring water cried voice dispelled fancy when with unnatural alacrity returned with water found weeping with excitement with wedderburn head upon knee wiping blood from face what be matter said wedderburn opening eye feebly closing again at once go tell annie to come out here to then go for dr haddon at once said to odd job man so soon a brought water added seeing hesitated will tell about when come back presently wedderburn opened eye again seeing that be troubled by puzzle of position explained to fainted in hothouse orchid will see to said wedderburn have lost good deal of blood beyond that have suffered no very great injury gave brandy mixed with pink extract of meat carried upstairs to bed housekeeper told incredible story in fragment to dr haddon come to orchid house see said cold outer air be blowing in through open door sickly perfume be almost dispelled most of torn aerial rootlet lay already withered amidst number of dark stain upon brick stem of inflorescence be broken by fall of plant flower be growing limp brown at edge of petal doctor stooped towards then saw that one of aerial rootlet still stirred feebly hesitated next morning strange orchid still lay there black now putrescent door banged intermittently in morning breeze array of wedderburn orchid be shrivelled prostrate wedderburn be bright garrulous upstairs in glory of strange adventure v in avu observatory observatory at avu in borneo stand on spur of mountain to north rise old crater black at night against unfathomable blue of sky from little circular building with mushroom dome slope plunge steeply downward into black mystery of tropical forest beneath little house in observer assistant live be about fifty yard from observatory beyond be hut of native attendant thaddy chief observer be down with slight fever assistant woodhouse paused for moment in silent contemplation of tropical night before commencing solitary vigil night be very still now then voice laughter came from native hut cry of strange animal be heard from midst of mystery of forest nocturnal insect appeared in ghostly fashion out of darkness fluttered round light thought perhaps of possibility of discovery still lay in black tangle beneath for to naturalist virgin forest of borneo be still wonderland full of strange question half suspected discovery woodhouse carried small lantern in hand yellow glow contrasted vividly with infinite series of tint between lavender blue black in landscape be painted hand face be smeared with ointment against attack of mosquito even in day of celestial photography work done in purely temporary erection with only most primitive appliance in addition to telescope still involves very large amount of cramped motionless watching sighed a thought of physical fatigue before stretched entered observatory reader be probably familiar with structure of ordinary astronomical observatory building be usually cylindrical in shape with very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from interior telescope be supported upon stone pillar in centre clockwork arrangement compensates for earth rotation allows star once found to be continuously observed besides there be compact tracery of wheel screw about point of support by astronomer adjusts there be of course slit in movable roof follows eye of telescope in survey of heaven observer sits lie on sloping wooden arrangement can wheel to part of observatory a position of telescope may require within be advisable to have thing a dark a possible in order to enhance brilliance of star observed lantern flared a woodhouse entered circular den general darkness fled into black shadow behind big machine from presently seemed to creep back over whole place again a light waned slit be profound transparent blue in six star shone with tropical brilliance light lay pallid gleam along black tube of instrument woodhouse shifted roof then proceeding to telescope turned first one wheel then great cylinder slowly swinging into new position then glanced through finder little companion telescope moved roof little more made further adjustment set clockwork in motion took off jacket for night be very hot pushed into position uncomfortable seat to be condemned for next four hour then with sigh resigned to watch upon mystery of space there be sound now in observatory lantern waned steadily outside there be occasional cry of animal in alarm pain calling to mate intermittent sound of malay dyak servant presently one of men began queer chanting song in others joined at interval after must seem that turned in for night for further sound came from direction whispering stillness became more more profound clockwork ticked steadily shrill hum of mosquito explored place grew shriller in indignation at woodhouse ointment then lantern went out observatory be black woodhouse shifted position presently when slow movement of telescope have carried beyond limit of comfort be watching little group of star in milky way in one of chief have seen fancied remarkable colour variability be not part of regular work for establishment existed for reason perhaps woodhouse be deeply interested must have forgotten thing terrestrial attention be concentrated upon great blue circle of telescope field circle powdered so seemed with innumerable multitude of star luminous against blackness of setting a watched seemed to to become incorporeal a if too be floating in ether of space infinitely remote be faint red spot be observing suddenly star be blotted out flash of blackness passed be visible again queer said woodhouse must have be bird thing happened again immediately after great tube shivered a though have be struck then dome of observatory resounded with series of thundering blow star seemed to sweep aside a telescope have be unclamped swung round away from slit in roof great scott cried woodhouse what be huge vague black shape with flapping something like wing seemed to be struggling in aperture of roof in moment slit be clear again luminous haze of milky way shone warm bright interior of roof be perfectly black only scraping sound marked whereabouts of unknown creature woodhouse have scrambled from seat to foot be trembling violently in perspiration with suddenness of occurrence be thing whatever be inside out be big whatever else might be something shot across skylight telescope swayed started violently put arm up be in observatory then with be clinging to roof apparently what devil be must see stood for perhaps minute in state of stupefaction beast whatever be clawed at interior of dome then something flapped almost into face saw momentary gleam of starlight on skin like oiled water bottle be knocked off little table with smash sense of strange bird creature hovering few yard from face in darkness be indescribably unpleasant to woodhouse a thought returned concluded that must be night bird large bat at risk must see what be pulling match from pocket tried to strike on telescope seat there be smoking streak of phosphorescent light match flared for moment saw vast wing sweeping towards gleam of grey brown fur then be struck in face match knocked out of hand blow be aimed at temple claw tore sideways down to cheek reeled fell heard extinguished lantern smash blow followed a fell be partly stunned felt own warm blood stream out upon face instinctively felt eye have be struck at turning over on face to save tried to crawl under protection of telescope be struck again upon back heard jacket rip then thing hit roof of observatory edged a far a must between wooden seat eyepiece of instrument turned body round so that be chiefly foot be exposed with must at least kick be still in mystified state strange beast banged about in darkness presently clung to telescope making sway gear rattle once flapped near kicked out madly felt soft body with foot be horribly scared now must be big thing to swing telescope like that saw for moment outline of head black against starlight with sharply pointed upstanding ear crest between seemed to to be a big a mastiff then began to bawl out a loudly a must for help at that thing came down upon again a did so hand touched something beside on floor kicked out next moment ankle be gripped held by row of keen teeth yelled again tried to free leg by kicking with other then realised have broken water bottle at hand snatching struggled into sitting posture feeling in darkness towards foot gripped velvety ear like ear of big cat have seized water bottle by neck brought down with shivering crash upon head of strange beast repeated blow then stabbed jabbed with jagged end of in darkness where judged face might be small teeth relaxed hold at once woodhouse pulled leg free kicked hard felt sickening feel of fur bone giving under boot there be tearing bite at arm struck over at face a judged hit damp fur there be pause then heard sound of claw dragging of heavy body away from over observatory floor then there be silence broken only by own sobbing breathing sound like licking everything be black except parallelogram of blue skylight with luminous dust of star against end of telescope now appeared in silhouette waited a seemed interminable time be thing coming on again felt in trouser pocket for match found one remaining tried to strike floor be wet spat went out cursed must not see where door be situated in struggle have quite lost bearing strange beast disturbed by splutter of match began to move again time called woodhouse with sudden gleam of mirth thing be not coming at again must have hurt thought with broken bottle felt dull pain in ankle probably be bleeding there wondered if must support if tried to stand up night outside be very still there be sound of one moving sleepy fool have not heard wing battering upon dome shout be good wasting strength in shouting monster flapped wing startled into defensive attitude hit elbow against seat fell over with crash cursed then cursed darkness suddenly oblong patch of starlight seemed to sway to fro be going to faint must never do to faint clenched fist set teeth to hold together where have door got to occurred to must get bearing by star visible through skylight patch of star saw be in sagittarius south eastward door be north be north by west tried to think if must get door open might retreat might be thing be wounded suspense be beastly look here said if come on will come at then thing began clambering up side of observatory saw black outline gradually blot out skylight be in retreat forgot about door watched a dome shifted creaked somehow did not feel very frightened excited now felt curious sinking sensation inside sharply defined patch of light with black form moving across seemed to be growing smaller smaller be curious began to feel very thirsty yet did not feel inclined to get anything to drink seemed to be sliding down long funnel felt burning sensation in throat then perceived be broad daylight that one of dyak servant be looking at with curious expression then there be top of thaddy face upside down funny fellow thaddy to go about like then grasped situation better perceived that head be on thaddy knee thaddy be giving brandy then saw eyepiece of telescope with lot of red smear on began to remember have made observatory in pretty mess said thaddy dyak boy be beating up egg in brandy woodhouse took sat up felt sharp twinge of pain ankle be tied up so be arm side of face smashed glass red stained lay about floor telescope seat be overturned by opposite wall be dark pool door be open saw grey summit of mountain against brilliant background of blue sky pah said woodhouse who be be killing calf here take out of then remembered thing fight have have with be said to thaddy thing fought with know best said thaddy anyhow worry now about have more to drink thaddy however be curious enough be hard struggle between duty inclination to keep woodhouse quiet until be decently put away in bed have slept upon copious dose of meat extract thaddy considered advisable then talked over together be said woodhouse more like big bat than anything else in world have sharp short ear soft fur wing be leathery teeth be little devilish sharp jaw must not have be very strong else must have bitten through ankle have pretty nearly said thaddy seemed to to hit out with claw pretty freely be about a much a know about beast conversation be intimate so to speak yet not confidential dyak chap talk about big colugo klang utang may be doe not often attack man suppose made nervous say there be big colugo little colugo something else that sound like gobble fly about at night for own part know there be flying fox flying lemur about here be none of very big beast there be more thing in heaven earth said woodhouse thaddy groaned at quotation more particularly in forest of borneo than be dreamt of in philosophy on whole if borneo fauna be going to disgorge more of novelty upon must prefer that did so when be not occupied in observatory at night alone vi aepyornis island man with scarred face leant over table looked at bundle orchid asked few said cypripedium said chiefly said anything new thought not did island twenty five twenty seven year ago if find anything new here well be brand new did leave much be not collector said be young then went on lord how used to fly round seemed to take measure be in east indie two year in brazil seven then went to madagascar know few explorer by name said anticipating yarn whom did collect for dawson wonder if have heard name of butcher ever butcher butcher name seemed vaguely present in memory then recalled butcher v dawson why said be man who sued for four year salary got cast away on desert island servant said man with scar bowing funny case be here be making little fortune on island doing nothing for quite unable to give notice often used to amuse thinking over while be there did calculation of big over blessed atoll in ornamental figuring how did happen said rightly remember case well have heard of aepyornis rather andrew be telling of new specie be working on only month so ago just before sailed have got thigh bone seems nearly yard long monster thing must have be believe said man with scar be monster sindbad roc be just legend of 'em when did find bone three four year ago fancy why why because found lord be nearly twenty year ago if dawson have be silly about salary might have made perfect ring in 'em must help infernal boat going adrift paused suppose be same place kind of swamp about ninety mile north of antananarivo do happen to know have to go to along coast by boat happen to remember perhaps fancy andrew said something about swamp must be same be on east coast somehow there be something in water keep thing from decaying like creosote smell reminded of trinidad did get more egg of egg found be foot half long swamp go circling round know cut off bit be mostly salt too well what time have of found thing quite by accident went for egg two native chap in one of rum canoe tied together found bone at same time have tent provision for four day pitched on one of firmer place to think of brings that odd tarry smell back even now be funny work go probing into mud with iron rod know usually egg get smashed wonder how long be since aepyornis really lived missionary say native have legend about when be alive never heard such story certainly egg got be a fresh a if have be new laid fresh carrying down to boat one of nigger chap dropped one on rock smashed how lammed into beggar sweet be a if be new laid not even smelly mother dead four hundred year perhaps said centipede have bit however be getting off straight with story have taken day to dig into slush get egg out unbroken be covered with beastly black mud naturally be cross so far a knew be only egg have ever be got out not even cracked went afterwards to see one have at natural history museum in london of be cracked just stuck together like mosaic bit missing mine be perfect meant to blow when got back naturally be annoyed at silly duffer dropping three hour work just on account of centipede hit about rather footnote european be known to have seen live aepyornis with doubtful exception of macandrew who visited madagascar in hgw man with scar took out clay pipe placed pouch before filled up absent mindedly how about others did get home remember be queer part of story have three others perfectly fresh egg well put in boat then went up to tent to make coffee leaving two heathen down by beach one fooling about with sting other helping never occurred to that beggar must take advantage of peculiar position be in to pick quarrel suppose centipede poison kicking have given have upset one be always cantankerous sort persuaded other remember be sitting smoking boiling up water over spirit lamp business used to take on expedition incidentally be admiring swamp under sunset black blood red be in streak beautiful sight up beyond land rose grey hazy to hill sky behind red like furnace mouth fifty yard behind back of be blessed heathen quite regardless of tranquil air of thing plotting to cut off with boat leave alone with three day provision canvas tent nothing to drink whatsoever beyond little keg of water heard kind of yelp behind there be in canoe affair be properly boat perhaps twenty yard from land realised what be up in moment gun be in tent besides have bullet only duck shot knew that have little revolver in pocket pulled out a ran down to beach back ' say flourishing jabbered something at man broke egg jeered aimed at other because be unwounded have paddle missed laughed however be beat knew have to keep cool tried again made jump with whang of did laugh time third time got head over went paddle with be precious lucky shot for revolver reckon be fifty yard went right under know if be shot simply stunned drowned then began to shout to other chap to come back huddled up in canoe refused to answer so fired out revolver at never got near felt precious fool can tell there be on rotten black beach flat swamp behind flat sea cold after sun set just black canoe drifting steadily out to sea tell damned dawson jamrach museum rest of just to right bawled to nigger to come back until voice went up into scream there be nothing for to swim after take luck with shark so opened clasp knife put in mouth took off clothes waded in a soon a be in water lost sight of canoe aimed a judged to head off hoped man in be too bad to navigate that must keep on drifting in same direction presently came up over horizon again to south westward about afterglow of sunset be well over now dim of night creeping up star be coming through blue swum like champion though leg arm be soon aching however came up to by time star be fairly out a got darker began to see manner of glowing thing in water phosphorescence know at time made giddy hardly knew be star be phosphorescence whether be swimming on head heel canoe be a black a sin ripple under bow like liquid fire be naturally chary of clambering up into be anxious to see what be up to first seemed to be lying cuddled up in lump in bow stern be out of water thing kept turning round slowly a drifted kind of waltzing know went to stern pulled down expecting to wake up then began to clamber in with knife in hand ready for rush never stirred so there sat in stern of little canoe drifting away over calm phosphorescent sea with host of star above waiting for something to happen after long time called by name never answered be too tired to take risk by going along to so sat there fancy dozed once twice when dawn came saw be a dead a doornail puffed up purple three egg bone be lying in middle of canoe keg of water coffee biscuit wrapped in cape argus by foot tin of methylated spirit underneath there be paddle in fact anything except spirit tin must use a one so settled to drift until be picked up held inquest on brought in verdict against snake scorpion centipede unknown sent overboard after have drink of water few biscuit took look round suppose man low down a be see very far leastways madagascar be clean out of sight trace of land at saw sail going south westward looked like schooner hull never came up presently sun got high in sky began to beat down upon lord pretty near made brain boil tried dipping head in sea after while eye fell on cape argus lay down flat in canoe spread over wonderful thing newspaper never read one through thoroughly before be odd what get up to when be alone a be suppose read blessed old cape argus twenty time pitch in canoe simply reeked with heat rose up into big blister drifted ten day said man with scar be little thing in telling be day be like last except in morning evening never kept look out even blaze be so infernal did see sail after first three day saw took notice of about sixth night ship went by scarcely mile away from with light ablaze port open looking like big firefly there be music aboard stood up shouted screamed at second day broached one of aepyornis egg scraped shell away at end bit by bit tried be glad to find be good enough to eat bit flavoury not bad mean with something of taste of duck egg there be kind of circular patch about six inch across on one side of yoke with streak of blood white mark like ladder in thought queer did not understand what meant at time be inclined to be particular egg lasted three day with biscuit drink of water chewed coffee berry too invigorating stuff second egg opened about eighth day scared man with scar paused yes said developing daresay find hard to believe did with thing before there egg have be sunk in cold black mud perhaps three hundred year there be mistaking there be what be embryo with big head curved back heart beating under throat yolk shrivelled up great membrane spreading inside of shell over yolk here be hatching out egg of biggest of extinct bird in little canoe in midst of indian ocean if old dawson have known that be worth four year salary what do think however have to eat precious thing up bit of before sighted reef of mouthful be beastly unpleasant left third one alone held up to light shell be too thick for to get notion of what might be happening inside though fancied heard blood pulsing might have be rustle in own ear like what listen to in seashell then came atoll came out of sunrise a be suddenly close up to drifted straight towards until be about mile from shore not more then current took turn have to paddle a hard a must with hand bit of aepyornis shell to make place however got there be just common atoll about four mile round with few tree growing spring in one place lagoon full of parrot fish took egg ashore put in good place well above tide line in sun to give chance must pulled canoe up safe loafed about prospecting be rum how dull atoll be a soon a have found spring interest seemed to vanish when be kid thought nothing must be finer more adventurous than robinson crusoe business place be a monotonous a book of sermon went round finding eatable thing generally thinking tell be bored to death before first day be out show luck very day landed weather changed thunderstorm went by to north flicked wing over island in night there came drencher howling wind slap over must have taken much know to upset canoe be sleeping under canoe egg be luckily among sand higher up beach first thing remember be sound like hundred pebble hitting boat at once rush of water over body 'd be dreaming of antananarivo sat up holloaed to intoshi to ask what devil be up clawed out at chair where match used to be then remembered where be there be phosphorescent wave rolling up a if meant to eat rest of night a black a pitch air be simply yelling cloud seemed down on head almost rain fell a if heaven be sinking be baling out water above firmament one great roller came writhing at like fiery serpent bolted then thought of canoe ran down to a water went hissing back again thing have gone wondered about egg then felt way to be right well out of reach of maddest wave so sat down beside cuddled for company lord what night be storm be over before morning there be rag of cloud left in sky when dawn came along beach there be bit of plank scattered be disarticulated skeleton so to speak of canoe however gave something to do for taking advantage of two of tree being together rigged up kind of storm shelter with vestige day egg hatched hatched sir when head be pillowed on be asleep heard whack felt jar sat up there be end of egg pecked out rum little brown head looking out at 'lord said be welcome with little difficulty came out be nice friendly little chap at first about size of small hen very much like most other young bird only bigger plumage be dirty brown to begin with with sort of grey scab fell off very soon scarcely feather kind of downy hair can hardly express how pleased be to see tell robinson crusoe make near enough of loneliness here be interesting company looked at winked eye from front backwards like hen gave chirp began to peck about at once a though being hatched three hundred year too late be just nothing 'glad to see man friday say for have naturally settled be to be called man friday if ever be hatched a soon a ever found egg in canoe have developed be bit anxious about feed so gave lump of raw parrot fish at once took opened beak for more be glad of for under circumstance if 'd be at fanciful must have have to eat after 'd be surprised what interesting bird aepyornis chick be followed about from very beginning used to stand by watch while fished in lagoon go share in anything caught be sensible too there be nasty green warty thing like pickled gherkin used to lie about on beach tried one of upset never even looked at of again grew must almost see grow a be never much of society man quiet friendly way suited to t for nearly two year be a happy a must be on island have business worry for knew salary be mounting up at dawson must see sail now then nothing ever came near amused too by decorating island with design worked in sea urchin fancy shell of various kind put aepyornis island round place very nearly in big letter like what see done with coloured stone at railway station in old country mathematical calculation drawing of various sort used to lie watching blessed bird stalking round growing growing think how must make living out of by showing about if ever got taken off after first moult began to get handsome with crest blue wattle lot of green feather at behind of then used to puzzle whether dawson have right to claim not stormy weather in rainy season lay snug under shelter have made out of old canoe used to tell lie about friend at home after storm must go round island together to see if there be drift be kind of idyll might say if only have have tobacco must have be simply just like heaven be about end of second year little paradise went wrong friday be then about fourteen foot high to bill of with big broad head like end of pickaxe two huge brown eye with yellow rim set together like man not out of sight of other like hen plumage be fine none of half mourning style of ostrich more like cassowary a far a colour texture go then be began to cock comb at give air show sign of nasty temper at last came time when fishing have be rather unlucky began to hang about in queer meditative way thought might have be eating sea cucumber something be really just discontent on part be hungry too when at last landed fish wanted for temper be short that morning on side pecked at grabbed gave whack on head to make leave go at that went for lord gave in face man indicated scar then kicked be like carthorse got up seeing have finished started off full tilt with arm doubled up over face ran on gawky leg of faster than racehorse kept landing out at with sledgehammer kick bringing pickaxe down on back of head made for lagoon went in up to neck stopped at water for hated getting foot wet began to make shindy something like peacock only hoarser started strutting up down beach will admit felt small to see blessed fossil lording there head face be bleeding well body just one jelly of bruise decided to swim across lagoon leave alone for bit until affair blew over shinned up tallest palm tree sat there thinking of suppose ever felt so hurt by anything before since be brutal ingratitude of creature 'd be more than brother to 'd hatched educated great gawky out of date bird human being heir of age thought after time 'd begin to see thing in light feel little sorry for behaviour thought if be to catch nice little bit of fish perhaps go to presently in casual kind of way offer to might do sensible thing took time to learn how unforgiving cantankerous extinct bird can be malice wo tell little device tried to get bird round again simply ca make cheek burn with shame even now to think of snub buffet have from infernal curiosity tried violence chucked lump of coral at from safe distance only swallowed shied open knife at almost lost though be too big for to swallow tried starving out struck fishing took to picking along beach at low water after worm rubbed along on that time spent up to neck in lagoon rest up palm tree one of be scarcely high enough when caught up have regular bank holiday with calf of leg got unbearable know if have ever tried sleeping up palm tree gave most horrible nightmare think of shame of too here be extinct animal mooning about island like sulky duke not allowed to rest sole of foot on place used to cry with weariness vexation told straight that did mean to be chased about desert island by damned anachronism told to go peck navigator of own age only snapped beak at great ugly bird leg neck must like to say how long went on altogether 'd have killed sooner if 'd known how however hit on way of settling at last be south american dodge joined fishing line together with stem of seaweed thing made stoutish string perhaps twelve yard in length more fastened two lump of coral rock to end of took time to do because now then have to go into lagoon up tree a fancy took whirled rapidly round head then let go at first time missed next time string caught leg beautifully wrapped round again again over went threw standing waist deep in lagoon a soon a went down be out of water sawing at neck with knife like to think of even now felt like murderer while did though anger be hot against when stood over saw bleeding on white sand beautiful great leg neck writhing in last agony pah with tragedy loneliness came upon like curse good lord ca imagine how missed that bird sat by corpse sorrowed over shivered a looked round desolate silent reef thought of what jolly little bird have be when be hatched of thousand pleasant trick have played before went wrong thought if 'd only wounded might have nursed round into better understanding if 'd have mean of digging into coral rock 'd have buried felt exactly a if be human a be must think of eating so put in lagoon little fish picked clean did even save feather then one day chap cruising about in yacht have fancy to see if atoll still existed did come moment too soon for be about sick enough of desolation of only hesitating whether must walk out into sea finish up business way fall back on green thing sold bone to man named winslow dealer near british museum say sold to old havers seems havers did understand be extra large be only after death attracted attention called aepyornis what be aepyornis vastus said be funny very thing be mentioned to by friend of mine when found aepyornis with thigh yard long thought have reached top of scale called aepyornis maximus then one turned up thigh bone four foot six more that called aepyornis titan then vastus be found after old havers died in collection then vastissimus turned up winslow be telling a much said man with scar if get more aepyornis reckons scientific swell will go burst blood vessel be queer thing to happen to man be altogether vii remarkable case of davidson eye transitory mental aberration of sidney davidson remarkable enough in be still more remarkable if wade explanation be to be credited set one dreaming of oddest possibility of intercommunication in future of spending intercalary five minute on other side of world being watched in most secret operation by unsuspected eye happened that be immediate witness of davidson seizure so fall naturally to to put story upon paper when say be immediate witness of seizure mean be first on scene thing happened at harlow technical college just beyond highgate archway be alone in larger laboratory when thing happened be in smaller room where balance be writing up note thunderstorm have completely upset work of course be just after one of louder peal thought heard glass smash in other room stopped writing turned round to listen for moment heard nothing hail be playing devil tattoo on corrugated zinc of roof then came sound smash doubt of time something heavy have be knocked off bench jumped up at once went opened door leading into big laboratory be surprised to hear queer sort of laugh saw davidson standing unsteadily in middle of room with dazzled look on face first impression be that be drunk did not notice be clawing out at something invisible yard in front of face put out hand slowly rather hesitatingly then clutched nothing what be come to said held up hand to face finger spread out great scott said thing happened three four year ago when one swore by personage then began raising foot clumsily a though have expected to find glued to floor davidson cried what be matter with turned round in direction looked about for looked over at on side of without slightest sign of seeing wave said remarkably neat schooner 'd swear be bellow voice hullo shouted suddenly at top of voice thought be up to foolery then saw littered about foot shattered remains of best of electrometer what be up man said have smashed electrometer bellow again said friend left if hand be gone something about electrometer way be bellow suddenly came staggering towards damned stuff cut like butter said walked straight into bench recoiled none so buttery that said stood swaying felt scared davidson said what on earth come over looked round in direction must swear be bellow why show like man bellow occurred to that must be suddenly struck blind walked round table laid hand upon arm never saw man more startled in life jumped away from came round into attitude of self defence face fairly distorted with terror good god cried what be that be bellow confound davidson jumped when answered stared how can express right through began talking not to to here in broad daylight on clear beach not place to hide in looked about wildly here be off suddenly turned ran headlong into big electro magnet so violently that a found afterwards bruised shoulder jawbone cruelly at that stepped back pace cried out with almost whimper what in heaven name have come over stood blanched with terror trembling violently with right arm clutching left where have collided with magnet by time be excited fairly scared davidson said be afraid be startled at voice not so excessively a before repeated word in a clear a firm tone a must assume bellow said be that ca see be laughed ca even see be where devil be here said in laboratory laboratory answered in puzzled tone put hand to forehead be in laboratory till flash came be hanged if be there now what ship be that there be ship said do be sensible old chap ship repeated seemed to forget denial forthwith suppose said slowly be dead rummy part be feel just a though still have body get used to at once suppose old shop be struck by lightning suppose jolly quick thing bellow eigh talk nonsense be very much alive be in laboratory blundering about have just smashed new electrometer envy when boyce arrives stared away from towards diagram of cryohydrates must be deaf said have fired gun for there go puff of smoke never heard sound put hand on arm again time be le alarmed seem to have sort of invisible body said by jove there be boat coming round headland be very much like old life after in different climate shook arm davidson cried wake up ii be just then that boyce came in so soon a spoke davidson exclaimed old boyce dead too what lark hastened to explain that davidson be in kind of somnambulistic trance boyce be interested at once did must to rouse fellow out of extraordinary state answered question asked of own attention seemed distracted by hallucination about beach ship kept interpolating observation concerning boat davit sail filling with wind made one feel queer in dusky laboratory to hear saying such thing be blind helpless have to walk down passage one at elbow to boyce private room while boyce talked to there humoured about ship idea went along corridor asked old wade to come look at voice of dean sobered little not very much asked where hand be why have to walk about up to waist in ground wade thought over long time know how knit brow then made feel couch guiding hand to be couch said couch in private room of professor boyce horse hair stuffing davidson felt about puzzled over answered presently that must feel right must see do see asked wade davidson said must see nothing lot of sand broken up shell wade gave other thing to feel telling what be watching keenly ship be almost hull down said davidson presently apropos of nothing never mind ship said wade listen to davidson do know what hallucination mean rather said davidson well everything see be hallucinatory bishop berkeley said davidson mistake said wade be alive in room of boyce something have happened to eye can not see can feel hear not see do follow seems to that see too much davidson rubbed knuckle into eye well said that be let perplex bellow here will take home in cab wait bit davidson thought help to sit down said presently now be sorry to trouble will tell over again wade repeated very patiently davidson shut eye pressed hand upon forehead yes said be quite right now eye be shut know be right be bellow sitting by on couch be in england again be in dark then opened eye there said be sun just rising yard of ship tumbled sea couple of bird flying never saw anything so real be sitting up to neck in bank of sand bent forward covered face with hand then opened eye again dark sea sunrise yet be sitting on sofa in old boyce room god help iii be beginning for three week strange affection of davidson eye continued unabated be far worse than being blind be absolutely helpless have to be fed like newly hatched bird led about undressed if attempted to move fell over thing struck against wall door after day so got used to hearing voice without seeing willingly admitted be at home that wade be right in what told sister to whom be engaged insisted on coming to see must sit for hour day while talked about beach of holding hand seemed to comfort immensely explained that when left college drove home lived in hampstead village appeared to a if drove right through sandhill be perfectly black until emerged again through rock tree solid obstacle when be taken to own room made giddy almost frantic with fear of falling because going upstairs seemed to lift thirty forty foot above rock of imaginary island kept saying must smash egg end be that have to be taken down into father consulting room laid upon couch stood there described island a being bleak kind of place on whole with very little vegetation except peaty stuff lot of bare rock there be multitude of penguin made rock white disagreeable to see sea be often rough once there be thunderstorm lay shouted at silent flash once twice seal pulled up on beach only on first two three day said be very funny way in penguin used to waddle right through how seemed to lie among without disturbing remember one odd thing be when wanted very badly to smoke put pipe in hand almost poked eye out with lit must taste anything have since found be same with know if be usual case can not enjoy tobacco at unless can see smoke queerest part of vision came when wade sent out in bath chair to get fresh air davidsons hired chair got that deaf obstinate dependant of theirs widgery to attend to be idea of healthy expedition be peculiar sister who have be to dog home met in camden town towards king cross widgery trotting along complacently davidson evidently most distressed trying in feeble blind way to attract widgery attention positively wept when sister spoke to oh get out of horrible darkness said feeling for hand must get out of will die be quite incapable of explaining be matter sister decided must go home presently a went uphill towards hampstead horror seemed to drop from said be good to see star again though be then about noon blazing day seemed told afterwards a if be being carried irresistibly towards water be not very much alarmed at first of course be night there lovely night of course asked for struck a odd of course said be always night there when be day here well went right into water be calm shining under moonlight just broad swell seemed to grow broader flatter a came down into surface glistened just like skin might have be empty space underneath for must tell to contrary very slowly for rode slanting into water crept up to eye then went under skin seemed to break heal again about eye moon gave jump up in sky grew green dim fish faintly glowing came darting round thing seemed made of luminous glass passed through tangle of seaweed shone with oily lustre so drove down into sea star went out one by one moon grew greener darker seaweed became luminous purple red be very faint mysterious everything seemed to quiver while must hear wheel of bath chair creaking footstep of people going by man in distance selling special pall mall kept sinking down deeper deeper into water became inky black about not ray from above came down into darkness phosphorescent thing grew brighter brighter snaky branch of deeper weed flickered like flame of spirit lamp after time there be more weed fish came staring gaping towards into through never imagined such fish before have line of fire along side of a though have be outlined with luminous pencil there be ghastly thing swimming backwards with lot of twining arm then saw coming very slowly towards through gloom hazy mass of light resolved a drew nearer into multitude of fish struggling darting round something drifted drove on straight towards presently saw in midst of tumult by light of fish bit of splintered spar looming over dark hull tilting over glowing phosphorescent form be shaken writhed a fish bit at then be began to try to attract widgery attention horror came upon ugh must have driven right into half eaten thing if sister have not come have great hole in bellow never mind be ghastly iv for three week davidson remained in singular state seeing what at time imagined be altogether phantasmal world stone blind to world around then one tuesday when called met old davidson in passage can see thumb old gentleman said in perfect transport be struggling into overcoat can see thumb bellow said with tear in eye lad will be right yet rushed in to davidson be holding up little book before face looking at laughing in weak kind of way be amazing said there be kind of patch come there pointed with finger be on rock a usual penguin be staggering flapping about a usual there be be whale showing now then be got too dark now to make out put something there see do see be very dim broken in place see same like faint spectre of found out morning while be dressing be like hole in infernal phantom world just put hand by mine no not there ah yes see base of thumb bit of cuff look like ghost of bit of hand sticking out of darkling sky just by there be group of star like cross coming out from time davidson began to mend account of change like account of vision be oddly convincing over patch of field of vision phantom world grew fainter grew transparent a be through translucent gap began to see dimly real world about patch grew in size number ran together spread until only here there be blind spot left upon eye be able to get up steer about feed once more read smoke behave like ordinary citizen again at first be very confusing to to have two picture overlapping other like changing view of lantern in little while began to distinguish real from illusory at first be unfeignedly glad seemed only too anxious to complete cure by taking exercise tonic a odd island of began to fade away from became queerly interested in wanted particularly to go down into deep sea again must spend time wandering about low lying part of london trying to find water logged wreck have seen drifting glare of real daylight very soon impressed so vividly a to blot out everything of shadowy world of night time in darkened room must still see white splashed rock of island clumsy penguin staggering to fro even grew fainter fainter at last soon after married sister saw for last time v now to tell of queerest thing of about two year after cure dined with davidsons after dinner man named atkins called in be lieutenant in royal navy pleasant talkative man be on friendly term with brother in law be soon on friendly term with came out that be engaged to davidson cousin incidentally took out kind of pocket photograph case to show new rendering of fiancee by by said here be old fulmar davidson looked at casually then suddenly face lit up good heaven said must almost swear what said atkins that have seen that ship before see how can have have be out of south sea for six year before then began davidson then yes be ship dreamt of be sure be ship dreamt of be standing off island swarmed with penguin fired gun good lord said atkins who have now heard particular of seizure how deuce must dream then bit by bit came out that on very day davidson be seized hm fulmar have actually be off little rock to south of antipode island boat have landed overnight to get penguin egg have be delayed thunderstorm drifting up boat crew have waited until morning before rejoining ship atkins have be one of corroborated word for word description davidson have given of island boat there be not slightest doubt in of mind davidson have really seen place in unaccountable way while moved hither thither in sight moved hither thither in manner corresponded about distant island how be absolutely mystery completes remarkable story of davidson eye be perhaps best authenticated case in existence of real vision at distance explanation there be none forthcoming except what professor wade have thrown out explanation invokes fourth dimension dissertation on theoretical kind of space to talk of there being kink in space seems mere nonsense to may be because be mathematician when said that nothing must alter fact that place be eight thousand mile away answered that two point might be yard away on sheet of paper yet be brought together by bending paper round reader may grasp argument certainly idea seems to be that davidson stooping between pole of big electro magnet have extraordinary twist given to retinal element through sudden change in field of force due to lightning think a consequence of that may be possible to live visually in one part of world while one life bodily in have even made experiment in support of view so far have simply succeeded in blinding few dog believe be net result of work though have not seen for week latterly have be so busy with work in connection with saint pancras installation have have little opportunity of calling to see whole of theory seems fantastic to fact concerning davidson stand on altogether different footing can testify personally to accuracy of detail have given viii lord of dynamo chief attendant of three dynamo buzzed rattled at camberwell kept electric railway going came out of yorkshire name be james holroyd be practical electrician fond of whisky heavy red haired brute with irregular teeth doubted existence of deity accepted carnot cycle have read shakespeare found weak in chemistry helper came out of mysterious east name be azuma zi holroyd called pooh bah holroyd liked nigger help because must stand kicking habit with holroyd did not pry into machinery try to learn way of certain odd possibility of negro mind brought into abrupt contact with crown of civilisation holroyd never fully realised though just at end got inkling of to define azuma zi be beyond ethnology be perhaps more negroid than anything else though hair be curly rather than frizzy nose have bridge moreover skin be brown rather than black white of eye be yellow broad cheekbone narrow chin gave face something of viperine v head too be broad behind low narrow at forehead a if brain have be twisted round in reverse way to european be short of stature still shorter of english in conversation made numerous odd noise of known marketable value infrequent word be carved wrought into heraldic grotesqueness holroyd tried to elucidate religious belief especially after whisky lectured to against superstition missionary azuma zi however shirked discussion of god even though be kicked for azuma zi have come clad in white insufficient raiment out of stoke hole of lord clive from strait settlement beyond into london have heard even in youth of greatness rich of london where woman be white fair even beggar in street be white have arrived with newly earned gold coin in pocket to worship at shrine of civilisation day of landing be dismal one sky be dun wind worried drizzle filtered down to greasy street plunged boldly into delight of shadwell be presently cast up shattered in health civilised in costume penniless except in matter of direst necessity practically dumb animal to toil for james holroyd to be bullied by in dynamo shed at camberwell to james holroyd bullying be labour of love there be three dynamo with engine at camberwell two have be there since beginning be small machine larger one be new smaller machine made reasonable noise strap hummed over drum now then brush buzzed fizzled air churned steadily whoo whoo whoo between pole one be loose in foundation kept shed vibrating big dynamo drowned little noise altogether with sustained drone of iron core somehow set part of ironwork humming place made visitor head reel with throb throb throb of engine rotation of big wheel spinning ball valve occasional spitting of steam over deep unceasing surging note of big dynamo last noise be from engineering point of view defect azuma zi accounted unto monster for mightiness pride if be possible must have noise of shed always about reader a read must tell story to accompaniment be steady stream of din from ear picked out first one thread then there be intermittent snorting panting seething of steam engine suck thud of piston dull beat on air a spoke of great driving wheel came round note leather strap made a ran tighter looser fretful tumult from dynamo over sometimes inaudible a ear tired of then creeping back upon sens again be trombone note of big machine floor never felt steady quiet beneath one foot quivered jarred be confusing unsteady place enough to send anyone thought jerking into odd zigzag for three month while big strike of engineer be in progress holroyd who be blackleg azuma zi who be mere black be never out of stir eddy of slept fed in little wooden shanty between shed gate holroyd delivered theological lecture on text of big machine soon after azuma zi came have to shout to be heard in din look at said holroyd where be 'eathen idol to match 'im azuma zi looked for moment holroyd be inaudible then azuma zi heard kill hundred men twelve per cent on ordinary share said holroyd be something like gord holroyd be proud of big dynamo expatiated upon size power to azuma zi until heaven know what odd current of thought incessant whirling shindy set up within curly black cranium must explain in most graphic manner dozen so way in man might be killed by once gave azuma zi shock a sample of quality after in breathing time of labour be heavy labour being not only own most of holroyd azuma zi must sit watch big machine now then brush must sparkle spit blue flash at holroyd must swear rest be a smooth rhythmic a breathing band ran shouting over shaft ever behind one a one be complacent thud of piston so lived day in big airy shed with holroyd to wait upon not prisoned up slaving to drive ship a other engine knew mere captive devil of british solomon have be machine enthroned two smaller dynamo azuma zi by force of contrast despised large one privately christened lord of dynamo be fretful irregular big dynamo be steady how great be how serene easy in working greater calmer even than buddha have seen at rangoon yet not motionless living great black coil spun spun ring ran round under brush deep note of coil steadied whole affected azuma zi queerly azuma zi be not fond of labour must sit about watch lord of dynamo while holroyd went away to persuade yard porter to get whisky although proper place be not in dynamo shed behind engine moreover if holroyd caught skulking got hit for with rod of stout copper wire must go stand close to colossus look up at great leather band running overhead there be black patch on band came round pleased somehow among clatter to watch return again again odd thought spun with whirl of scientific people tell that savage give soul to rock tree machine be thousand time more alive than rock tree azuma zi be practically savage still veneer of civilisation lay deeper than slop suit bruise coal grime on face hand father before have worshipped meteoric stone kindred blood may be have splashed broad wheel of juggernaut took opportunity holroyd gave of touching handling great dynamo be fascinating polished cleaned until metal part be blinding in sun felt mysterious sense of service in doing must go up to touch spinning coil gently god have worshipped be far away people in london hid god at last dim feeling grew more distinct took shape in thought at last in act when came into roaring shed one morning salaamed to lord of dynamo then when holroyd be away went whispered to thundering machine that be servant prayed to have pity on save from holroyd a did so rare gleam of light came in through open archway of throbbing machine shed lord of dynamo a whirled roared be radiant with pale gold then azuma zi knew that service be acceptable to lord after that did not feel so lonely a have done have indeed be very much alone in london even when work time be over be rare loitered about shed then next time holroyd maltreated azuma zi went presently to lord of dynamo whispered thou seest o lord angry whirr of machinery seemed to answer thereafter appeared to that whenever holroyd came into shed different note came into sound of dynamo lord bides time said azuma zi to iniquity of fool be not yet ripe waited watched for day of reckoning one day there be evidence of short circuiting holroyd making unwary examination be in afternoon got rather severe shock azuma zi from behind engine saw jump off curse at peccant coil be warned said azuma zi to surely lord be very patient holroyd have at first initiated nigger into such elementary conception of dynamo working a must enable to take temporary charge of shed in absence when noticed manner in azuma zi hung about monster became suspicious dimly perceived assistant be up to something connecting with anointing of coil with oil have rotted varnish in one place issued edict shouted above confusion of machinery go nigh that big dynamo more pooh bah will take thy skin off besides if pleased azuma zi to be near big machine be plain sense decency to keep away from azuma zi obeyed at time later be caught bowing before lord of dynamo at holroyd twisted arm kicked a turned to go away a azuma zi presently stood behind engine glared at back of hated noise of machinery took new rhythm sounded like four word in native tongue be hard to say exactly what madness be fancy azuma zi be mad incessant din whirl of dynamo shed may have churned up little store of knowledge big store of superstitious fancy at last into something akin to frenzy at rate when idea of making sacrifice to dynamo fetich be thus suggested to filled with strange tumult of exultant emotion night two men black shadow be alone in shed together shed be lit with one big arc light winked flickered purple shadow lay black behind dynamo ball governor of engine whirled from light to darkness piston beat loud steady world outside seen through open end of shed seemed incredibly dim remote seemed absolutely silent too since riot of machinery drowned external sound far away be black fence of yard with grey shadowy house behind above be deep blue sky pale little star azuma zi suddenly walked across centre of shed above leather band be running went into shadow by big dynamo holroyd heard click spin of armature changed what be dewin ' with switch bawled in surprise have told then saw set expression of azuma zi eye a asiatic came out of shadow towards in moment two men be grappling fiercely in front of great dynamo coffee headed fool gasped holroyd with brown hand at throat keep off contact ring in moment be tripped reeling back upon lord of dynamo instinctively loosened grip upon antagonist to save from machine messenger sent in furious haste from station to find out what have happened in dynamo shed met azuma zi at porter lodge by gate azuma zi tried to explain something messenger must make nothing of black incoherent english hurried on to shed machine be noisily at work nothing seemed to be disarranged there be however queer smell of singed hair then saw odd looking crumpled mass clinging to front of big dynamo approaching recognised distorted remains of holroyd man stared hesitated moment then saw face shut eye convulsively turned on heel before opened so that must not see holroyd again went out of shed to get advice help when azuma zi saw holroyd die in grip of great dynamo have be little scared about consequence of act yet felt strangely elated knew that favour of lord dynamo be upon plan be already settled when met man coming from station scientific manager who speedily arrived on scene jumped at obvious conclusion of suicide expert scarcely noticed azuma zi except to ask few question did see holroyd kill azuma zi explained have be out of sight at engine furnace until heard difference in noise from dynamo be not difficult examination being untinctured by suspicion distorted remains of holroyd electrician removed from machine be hastily covered by porter with coffee stained table cloth somebody by happy inspiration fetched medical man expert be chiefly anxious to get machine at work again for seven eight train have stopped midway in stuffy tunnel of electric railway azuma zi answering misunderstanding question of people who have by authority impudence come into shed be presently sent back to stoke hole by scientific manager of course crowd collected outside gate of yard crowd for known reason always hovers for day two near scene of sudden death in london two three reporter percolated somehow into engine shed one even got to azuma zi scientific expert cleared out again being amateur journalist presently body be carried away public interest departed with azuma zi remained very quietly at furnace seeing over over again in coal figure wriggled violently became still hour after murder to one coming into shed must have looked exactly a if nothing remarkable have ever happened there peeping presently from engine room black saw lord dynamo spin whirl beside little brother driving wheel be beating round steam in piston went thud thud exactly a have be earlier in evening after from mechanical point of view have be most insignificant incident mere temporary deflection of current now slender form slender shadow of scientific manager replaced sturdy outline of holroyd travelling up down lane of light upon vibrating floor under strap between engine dynamo have not served lord said azuma zi inaudibly from shadow note of great dynamo rang out full clear a looked at big whirling mechanism strange fascination of have be little in abeyance since holroyd death resumed sway never have azuma zi seen man killed so swiftly pitilessly big humming machine have slain victim without wavering for second from steady beating be indeed mighty god unconscious scientific manager stood with back to scribbling on piece of paper shadow lay at foot of monster be lord dynamo still hungry servant be ready azuma zi made stealthy step forward then stopped scientific manager suddenly ceased writing walked down shed to endmost of dynamo began to examine brush azuma zi hesitated then slipped across noiselessly into shadow by switch there waited presently manager footstep must be heard returning stopped in old position unconscious of stoker crouching ten foot away from then big dynamo suddenly fizzled in moment azuma zi have sprung out of darkness upon first scientific manager be gripped round body swung towards big dynamo then kicking with knee forcing antagonist head down with hand loosened grip on waist swung round away from machine then black grasped again putting curly head against chest swayed panted a seemed for age so then scientific manager be impelled to catch black ear in teeth bite furiously black yelled hideously rolled over on floor black who have apparently slipped from vice of teeth parted with ear scientific manager wondered at time tried to throttle scientific manager be making ineffectual effort to claw something with hand to kick when welcome sound of quick footstep sounded on floor next moment azuma zi have left darted towards big dynamo there be splutter amid roar officer of company who have entered stood staring a azuma zi caught naked terminal in hand gave one horrible convulsion then hung motionless from machine face violently distorted be jolly glad came in when did said scientific manager still sitting on floor looked at still quivering figure be not nice death to die apparently be quick official be still staring at body be man of slow apprehension there be pause scientific manager got up on foot rather awkwardly ran finger along collar thoughtfully moved head to fro several time poor holroyd see now then almost mechanically went towards switch in shadow turned current into railway circuit again a did so singed body loosened grip upon machine fell forward on face core of dynamo roared out loud

detail how two great men quarrelled how split between widened until from microlepidoptera be at war upon open question in entomology there be memorable occasion at time royal entomological society meeting resembled nothing so much a chamber of deputy on whole fancy pawkins be nearer truth than hapley hapley be skilful with rhetoric have turn for ridicule rare in scientific man be endowed with vast energy have fine sense of injury in matter of extinguished specie while pawkins be man of dull presence prosy of speech in shape not unlike water barrel over conscientious with testimonial suspected of jobbing museum appointment so young men gathered round hapley applauded be long struggle vicious from beginning growing at last to pitiless antagonism successive turn of fortune now advantage to one side now to now hapley tormented by success of pawkins now pawkins outshone by hapley belong rather to history of entomology than to story footnote remark on recent revision of microlepidoptera quart journ entomological soc footnote b rejoinder to certain remark etc ibid footnote c further remark etc ibid in pawkins whose health have be bad for time published work upon mesoblast of death head what mesoblast of death head moth may be doe not matter rap in story work be far below usual standard gave hapley opening have coveted for year must have worked night day to make most of advantage in elaborate critique rent pawkins to tatter one can fancy man disordered black hair queer dark eye flashing a went for antagonist pawkins made reply halting ineffectual with painful gap of silence yet malignant there be mistaking will to wound hapley incapacity to do few of who heard be absent from meeting realised how ill man be hapley got opponent down meant to finish followed with simply brutal attack upon pawkins in form of paper upon development of moth in general paper showing evidence of most extraordinary amount of mental labour yet couched in violently controversial tone violent a be editorial note witness that be modified must have covered pawkins with shame confusion of face left loophole be murderous in argument utterly contemptuous in tone awful thing for declining year of man career world of entomologist waited breathlessly for rejoinder from pawkins must try one for pawkins have always be game when came surprised for rejoinder of pawkins be to catch influenza proceed to pneumonia die be perhaps a effectual reply a must make under circumstance largely turned current of feeling against very people who have most gleefully cheered on gladiator became serious at consequence there must be reasonable doubt fret of defeat have contributed to death of pawkins there be limit even to scientific controversy said serious people crushing attack be already in press appeared on day before funeral think hapley exerted to stop people remembered how hapley have hounded down rival forgot that rival defect scathing satire read ill over fresh mould thing provoked comment in daily paper be that made think that have probably heard of hapley controversy a have already remarked scientific worker live very much in world of own people dare say who go along piccadilly to academy year must not tell where learned society abide many even think that research be kind of happy family cage in kind of men lie down together in peace in private thought hapley must not forgive pawkins for dying in first place be mean dodge to escape absolute pulverisation hapley have in hand for in second left hapley mind with queer gap in for twenty year have worked hard sometimes far into night seven day week with microscope scalpel collecting net pen almost entirely with reference to pawkins european reputation have won have come a incident in great antipathy have gradually worked up to climax in last controversy have killed pawkins have also thrown hapley out of gear so to speak doctor advised to give up work for time rest so hapley went down into quiet village in kent thought day night of pawkins good thing be now impossible to say about at last hapley began to realise in what direction pre occupation tended determined to make fight for started by trying to read novel must not get mind off pawkins white in face making last speech sentence beautiful opening for hapley turned to fiction found have grip on read island night entertainment until sense of causation be shocked beyond endurance by bottle imp then went to kipling found proved nothing besides being irreverent vulgar scientific people have limitation then unhappily tried besant inner house opening chapter set mind upon learned society pawkins at once so hapley turned to chess found little more soothing soon mastered move chief gambit commoner closing position began to beat vicar then cylindrical contour of opposite king began to resemble pawkins standing up gasping ineffectually against check mate hapley decided to give up chess perhaps study of new branch of science must after be better diversion best rest be change of occupation hapley determined to plunge at diatom have one of smaller microscope halibut monograph sent down from london thought that perhaps if must get up vigorous quarrel with halibut might be able to begin life afresh forget pawkins very soon be hard at work in habitual strenuous fashion at microscopic denizen of way side pool be on third day of diatom hapley became aware of novel addition to local fauna be working late at microscope only light in room be brilliant little lamp with special form of green shade like experienced microscopist kept eye open be only way to avoid excessive fatigue one eye be over instrument bright distinct before be circular field of microscope across brown diatom be slowly moving with other eye hapley saw a be without seeing be only dimly conscious of brass side of instrument illuminated part of table cloth sheet of notepaper foot of lamp darkened room beyond suddenly attention drifted from one eye to other table cloth be of material called tapestry by shopmen rather brightly coloured pattern be in gold with small amount of crimson pale blue upon greyish ground at one point pattern seemed displaced there be vibrating movement of colour at point hapley suddenly moved head back looked with eye mouth fell open with astonishment be large moth butterfly wing spread in butterfly fashion be strange must be in room at for window be closed strange that must not have attracted attention when fluttering to present position strange that must match table cloth stranger far to hapley great entomologist be altogether unknown there be delusion be crawling slowly towards foot of lamp new genus by heaven in england said hapley staring then suddenly thought of pawkins nothing must have maddened pawkins moreand pawkins be dead something about head body of insect became singularly suggestive of pawkins just a chess king have be confound pawkins said hapley must catch looking round for mean of capturing moth rose slowly out of chair suddenly insect rose edge of lampshade hapley heard ping vanished into shadow in moment hapley have whipped off shade so that whole room be illuminated thing have disappeared soon practised eye detected upon wall paper near door went towards poising lamp shade for capture before be within striking distance however have risen be fluttering round room after fashion of kind flew with sudden start turn seeming to vanish here reappear there once hapley struck missed then again third time hit microscope instrument swayed struck overturned lamp fell noisily upon floor lamp turned over on table very luckily went out hapley be left in dark with start felt strange moth blunder into face be maddening have light if opened door of room thing must get away in darkness saw pawkins quite distinctly laughing at pawkins have ever oily laugh swore furiously stamped foot on floor there be timid rapping at door then opened perhaps foot very slowly alarmed face of landlady appeared behind pink candle flame wore night cap over grey hair have purple garment over shoulder what be fearful smash said have anything strange moth appeared fluttering about chink of door shut that door said hapley suddenly rushed at door slammed hastily hapley be left alone in dark then in pause heard landlady scuttle upstairs lock door drag something heavy across room put against became evident to hapley that conduct appearance have be strange alarming confound moth pawkins however be pity to lose moth now felt way into hall found match after sending hat down upon floor with noise like drum with lighted candle returned to sitting room moth be to be seen yet once for moment seemed that thing be fluttering round head hapley very suddenly decided to give up moth go to bed be excited night long sleep be broken by dream of moth pawkins landlady twice in night turned out soused head in cold water one thing be very clear to landlady must not possibly understand about strange moth especially a have failed to catch one entomologist must understand quite how felt be probably frightened at behaviour yet failed to see how must explain decided to say nothing further about event of last night after breakfast saw in garden decided to go out talk to reassure talked to about bean potato bee caterpillar price of fruit replied in usual manner looked at little suspiciously kept walking a walked so that there be always bed of flower row of bean something of sort between after while began to feel singularly irritated at to conceal vexation went indoors presently went out for walk moth butterfly trailing odd flavour of pawkins with kept coming into walk though did best to keep mind off once saw quite distinctly with wing flattened out upon old stone wall run along west edge of park going up to found be only two lump of grey yellow lichen said hapley be reverse of mimicry instead of butterfly looking like stone here be stone looking like butterfly once something hovered fluttered round head by effort of will drove impression out of mind again in afternoon hapley called upon vicar argued with upon theological question sat in little arbour covered with briar smoked a wrangled look at moth said hapley suddenly pointing to edge of wooden table where said vicar see moth on edge of table there said hapley certainly not said vicar hapley be thunderstruck gasped vicar be staring at clearly man saw nothing eye of faith be better than eye of science said hapley awkwardly see point said vicar thinking be part of argument night hapley found moth crawling over counterpane sat on edge of bed in shirt sleeve reasoned with be pure hallucination knew be slipping battled for sanity with same silent energy have formerly displayed against pawkins so persistent be mental habit that felt a if be still struggle with pawkins be well versed in psychology knew that such visual illusion do come a result of mental strain point be did not only see moth have heard when touched edge of lampshade afterwards when hit against wall have felt strike face in dark looked at be not at dreamlike perfectly clear solid looking in candle light saw hairy body short feathery antenna jointed leg even place where down be rubbed from wing suddenly felt angry with for being afraid of little insect landlady have got servant to sleep with night because be afraid to be alone in addition have locked door put chest of drawer against listened talked in whisper after have gone to bed nothing occurred to alarm about eleven have ventured to put candle out have dozed off to sleep woke up with start sat up in bed listening in darkness then heard slippered foot going to fro in hapley room chair be overturned there be violent dab at wall then china mantel ornament smashed upon fender suddenly door of room opened heard upon landing clung to one listening seemed to be dancing upon staircase now must go down three four step quickly then up again then hurry down into hall heard umbrella stand go over fanlight break then bolt shot chain rattled be opening door hurried to window be dim grey night almost unbroken sheet of watery cloud be sweeping across moon hedge tree in front of house be black against pale roadway saw hapley looking like ghost in shirt white trouser running to fro in road beating air now must stop now must dart very rapidly at something invisible now must move upon with stealthy stride at last went out of sight up road towards down then while argued who must go down lock door returned be walking very fast came straight into house closed door carefully went quietly up to bedroom then everything be silent mr colville said hapley calling down staircase next morning hope did not alarm last night may well ask said mr colville fact be be sleep walker last two night have be without sleeping mixture there be nothing to be alarmed about really be sorry made as of myself will go over down to shoreham get stuff to make sleep soundly ought to have done yesterday half way over down by chalk pit moth came upon hapley again went on trying to keep mind upon chess problem be good thing fluttered into face struck at with hat in self defence then rage old rage rage have so often felt against pawkins came upon again went on leaping striking at eddying insect suddenly trod on nothing fell headlong there be gap in sensation hapley found sitting on heap of flint in front of opening of chalk pit with leg twisted back under strange moth be still fluttering round head struck at with hand turning head saw two men approaching one be village doctor occurred to hapley that be lucky then came into mind with extraordinary vividness that one must ever be able to see strange moth except that behoved to keep silent about late that night however after broken leg be set be feverish forgot self restraint be lying flat on bed began to run eye round room to see if moth be still about tried not to do be no good soon caught sight of thing resting close to hand by night light on green table cloth wing quivered with sudden wave of anger smote at with fist nurse woke up with shriek have missed that moth said then be fancy nothing time must see quite clearly insect going round cornice darting across room must also see that nurse saw nothing of looked at strangely must keep in hand knew be lost man if did not keep in hand a night waned fever grew upon very dread have of seeing moth made see about five just a dawn be grey tried to get out of bed catch though leg be afire with pain nurse have to struggle with on account of tied down to bed at moth grew bolder once felt settle in hair then because struck out violently with arm tied also at moth came crawled over face hapley wept swore screamed prayed for to take off unavailingly doctor be blockhead just qualified general practitioner quite ignorant of mental science simply said there be moth have possessed wit might still perhaps have saved hapley from fate by entering into delusion covering face with gauze a prayed might be done a say doctor be blockhead until leg be healed hapley be kept tied to bed with imaginary moth crawling over never left while be awake grew to monster in dream while be awake longed for sleep from sleep awoke screaming so now hapley be spending remainder of day in padded room worried by moth that one else can see asylum doctor call hallucination hapley when be in easier mood can talk say be ghost of pawkins consequently unique specimen well worth trouble of catching treasure in forest canoe be now approaching land bay opened out gap in white surf of reef marked where little river ran out to sea thicker deeper green of virgin forest showed course down distant hill slope forest here came close to beach far beyond dim almost cloudlike in texture rose mountain like suddenly frozen wave sea be still save for almost imperceptible swell sky blazed man with carved paddle stopped must be somewhere here said shipped paddle held arm out straight before other man have be in fore part of canoe closely scrutinising land have sheet of yellow paper on knee come look at evans said men spoke in low tone lip be hard dry man called evans came swaying along canoe until must look over companion shoulder paper have appearance of rough map by much folding be creased worn to pitch of separation second man held discoloured fragment together where have parted on one must dimly make out in almost obliterated pencil outline of bay here said evans be reef here be gap ran thumb nail over chart curved twisting line be river must do with drink now star be place see dotted line said man with map be straight line run from opening of reef to clump of palm tree star come just where cut river must mark place a go into lagoon be queer said evans after pause what little mark down here be for look like plan of house something what little dash pointing way may mean ca get notion what be writing chinese said man with map of course be chinee said evans be said man with map sat for minute staring at land while canoe drifted slowly then evans looked towards paddle turn with paddle now hooker said companion quietly folded up map put in pocket passed evans carefully began to paddle movement be languid like of man whose strength be nearly exhausted evans sat with eye half closed watching frothy breakwater of coral creep nearer sky be like furnace for sun be near zenith though be so near treasure did not feel exaltation have anticipated intense excitement of struggle for plan long night voyage from mainland in unprovisioned canoe have to use own expression taken out of tried to arouse by directing mind to ingot chinaman have spoken of must not rest there came back headlong to thought of sweet water rippling in river to almost unendurable dryness of lip throat rhythmic wash of sea upon reef be becoming audible now have pleasant sound in ear water washed along side of canoe paddle dripped between stroke presently began to doze be still dimly conscious of island queer dream texture interwove with sensation once again be night when hooker have hit upon chinaman secret saw moonlit tree little fire burning black figure of three chinaman silvered on one side by moonlight on other glowing from firelight heard talking together in pigeon english for came from different province hooker have caught drift of talk first have motioned to to listen fragment of conversation be inaudible fragment incomprehensible spanish galleon from philippine hopelessly aground treasure buried against day of return lay in background of story shipwrecked crew thinned by disease quarrel so need of discipline at last taking to boat never to be heard of again then chang hi only year since wandering ashore have happened upon ingot hidden for two hundred year have deserted junk reburied with infinite toil single handed very safe laid great stress on safety be secret of now wanted help to return exhume presently little map fluttered voice sank fine story for two stranded british wastrel to hear evans dream shifted to moment when have chang hi pigtail in hand life of chinaman be scarcely sacred like european cunning little face of chang hi first keen furious like startled snake then fearful treacherous pitiful became overwhelmingly prominent in dream at end chang hi have grinned most incomprehensible startling grin abruptly thing became very unpleasant a will do at time in dream chang hi gibbered threatened saw in dream heap heap of gold chang hi intervening struggling to hold back from took chang hi by pig tail how big yellow brute be how struggled grinned kept growing bigger too then bright heap of gold turned to roaring furnace vast devil surprisingly like chang hi with huge black tail began to feed with coal burnt mouth horribly devil be shouting name evans evans sleepy fool be hooker woke up be in mouth of lagoon there be three palm tree must be in line with clump of bush said companion mark that if go to bush then strike into bush in straight line from here will come to when come to stream must see now where mouth of stream opened out at sight of evans revived hurry up man said by heaven will have to drink sea water gnawed hand stared at gleam of silver among rock green tangle presently turned almost fiercely upon hooker give paddle said so reached river mouth little way up hooker took water in hollow of hand tasted spat out little further tried again will do said began drinking eagerly curse said evans suddenly be too slow leaning dangerously over fore part of canoe began to suck up water with lip presently made end of drinking running canoe into little creek be about to land among thick growth that overhung water will have to scramble through to beach to find bush get line to place said evans have better paddle round said hooker so pushed out again into river paddled back down to sea along shore to place where clump of bush grew here landed pulled light canoe far up beach then went up towards edge of jungle until must see opening of reef bush in straight line evans have taken native implement out of canoe be l shaped transverse piece be armed with polished stone hooker carried paddle be straight now in direction said must push through till strike stream then must prospect pushed through close tangle of reed broad frond young tree at first be toilsome going very speedily tree became larger ground beneath opened out blaze of sunlight be replaced by insensible degree by cool tree became at last vast pillar rose up to canopy of greenery far overhead dim white flower hung from stem ropy creeper swung from tree to tree shadow deepened on ground blotched fungi red brown incrustation became frequent evans shivered seems almost cold here after blaze outside hope be keeping to straight said hooker presently saw far ahead gap in sombre darkness where white shaft of hot sunlight smote into forest there also be brilliant green undergrowth coloured flower then heard rush of water here be river must be close to now said hooker vegetation be thick by river bank great plant a yet unnamed grew among root of big tree spread rosette of huge green fan towards strip of sky many flower creeper with shiny foliage clung to exposed stem on water of broad quiet pool treasure seeker now overlooked there floated big oval leaf waxen pinkish white flower not unlike water lily further a river bent away from water suddenly frothed became noisy in rapid well said evans have swerved little from straight said hooker be to be expected turned looked into dim cool shadow of silent forest behind if beat little way up down stream must come to something said began evans said there be heap of stone said two men looked at other for moment let try little down stream first said evans advanced slowly looking curiously about suddenly evans stopped what devil that said hooker followed finger something blue said have come into view a topped gentle swell of ground then began to distinguish what be advanced suddenly with hasty step until body belonged to limp hand arm have become visible grip tightened on implement carried thing be figure of chinaman lying on face abandon of pose be unmistakable two men drew closer together stood staring silently at ominous dead body lay in clear space among tree near by be spade after chinese pattern further off lay scattered heap of stone close to freshly dug hole somebody have be here before said hooker clearing throat then suddenly evans began to swear rave stamp upon ground hooker turned white said nothing advanced towards prostrate body saw neck be puffed purple hand ankle swollen pah said suddenly turned away went towards excavation gave cry of surprise shouted to evans who be following slowly fool be right be here still then turned again looked at dead chinaman then again at hole evans hurried to hole already half exposed by ill fated wretch beside lay number of dull yellow bar bent down in hole clearing off soil with bare hand hastily pulled one of heavy mass out a did so little thorn pricked hand pulled delicate spike out with finger lifted ingot only gold lead must weigh like said exultantly hooker be still looking at dead chinaman be puzzled stole march on friend said at last came here alone poisonous snake have killed wonder how found place evans stood with ingot in hand what did dead chinaman signify will have to take stuff to mainland piecemeal bury there for while how will get to canoe took jacket off spread on ground flung two three ingot into presently found that little thorn have punctured skin be a much a can carry said then suddenly with queer rush of irritation what be staring at hooker turned to ca stand nodded towards corpse be so like rubbish said evans chinaman be alike hooker looked into face be going to bury anyhow before lend hand with stuff be fool hooker said evans let that mass of corruption bide hooker hesitated then eye went carefully over brown soil about scare somehow said thing be said evans what to do with ingot will re bury over here take across strait in canoe hooker thought puzzled gaze wandered among tall tree trunk up into remote sunlit greenery overhead shivered again a eye rested upon blue figure of chinaman stared searchingly among grey depth between tree what be come to hooker said evans have lost wit let get gold out of place anyhow said hooker took end of collar of coat in hand evans took opposite corner lifted mass way said evans to canoe be queer said evans when have advanced only few step arm ache still with paddling curse said ache must rest let coat down evans face be white little drop of sweat stood out upon forehead be stuffy somehow in forest then with abrupt transition to unreasonable anger what be good of waiting here day lend hand say have done nothing moon since saw dead chinaman hooker be looking steadfastly at companion face helped raise coat bearing ingot went forward perhaps hundred yard in silence evans began to breathe heavily ca speak said what be matter with said hooker evans stumbled then with sudden curse flung coat from stood for moment staring at hooker then with groan clutched at own throat come near said went leant against tree then in steadier voice will be better in minute presently grip upon trunk loosened slipped slowly down stem of tree until be crumpled heap at foot hand be clenched convulsively face became distorted with pain hooker approached touch touch said evans in stifled voice put gold back on coat ca do anything for said hooker put gold back on coat a hooker handled ingot felt little prick on ball of thumb looked at hand saw slender thorn perhaps two inch in length evans gave inarticulate cry rolled over hooker jaw dropped stared at thorn for moment with dilated eye then looked at evans who be now crumpled together on ground back bending straightening spasmodically then looked through pillar of tree net work of creeper stem to where in dim grey shadow blue clad body of chinaman be still indistinctly visible thought of little dash in corner of plan in moment understood god help said for thorn be similar to dyaks poison use in blowing tube understood now what chang hi assurance of safety of treasure meant understood that grin now evans cried evans be silent motionless save for horrible spasmodic twitching of limb profound silence brooded over forest then hooker began to suck furiously at little pink spot on ball of thumb sucking for dear life presently felt strange aching pain in arm shoulder finger seemed difficult to bend then knew that sucking be good abruptly stopped sitting down by pile of ingot resting chin upon hand elbow upon knee stared at distorted still quivering body of companion chang hi grin came into mind again dull pain spread towards throat grew slowly in intensity far above faint breeze stirred

appear that mr fison be afraid that realised that be in danger possibly confidence be to be ascribed to limpness of attitude be horrified of course intensely excited indignant at such revolting creature preying upon human flesh thought have chanced upon drowned body shouted to with idea of driving off finding did not budge cast about picked up big rounded lump of rock flung at one then slowly uncoiling tentacle began moving towards creeping at first deliberately making soft purring sound to other in moment mr fison realised that be in danger shouted again threw boot started off with leap forthwith twenty yard off stopped faced about judging slow behold tentacle of leader be already pouring over rocky ridge on have just be standing at that shouted again time not threatening cry of dismay began jumping striding slipping wading across uneven expanse between beach tall red cliff seemed suddenly at vast distance saw a though be creature in world two minute workman engaged in repair of ladder way little suspecting race for life be beginning below at one time must hear creature splashing in pool not dozen foot behind once slipped almost fell chased to very foot of cliff desisted only when have be joined by workman at foot of ladder way up cliff three of men pelted with stone for time then hurried to cliff top along path towards sidmouth to secure assistance boat to rescue desecrated body from clutch of abominable creature ii a if have not already be in sufficient peril that day mr fison went with boat to point out exact spot of adventure a tide be down required considerable detour to reach spot when at last came off ladder way mangled body have disappeared water be now running in submerging first one slab of slimy rock then four men in boat workman be boatman mr fison now turned attention from bearing off shore to water beneath keel at first must see little below save dark jungle of laminaria with occasional darting fish mind be set on adventure expressed disappointment freely presently saw one of monster swimming through water seaward with curious rolling motion suggested to mr spinning roll of captive balloon almost immediately after waving streamer of laminaria be extraordinarily perturbed parted for moment three of beast became darkly visible struggling for what be probably fragment of drowned man in moment copious olive green ribbon have poured again over writhing group at four men greatly excited began beating water with oar shouting immediately saw tumultuous movement among weed desisted to see more clearly a soon a water be smooth saw a seemed to whole sea bottom among weed set with eye ugly swine cried one of men why there be dozen forthwith thing began to rise through water about mr fison have since described to writer startling eruption out of waving laminaria meadow to seemed to occupy considerable time be probable that really be affair of few second only for time nothing eye then speaks of tentacle streaming out parting weed frond way that then thing growing larger until at last bottom be hidden by intercoiling form tip of tentacle rose darkly here there into air above swell of water one came up boldly to side of boat clinging to with three of sucker set tentacle threw four others over gunwale a if with intention of oversetting boat of clambering into mr fison at once caught up boat hook jabbing furiously at soft tentacle forced to desist be struck in back almost pitched overboard by boatman who be using oar to resist similar attack on other side of boat tentacle on side at once relaxed hold slid out of sight splashed into water 'd better get out of said mr fison who be trembling violently went to tiller while boatman one of workman seated began rowing other workman stood up in fore part of boat with boat hook ready to strike more tentacle might appear nothing else seems to have be said mr fison have expressed common feeling beyond amendment in hushed scared mood with face white drawn set about escaping from position into have so recklessly blundered oar have scarcely dropped into water before dark tapering serpentine rope have bound be about rudder creeping up side of boat with looping motion came sucker again men gripped oar pulled be like trying to move boat in floating raft of weed help here cried boatman mr fison second workman rushed to help lug at oar then man with boat hook name be ewan ewen sprang up with curse began striking downward over side a far a must reach at bank of tentacle now clustered along boat bottom at same time two rower stood up to get better purchase for recovery of oar boatman handed to mr fison who lugged desperately meanwhile boatman opened big clasp knife leaning over side of boat began hacking at spiring arm upon oar shaft mr fison staggering with quivering rocking of boat teeth set breath coming short vein starting on hand a pulled at oar suddenly cast eye seaward there not fifty yard off across long roller of incoming tide be large boat standing in towards with three woman little child in boatman be rowing little man in pink ribboned straw hat white stood in stern hailing for moment of course mr fison thought of help then thought of child abandoned oar forthwith threw up arm in frantic gesture screamed to party in boat to keep away for god sake say much for modesty courage of mr fison that doe not seem to be aware that there be quality of heroism in action at juncture oar have abandoned be at once drawn under presently reappeared floating about twenty yard away at same moment mr fison felt boat under lurch violently hoarse scream prolonged cry of terror from boatman caused to forget party of excursionist altogether turned saw hill crouching by forward row lock face convulsed with terror right arm over side drawn tightly down gave now succession of short sharp cry oh oh oh oh mr fison belief that must have be hacking at tentacle below water line have be grasped by of course be quite impossible to say now certainly what have happened boat be heeling over so that gunwale be within ten inch of water ewan other labourer be striking down into water with oar boat hook on side of hill arm mr fison instinctively placed to counterpoise then hill who be burly powerful man made strenuous effort rose almost to standing position lifted arm indeed clean out of water hanging to be complicated tangle of brown rope eye of one of brute have hold of glaring straight resolute showed momentarily above surface boat heeled more more green brown water came pouring in cascade over side then hill slipped fell with rib across side arm mass of tentacle about splashed back into water rolled over boot kicked mr fison knee a gentleman rushed forward to seize in moment fresh tentacle have whipped about waist neck after brief convulsive struggle in boat be nearly capsized hill be lugged overboard boat righted with violent jerk that sent mr fison over other side hid struggle in water from eye stood staggering to recover balance for moment a did so became aware that struggle inflowing tide have carried close upon weedy rock again not four yard off table of rock still rose in rhythmic movement above in wash of tide in moment mr fison seized oar from ewan gave one vigorous stroke then dropping ran to bow leapt felt foot slide over rock by frantic effort leapt again towards further mass stumbled over came to knee rose again look out cried someone large drab body struck be knocked flat into tidal pool by one of workman a went down heard smothered choking cry that believed at time came from hill then found marvelling at shrillness variety of hill voice someone jumped over curving rush of foamy water poured over passed scrambled to foot dripping without looking seaward ran a fast a terror must let shoreward before over flat space of scattered rock stumbled two work men one dozen yard in front of other looked over shoulder at last seeing that be not pursued faced about be astonished from moment of rising of cephalopod out of water have be acting too swiftly to fully comprehend action now seemed to a if have suddenly jumped out of evil dream for there be sky cloudless blazing with afternoon sun sea weltering under pitiless brightness soft creamy foam of breaking water low long dark ridge of rock righted boat floated rising falling gently on swell about dozen yard from shore hill monster stress tumult of fierce fight for life have vanished a though have never be mr fison heart be beating violently be throbbing to finger tip breath came deep there be something missing for second must not think clearly enough what might be sun sky sea rock what be then remembered boat load of excursionist have vanished wondered whether have imagined turned saw two workman standing side by side under projecting mass of tall pink cliff hesitated whether must make one last attempt to save man hill physical excitement seemed to desert suddenly leave aimless helpless turned shoreward stumbling wading towards two companion looked back again there be now two boat floating one farthest out at sea pitched clumsily bottom upward iii so be haploteuthis ferox made appearance upon devonshire coast so far have be most serious aggression mr fison account taken together with wave of boating bathing casualty to have already alluded absence of fish from cornish coast that year point clearly to shoal of voracious deep sea monster prowling slowly along sub tidal coast line hunger migration have know be suggested a force drove for own part prefer to believe alternative theory of hemsley hemsley hold that pack shoal of creature may have become enamoured of human flesh by accident of foundered ship sinking among have wandered in search of out of accustomed zone first waylaying following ship so coming to shore in wake of atlantic traffic to discus hemsley cogent admirably stated argument must be out of place here must seem that appetite of shoal be satisfied by catch of eleven people for so far a can be ascertained there be ten people in second boat certainly creature gave further sign of presence off sidmouth that day coast between seaton budleigh salterton be patrolled that evening night by four preventive service boat men in be armed with harpoon cutlass a evening advanced number of more le similarly equipped expedition organised by private individual

down nearer boat at once hurried towards alarm venturesome occupant of boat seaman curate two schoolboy have actually seen monster passing under boat creature seems like most deep sea organism be phosphorescent have be floating five fathom deep so like creature of moonshine through blackness of water tentacle retracted a if asleep rolling over over moving slowly in wedge like formation towards south east people told story in gesticulated fragment a first one boat drew alongside then at last there be little fleet of eight nine boat collected together from tumult like chatter of market place rose into stillness of night there be little disposition to pursue shoal people have weapon experience for dubious chase presently even with certain relief may be boat turned shoreward now to tell what be perhaps most astonishing fact in whole astonishing raid have not slightest knowledge of subsequent movement of shoal although whole south west coast be now alert for may perhaps be significant that cachalot be stranded off sark on june two week three day after sidmouth affair living haploteuthis came ashore on calais sand be alive because several witness saw tentacle moving in convulsive

something always turn up to prevent explanation xv plattner story whether story of gottfried plattner be to be credited not be pretty question in value of evidence on one hand have seven witness to be perfectly exact have six half pair of eye one undeniable fact on other have what be prejudice common sense inertia of opinion never be there seven more honest seeming witness never be there more undeniable fact than inversion of gottfried plattner anatomical structure never be there more preposterous story than one have to tell most preposterous part of story be worthy gottfried contribution for count a one of seven heaven forbid must be led into giving countenance to superstition by passion for impartiality so come to share fate of eusapia patron frankly believe there be something crooked about business of gottfried plattner what that crooked factor be will admit a frankly know have be surprised at credit accorded to story in most unexpected authoritative quarter fairest way to reader however will be for to tell without further comment gottfried plattner be in spite of name freeborn englishman father be alsatian who came to england in beixties married respectable english girl of unexceptionable antecedent died after wholesome uneventful life devoted understand chiefly to laying of parquet flooring in gottfried age be seven twenty be by virtue of heritage of three language modern language master in small private school in south of england to casual observer be singularly like other modern language master in other small private school costume be very costly very fashionable on other hand be not markedly cheap shabby complexion like height bearing be inconspicuous must notice perhaps that like majority of people face be not absolutely symmetrical right eye little larger than left jaw trifle heavier on right side if a ordinary careless person be to bare chest feel heart beating must probably find quite like heart of anyone else here trained observer must part company if found heart quite ordinary trained observer must find quite otherwise once thing be pointed out to too must perceive peculiarity easily enough be that gottfried heart beat on right side of body now be not only singularity of gottfried structure although be only one must appeal to untrained mind careful sounding of gottfried internal arrangement by well known surgeon seems to point to fact that other unsymmetrical part of body be similarly misplaced right lobe of liver be on left side left on right while lung too be similarly contraposed what be still more singular unless gottfried be consummate actor must believe that right hand have recently become left since occurrence be about to consider a impartially a possible have found utmost difficulty in writing except from right to left across paper with left hand can not throw with right hand be perplexed at meal time between knife fork idea of rule of road be cyclist be still dangerous confusion there be not scrap of evidence to show that before occurrence gottfried be at left handed there be yet wonderful fact in preposterous business gottfried produce three photograph of have at age of five six thrusting fat leg at from under plaid frock scowling in photograph left eye be little larger than right jaw be trifle heavier on left side be reverse of present living condition photograph of gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict fact be because be one of cheap gem photograph be then in vogue taken direct upon metal therefore reversing thing just a looking glass must third photograph represents at one twenty confirms record of others there seems here evidence of strongest confirmatory character gottfried have exchanged left side for right yet how human being can be so changed short of fantastic pointless miracle be exceedingly hard to suggest in one way of course fact might be explicable on supposition that plattner have undertaken elaborate mystification on strength of heart displacement photograph may be faked left handedness imitated character of man doe not lend to such theory be quiet practical unobtrusive thoroughly sane from nordau standpoint like beer smoke moderately take walking exercise daily have healthily high estimate of value of teaching have good untrained tenor voice take pleasure in singing air of popular cheerful character be fond not morbidly fond of reading chiefly fiction pervaded with vaguely pious optimism sleep well rarely dream be in fact very last person to evolve fantastic fable indeed so far from forcing story upon world have be singularly reticent on matter meet enquirer with certain engaging bashfulness be almost word disarms most suspicious seems genuinely ashamed that anything so unusual have occurred to be to be regretted that plattner aversion to idea of post mortem dissection may postpone perhaps for ever positive proof that entire body have have left right side transposed upon fact mainly credibility of story hang there be way of taking man moving about in space a ordinary people understand space will result in changing side do right be still right left left can do with perfectly thin flat thing of course if be to cut figure out of paper figure with right left side must change side simply by lifting up turning over with solid be different mathematical theorist tell that only way in right left side of solid body can be changed be by taking that body clean out of space a know taking out of ordinary existence be turning somewhere outside space be little abstruse doubt anyone with knowledge of mathematical theory will assure reader of truth to put thing in technical language curious inversion of plattner right left side be proof that have moved out of space into what be called fourth dimension that have returned again to world unless choose to consider victim of elaborate motiveless fabrication be almost bound to believe that have occurred so much for tangible fact come now to account of phenomenon attended temporary disappearance from world appears that in sussexville proprietary school plattner not only discharged duty of modern language master also taught chemistry commercial geography bookkeeping shorthand drawing other additional subject to changing fancy of boy parent might direct attention knew little nothing of various subject in secondary a distinguished from board elementary school knowledge in teacher be very properly by mean so necessary a high moral character gentlemanly tone in chemistry be particularly deficient knowing say nothing beyond three gas three gas may be a however pupil began by knowing nothing derived information from caused anyone little inconvenience for several term then little boy named whibble joined school who have be educated seems by mischievous relative into inquiring habit of mind little boy followed plattner lesson with marked sustained interest in order to exhibit zeal on subject brought at various time substance for plattner to analyse plattner flattered by evidence of power of awakening interest trusting to boy ignorance analysed even made general statement a to composition indeed be so far stimulated by pupil a to obtain work upon analytical chemistry study during supervision of evening preparation be surprised to find chemistry quite interesting subject so far story be absolutely commonplace now greenish powder come upon scene source of greenish powder seems unfortunately lost master whibble tell tortuous story of finding done up in packet in disused limekiln near down must have be excellent thing for plattner possibly for master whibble family if match must have be applied to powder there then young gentleman certainly did not bring to school in packet in common eight ounce graduated medicine bottle plugged with masticated newspaper gave to plattner at end of afternoon school four boy have be detained after school prayer in order to complete neglected task plattner be supervising in small class room in chemical teaching be conducted appliance for practical teaching of chemistry in sussexville proprietary school a in most small school in country be characterised by severe simplicity be kept in small cupboard standing in recess having about same capacity a common travelling trunk plattner being bored with passive superintendence seems to have welcomed intervention of whibble with green powder a agreeable diversion unlocking cupboard proceeded at once with analytical experiment whibble sat luckily for at safe distance regarding four malefactor feigning profound absorption in work watched furtively with keenest interest for even within limit of three gas plattner practical chemistry be understand temerarious be practically unanimous in account of plattner proceeding poured little of green powder into test tube tried substance with water hydrochloric acid nitric acid sulphuric acid in succession getting result emptied out little heap nearly bottleful in fact upon slate

none of seriously hurt window be blown out into playground blackboard on easel be upset slate be smashed to atom plaster fell from ceiling other damage be done to school edifice appliance boy at first seeing nothing of plattner fancied be knocked down lying out of sight below desk jumped out of place to go to assistance be amazed to find space empty being still confused by sudden violence of report hurried to open door under impression that must have be hurt have rushed out of room carson foremost nearly collided in doorway with principal mr lidgett mr lidgett be corpulent excitable man with one eye boy describe a stumbling into room mouthing of tempered expletive irritable schoolmaster accustom to use lest worse befall wretched mumchancer said where mr plattner boy be agreed on very word wobbler snivelling puppy mumchancer be seems among ordinary small change of mr lidgett scholastic commerce where mr plattner be question be to be repeated many time in next few day really seemed a though frantic hyperbole blown to atom have for once realised there be not visible particle of plattner to be seen not drop of blood stitch of clothing to be found apparently have be blown clean out of existence left not wrack behind not so much a must cover sixpenny piece to quote proverbial expression evidence of absolute disappearance a consequence of explosion be indubitable be not necessary to enlarge here upon commotion excited in sussexville proprietary school in sussexville elsewhere by event be quite possible indeed that of reader of page may recall hearing of remote dying version of excitement during last summer holiday lidgett must seem did everything in power to suppress minimise story instituted penalty of twenty five line for mention of plattner name among boy stated in schoolroom that be clearly aware of assistant whereabouts be afraid explains that possibility of explosion happening in spite of elaborate precaution taken to minimise practical teaching of chemistry might injure reputation of school so might mysterious quality in plattner departure indeed did everything in power to make occurrence seem a ordinary a possible in particular cross examined five eye witness of occurrence so searchingly that began to doubt plain evidence of sens in spite of effort tale in magnified distorted state made nine day wonder in district several parent withdrew son on colourable pretext not least remarkable point in matter be fact that large number of people in neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dream of plattner during period of excitement before return that dream have curious uniformity in almost of plattner be seen sometimes singly sometimes in company wandering about through coruscating iridescence in case face be pale distressed in gesticulated towards dreamer one two of boy evidently under influence of nightmare fancied that plattner approached with remarkable swiftness seemed to look closely into very eye others fled with plattner from pursuit of vague extraordinary creature of globular shape fancy be forgotten in inquiry speculation when on wednesday next one after monday of explosion plattner returned circumstance of return be a singular a of departure so far a mr lidgett somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from plattner hesitating statement must appear that on wednesday evening towards hour of sunset former gentleman having dismissed evening preparation be engaged in garden picking eating strawberry fruit of be inordinately fond be large old fashioned garden secured from observation fortunately by high ivy covered red brick wall just a be stooping over particularly prolific plant there be flash in air heavy thud before must look round heavy body struck violently from behind be pitched forward crushing strawberry held in hand that so roughly that silk hat mr lidgett adheres to older idea of scholastic costume be driven violently down upon forehead almost over one eye heavy missile slid over sideways collapsed into sitting posture among strawberry plant proved to be long lost mr gottfried plattner in extremely dishevelled condition be collarless hatless linen be dirty there be blood upon hand mr lidgett be so indignant surprised that remained on four with hat jammed down on eye while expostulated vehemently with plattner for disrespectful unaccountable conduct scarcely idyllic scene completes what may call exterior version of plattner story exoteric aspect be quite unnecessary to enter here into detail of dismissal by mr lidgett such detail with full name date reference will be found in larger report of occurrence be laid before society for investigation of abnormal phenomenon singular transposition of plattner right left side be scarcely observed for first day so then first in connection with disposition to write from right to left across blackboard concealed rather than ostended curious confirmatory circumstance a considered must unfavourably affect prospect in new situation displacement of heart be discovered month after when be having tooth extracted under anaesthetic then very unwillingly allowed cursory surgical examination to be made of with view to brief account in journal of anatomy exhaust statement of material fact may now go on to consider plattner account of matter first let clearly differentiate between preceding portion of story what be to follow have told thus far be established by such evidence a even criminal lawyer must approve one of witness be still alive reader if have leisure may hunt lad out to morrow even brave terror of redoubtable lidgett cross examine trap test to heart content gottfried plattner twisted heart three photograph be producible may be taken a proved that did disappear for nine day a consequence of explosion that returned almost a violently under circumstance in nature annoying to mr lidgett detail of circumstance may be that returned inverted just a reflection return from mirror from last fact a have already stated follows almost inevitably that plattner during nine day must have be in state of existence altogether out of space evidence to statement be indeed far stronger than upon most murderer be hanged for own particular account of where have be with confused explanation wellnigh self contradictory detail have only mr gottfried plattner word wish to discredit must point out what so many writer upon obscure psychic phenomenon fail to do that be passing here from practically undeniable to kind of matter reasonable man be entitled to believe reject a think proper previous statement render plausible discordance with common experience tilt towards incredible must prefer not to sway beam of reader judgment way simply to tell story a plattner told gave narrative may state at house at chislehurst so soon a have left that evening went into study wrote down everything a remembered subsequently be good enough to read over type written copy so that substantial correctness be undeniable state that at moment of explosion distinctly thought be killed felt lifted off foot driven forcibly backward be curious fact for psychologist that thought clearly during backward flight wondered whether must hit chemistry cupboard blackboard easel heel struck ground staggered fell heavily into sitting position on something soft firm for moment concussion stunned became aware at once of vivid scent of singed hair seemed to hear voice of lidgett asking for will understand for time mind be greatly confused at first be under impression that be still standing in class room perceived quite distinctly surprise of boy entry of mr lidgett be quite positive upon score did not hear remark that ascribed to deafening effect of experiment thing about seemed curiously dark faint mind explained that on obvious mistaken idea that explosion have engendered huge volume of dark smoke through dimness figure of lidgett boy moved a faint silent a ghost plattner face still tingled with stinging heat of flash be say muddled first definite thought seem to have be of personal safety thought be perhaps blinded deafened felt limb face in gingerly manner then perception grew clearer be astonished to miss old familiar desk other schoolroom furniture about only dim uncertain grey shape stood in place of then came thing made shout aloud awoke stunned faculty to instant activity two of boy gesticulating walked one after other clean through neither manifested slightest consciousness of presence be difficult to imagine sensation felt came against say with more force than wisp of mist plattner first thought after be that be dead having be brought up with thoroughly sound view in matter however be little surprised to find body still about second conclusion be that be not dead that others be that explosion have destroyed sussexville proprietary school soul in except that too be scarcely satisfactory be thrown back upon astonished observation everything about be profoundly dark at first seemed to have altogether ebony blackness overhead be black firmament only touch of light in scene be faint greenish glow at edge of sky in one direction threw into prominence horizon of undulating black hill say be impression at first a eye grew accustomed to darkness began to distinguish faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in circumambient night against background furniture occupant of class room seems stood out like phosphorescent spectre faint impalpable extended hand thrust without effort through wall of room by fireplace describes a making strenuous effort to attract attention shouted to lidgett tried to seize boy a went to fro only desisted from attempt when mr lidgett whom a assistant master naturally disliked entered room say sensation of being in world yet not part of be extraordinarily disagreeable one compared feeling not inaptly to of cat watching mouse through window whenever made motion to communicate with dim familiar world about found invisible incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse then turned attention to solid environment found medicine bottle still unbroken in hand with remainder of green powder therein put in pocket began to feel about apparently be sitting on boulder of rock covered with velvety moss dark country about be unable to see faint misty picture of schoolroom blotting out have feeling due perhaps to cold wind that be near crest of hill that steep valley fell away beneath foot green glow along edge of sky seemed to be growing in extent intensity stood up rubbing eye must seem that made few step going steeply downhill then stumbled nearly fell sat down again upon jagged mass of rock to watch dawn became aware that world about be absolutely silent be a still a be dark though there be cold wind blowing up hill face rustle of grass soughing of bough must have accompanied be absent must hear therefore if must not see that hillside upon stood be rocky desolate green grew brighter moment a did so faint transparent blood red mingled with did not mitigate blackness of sky overhead rocky desolation about having regard to what follows be inclined to think that redness may have be optical effect due to contrast something black fluttered momentarily against livid yellow green of lower sky then thin penetrating voice of bell rose out of black gulf below oppressive expectation grew with growing light be probable that hour more elapsed while sat there strange green light growing brighter moment spreading slowly in flamboyant finger upward towards zenith a grew spectral vision of world became relatively absolutely fainter probably for time must have be about of earthly sunset so far a vision of world went plattner by few step downhill have passed through floor of class room be now seemed sitting in mid air in larger schoolroom downstairs saw boarder distinctly much more faintly than have seen lidgett be preparing evening task noticed with interest that several be cheating with euclid rider by mean of crib compilation whose existence have hitherto never suspected a time passed faded steadily a steadily a light of green dawn increased looking down into valley saw that light have crept far down rocky side that profound blackness of abyss be now broken by minute green glow like light of glow worm almost immediately limb of huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over basaltic undulation of distant hill monstrous hill mass about came out gaunt desolate in green light deep ruddy black shadow became aware of vast number of ball shaped object drifting a thistledown drift over high ground there be none of nearer to than opposite side of gorge bell below twanged quicker quicker with something like impatient insistence several light moved hither thither boy at work at desk be now almost imperceptibly faint extinction of world when green sun of other universe rose be curious point upon plattner insists during other world night be difficult to move about on account of vividness with thing of world be visible becomes riddle to explain why if be case in world catch glimpse of other world be due perhaps to comparatively vivid illumination of world of ours plattner describes midday of other world at brightest a not being nearly so bright a world at full moon while night be profoundly black consequently amount of light even in ordinary dark room be sufficient to render thing of other world invisible on same principle that faint phosphorescence be only visible in profoundest darkness have tried since told story to see something of other world by sitting for long space in photographer dark room at night have certainly seen indistinctly form of greenish slope rock only must admit very indistinctly indeed reader may possibly be more successful plattner tell that since return have dreamt seen recognised place in other world be probably due to memory of scene seems quite possible that people with unusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch glimpse of strange other world about however be digression a green sun rose long street of black building became perceptible though only darkly indistinctly in gorge after hesitation plattner began to clamber down precipitous descent towards descent be long exceedingly tedious being so not only by extraordinary steepness also by reason of looseness of boulder with whole face of hill be strewn noise of descent now then heel struck fire from rock seemed now only sound in universe for beating of bell have ceased a drew nearer perceived that various edifice have singular resemblance to tomb mausoleum monument saving only that be uniformly black instead of being white a most sepulchre be then saw crowding out of largest building very much a people disperse from church number of pallid rounded pale green figure dispersed in several direction about broad street of place going through side alley reappearing upon steepness of hill others entering of small black building lined way at sight of thing drifting up towards plattner stopped staring be not walking be indeed limbless have appearance of human head beneath tadpole like body swung be too astonished at strangeness too full indeed of strangeness to be seriously alarmed by drove towards in front of chill wind be blowing uphill much a soap bubble drive before draught a looked at nearest of approaching saw be indeed human head albeit with singularly large eye wearing such expression of distress anguish a have never seen before upon mortal countenance be surprised to find that did not turn to regard seemed to be watching following unseen moving thing for moment be puzzled then occurred to that creature be watching with enormous eye something be happening in world have just left nearer came nearer be too astonished to cry out made very faint fretting sound a came close to then struck face with gentle pat touch be very cold drove past upward towards crest of hill extraordinary conviction flashed across plattner mind that head have strong likeness to lidgett then turned attention to other head be now swarming thickly up hill side none made slightest sign of recognition one two indeed came close to head almost followed example of first dodged convulsively out of way upon most of saw same expression of unavailing regret have seen upon first heard same faint sound of wretchedness from one two wept one rolling swiftly uphill wore expression of diabolical rage others be cold several have look of gratified interest in eye one at least be almost in ecstasy of happiness plattner doe not remember that recognised more likeness in saw at time for several hour perhaps plattner watched strange thing dispersing over hill not till long after have ceased to issue from clustering black building in gorge did resume downward climb darkness about increased so much that have difficulty in stepping true overhead sky be now bright pale green felt hunger thirst later when did found chilly stream running down centre of gorge rare moss upon boulder when tried at last in desperation be good to eat groped about among tomb ran down gorge seeking vaguely for clue to inexplicable thing after long time came to entrance of big mausoleum like building from head have issued in found group of green light burning upon kind of basaltic altar bell rope from belfry overhead hanging down into centre of place round wall ran lettering of fire in character unknown to while be still wondering at purport of thing heard receding tramp of heavy foot echoing far down street ran out into darkness again must see nothing have mind to pull bell rope finally decided to follow footstep although ran far never overtook shouting be of avail gorge seemed to extend interminable distance be a dark a earthly starlight throughout length while ghastly green day lay along upper edge of precipice there be none of head now below be seemed busily occupied along upper slope looking up saw drifting hither thither hovering stationary flying swiftly through air reminded said of big snowflake only be black pale green in pursuing firm undeviating footstep that never overtook in groping into new region of endless devil dyke in clambering up down pitiless height in wandering about summit in watching drifting face plattner state that spent better part of seven eight day did not keep count say though once twice found eye watching have word with living soul slept among rock on hillside in gorge thing earthly be invisible because from earthly standpoint be far underground on altitude so soon a earthly day began world became visible to found sometimes stumbling over dark green rock arresting on precipitous brink while about green branch of sussexville lane be swaying again seemed to be walking through sussexville street watching unseen private business of household then be discovered that to almost human being in world there pertained of drifting head everyone in world be watched intermittently by helpless disembodiments what be watcher of living plattner never learned two presently found followed be like childhood memory of father mother now then other face turned eye upon eye like of dead people who have swayed injured helped in youth manhood whenever looked at plattner be overcome with strange sense of responsibility to mother ventured to speak made answer looked sadly steadfastly tenderly little reproachfully too seemed into eye simply tell story doe not endeavour to explain be left to surmise who watcher of living may be if be indeed dead why must so closely passionately watch world have left for ever may be indeed to mind seems just when life have closed when evil good be no longer choice for may still have to witness working out of train of consequence have laid if human soul continue after death then surely human interest continue after death be merely own guess at meaning of thing seen plattner offer interpretation for none be given be well reader must understand clearly day after day with head reeling wandered about strange lit world outside world weary towards end weak hungry by day by earthly day be ghostly vision of old familiar scenery of sussexville about irked worried must not see where to put foot ever again with chilly touch one of watching soul must come against face after dark multitude of watcher about intent distress confused mind beyond describing great longing to return to earthly life be so near yet so remote consumed unearthliness of thing about produced positively painful mental distress be worried beyond describing by own particular follower must shout at to desist from staring at scold at hurry away from be always mute intent run a might over uneven ground followed destiny on ninth day towards evening plattner heard invisible footstep approaching far away down gorge be then wandering over broad crest of same hill upon have fallen in entry into strange other world of turned to hurry down into gorge feeling way hastily be arrested by sight of thing be happening in room in back street near school of people in room knew by sight window be open blind up setting sun shone clearly into so that came out quite brightly at first vivid oblong of room lying like magic lantern picture upon black landscape livid green dawn in addition to sunlight candle have just be lit in room on bed lay lank man ghastly white face terrible upon tumbled pillow clenched hand be raised above head little table beside bed carried few medicine bottle toast water empty glass now then lank man lip fell apart to indicate word must not articulate woman did not notice that wanted anything because be busy turning out paper from old fashioned bureau in opposite corner of room at first picture be very vivid indeed a green dawn behind grew brighter brighter so became fainter more more transparent a echoing footstep paced nearer nearer footstep sound so loud in other world come so silently in plattner perceived about great multitude of dim face gathering together out of darkness watching two people in room never before have seen so many of watcher of living multitude have eye only for sufferer in room multitude in infinite anguish watched woman a hunted with greedy eye for something must not find crowded about plattner came across sight buffeted face noise of unavailing regret be about saw clearly only now then at other time picture quivered dimly through veil of green reflection upon movement in room must have be very still plattner say candle flame streamed up into perfectly vertical line of smoke in ear footfall echo beat like clap of thunder face two more particularly near woman one woman also white clear featured face might have once be cold hard be now softened by touch of wisdom strange to earth other might have be woman father be evidently absorbed in contemplation of act of hateful meanness so seemed must no longer guard against prevent behind be others teacher may be who have taught ill friend whose influence have failed over man too multitude none seemed to be parent teacher face might once have be coarse now purged to strength by sorrow in forefront one face girlish one angry remorseful merely patient weary a seemed to plattner waiting for relief power of description fail at memory of multitude of ghastly countenance gathered on stroke of bell saw in space of second must seem that be so worked on by excitement that quite involuntarily restless finger took bottle of green powder out of pocket held before doe not remember that abruptly footstep ceased waited for next there be silence then suddenly cutting through unexpected stillness like keen thin blade came first stroke of bell at that multitudinous face swayed to fro louder cry began about woman did not hear be burning something now in candle flame at second stroke everything grew dim breath of wind icy cold blew through host of watcher swirled about like eddy of dead leaf in spring at third stroke something be extended through to bed have heard of beam of light be like beam of darkness looking again at plattner saw that be shadowy arm hand green sun be now topping black desolation of horizon vision of room be very faint plattner must see that white of bed struggled be convulsed that woman looked round over shoulder at startled cloud of watcher lifted high like puff of green dust before wind swept swiftly downward towards temple in gorge then suddenly plattner understood meaning of shadowy black arm stretched across shoulder clutched prey did not dare turn head to see shadow behind arm with violent effort covering eye set to run made perhaps twenty stride then slipped on boulder fell fell forward on hand bottle smashed exploded a touched ground in moment found stunned bleeding sitting face to face with lidgett in old walled garden behind school there story of plattner experience end have resisted believe successfully natural disposition of writer of fiction to dress up incident of sort have told thing a far a possible in order in plattner told to have carefully avoided attempt at style effect construction must have be easy for instance to have worked scene of death bed into kind of plot in plattner might have be involved quite apart from objectionableness of falsifying most extraordinary true story such trite device must spoil to mind peculiar effect of dark world with livid green illumination drifting watcher of living unseen unapproachable to be yet lying about remains to add that death did actually occur in vincent terrace just beyond school garden so far a can be proved at moment of plattner return deceased be rate collector insurance agent widow who be much younger than married last month mr whymper veterinary surgeon of allbeeding a portion of story given here have in various form circulated orally in sussexville have consented to use of name on condition make distinctly known that emphatically contradicts detail of plattner account of husband last moment burnt will say although plattner never accused of doing so husband made one will just after marriage certainly from man who have never seen be account of furniture of room be curiously accurate one other thing even at risk of irksome repetition must insist upon lest seem to favour credulous superstitious view plattner absence from world for nine day be think proved that doe not prove story be quite conceivable that even outside space hallucination may be possible that at least reader must bear distinctly in mind xvi red room can assure said that will take very tangible ghost to frighten stood up before fire

of crystal egg mr cave glanced nervously towards door leading into parlour said five pound clergyman protested that price be high to companion a well a to mr cave be indeed very much more than mr cave have intended to ask when have stocked article attempt at bargaining ensued mr cave stepped to shop door held open five pound be price said a though wished to save trouble of unprofitable discussion a did so upper portion of woman face appeared above blind in glass upper panel of door leading into parlour stared curiously at two customer five pound be price said mr cave with quiver in voice swarthy young man have so far remained spectator watching cave keenly now spoke give five pound said clergyman glanced at to see if be in earnest when looked at mr cave again saw that latter face be white be lot of money said clergyman diving into pocket began counting resource have little more than thirty shilling appealed to companion with whom seemed to be on term of considerable intimacy gave mr cave opportunity of collecting thought began to explain in agitated manner that crystal be not a matter of fact entirely free for sale two customer be naturally surprised at inquired why have not thought of before began to bargain mr cave became confused stuck to story that crystal be not in market afternoon that probable purchaser of have already appeared two treating a attempt to raise price still further made a if must leave shop at point parlour door opened owner of dark fringe little eye appeared be coarse featured corpulent woman younger very much larger than mr cave walked heavily face be flushed that crystal be for sale said five pound be good enough price for ca think what be about cave not to take gentleman offer mr cave greatly perturbed by irruption looked angrily at over rim of spectacle without excessive assurance asserted right to manage business in own way altercation began two customer watched scene with interest amusement occasionally assisting mr cave with suggestion mr cave hard driven persisted in confused impossible story of inquiry for crystal that morning agitation became painful stuck to point with extraordinary persistence be young oriental who ended curious controversy proposed that must call again in course of two day so a to give alleged inquirer fair chance then must insist said clergyman five pound mr cave took on to apologise for husband explaining that be sometimes little odd a two customer left couple prepared for free discussion of incident in bearing mr cave talked to husband with singular directness poor little man quivering with emotion muddled between story maintaining on one hand that have customer in view on other asserting that crystal be honestly worth ten guinea why did ask five pound said wife do let manage business own way said mr cave mr cave have living with step daughter step son at supper night transaction be re discussed none of have high opinion of mr cave business method action seemed culminating folly be opinion be refused that crystal before said step son loose limbed lout of eighteen five pound said step daughter argumentative young woman of six twenty mr cave answer be wretched must only mumble weak assertion that knew own business best drove from half eaten supper into shop to close for night ear aflame tear of vexation behind spectacle why have left crystal in window so long folly of be trouble closest in mind for time must see way of evading sale after supper step daughter step son smartened up went out wife retired upstairs to reflect upon business aspect of crystal over little sugar lemon so forth in hot water mr cave went into shop stayed there until late ostensibly to make ornamental rockery for gold fish case really for private purpose will be better explained later next day mr cave found that crystal have be removed from window be lying behind second hand book on angling replaced in conspicuous position did not argue further about a nervous headache disinclined from debate mr cave be always disinclined day passed disagreeably mr cave be if anything more absent minded than usual uncommonly irritable withal in afternoon when wife be taking customary sleep removed crystal from window again next day mr cave have to deliver consignment of dog fish at one of hospital school where be needed for dissection in absence mr cave mind reverted to topic of crystal method of expenditure suitable to windfall of five pound have already devised very agreeable expedient among others dress of green silk for herself trip to richmond when jangling of front door bell summoned into shop customer be examination coach who came to complain of non delivery of certain frog asked for previous day mr cave did not approve of particular branch of mr cave business gentleman who have called in somewhat aggressive mood retired after brief exchange of word entirely civil so far a be concerned mr cave eye then naturally turned to window for sight of crystal be assurance of five pound of dream what be surprise to find gone went to place behind locker on counter where have discovered day before be not there immediately began eager search about shop when mr cave returned from business with dogfish about quarter to two in afternoon found shop in confusion wife extremely exasperated on knee behind counter routing among taxidermic material face came up hot angry over counter a jangling bell announced return forthwith accused of hiding hid what asked mr cave crystal at mr cave apparently much surprised rushed to window be here said great heaven what have become of just then mr cave step son re entered shop from inner room have come home minute so before mr cave be blaspheming freely be apprenticed to second hand furniture dealer down road have meal at home be naturally annoyed to find dinner ready when heard of loss of crystal forgot meal anger be diverted from mother to step father first idea of course be that have hidden mr cave stoutly denied knowledge of fate freely offering bedabbled affidavit in matter at last be worked up to point of accusing first wife then stepson of having taken with view to private sale so began exceedingly acrimonious emotional discussion ended for mr cave in peculiar nervous condition midway between hysteric amuck caused step son to be hour late at furniture establishment in afternoon mr cave took refuge from wife emotion in shop in evening matter be resumed with le passion in judicial spirit under presidency of step daughter supper passed unhappily culminated in painful scene mr cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation went out banging front door violently rest of family having discussed with freedom absence warranted hunted house from garret to cellar hoping to light upon crystal next day two customer called again be received by mr cave almost in tear transpired that one must imagine that have stood from cave at various time in married pilgrimage also gave garbled account of disappearance clergyman oriental laughed silently at one said be very extraordinary a mr cave seemed disposed to give complete history of life made to leave shop thereupon mr cave still clinging to hope asked for clergyman address so that if must get anything out of cave might communicate address be duly given apparently be afterwards mislaid mr cave can remember nothing about in evening of day cave seem to have exhausted emotion mr cave who have be out in afternoon supped in gloomy isolation contrasted pleasantly with impassioned controversy of previous day for time matter be very badly strained in cave household crystal customer reappeared now without mincing matter must admit that mr cave be liar knew perfectly well where crystal be be in room of mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator at st catherine hospital westbourne street stood on sideboard partially covered by black velvet cloth beside decanter of american whisky be from mr wace indeed that particular upon narrative be based be derived cave have taken off thing to hospital hidden in dog fish sack there have pressed young investigator to keep for mr wace be little dubious at first relationship to cave be peculiar have taste for singular character have more than once invited old man to smoke drink in room to unfold rather amusing view of life in general of wife in particular mr wace have encountered mr cave too on occasion when mr cave be not at home to attend to knew constant interference to cave be subjected having weighed story judicially decided to give crystal refuge mr cave promised to explain reason for remarkable affection for crystal more fully on later occasion spoke distinctly of seeing vision therein called on mr wace same evening told complicated story crystal said have come into possession with other oddment at forced sale of curiosity dealer effect not knowing what value might be have ticketed at ten shilling have hung upon hand at price for month be thinking of reducing figure when made singular discovery at time health be very bad must be borne in mind that throughout experience physical condition be one of ebb be in considerable distress by reason of negligence positive ill treatment even received from wife step child wife be vain extravagant unfeeling have growing taste for private drinking step daughter be mean over reaching step son have conceived violent dislike for lost chance of showing requirement of business pressed heavily upon mr wace doe not think that be altogether free from occasional intemperance have begun life in comfortable position be man of fair education suffered for week at stretch from melancholia insomnia afraid to disturb family must slip quietly from wife side when thought became intolerable wander about house about three o'clock one morning late in august chance directed into shop dirty little place be impenetrably black except in one spot where perceived unusual glow of light approaching discovered to be crystal egg be standing on corner of counter towards window thin ray smote through crack in shutter impinged upon object seemed a be to fill entire interior occurred to mr cave that be not in accordance with law of optic a have known in younger day must understand ray being refracted by crystal coming to focus in interior diffusion jarred with physical conception approached crystal nearly peering into round with transient revival of scientific curiosity that in youth have determined choice of calling be surprised to find light not steady writhing within substance of egg a though object be hollow sphere of luminous vapour in moving about to get different point of view suddenly found that have come between ray that crystal none le remained luminous greatly astonished lifted out of light ray carried to darkest part of shop remained bright for four five minute when slowly faded went out placed in thin streak of daylight luminousness be almost immediately restored so far at least mr wace be able to verify remarkable story of mr cave have repeatedly held crystal in ray of light have to be of le diameter than one millimetre in perfect darkness such a must be produced by velvet wrapping crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent must seem however that luminousness be of exceptional sort not equally visible to eye for mr harbinger whose name will be familiar to scientific reader in connection with pasteur institute be quite unable to see light mr wace own capacity for appreciation be out of comparison inferior to of mr cave even with mr cave power varied very considerably vision be most vivid during state of extreme weakness fatigue now from outset light in crystal exercised curious fascination upon mr cave say more for loneliness of soul than volume of pathetic writing must do that told human being of curious observation seems to have be living in such atmosphere of petty spite to admit existence of pleasure must have be to risk loss of found that a dawn advanced amount of diffused light increased crystal became to appearance non luminous for time be unable to see anything in except at night time in dark corner of shop use of old velvet cloth used a background for collection of mineral occurred to by doubling putting over head hand be able to get sight of luminous movement within crystal even in day time be very cautious lest must be thus discovered by wife practised occupation only in afternoon while be asleep upstairs then circumspectly in hollow under counter one day turning crystal about in hand saw something came went like flash gave impression that object have for moment opened to view of wide spacious strange country turning about did just a light faded see same vision again now must be tedious unnecessary to state phase of mr cave discovery from point suffice that effect be crystal being peered into at angle of about degree from direction of illuminating ray gave clear consistent picture of wide peculiar country side be not dream like at produced definite impression of reality better light more real solid seemed be moving picture be to say certain object moved in slowly in orderly manner like real thing according a direction of lighting vision changed picture changed also must indeed have be like looking through oval glass at view turning glass about to get at different aspect mr cave statement mr wace assures be extremely circumstantial entirely free from of emotional quality taint hallucinatory impression must be remembered that effort of mr wace to see similar clarity in faint opalescence of crystal be wholly unsuccessful try a must difference in intensity of impression received by two men be very great be quite conceivable that what be view to mr cave be mere blurred nebulosity to mr view a mr cave described be invariably of extensive plain seemed always to be looking at from considerable height a if from tower mast to east to west plain be bounded at remote distance by vast reddish cliff reminded of have seen in picture what picture be mr wace be unable to ascertain cliff passed north south must tell point of compass by star be visible of night receding in almost illimitable perspective fading into mist of distance before met be nearer eastern set of cliff on occasion of first vision sun be rising over black against sunlight pale against shadow appeared multitude of soaring form mr cave regarded a bird vast range of building spread below seemed to be looking down upon a approached blurred refracted edge of picture became indistinct there be also tree curious in shape in colouring deep mossy green exquisite grey beside wide shining canal something great brilliantly coloured flew across picture first time mr cave saw picture saw only in flash hand shook head moved vision came went grew foggy indistinct at first have greatest difficulty in finding picture again once direction of be lost next clear vision came about week after first interval having yielded nothing tantalising glimpse useful experience showed view down length of valley view be different have curious persuasion subsequent observation abundantly confirmed that be regarding strange world from exactly same spot although be looking in different direction long facade of great building whose roof have looked down upon before be now receding in perspective recognised roof in front of facade be terrace of massive proportion extraordinary length down middle of terrace at certain interval stood huge very graceful mast bearing small shiny object reflected setting sun import of small object did not occur to mr cave until time after a be describing scene to mr wace terrace overhung thicket of most luxuriant graceful vegetation beyond be wide grassy lawn on certain broad creature in form like beetle enormously larger reposed beyond again be richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone beyond lined with dense red weed passing up valley exactly parallel with distant cliff be broad mirror like expanse of water air seemed full of squadron of great bird manoeuvring in stately curve across river be multitude of splendid building richly coloured glittering with metallic tracery facet among forest of moss like lichenous tree suddenly something flapped repeatedly across vision like fluttering of jewelled fan beating of wing face rather upper part of face with very large eye came a be close to own a if on other side of crystal mr cave be so startled so impressed by absolute reality of eye that drew head back from crystal to look behind have become so absorbed in watching that be quite surprised to find in cool darkness of little shop with familiar odour of methyl mustiness decay a blinked about glowing crystal faded went out such be first general impression of mr cave story be curiously direct circumstantial from outset when valley first flashed momentarily on sens imagination be strangely affected a began to appreciate detail of scene saw wonder rose to point of passion went about business listless distraught thinking only of time when must be able to return to watching then few week after first sight of valley came two customer stress excitement of offer narrow escape of crystal from sale a have already told now while thing be mr cave secret remained mere wonder thing to creep to covertly peep at a child might peep upon forbidden garden mr wace have for young scientific investigator particularly lucid consecutive habit of mind directly crystal story came to have satisfied by seeing phosphorescence with own eye that there really be certain evidence for mr cave statement proceeded to develop matter systematically mr cave be only too eager to come feast eye on wonderland saw came night from half past eight until past ten sometimes in mr wace absence during day on sunday afternoon also came from outset mr wace made copious note be due to scientific method that relation between direction from initiating ray entered crystal orientation of picture be proved by covering crystal in box perforated only with small aperture to admit exciting ray by substituting black holland for buff blind greatly improved condition of observation so in little while be able to survey valley in direction desired so having cleared way may give brief account of visionary world within crystal thing be in case seen by mr cave method of working be invariably for to watch crystal report what saw while mr wace who a science student have learnt trick of writing in dark wrote brief note of report when crystal faded be put into box in proper position electric light turned on mr wace asked question suggested observation to clear up difficult point nothing indeed must have be le visionary more matter of fact attention of mr cave have be speedily directed to bird like creature have seen so abundantly present in of earlier vision first impression be soon corrected considered for time that might represent diurnal specie of bat then thought grotesquely enough that might be cherub head be round curiously human be eye of one of have so startled on second observation have broad silvery wing not feathered glistening almost a brilliantly a new killed fish with same subtle play of colour wing be not built on plan of bird wing bat mr wace learned supported by curved rib radiating from body sort of butterfly wing with curved rib seems best to express appearance body be small fitted with two bunch of prehensile organ like long tentacle immediately under mouth incredible a appeared to mr wace persuasion at last became irresistible that be creature owned great quasi human building magnificent garden made broad valley so splendid mr cave perceived that building with other peculiarity have door that great circular window opened freely gave creature egress entrance must alight upon tentacle fold wing to smallness almost rod like hop into interior among be multitude of smaller winged creature like great dragon fly moth flying beetle across greensward brilliantly coloured gigantic ground beetle crawled lazily to fro moreover on causeway terrace large headed creature similar to greater winged fly wingless be visible hopping busily upon hand like tangle of tentacle allusion have already be made to glittering object upon mast stood upon terrace of nearer building dawned upon mr cave after regarding one of mast very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that glittering object there be crystal exactly like into peered still more careful scrutiny convinced that one in vista of nearly twenty carried similar object occasionally one of large flying creature must flutter up to one folding wing coiling number of tentacle about mast must regard crystal fixedly for space sometimes for a long a fifteen minute series of observation made at suggestion of mr wace convinced watcher so far a visionary world be concerned crystal into peered actually stood at summit of end most mast on terrace that on one occasion at least one of inhabitant of other world have looked into mr cave face while be making observation so much for essential fact of very singular story unless dismiss a ingenious fabrication of mr wace have to believe one of two thing mr cave crystal be in two world at once that while be carried about in one remained stationary in other seems altogether absurd else that have peculiar relation of sympathy with exactly similar crystal in other world so what be seen in interior of one in world be under suitable condition visible to observer in corresponding crystal in other world vice versa at present indeed know of way in two crystal must so come en rapport nowadays know enough to understand that thing be not altogether impossible view of crystal a en rapport be supposition occurred to mr wace to at least seems extremely plausible where be other world on also alert intelligence of mr wace speedily threw light after sunset sky darkened rapidly there be very brief twilight interval indeed star shone out be recognisably same a see arranged in same constellation mr cave recognised bear pleiades aldebaran sirius so that other world must be somewhere in solar system at utmost only few hundred of million of mile from own following up clue mr wace learned that midnight sky be darker blue even than midwinter sky that sun seemed little smaller there be two small moon like moon smaller quite differently marked one of moved so rapidly that motion be clearly visible a one regarded moon be never high in sky vanished a rose be time revolved be eclipsed because be so near primary planet answer quite completely although mr cave did not know to what must be condition of thing on mar indeed seems exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into crystal mr cave did actually see planet mar inhabitant if be case then evening star shone so brilliantly in sky of distant vision be neither more le than own familiar earth for time martian if be martian seem to have known of mr cave inspection once twice one must come to peer go away very shortly to other mast a though vision be unsatisfactory during time mr cave be able to watch proceeding of winged people without being disturbed by attention although report be necessarily vague fragmentary be nevertheless very suggestive imagine impression of humanity martian observer must get who after difficult process of preparation with considerable fatigue to eye be able to peer at london from steeple of st martin church for stretch at longest of four minute at time mr cave be unable to ascertain if winged martian be same a martian who hopped about causeway terrace if latter must put on wing at will several time saw certain clumsy biped dimly suggestive of ape white partially translucent feeding among certain of lichenous tree once of fled before one of hopping round headed martian latter caught one in tentacle then picture faded suddenly left mr cave most tantalisingly in dark on occasion vast thing mr cave thought at first be gigantic insect appeared advancing along causeway beside canal with extraordinary rapidity a drew nearer mr cave perceived that be mechanism of shining metal of extraordinary complexity then when looked again have passed out of sight after time mr wace aspired to attract attention of martian next time that strange eye of one of appeared close to crystal mr cave cried out sprang away immediately turned on light began to gesticulate in manner suggestive of signalling when at last mr cave examined crystal again martian have departed thus far observation have progressed in early november then mr cave feeling that suspicion of family about crystal be allayed began to take to fro with in order that a occasion arose in daytime night might comfort with what be fast becoming most real thing in existence in december mr wace work in connection with forthcoming examination became heavy sitting be reluctantly suspended for week for ten eleven day be not quite sure saw nothing of cave then grew anxious to resume investigation stress of seasonal labour being abated went down to seven dial at corner noticed shutter before bird fancier window then at cobbler mr cave shop be closed rapped door be opened by step son in black at once called mr cave who be mr wace must not observe in cheap ample widow weed of most imposing pattern without very great surprise mr wace learnt that cave be dead already buried be in tear voice be little thick have just returned from highgate mind seemed occupied with own prospect honourable detail of obsequies mr wace be at last able to learn particular of cave death have be found dead in shop in early morning day after last visit to mr wace crystal have be clasped in stone cold hand face be smiling said mr cave velvet cloth from mineral lay on floor at foot must have be dead five six hour when be found came a great shock to wace began to reproach bitterly for having neglected plain symptom of old man ill health chief thought be of crystal approached that topic in gingerly manner because knew mr cave peculiarity be dumfounded to learn that be sold mr cave first impulse directly cave body have be taken upstairs have be to write to mad clergyman who have offered five pound for crystal informing of recovery after violent hunt in daughter joined be convinced of loss of address a be without mean required to mourn bury cave in elaborate style dignity of old seven dial inhabitant demand have appealed to friendly fellow tradesman in great portland street have very kindly taken over portion of stock at valuation valuation be own crystal egg be included in one of lot mr wace after few suitable condolence little off handedly proffered perhaps hurried at once to great portland street there learned that crystal egg have already be sold to tall dark man in grey there material fact in curious to at least very suggestive story come abruptly to end great portland street dealer did not know who tall dark man in grey be have observed with sufficient attention to describe minutely did not even know way person have gone after leaving shop for time mr wace remained in shop trying dealer patience with hopeless question venting own exasperation at last realising abruptly that whole thing have passed out of hand have vanished like vision of night returned to own room little astonished to find note have made still tangible visible upon untidy table annoyance disappointment be naturally very great made second call equally ineffectual upon great portland street dealer resorted to

resume search whether not will remain lost for ever with material origin of be thing equally speculative at present time if present purchaser be collector one must have expected enquiry of mr wace to

will give chance of being read by ordinary consumer of fiction own idea in matter be practically identical with of mr wace believe crystal on mast in mar crystal egg of mr cave to be in physical at

lead to expectation of miracle be clerk at gomshott be greatly addicted to assertive argument be while be asserting impossibility of miracle that have first intimation of extraordinary power particular argument be being held in bar of long dragon toddy beamish be conducting opposition by monotonous effective so say that drove mr fotheringay to very limit of patience there be present besides two very dusty cyclist landlord cox miss maybridge perfectly respectable rather portly barmaid of dragon miss maybridge be standing with back to mr fotheringay washing glass others be watching more le amused by present ineffectiveness of assertive method goaded by torres vedras tactic of mr beamish mr fotheringay determined to make unusual rhetorical effort looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let clearly understand what miracle be be something contrariwise to course of nature done by power of will something what must happen without being specially willed so say said mr beamish repulsing mr fotheringay appealed to cyclist who have hitherto be silent auditor received assent given with hesitating cough glance at mr beamish landlord must express opinion mr fotheringay returning to mr beamish received unexpected concession of qualified assent to definition of miracle for instance said mr fotheringay greatly encouraged here must be miracle lamp in natural course of nature must burn like upsy down must beamish say must said beamish said fotheringay mean to say eh said beamish reluctantly must very well said mr fotheringay then here come someone a might be along here stand a might be here say to lamp a might do collecting will turn upsy down without breaking go on burning steady hullo be enough to make anyone say impossible incredible be visible to lamp hung inverted in air burning quietly with flame pointing down be a solid a indisputable a ever lamp be prosaic common lamp of long dragon bar mr fotheringay stood with extended forefinger knitted brow of one anticipating catastrophic smash cyclist who be sitting next lamp ducked jumped across bar everybody jumped more le miss maybridge turned screamed for nearly three second lamp remained still faint cry of mental distress came from mr fotheringay ca keep up said longer staggered back inverted lamp suddenly flared fell against corner of bar bounced aside smashed upon floor went out be lucky have metal receiver whole place must have be in blaze mr cox be first to speak remark shorn of needle excrescence be to effect that fotheringay be fool fotheringay be beyond disputing even so fundamental proposition a that be astonished beyond measure at thing have occurred subsequent conversation threw absolutely light on matter so far a fotheringay be concerned general opinion not only followed mr cox very closely very vehemently everyone accused fotheringay of silly trick presented to a foolish destroyer of comfort security mind be in tornado of perplexity be inclined to agree with made remarkably ineffectual opposition to proposal of departure went home flushed heated coat collar crumpled eye smarting ear red watched of ten street lamp nervously a passed be only when found alone in little bedroom in church row that be able to grapple seriously with memory of occurrence ask what on earth happened have removed coat boot be sitting on bed with hand in pocket repeating text of defence for seventeenth time did want confounded thing to upset when occurred to that at precise moment have said commanding word have inadvertently willed thing said that when have seen lamp in air have felt that depended on to maintain there without being clear how be to be done have not particularly complex mind might have stuck for time at inadvertently willed embracing a doe abstrusest problem of voluntary action a be idea came to with quite acceptable haziness from following a must admit clear logical path came to test of experiment pointed resolutely to candle collected mind though felt did foolish thing be raised up said in second that feeling vanished candle be raised hung in air one giddy moment a mr fotheringay gasped fell with smash on toilet table leaving in darkness save for expiring glow of wick for time mr fotheringay sat in darkness perfectly still did happen after said 'ow be to explain know sighed heavily began feeling in pocket for match must find none rose groped about toilet table wish have match said resorted to coat there be none there then dawned upon that miracle be possible even with match extended hand scowled at in dark let there be match in hand said felt light object fall across palm finger closed upon match after several ineffectual attempt to light discovered be safety match threw down then occurred to that might have willed lit did perceived burning in midst of toilet table mat caught up hastily went out perception of possibility enlarged felt for replaced candle in candlestick here be lit said mr fotheringay forthwith candle be flaring saw little black hole in toilet cover with wisp of smoke rising from for time stared from to little flame back then looked up met own gaze in looking glass by help communed with in silence for time how about miracle now said mr fotheringay at last addressing reflection subsequent meditation of mr fotheringay be of severe confused description so far must see be case of pure willing with nature of experience so far disinclined for further experiment at least until have reconsidered lifted sheet of paper turned glass of water pink then green created snail miraculously annihilated got miraculous new tooth brush somewhere in small hour have reached fact that will power must be of particularly rare pungent quality fact of have indeed have inkling before certain assurance scare perplexity of first discovery be now qualified by pride in evidence of singularity by vague intimation of advantage became aware that church clock be striking one a did not occur to that daily duty at gomshott might be miraculously dispensed with resumed undressing in order to get to bed without further delay a struggled to get shirt over head be struck with brilliant idea let be in bed said found so undressed stipulated finding sheet cold added hastily in nightshirt ho in nice soft woollen nightshirt ah said with immense enjoyment now let be comfortably asleep awoke at usual hour be pensive through breakfast time wondering whether over night experience might not be particularly vivid dream at length mind turned again to cautious experiment for instance have three egg for breakfast two landlady have supplied good shoppy one be delicious fresh goose egg laid cooked served by extraordinary will hurried off to gomshott in state of profound carefully concealed excitement only remembered shell of third egg when landlady spoke of night day must do work because of astonishing new self knowledge caused inconvenience because made up for miraculously in last ten minute a day wore on state of mind passed from wonder to elation albeit circumstance of dismissal from long dragon be still disagreeable to recall garbled account of matter have reached colleague led to badinage be evident must be careful how lifted frangible article in other way gift promised more more a turned over in mind intended among other thing to increase personal property by unostentatious act of creation called into existence pair of very splendid diamond stud hastily annihilated again a young gomshott came across counting house to desk be afraid young gomshott might wonder how have come by saw quite clearly gift required caution watchfulness in exercise so far a must judge difficulty attending mastery must be no greater than have already faced in study of cycling be that analogy perhaps quite a much a feeling that must be unwelcome in long dragon drove out after supper into lane beyond gasworks to rehearse few miracle in private there be possibly certain want of originality in attempt for apart from will power mr fotheringay be not very exceptional man miracle of moses rod came to mind night be dark unfavourable to proper control of large miraculous snake then recollected story of tannhaeuser that have read on back of philharmonic programme seemed to singularly attractive harmless stuck walking stick very nice poona penang lawyer into turf edged footpath commanded dry wood to blossom air be immediately full of scent of rose by mean of match saw for that beautiful miracle be indeed accomplished satisfaction be ended by advancing footstep afraid of premature discovery of power addressed blossoming stick hastily go back what meant be change back of course be confused stick receded at considerable velocity incontinently came cry of anger bad word from approaching person who be throwing bramble at fool cried voice got on shin be sorry old chap said mr fotheringay then realising awkward nature of explanation caught nervously at moustache saw winch one of three immering constable advancing what d'yer mean by asked constable hullo be be gent broke lamp at long dragon mean anything by said mr fotheringay nothing at what d'yer do for then oh bother said mr fotheringay indeed d'yer know that stick hurt what d'yer do for eh for moment mr fotheringay must not think what have done for silence seemed to irritate mr winch have be assaulting police young man time be what done look here mr winch said mr fotheringay annoyed confused be sorry very fact be well must think of way truth be working miracle tried to speak in off hand way try a must must working 'ere talk rot working miracle indeed miracle well that be downright funny why be chap believe in miracle fact be be of silly conjuring trick be what be now tell mr fotheringay never heard what mr winch be going to tell realised have given away flung valuable secret to wind of heaven violent gust of irritation swept to action turned on constable swiftly fiercely here said have have enough of have will show silly conjuring trick will go to hades go now be alone mr fotheringay performed more miracle night did trouble to see what have become of flowering stick returned to town scared very quiet went to bedroom lord said be powerful gift extremely powerful gift did hardly mean a much a that not really wonder what hades be like sat on bed taking off boot struck by happy thought transferred constable to san francisco without more interference with normal causation went soberly to bed in night dreamt of anger of winch next day mr fotheringay heard two interesting item of news someone have planted most beautiful climbing rose against elder mr gomshott private house in lullaborough road river a far a rawling mill be to be dragged for constable winch mr fotheringay be abstracted thoughtful day performed miracle except certain provision for winch miracle of completing day work with punctual perfection in spite of bee swarm of thought hummed through mind extraordinary abstraction meekness of manner be remarked by several people made matter for jesting for most part be thinking of winch on sunday evening went to chapel oddly enough mr maydig who took certain interest in occult matter preached about thing be not lawful mr fotheringay be not regular chapelgoer system of assertive scepticism to have already alluded be now very much shaken tenor of sermon threw entirely new light on novel gift suddenly decided to consult mr maydig immediately after service so soon a be determined found wondering why have not done so before mr maydig lean excitable man with quite remarkably long wrist neck be gratified at request for private conversation from young man whose carelessness in religious matter be subject for general remark in town after few necessary delay conducted to study of manse be contiguous to chapel seated comfortably standing in front of cheerful fire leg threw rhodian arch of shadow on opposite wall requested mr fotheringay to state business at first mr fotheringay be little abashed found difficulty in opening matter will scarcely believe mr maydig be afraid so forth for time tried question at last asked mr maydig opinion of miracle mr maydig be still saying well in extremely judicial tone when mr fotheringay interrupted again believe suppose that common sort of person like for instance a might be sitting here now might have sort of twist inside that made able to do thing by will be possible said mr maydig something of sort perhaps be possible if might make free with something here think might show by sort of experiment said mr fotheringay now take that tobacco jar on table for instance what want to know be whether what be going to do with be miracle not just minute mr maydig please knitted brow pointed to tobacco jar said be bowl of vi'lets tobacco jar did a be ordered mr maydig started violently at change stood looking from thaumaturgist to bowl of flower said nothing presently ventured to lean over table smell violet be fresh picked very fine one then stared at mr fotheringay again how did do that asked mr fotheringay pulled moustache just told there be be that miracle be black art what be what do think matter with be what want to ask be most extraordinary occurrence day last week knew more must do thing like than did came quite sudden be something odd about will suppose be a far a can see be that only thing must do other thing besides lord yes said mr fotheringay just anything thought suddenly recalled conjuring entertainment have seen here pointed change into bowl of fish not that change into glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in be better see that mr maydig be astonishing be incredible be either most extraordinary must change into anything said mr fotheringay just anything here be pigeon will in moment blue pigeon be fluttering round room making mr maydig duck time came near stop there will said mr fotheringay pigeon hung motionless in air must change back to bowl of flower said after replacing pigeon on table worked that miracle expect will want pipe in bit said restored tobacco jar mr maydig have followed later change in sort of ejaculatory silence stared at mr fotheringay in very gingerly manner picked up tobacco jar examined replaced on table well be only expression of feeling now after that be easier to explain what came about said mr fotheringay proceeded to lengthy involved narrative of strange experience beginning with affair of lamp in long dragon complicated by persistent allusion to winch a went on transient pride mr maydig consternation have caused passed away became very ordinary mr fotheringay of everyday intercourse again mr maydig listened intently tobacco jar in hand bearing changed also with course of narrative presently while mr fotheringay be dealing with miracle of third egg minister interrupted with fluttering extended hand be possible said be credible be amazing of course reconciles number of amazing difficulty power to work miracle be gift peculiar quality like genius second sight hitherto have come very rarely to exceptional people in casei have always wondered at miracle of mahomet at yogi miracle miracle of madame blavatsky of course yes be simply gift carry out so beautifully argument of great thinker mr maydig voice sank grace duke of argyll here plumb profounder law deeper than ordinary law of nature yes yes go on go on mr fotheringay proceeded to tell of misadventure with winch mr maydig no longer overawed scared began to jerk limb about interject astonishment be what troubled most proceeded mr fotheringay be be most mijitly in want of advice for of course be at san francisco wherever san francisco may be of course be awkward for of a will see mr maydig see how can understand what have happened daresay be scared exasperated something tremendous trying to get at daresay keep on starting off to come here send back by miracle few hour when think of of course be thing wo be able to understand be bound to annoy of course if take ticket time will cost lot of money done best must for of course be difficult for to put in place thought afterwards that clothes might have got scorched know if hades be be supposed to be before shifted in case suppose 'd have locked up in san francisco of course willed new suit of clothes on directly thought of see be already in deuce of tangle mr maydig looked serious see be in tangle yes be difficult position how be to end became diffuse inconclusive however will leave winch for little discus larger question think be case of black art anything of sort think there be taint of criminality about at mr fotheringay none unless be suppressing material fact be miracle pure miracle miracle if may say so of very highest class began to pace hearthrug gesticulate while mr fotheringay sat with arm on table head on arm looking worried see how be to manage about winch said gift of working miracle apparently very powerful gift said mr maydig will find way about winch never fear dear sir be most important man man of most astonishing possibility a evidence for example in other way thing may do yes have thought of thing two said mr fotheringay of thing came bit twisty saw that fish at first wrong sort of bowl wrong sort of fish thought 'd ask someone proper course said mr maydig very proper course altogether proper course stopped looked at mr fotheringay be practically unlimited gift let test power for instance if really be if really be seem to be so incredible a may seem in study of little house behind congregational chapel on evening of sunday nov mr fotheringay egged on inspired by mr maydig began to work miracle reader attention be specially definitely called to date will object probably have already objected that certain point in story be improbable that if thing of sort already described have indeed occurred must have be in paper at time detail immediately following will find particularly hard to accept because among other thing involve conclusion that reader in question must have be killed in violent unprecedented manner more than year ago now miracle be nothing if not improbable a matter of fact reader be killed in violent unprecedented manner in in subsequent course of story will become perfectly clear credible a right minded reasonable reader will admit be not place for end of story being little beyond hither side of middle at first miracle worked by mr fotheringay be timid little miracle little thing with cup parlour fitment a feeble a miracle of theosophist feeble a be be received with awe by collaborator must have preferred to settle winch business out of hand mr maydig must not let after have worked dozen of domestic triviality sense of power grew imagination began to show sign of stimulation ambition enlarged first larger enterprise be due to hunger negligence of mr minchin mr maydig meal to minister conducted mr fotheringay be certainly ill laid uninviting a refreshment for two industrious miracle worker be seated mr maydig be descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon housekeeper shortcoming before occurred to mr fotheringay that opportunity lay before think mr maydig said if be liberty dear mr fotheringay of course did think mr fotheringay waved hand what will have said in large inclusive spirit at mr maydig order revised supper very thoroughly a for said eyeing mr maydig selection be always particularly fond of tankard of stout nice welsh rarebit will order ai much given to burgundy forthwith stout welsh rarebit promptly appeared at command sat long at supper talking like equal a mr fotheringay presently perceived with glow of surprise gratification of miracle must presently do by by mr maydig said mr fotheringay might perhaps be able to help in domestic way quite follow said mr maydig pouring out glass of miraculous old burgundy mr fotheringay helped to second welsh rarebit out of vacancy took mouthful be thinking said might be able chum chum to work chum chum miracle with mr minchin chum chum make better woman mr maydig put down glass looked doubtful be strongly object to interference know mr fotheringay a matter of fact be well past eleven be probably in bed asleep do think on whole mr fotheringay considered objection see that must be done in sleep for time mr maydig opposed idea then yielded mr fotheringay issued order little le at ease perhaps two gentleman proceeded with repast mr maydig be enlarging on change might expect in housekeeper next day with optimism seemed even to mr fotheringay supper sens little forced hectic when series of confused noise from upstairs began eye exchanged interrogation mr maydig left room hastily mr fotheringay heard calling up to housekeeper then footstep going softly up to in minute so minister returned step light face radiant wonderful said touching most touching began pacing hearthrug repentance most touching repentance through crack of door poor woman most wonderful change have got up must have got up at once have got up out of sleep to smash private bottle of brandy in box to confess too give open most amazing vista of possibility if can work miraculous change in thing unlimited seemingly said mr fotheringay about mr winch altogether unlimited from hearthrug mr maydig waving winch difficulty aside unfolded series of wonderful proposal proposal invented a went along now what proposal be doe not concern essential of story suffice that be designed in spirit of infinite benevolence sort of benevolence used to be called post prandial suffice too that problem of winch remained unsolved be necessary to describe how far that series got to fulfilment there be astonishing change small hour found mr maydig mr fotheringay careering across chilly market square under still moon in sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy mr maydig flap gesture mr fotheringay short bristling longer abashed at greatness have reformed drunkard in parliamentary division changed beer alcohol to water mr maydig have overruled mr fotheringay on point have further greatly improved railway communication of place drained flinder swamp improved soil of one tree hill cured vicar wart be going to see what must be done with injured pier at south bridge place gasped mr maydig wo be same place to morrow how surprised thankful everyone will be just at moment church clock struck three say said mr fotheringay be three o'clock must be getting back have got to be at business by eight besides mr wimms be only beginning said mr maydig full of sweetness of unlimited power be only beginning think of good be doing when people wake said mr fotheringay mr maydig gripped arm suddenly eye be bright wild dear chap said there be hurry look pointed to moon at zenith joshua joshua said mr fotheringay joshua said mr maydig why not stop mr fotheringay looked at moon be bit tall said after pause why not said mr maydig of course doe stop stop rotation of earth know time stop be a if be doing harm h be said mr fotheringay well sighed will try here buttoned up jacket addressed to habitable globe with a good assumption of confidence a lay in power jest stop rotating will said mr fotheringay incontinently be flying head over heel through air at rate of dozen of mile minute in spite of innumerable circle be describing per second thought for thought be wonderful sometimes a sluggish a flowing pitch sometimes a instantaneous a light thought in second willed let come down safe sound else happens let down safe sound willed only just in time for clothes heated by rapid flight through air be already beginning to singe came down with forcible by mean injurious bump in what appeared to be mound of fresh turned earth large mass of metal

fotheringay scarce able to speak for gale have have squeak what be gone wrong storm thunder only minute ago fine night be maydig set on to sort of thing what wind if go on fooling in way be bound to have thundering accident where be maydig what confounded mess everything in looked about so far a flapping jacket must permit appearance of thing be really extremely strange sky right anyhow said mr fotheringay be about be right even there look like terrific gale coming up there be moon overhead just a be just now bright a midday a for rest where be village where be where be anything what on earth set wind blowing did order wind mr fotheringay struggled to get to foot in vain after one failure remained on four holding on surveyed moonlit world to leeward with tail of jacket streaming over head there be something seriously wrong said mr fotheringay what be goodness know far wide nothing be visible in white glare through haze of dust drove before screaming gale tumbled mass of earth heap of inchoate ruin tree house familiar shape only wilderness of disorder vanishing at last into darkness beneath whirling column streamer lightning thunderings of swiftly rising storm near in livid glare be something might once have be elm tree smashed mass of splinter shivered from bough to base further twisted mass of iron girder only too evidently viaduct rose out of piled confusion see when mr fotheringay have arrested rotation of solid globe have made stipulation concerning trifling movable upon surface earth spin so fast that surface at equator be travelling at rather more than

violently than if have be fired out of cannon human being living creature house tree world a know have be so jerked smashed utterly destroyed be thing mr fotheringay did not of course fully appreciate perceived that miracle have miscarried with great disgust of miracle came upon be in darkness now for cloud have swept together blotted out momentary glimpse of moon air be full of fitful struggling tortured wraith of hail great roaring of wind water filled earth sky peering under hand through dust sleet to windward saw by play of lightning vast wall of water pouring towards maydig screamed mr fotheringay feeble voice amid elemental uproar here maydig stop cried mr fotheringay to advancing water oh for goodness ' sake stop just moment said mr fotheringay to lightning thunder stop jest

glorious time have young people in pale brown cleanly city of memory be once world only sorrow be shortness of time said indeed that electric tram ' building criminal advertisement glare upon forum outraged aesthetic feeling unspeakably be only part of fun indeed rome be such wonderful place that made miss winchelsea forget of most carefully prepared enthusiasm at time helen taken unawares must suddenly admit beauty of unexpected thing yet fanny helen must have liked shop window so in english quarter if miss winchelsea uncompromising hostility to other english visitor have not rendered that district impossible intellectual aesthetic fellowship of miss winchelsea scholarly young man passed insensibly towards deeper feeling exuberant fanny did best to keep pace with recondite admiration by playing beautiful with vigour saying oh let go with enormous appetite whenever new place of interest be mentioned helen developed certain want of sympathy towards end disappointed miss winchelsea little refused to see anything in face of beatrice cenci shelley beatrice cenci in barberini gallery one day when be deploring electric tram said rather snappishly that people must get about somehow

wonderful association about to more intimate personal feeling in tentative way information be supplied spoke allusively of school of examination success of gladness that day of cram be over made quite clear that also be teacher spoke of greatness of calling of necessity of sympathy to face irksome detail of certain loneliness sometimes felt be in colosseum be a far a got day because helen returned

terrible vacillation period even when something almost like passion bid throw refinement to wind there be something in unexpurgated vestige of vulgarity made strenuous attempt at proving snook be not so very bad name after hovering hesitation flew before fanny manner when fanny came with air of catastrophe to tell that also knew horror fanny voice fell to whisper when said snook miss winchelsea

night of flight pain be in open place near great temple at paestum at last on blank stony place dotted with spiky bush empty desolate so flat that grove of eucalyptus far away showed to foot of stem how can see lady be sitting down under bush resting little for be very weak weary be standing up watching to see if must tell distance of firing came went be still know fighting far from other with terrible new weapon have never before be used gun must carry beyond sight aeroplane must do what must do man must foretell knew that be between two army that drew together knew be in danger that must not stop there rest though thing be in mind be in background seemed to be affair beyond concern chiefly be thinking of lady aching distress filled for first time have owned beaten have fallen weeping behind must hear sobbing must not turn round to because knew have need of weeping have held so far so long for be well thought that must weep rest then must toil on again for have inkling of thing hung so near even now can see a sat there lovely hair upon shoulder can mark again deepening hollow of cheek 'if have parted ' said have let go ' 'no said 'even now repent will not repent made choice will hold on to end then overhead in sky flashed something burst about heard bullet making noise like handful of pea suddenly thrown chipped stone about whirled fragment from brick passed put hand to mouth then moistened lip at flash have turned about know stood up stood up know moved step towards a though wanted to reach have be shot through heart stopped stared at felt that foolish incapacity englishman feel on such occasion met eye for moment then stared out of window for long space kept silence when at last looked at be sitting back in corner arm folded teeth gnawing at knuckle bit nail suddenly stared at carried said towards temple in arm a though mattered know why seemed sort of sanctuary know have lasted so long suppose must have died almost instantly only talked to way silence again have seen temple said abruptly indeed have brought still sunlit arcade of worn sandstone very vividly before be brown one big brown one sat down on fallen pillar held in arm silent after first babble be over after little while lizard came out ran about again a though nothing unusual be going on a though nothing have changed be tremendously still there sun high shadow still even shadow of weed upon entablature be still in spite of thudding banging went about sky seem to remember that aeroplane came up out of south that battle went away to west one aeroplane be struck overset fell remember that though did interest in least did seem to signify be like wounded gull know flapping for time in water must see down aisle of temple black thing in bright blue water three four time shell burst about beach then ceased time happened lizard scuttled in hid for space be mischief done except once stray bullet gashed stone hard by made just fresh bright surface a shadow grew longer stillness seemed greater curious thing remarked with manner of man who make trivial conversation be did think did think at sat with in arm amidst stone in sort of lethargy stagnant remember waking up remember dressing day know found in office with letter slit open in front of how be struck by absurdity of being there seeing that in reality be sitting stunned in paestum temple with dead woman in arm read letter like machine have forgotten what be about stopped there be long silence suddenly perceived that be running down incline from chalk farm to euston started at passing of time turned on with brutal question with tone of now never did dream again yes seemed to force to finish voice be very low once more a be only for few instant seemed to have suddenly awakened out of great apathy to have risen into sitting position body lay there on stone beside gaunt body not know so soon be not may have heard voice know only knew clearly that men be coming into solitude that be last outrage stood up walked through temple then there came into sight first one man with yellow face dressed in uniform of dirty white trimmed with blue then several climbing to crest of old wall of vanished city crouching there be little bright figure in sunlight there hung weapon in hand peering cautiously before further away saw others then more at point in wall be long lax line of men in open order presently man have first seen stood up shouted command men came tumbling down wall into high weed towards temple scrambled down with led came facing towards when saw stopped at first have watched men with mere curiosity when have seen meant to come to temple be moved to forbid shouted to officer must not come here ' cried be here be here with dead stared then shouted question back to in unknown tongue repeated what have said shouted again folded arm stood still presently spoke to men came forward carried drawn sword signed to to keep away continued to advance told again very patiently clearly 'you must not come here be old temple be here with dead presently be so close must see face clearly be narrow face with dull grey eye black moustache have scar on upper lip be dirty unshaven kept shouting unintelligible thing question perhaps at know now that be afraid of at time did not occur to a tried to explain to interrupted in imperious tone bidding suppose stand aside made to go past caught hold of saw face change at grip fool ' cried know be dead ' started back looked at with cruel eye saw sort of exultant resolve leap into delight then suddenly with scowl swept sword back so thrust stopped abruptly became aware of change in rhythm of train brake lifted voice carriage jarred jerked present world insisted upon became clamorous saw through steamy window huge electric light glaring down from tall mast upon fog saw row of stationary empty carriage passing by then signal box hoisting constellation of green red into murky london twilight marched after looked again at drawn feature ran through heart be with sort of astonishment fear no pain just amazement that felt pierce felt sword drive home into body did hurt know did hurt at yellow platform light came into field of view passing first rapidly then slowly at last stopping with jerk dim shape of men passed to fro without euston cried voice do mean there be pain no sting smart amazement then darkness sweeping over everything hot brutal face before face of man who have killed seemed to recede swept out of existence euston clamoured voice outside euston carriage door opened admitting flood of sound porter stood regarding sound of door slamming hoof clatter of cab horse behind thing featureless remote roar of london cobble stone came to ear truck load of lighted lamp blazed along platform darkness flood of darkness opened spread blotted out thing luggage sir said porter be end asked seemed to hesitate then almost inaudibly answered mean must get to be there on other side of temple then yes insisted yes nightmare cried nightmare indeed god great bird fought tore xxvi valley of spider towards mid day three pursuer came abruptly round bend in torrent bed upon sight of very broad spacious valley difficult winding trench of pebble along have tracked fugitive for so long expanded to broad slope with common impulse three men left trail rode to little eminence set with olive dun tree there halted two others a became little behind man with silver studded bridle for space scanned great expanse below with eager eye spread remoter remoter with only few cluster of sere thorn bush here there dim suggestion of now waterless ravine to break desolation of yellow grass purple distance melted at last into bluish slope of further hill hill might be of greener kind above invisibly supported seeming indeed to hang in blue be snow clad summit of mountain grew larger bolder to northwestward a side of valley drew together westward valley opened until distant darkness under sky told where forest began three men looked east west only steadfastly across valley gaunt man with scarred lip be first to speak nowhere said with sigh of disappointment in voice after have full day start know be after said little man on white horse must know said leader bitterly a if speaking to even then ca go fast have got beast mule to day girl foot have be bleeding man with silver bridle flashed quick intensity of rage on do think have seen that snarled help anyhow whispered little man to gaunt man with scarred lip stared impassively ca be over valley said if ride hard glanced at white horse paused curse white horse said man with silver bridle turned to scan beast curse included little man looked down between melancholy ear of steed did best said two others stared again across valley for space gaunt man passed back of hand across scarred lip come up said man who owned silver bridle suddenly little man started jerked rein horse hoof of three made multitudinous faint pattering upon withered grass a turned back towards trail rode cautiously down long slope before so came through waste of prickly twisted bush strange dry shape of thorny branch grew amongst rock into level below there trail grew faint for soil be scanty only herbage be scorched dead straw lay upon ground still by hard scanning by leaning beside horse neck pausing ever again even white men must contrive to follow after prey there be trodden place bent broken blade of coarse grass ever again sufficient intimation of footmark once leader saw brown smear of blood where half caste girl may have trod at under breath cursed for fool gaunt man checked leader tracking little man on white horse rode behind man lost in dream rode one after man with silver bridle led way spoke never word after time came to little man on white horse that world be very still started out of dream besides little noise of horse equipment whole great valley kept brooding quiet of painted scene before went master fellow intently leaning forward to left impassively moving with pace of horse shadow went before still noiseless tapering attendant nearer crouched cool shape be own looked about be have gone then remembered reverberation from bank of gorge perpetual accompaniment of shifting jostling pebble moreover there be breeze be what vast still place be monotonous afternoon slumber sky open blank except for sombre veil of haze have gathered in upper valley straightened back fretted with bridle puckered lip to whistle simply sighed turned in saddle for time stared at throat of mountain gorge out of have come blank blank slope on side with never sign of decent beast tree much le man what land be what wilderness dropped again into former pose filled with momentary pleasure to see wry stick of purple black flash out into form of snake vanish amidst brown after infernal valley be alive then to rejoice still more came little breath across face whisper came went faintest inclination of stiff black antlered bush upon little crest first intimation of possible breeze idly wetted finger held up pulled up sharply to avoid collision with gaunt man who have stopped at fault upon trail just at guilty moment caught master eye looking towards for time forced interest in tracking then a rode on again studied master shadow hat shoulder appearing disappearing behind gaunt man nearer contour have ridden four day out of very limit of world into desolate place short of water with nothing strip of dried meat under saddle over rock mountain where surely none fugitive have ever be before for be for girl mere wilful child man have whole cityfuls of people to do basest bidding girl woman why in name of passionate folly one in particular asked little man scowled at world licked parched lip with blackened tongue be way of master be knew just because sought to evade eye caught whole row of high plumed cane bending in unison then tail of silk that hung before neck flapped fell breeze be growing stronger somehow took stiff stillness out of thing be well hullo said gaunt man three stopped abruptly what asked master what over there said gaunt man pointing up valley what something coming towards a spoke yellow animal crested rise came bearing down upon be big wild dog coming before wind tongue out at steady pace running with intensity of purpose that did not seem to see horseman approached ran with nose up following be plain neither scent quarry a drew nearer little man felt for sword be mad said gaunt rider shout said little man shouted dog came on then when little man blade be already out swerved aside went panting by passed eye of little man followed flight there be foam said for space man with silver studded bridle stared up valley oh come on cried at last what doe matter jerked horse into movement again little man left insoluble mystery of dog fled from nothing wind lapsed into profound musing on human character come on whispered to why must be given to one man to say 'come on ' with stupendous violence of effect always life man with silver bridle have be saying that if said thought little man people marvelled when master be disobeyed even in wildest thing half caste girl seemed to seemed to one mad blasphemous almost little man by way of comparison reflected on gaunt rider with scarred lip a stalwart a master a brave indeed perhaps braver yet for there be obedience nothing to give obedience duly stoutly certain sensation of hand knee called little man back to more immediate thing became aware of something rode up beside gaunt fellow do notice horse said in undertone gaunt face looked interrogation like wind said little man dropped behind a man with silver bridle turned upon be right said gaunt faced man rode on again for space in silence foremost two rode downcast upon trail hindmost man watched haze crept down vastness of valley nearer nearer noted how wind grew in strength moment by moment far away on left saw line of dark bulk wild hog perhaps galloping down valley of that said nothing did remark again upon uneasiness of horse then saw first one then second great white ball great shining white ball like gigantic head of thistledown drove before wind athwart path ball soared high in air dropped rose again caught for moment hurried on passed at sight of restlessness of horse increased then presently saw that more of drifting globe then soon very many more be hurrying towards down valley became aware of squealing athwart path huge boar rushed turning head for one instant to glance at then hurling on down valley again at three stopped sat in saddle staring into thickening haze be coming upon if be not for thistle down began leader now big globe came drifting past within score of yard of be really not even sphere at vast soft ragged filmy thing sheet gathered by corner aerial jelly fish a be rolling over over a advanced trailing long cobwebby thread streamer floated in wake be thistle down said little man like stuff said gaunt man looked at one curse cried leader air full of lit up there if keep on at pace long will stop altogether instinctive feeling such a line out herd of deer at approach of ambiguous thing prompted to turn horse to wind ride forward for few pace stare at advancing multitude of floating mass came on before wind with sort of smooth swiftness rising falling noiselessly sinking to earth rebounding high soaring with perfect unanimity with still deliberate assurance right left of horseman pioneer of strange army passed at one rolled along ground breaking shapelessly trailing out reluctantly into long grappling ribbon band three horse began to shy dance master be seized with sudden unreasonable impatience cursed drifting globe roundly get on cried get on do thing matter how can matter back to trail fell swearing at horse sawed bit across mouth shouted aloud with rage will follow trail tell cried where be trail gripped bridle of prancing horse searched amidst grass long clinging thread fell across face grey streamer dropped about bridle arm big active thing with many leg ran down back of head looked up to discover one of grey mass anchored a be above by thing flapping out end a sail flap when boat come about noiselessly have impression of many eye of dense crew of squat body of long many jointed limb hauling at mooring rope to bring thing down upon for space stared up reining in prancing horse with instinct born of year of horsemanship then flat of sword smote back blade flashed overhead cut drifting balloon of spider web free whole mass lifted softly drove clear away spider cried voice of gaunt man thing be full of big spider look lord man with silver bridle still followed mass drove away look lord master found staring down at red smashed thing on ground that in spite of partial obliteration must still wriggle unavailing leg then when gaunt man pointed to mass that bore down upon drew sword hastily up valley now be like fog bank torn to rag tried to grasp situation ride for little man be shouting ride for down valley what happened then be like confusion of battle man with silver bridle saw little man go past slashing furiously at imaginary cobweb saw cannon into horse of gaunt man hurl rider to earth own horse went dozen pace before must rein in then looked up to avoid imaginary danger then back again to see horse rolling on ground gaunt man standing slashing over at rent fluttering mass of grey streamed wrapped about thick fast a thistle down on waste land on windy day in july cobweb mass be coming on little man have dismounted dared not release horse be endeavouring to lug struggling brute back with strength of one arm while with other slashed aimlessly tentacle of second grey mass have entangled with struggle second grey mass came to mooring slowly sank master set teeth gripped bridle lowered head spurred horse forward horse on ground rolled over there be blood moving shape upon flank gaunt man suddenly leaving ran forward towards master perhaps ten pace leg be swathed encumbered with grey made ineffectual movement with sword grey streamer waved from there be thin veil of grey across face with left hand beat at something on body suddenly stumbled fell struggled to rise fell again suddenly horribly began to howl oh ohoo ohooh master must see great spider upon others upon ground a strove to force horse nearer to gesticulating screaming grey object struggled up down there came clatter of hoof little man in act of mounting swordless balanced on belly athwart white horse clutching mane whirled past again clinging thread of grey gossamer swept across master face about over seemed drifting noiseless cobweb circled drew nearer to day of death never knew just how event of moment happened did indeed turn horse did really of own accord stampede after fellow suffice that in second be galloping full tilt down valley with sword whirling furiously overhead about on quickening breeze spider air ship air bundle air sheet seemed to to hurry in conscious pursuit clatter clatter thud thud man with silver bridle rode heedless of direction with fearful face looking up now right now left sword arm ready to slash few hundred yard ahead of with tail of torn cobweb trailing behind rode little man on white horse still imperfectly in saddle reed bent before wind blew fresh strong over shoulder master must see web hurrying to overtake be so intent to escape spider web only a horse gathered together for leap did realise ravine ahead then realised only to misunderstand interfere be leaning forward on horse neck sat up back too late if in excitement have failed to leap at rate have not forgotten how to fall be horseman again in mid air came off clear with mere bruise upon shoulder horse rolled kicking spasmodic leg lay still master sword drove point into hard soil snapped clean across a though chance refused longer a knight splintered end missed face by inch so be on foot in moment breathlessly scanning on rushing spider web for moment be minded to run then thought of ravine turned back ran aside once to dodge one drifting terror then be swiftly clambering down precipitous side out of touch of gale there under lee of dry torrent steeper bank might crouch watch strange grey mass pas pas in safety till wind fell became possible to escape there for long time crouched watching strange grey ragged mass trail streamer across narrowed sky once stray spider fell into ravine close beside full foot measured from leg to leg body be man hand after have watched monstrous alacrity of search escape for little while tempted to bite broken sword lifted up iron heeled boot smashed into pulp swore a did so for time sought up down for then presently when be surer spider swarm must not drop into ravine found place where must sit down sat fell into deep thought began after manner to gnaw knuckle bite nail from be moved by coming of man with white horse heard long before saw a clattering of hoof stumbling footstep reassuring voice then little man appeared rueful figure still with tail of white cobweb trailing behind approached other without speaking without salutation little man be fatigued shamed to pitch of hopeless bitterness came to stop at last face to face with seated master latter winced little under dependent eye well said at last with pretence of authority left horse bolted know so did mine laughed at master mirthlessly say horse bolted said man who once have silver studded bridle coward said little man other gnawed knuckle through meditative moment with eye on inferior call coward said at length be coward like coward possibly there be limit beyond man must fear that have learnt at last not like be where difference come in never must have dreamt must have left saved life two minute before why be lord master gnawed knuckle again countenance be dark man call coward said broken sword be better than none one spavined white horse can not be expected to carry two men four day journey hate white horse time can not be helped begin to understand perceive that be minded on strength of what have seen fancy to taint reputation be men of sort who unmake king besides never liked lord said little man said master no stood up sharply a little man moved for minute perhaps faced one overhead spider ball went driving there be quick movement among pebble running of foot cry of despair gasp blow towards wind fell sun set in calm serenity man who have once possessed silver bridle came at last very cautiously by easy slope out of ravine again now led white horse once belonged to little man must have gone back to horse to get silver mounted bridle again feared night quickening breeze might still find in valley besides disliked greatly to think might discover horse swathed in cobweb perhaps unpleasantly eaten a thought of cobweb of danger have be through manner in have be preserved that day hand sought little reliquary that hung about neck clasped for moment with heartfelt gratitude a did so eye went across valley be hot with passion said now have met reward also doubt behold far away out of wooded slope across valley in clearness of sunset distinct unmistakable saw little spire of smoke at expression of serene resignation changed to amazed anger smoke turned head of white horse about hesitated a did so little rustle of air went through grass about far away upon reed swayed tattered sheet of grey looked at cobweb looked at smoke perhaps after be not said at last knew better after have stared at smoke for time mounted white horse a rode picked way amidst stranded mass of web for reason there be many dead spider on ground lived feasted guiltily on fellow at sound of horse hoof fled time have passed from ground without wind to carry winding sheet ready thing for poison must do little evil flicked with belt at fancied came too near once where number ran together over bare place be minded to dismount trample with boot impulse overcame ever again turned in saddle looked back at smoke spider muttered over over again spider well well next time must spin web xxvii new accelerator certainly if ever man found guinea when

edge of desk with green phial think know stuff already have got something coming nervous smile upon face betrayed gravity of revelation rarely talked of actual experimental work unless thing be very near end may be may be must be surprised may even do thing at greater rate than twice will be rather big thing hazarded will be think rather big thing think quite knew what big thing be to be for

try stuff said a went along passage rather said gibberne turning on in study there be in little green phial there unless happen to be afraid be careful man by nature only theoretically adventurous be afraid on other hand there be pride well haggled say have tried have tried said look hurt by do even look livery feel sat down give potion said if worst come to worst will save having hair cut think be one of most hateful duty of civilised man how do take mixture with water said gibberne whacking down carafe stood up in front of desk regarded in easy chair manner be suddenly affected by touch of harley street specialist be rum stuff know said made gesture with hand must warn in first place a soon a have got down to shut eye open very cautiously in minute so time one still see sense of vision be question of length of vibration not of multitude of impact there be kind of shock to retina nasty giddy confusion just at time if eye be open keep shut shut said good next thing be keep still begin to whack about may fetch something nasty rap if do remember will be going several thousand time faster than ever did before heart lung muscle brain everything will hit hard without knowing wo know

little measure glanced at material on desk glass said water here must take too much for first attempt little phial glucked out precious content forget what told said turning content of measure into glass in manner of italian waiter measuring whisky sit with eye tightly shut in absolute stillness for two minute said then will hear speak added inch so of water to little dose in glass by by said put glass down keep in hand rest hand on knee yes so now raised glass new accelerator said new accelerator answered touched glass drank instantly closed eye know that blank non existence into one drop when one have taken gas for indefinite interval be like then heard gibberne telling to wake up stirred opened eye there stood a have be standing glass still in hand be empty that be difference well said nothing out of way nothing slight feeling of exhilaration perhaps nothing more sound thing be still said by jove yes be still except sort of faint pat patter like rain falling on different thing what be analysed sound think said be not sure glanced at window have ever seen curtain before window fixed in way before followed eye there be end of curtain frozen a be corner high in act of flapping briskly in breeze said be odd here said opened hand held glass naturally winced expecting glass to smash so far from smashing did not even seem to stir in mid air motionless roughly speaking said gibberne object in latitude fall foot in first second glass be falling foot in second now only see have be falling yet for hundredth part of second give idea of pace of accelerator waved hand round round over under slowly sinking glass finally took by bottom pulled down placed very carefully on table eh said to laughed that seems right said began very gingerly to raise from chair felt perfectly well very light comfortable quite confident in mind be going fast over heart for example be beating thousand time second caused discomfort at looked out of window immovable cyclist head down with frozen puff of dust behind driving wheel scorched to overtake galloping char banc did not stir gaped in amazement at incredible spectacle gibberne cried how long will confounded stuff last heaven know answered last time took went to bed slept off tell be frightened must have lasted minute think seemed like hour after bit slows down rather suddenly believe be proud to observe did not feel frightened suppose because there be two of why must go out asked why not will see not goodness why will be going thousand time faster than quickest conjuring trick be ever done come along way will go window door out by window went assuredly of strange experience have ever have imagined read of other people having imagining little raid made with gibberne on folkestone lea under influence of new accelerator be strangest maddest of went out by gate into road there made minute examination of statuesque passing traffic top of wheel of leg of horse of char banc end of whip lash lower jaw of conductor who be just beginning to yawn be perceptibly in motion rest of lumbering conveyance seemed still quite noiseless except for faint rattling came from one man throat a part of frozen edifice there be driver know conductor eleven people effect a walked about thing began by being madly queer ended by being disagreeable there be people like ourselves yet not like ourselves frozen in careless attitude caught in mid gesture girl man smiled at one leering smile threatened to last for evermore woman in floppy capelline rested arm on rail stared at gibberne house with unwinking stare of eternity man stroked moustache like figure of wax stretched tiresome stiff hand with extended finger towards loosened hat stared at laughed at made face at then sort of disgust of came upon turned away walked round in front of cyclist towards lea goodness cried gibberne suddenly look there pointed there at tip of finger sliding down air with wing flapping slowly at speed of exceptionally languid snail be bee so came out upon lea there thing seemed madder than ever band be playing in upper stand though sound made for be low pitched wheezy rattle sort of prolonged last sigh that passed at time into sound like slow muffled ticking of monstrous clock frozen people stood erect strange silent self conscious looking dummy hung unstably in mid stride promenading upon grass passed close to little poodle dog suspended in act of leaping watched slow movement of leg a sank to earth lord look here cried gibberne halted for moment before magnificent person in white faint striped flannel white shoe panama hat who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed lady have passed wink studied with such leisurely deliberation a must afford be unattractive thing loses quality of alert gaiety one remark that winking eye doe not completely close that under drooping lid appears lower edge of eyeball little line of white heaven give memory said will never wink again smile said gibberne with eye on lady answering teeth be infernally hot somehow said let go slower oh come along said gibberne picked way among bath chair in path many of people sitting in chair seemed almost natural in passive pose contorted scarlet of bandsman be not restful thing to see purple faced little gentleman be frozen in midst of violent struggle to refold newspaper against wind there be many evidence that people in sluggish way be exposed to considerable breeze breeze have existence so far a sensation went came out walked little way from crowd turned regarded to see multitude changed to picture smitten rigid a be into semblance of realistic wax be impossibly wonderful be absurd of course filled with irrational exultant sense of superior advantage consider wonder of have said thought done since stuff have begun to work in vein have happened so far a people so far a world in general went in twinkling of eye new accelerator began gibberne interrupted there be that infernal old woman said what old woman life next door to said gibberne have lapdog yap god temptation be strong there be something very boyish impulsive about gibberne at time before must expostulate with have dashed forward snatched unfortunate animal out of visible existence be running violently with towards cliff of lea be most extraordinary little brute know did bark wriggle make slightest sign of vitality kept quite stiffly in attitude of somnolent repose gibberne held by neck be like running about with dog of wood gibberne cried put down then said something else if run like gibberne cried will set clothes on fire linen trouser be going brown a be clapped hand on thigh stood hesitating on verge gibberne cried coming up put down heat be too much be running so two three mile second friction of air what said glancing at dog friction of air shouted friction of air going too fast like meteorite thing too hot gibberne gibberne be over pricking sort of perspiration can see people stirring slightly believe stuff working off put that dog down eh said be working off repeated be too hot stuff working off be wet through stared at then at band wheezy rattle of whose performance be certainly going faster then with tremendous sweep of arm hurled dog away from went spinning upward still inanimate hung at last over grouped parasol of knot of chattering people gibberne be gripping elbow by jove cried believe be sort of hot pricking yes that man moving pocket handkerchief perceptibly must get out of sharp must not get out of sharply enough luckily perhaps for might have run if have run must believe have burst into flame almost certainly must have burst into flame know have of thought of before must even begin to run action of drug have ceased be business of minute fraction of second effect of new accelerator passed like drawing of curtain vanished in movement of hand heard gibberne voice in infinite alarm sit down said flop down upon turf at edge of lea sat scorching a sat there be patch of burnt grass there still where sat down whole stagnation seemed to wake up a did so disarticulated vibration of band rushed together into blast of music promenaders put foot down walked way paper flag began flapping

dese ant dey come go be business for men after that talked frequently of ant to holroyd whenever chanced to drift against speck of humanity in waste of water sunshine distant tree holroyd improving knowledge of language enabled to recognise ascendant word saueba more more completely dominating whole perceived ant be becoming interesting nearer drew to more interesting became gerilleau abandoned old theme almost suddenly portuguese lieutenant became conversational figure knew something about leaf cutting ant expanded knowledge gerilleau sometimes rendered what have to tell to holroyd told of little worker that swarm fight big worker command rule how latter always crawled to neck how bite drew blood told how cut leaf made fungus bed how nest in caracas be sometimes hundred yard across two day three men spent disputing whether ant have eye discussion grew dangerously heated on second afternoon holroyd saved situation by going ashore in boat to catch ant see captured various specimen

asked holroyd yes dey sting dere be poison in sting meditated see what men can do against ant dey come go go will said gerilleau past tamandu there be long low coast of eighty mile without population then one come to confluence of main river batemo arm like great lake then forest came nearer came at last intimately near character of channel change snag abound benjamin constant moored by cable night under very shadow of dark tree for first time for many day came spell of coolness holroyd gerilleau sat late smoking cigar enjoying delicious sensation gerilleau mind be full of ant what must do decided to sleep at last lay down on mattress on deck man hopelessly perplexed last word when already seemed asleep be to ask with flourish of despair what can one do with ant de whole thing be absurd holroyd be left to scratch bitten wrist meditate alone sat on bulwark listened to little change in gerilleau breathing until be fast asleep then ripple lap of stream took mind brought back that sense of immensity have be growing upon since first have left para come up river monitor showed one small light there be first little talking forward then stillness eye went from dim black outline of middle work of gunboat towards bank to black overwhelming mystery of forest lit now then by fire fly never still from murmur of alien mysterious activity be inhuman immensity of land astonished oppressed knew sky be empty of men star be speck in incredible vastness of space knew ocean be enormous untamable in england have come to think of land a man in england be indeed man be wild thing live by sufferance grow on lease everywhere road fence absolute security run in atlas too land be man coloured to show claim to in vivid contrast to universal independent blueness of sea have taken for granted that day must come when everywhere about earth plough culture light tramway good road ordered security must prevail now doubted forest be interminable have air of being invincible man seemed at best infrequent precarious intruder one travelled for mile amidst still silent struggle of giant tree of strangulating creeper of assertive flower everywhere alligator turtle endless variety of bird insect seemed at home dwelt irreplaceably man man at most held footing upon resentful clearing fought weed fought beast insect for barest foothold fell prey to snake beast insect fever be presently carried away in many place down river have be manifestly driven back deserted creek that preserved name of casa here there ruinous white wall shattered tower enforced lesson puma jaguar be more master here who be real master in few mile of forest there must be more ant than there be men in whole world seemed to holroyd perfectly new idea in few thousand year men have emerged from barbarism to stage of civilisation that made feel lord of future master of earth what be to prevent ant evolving also such ant a one knew lived in little community of few thousand individual made concerted effort against greater world have language have intelligence why must thing stop at more than men have stopped at barbaric stage suppose presently ant began to store knowledge just a men have done by mean of book record use weapon form great empire sustain planned organised war thing came back to that gerilleau have gathered about ant be approaching used poison like poison of snake obeyed greater leader even a leaf cutting ant do be carnivorous where came stayed forest be very still water lapped incessantly against side about lantern overhead there eddied noiseless whirl of phantom moth gerilleau stirred in darkness sighed what can one do murmured turned over be still again holroyd be roused from meditation be becoming sinister by hum of mosquito ii next morning holroyd learnt be within forty kilometre of badama interest in bank intensified came up whenever opportunity offered to examine surroundings must see sign of human occupation save for weedy ruin of house green stained facade of long deserted monastery at moju with forest tree growing out of vacant window space great creeper netted across vacant portal several flight of strange yellow butterfly with semi transparent wing crossed river that morning many alighted on monitor be killed by men be towards afternoon that came upon derelict cuberta did not at first appear to be derelict sail be set hanging slack in afternoon calm there be figure of man sitting on fore planking beside shipped sweep man appeared to be sleeping face downwards on sort of longitudinal bridge big canoe have in waist be presently apparent from sway of rudder way drifted into course of gunboat that something be out of order with gerilleau surveyed through field glass became interested in queer darkness of face of sitting man red faced man seemed without nose crouching be rather than sitting longer captain looked le liked to look at le able be to take glass away did so at last went little way to call up holroyd then went back to hail cuberta hailed again so drove past santa rosa stood out clearly a name a came by into wake of monitor pitched little suddenly figure of crouching man collapsed a though joint have given way hat fell off head be not nice to look at body flopped lax rolled out of sight behind bulwark caramba cried gerilleau resorted to holroyd forthwith holroyd be way up companion did see dat said captain dead said holroyd yes 'd better send boat aboard there be something wrong did by chance see face what be like be ugh have word captain suddenly turned back on holroyd became active strident commander gunboat came about steamed parallel to erratic course of canoe dropped boat with lieutenant da cunha three sailor to board then curiosity of captain made draw up almost alongside a lieutenant got aboard so that whole of santa rosa deck hold be visible to holroyd saw now clearly that sole crew of vessel be two dead men though must not see face saw by outstretched hand be of ragged flesh that have be subjected to strange exceptional process of decay for moment attention concentrated on two enigmatical bundle of dirty clothes laxly flung limb then eye went forward to discover open hold piled high with trunk case aft to where little cabin gaped inexplicably empty then became aware that plank of middle decking be dotted with moving black speck attention be riveted by speck be walking in direction radiating from fallen man in manner image came unsought to mind like crowd dispersing from bull fight became aware of gerilleau beside capo said have glass can focus a closely a plank there gerilleau made effort grunted handed glass there followed moment of scrutiny be ant said englishman handed focused field glass back to gerilleau impression of be of crowd of large black ant very like ordinary ant except for size for fact that of larger of bore sort of clothing of grey at time inspection be too brief for particular head of lieutenant da cunha appeared over side of cuberta brief colloquy ensued must go aboard said gerilleau lieutenant objected that boat be full of ant have boot said gerilleau lieutenant changed subject how did men die asked captain gerilleau embarked upon speculation holroyd must not follow two men disputed with certain increasing vehemence holroyd took up field glass resumed scrutiny first of ant then of dead man amidships have described ant to very particularly say be a large a ant have ever seen black moving with steady deliberation very different from mechanical fussiness of common ant about one in twenty be much larger than fellow with exceptionally large head reminded at once of master worker who be said to rule over leaf cutter ant like seemed to be directing co ordinating general movement tilted body back in manner altogether singular a if made use of fore foot have curious fancy that be too far off to verify most of ant of kind be wearing accoutrement have thing strapped about body by bright white band like white metal thread put down glass abruptly realising that question of discipline between captain subordinate have become acute be duty said captain to go aboard be instruction lieutenant seemed on verge of refusing head of one of mulatto sailor appeared beside believe men be killed by ant said holroyd abruptly in english captain burst into rage made answer to holroyd have commanded to go aboard screamed to subordinate in portuguese if go aboard forthwith be mutiny rank mutiny mutiny cowardice where be courage must animate will have in iron will have shot like dog began torrent of abuse curse danced to fro shook fist behaved a if beside with rage lieutenant white still stood looking at crew appeared forward with amazed face suddenly in pause of outbreak lieutenant came to heroic decision saluted drew together clambered upon deck of cuberta ah said gerilleau mouth shut like trap holroyd saw ant retreating before da cunha boot portuguese walked slowly to fallen man stooped down hesitated clutched coat turned over black swarm of ant rushed out of clothes da cunha stepped back very quickly trod two three time on deck holroyd put up glass saw scattered ant about invader foot doing what have never seen ant doing before have nothing of blind movement of common ant be looking at a rallying crowd of men might look at gigantic monster have dispersed how did die captain shouted holroyd understood portuguese to say body be too much eaten to tell what be there forward asked gerilleau lieutenant walked few pace began answer in portuguese stopped abruptly beat off something from leg made peculiar step a if be trying to stamp on something invisible went quickly towards side then controlled turned about walked deliberately forward to hold clambered up to fore decking from sweep be worked stooped for time over second man groaned audibly made way back aft to cabin moving very rigidly turned began conversation with captain cold respectful in tone on side contrasting vividly with wrath insult of few moment before holroyd gathered only fragment of purport reverted to field glass be surprised to find ant have vanished from exposed surface of deck turned towards shadow beneath decking seemed to be full of watching eye cuberta be agreed be derelict too full of ant to put men aboard to sit sleep must be towed lieutenant went forward to take in adjust cable men in boat stood up to be ready to help holroyd glass searched canoe became more more impressed by fact that great if minute furtive activity be going on perceived that number of gigantic ant seemed nearly couple of inch in length carrying oddly shaped burthen for must imagine use be moving in rush from one point of obscurity to did not move in column across exposed place in open spaced out line oddly suggestive of rush of modern infantry advancing under fire number be taking cover under dead man clothes perfect swarm be gathering along side over da cunha must presently go did not see actually rush for lieutenant a returned have doubt did make concerted rush suddenly lieutenant be shouting cursing beating at leg be stung shouted with face of hate accusation towards gerilleau then vanished over side dropped into boat plunged at once into water holroyd heard splash three men in boat pulled out brought aboard night died iii holroyd captain came out of cabin in swollen contorted body of lieutenant lay stood together at stern of monitor staring at sinister vessel trailed behind be close dark night have only phantom flickerings of sheet lightning to illuminate cuberta vague black triangle rocked about in steamer wake sail bobbing flapping black smoke from funnel spark lit ever again streamed over swaying mast gerilleau mind be inclined to run on unkind thing lieutenant have said in heat of last fever say murdered protested be simply absurd someone 'ad to go aboard be to run away from confounded ant whenever show up holroyd said nothing be thinking of disciplined rush of little black shape across bare sunlit planking be place to go harped gerilleau died in execution of duty what have to complain of murdered poor fellow be what be demented be not in right mind poison swelled u be came to long silence will sink that canoe burn then inquiry irritated shoulder went up hand flew out at right angle from body what be one to do said voice going up to angry squeak anyhow broke out vindictively ant in dat cuberta will burn dem alive holroyd be not moved to conversation distant ululation of howling monkey filled sultry night with foreboding sound a gunboat drew near black mysterious bank be reinforced by depressing clamour of frog what be one to do captain repeated after vast interval suddenly becoming active savage blasphemous decided to burn santa rosa without further delay everyone aboard be pleased by idea everyone helped with zest pulled in cable cut dropped boat fired with tow kerosene soon cuberta be crackling flaring merrily amidst immensity of tropical night holroyd watched mounting yellow flare against blackness livid flash of sheet lightning came went above forest summit throwing into momentary silhouette stoker stood behind watching also stoker be stirred to depth of linguistics saueba go pop pop said wahaw laughed richly holroyd be thinking that little creature on decked canoe have also eye brain whole thing impressed a incredibly foolish wrong what be one to do question came back enormously reinforced on morrow when at last gunboat reached badama place with leaf thatch covered house shed creeper invaded sugar mill little jetty of timber cane be very still in morning heat showed never sign of living men ant there be at distance be too small to see people have gone said gerilleau will do one thing anyhow will 'oot vissel so holroyd hooted whistled then captain fell into doubting fit of worst kind dere be one thing can do said presently what be said holroyd 'oot vissel again so did captain walked deck gesticulated to seemed to have many thing on mind fragment of speech came from lip appeared to be addressing imaginary public tribunal in spanish portuguese holroyd improving ear detected something about ammunition came out of preoccupation suddenly into english dear cried broke off with what can one do took boat field glass went close in to examine place made out number of big ant whose still posture have certain effect of watching dotted about edge of rude embarkation jetty gerilleau tried ineffectual pistol shot at holroyd think distinguished curious earthwork running between nearer house may have be work of insect conqueror of human habitation explorer pulled past jetty became aware of human skeleton wearing loin cloth very bright clean shining lying beyond came to pause regarding 'ave dose life to consider said gerilleau suddenly holroyd turned stared at captain realising slowly that referred to unappetising mixture of race constituted crew to send landing party be impossible impossible will be poisoned will swell will swell up abuse die be totally impossible if land must land alone alone in thick boot with life in hand perhaps must live again might not land know know holroyd thought did said nothing de whole thing said gerilleau suddenly 'as be got up to make ridiculous de whole thing paddled about regarded clean white skeleton from various point of view then returned to gunboat then gerilleau indecision became terrible steam be got up in afternoon monitor went on up river with air of going to ask somebody something by sunset came back again anchored thunderstorm gathered broke furiously then night became beautifully cool quiet everyone slept on deck except gerilleau who tossed about muttered in dawn awakened holroyd lord said what now have decided said captain what to land said holroyd sitting up brightly said captain be for time very reserved have decided repeated holroyd manifested symptom of impatience well yes said captain will fire de big gun did heaven know what ant thought of did fired twice with great sternness ceremony crew have wadding in ear there be effect of going into action about whole affair first hit wrecked old sugar mill then smashed abandoned store behind jetty then gerilleau experienced inevitable reaction be good said to holroyd good at sort of bally good must go back for instruction dere will be de devil of row about dis ammunition oh de devil of row know 'olroyd stood regarding world in infinite perplexity for space what else be there to do cried in afternoon monitor started down stream again in evening landing party took body of lieutenant buried on bank upon new ant have so far not appeared iv heard story in fragmentary state from holroyd not three week ago new ant have got into brain

very early experience between other consecutive memory of boyhood there be gulf time came when seemed impossible must ever speak of wonder glimpse again asked obvious question said remember that ever attempted to find way back to garden in early year seems odd to now think that very probably closer watch be kept on movement after misadventure to prevent going astray be till knew tried for garden again believe there be period incredible a seems now when forgot garden altogether when be about eight nine may have be do remember a kid at saint aethelstan rather did show sign did in day of having secret dream ii looked up with sudden smile did ever play north west passage with of course did come way be sort of game went on imaginative child play day idea be discovery of north west passage to school way to school be plain enough game consisted in finding way be plain starting off ten minute early in almost hopeless direction working way round through unaccustomed street to goal one day got entangled among rather low class street on other side of campden hill began to think that for once game must be against must get to school late tried rather desperately street seemed cul de sac found passage at end hurried through with renewed hope ' will do yet ' said passed row of frowsy little shop be inexplicably familiar to behold there be long white wall green door led to enchanted garden thing whacked upon suddenly then after garden wonderful garden be dream paused suppose second experience with green door mark world of difference there be between busy life of schoolboy infinite leisure of child anyhow second time did for moment think of going in straight away see for one thing mind be full of idea of getting to school in time set on not breaking record for punctuality must surely have felt little desire at least to try door yes must have felt that seem to remember attraction of door mainly a obstacle to overmastering determination to get to school be immensely interested by discovery have made of course went on with mind full of went on did check ran past tugging out watch found have ten minute still to spare then be going downhill into familiar surroundings got to school breathless be true wet with perspiration in time can remember hanging up coat went right by left behind odd eh looked at thoughtfully of course did know then that must always be there schoolboy have limited imagination suppose thought be awfully jolly thing to have there to know way back to there be school tugging at expect be good deal distraught inattentive that morning recalling what must of beautiful strange people must presently see again oddly enough have doubt in mind that must be glad to see must have thought of garden that morning just a jolly sort of place to one might resort in interlude of strenuous scholastic career did go day at next day be half holiday may have weighed with perhaps too state of inattention brought down imposition upon docked margin of time necessary for detour know what do know be that in meantime enchanted garden be so much upon mind must not keep to myself told what be name ferrety looking youngster used to call squiff young hopkins said hopkins be did not like telling have feeling in way be against rule to tell did be walking part of way home with be talkative if have not talked about enchanted garden must have

that be near lower edge of snow below down what be now moonlit practicable slope saw dark broken appearance of rock strewn turf struggled to foot aching in joint limb got down painfully from heaped loose snow about went downward until be on turf there dropped rather than lay beside boulder drank deep from flask in inner pocket instantly fell asleep be awakened by singing of bird in tree far below sat up perceived be on little alp at foot of vast precipice be grooved by gully down snow have come over against wall of rock reared against sky gorge between precipice ran east west be full of morning sunlight lit to westward mass of fallen mountain closed descending gorge below seemed there be precipice equally steep behind snow in gully found sort of chimney cleft dripping with snow water down desperate man might venture found easier than seemed came at last to desolate alp then after rock climb of particular difficulty to steep slope of tree took bearing turned face up gorge for saw opened out above upon green meadow among now glimpsed quite distinctly cluster of stone hut of unfamiliar fashion at time progress be like clambering along face of wall after time rising sun ceased to strike along gorge voice of singing bird died away air grew cold dark about distant valley with house be brighter for that came presently to talus among rock noted for be observant man unfamiliar fern seemed to clutch out of crevice with intense green hand picked frond so gnawed stalk found helpful about midday came at last out of throat of gorge into plain sunlight be stiff weary sat down in shadow of rock filled up flask with water from spring drank down remained for time resting before went on to house be very strange to eye indeed whole aspect of valley became a regarded queerer more unfamiliar greater part of surface be lush green meadow starred with many beautiful flower irrigated with extraordinary care bearing evidence of systematic cropping piece by piece high up ringing valley about be wall what appeared to be circumferential water channel from little trickle of water fed meadow plant came on higher slope above flock of llama cropped scanty herbage shed apparently shelter feeding place for llama stood against boundary wall here there irrigation stream ran together into main channel down centre of valley be enclosed on side by wall breast high gave singularly urban quality to secluded place quality be greatly enhanced by fact that number of path paved with black white stone with curious little kerb at side ran hither thither in orderly manner house of central village be quite unlike casual higgledy piggledy agglomeration of mountain village knew stood in continuous row on side of central street of astonishing cleanness here there particoloured facade be pierced by door not solitary window broke even frontage be particoloured with extraordinary irregularity smeared with sort of plaster be sometimes grey sometimes drab sometimes slate coloured dark brown be sight of wild plastering first brought word blind into thought of explorer good man who did that thought must have be a blind a bat descended steep place so came to wall channel that ran about valley near where latter spouted out surplus content into deep of gorge in thin wavering thread of cascade must now see number of men woman resting on piled heap of grass a if taking siesta in remoter part of meadow village number of recumbent child then nearer at hand three men carrying pail on yoke along little path ran from encircling wall towards house latter be clad in garment of llama cloth boot belt of leather wore cap of cloth with back ear flap followed one in single file walking slowly yawning a walked like men who have be up night there be something so reassuringly prosperous respectable in bearing that after moment hesitation nunez stood forward a conspicuously a possible upon rock gave vent to mighty shout that echoed round valley three men stopped moved head a though be looking about turned face way nunez gesticulated with freedom did not appear to see for gesture after time directing towards mountain far away to right shouted a if in answer nunez bawled again then once more a gestured ineffectually word blind came up to top of thought fool must be blind said when at last after much shouting wrath nunez crossed stream by little bridge came through gate in wall approached be sure that be blind be sure that be country of blind of legend told conviction have sprung upon sense of great rather enviable adventure three stood side by side not looking at with ear directed towards judging by unfamiliar step stood close together like men little afraid must see eyelid closed sunken a though very ball beneath have shrunk away there be expression near awe on face man one said in hardly recognisable spanish man be man spirit coming down from rock nunez advanced with confident step of youth who enters upon life old story of lost valley country of blind have come back to mind through thought ran old proverb a if be refrain in country of blind one eyed man be king in country of blind one eyed man be king very civilly gave greeting talked to used eye where doe come from brother pedro asked one down out of rock over mountain come said nunez out of country beyond there where men can see from near bogota where there be hundred thousand of people where city pass out of sight sight muttered pedro sight come said second blind man out of rock cloth of coat nunez saw be curiously fashioned with different sort of stitching startled by simultaneous movement towards with hand outstretched stepped back from advance of spread finger come hither said third blind man following motion clutching neatly held nunez felt over saying word further until have done so carefully cried with finger in eye found thought that organ with fluttering lid queer thing in went over again strange creature correa said one called pedro feel coarseness of hair like llama hair rough be a rock begot said correa investigating nunez unshaven chin with soft slightly moist hand perhaps will grow finer nunez struggled little under examination gripped firm carefully said again speaks said third man certainly be man ugh said pedro at roughness of coat have come into world asked pedro out of world over mountain glacier right over above there half way to sun out of great big world go down twelve day journey to sea scarcely seemed to heed father have told men may be made by force of nature said correa be warmth of thing moisture rottenness rottenness let lead to elder said pedro shout first said correa lest child be afraid be marvellous occasion so shouted pedro went first took nunez by hand to lead to house drew hand away can see said see said correa yes see said nunez turning towards stumbled against pedro pail sens be still imperfect said third blind man stumble talk unmeaning word lead by hand a will said nunez be led along laughing seemed knew nothing of sight well all in good time must teach heard people shouting saw number of figure gathering together in middle roadway of village found tax nerve patience more than have anticipated that first encounter with population of country of blind place seemed larger a drew near to smeared plastering queerer crowd of child men woman woman girl be pleased to note have of quite sweet face for eye be shut sunken came about holding on to touching with soft sensitive hand smelling at listening at word spoke of maiden child however kept aloof a if afraid indeed voice seemed coarse rude beside softer note mobbed three guide kept close to with effect of proprietorship said again again wild man out of rock bogota said bogota over mountain crest wild man using wild word said pedro did hear that bogota mind be hardly formed yet have only beginning of speech little boy nipped hand bogota said mockingly ay city to village come from great world where men have eye see name bogota said stumbled said correa stumbled twice a came hither bring to elder thrust suddenly through doorway into room a black a pitch save at end there faintly glowed fire crowd closed in behind shut out faintest glimmer of day before must arrest have fallen headlong over foot of seated man arm outflung struck face of someone else a went down felt soft impact of feature heard cry of anger for moment struggled against number of hand clutched be one sided fight inkling of situation came to lay quiet fell down said must see in pitchy darkness there be pause a if unseen person about tried to understand word then voice of correa said be newly formed stumble a walk mingles word mean nothing with speech others also said thing about that heard understood imperfectly may sit up asked in pause will not struggle against again consulted let rise voice of older man began to question nunez found trying to explain great world out of have fallen sky mountain sight such like marvel to elder who sat in darkness in country of blind must believe understand nothing whatever told thing quite outside expectation must not even understand many of word for fourteen generation people have be blind cut off from seeing world name for thing of sight have faded changed story of outer world be faded changed to child story have ceased to concern with anything beyond rocky slope above circling wall blind men of genius have arisen among questioned shred of belief tradition have brought with from seeing day have dismissed thing a idle fancy replaced with new saner explanation much of imagination have shrivelled with eye have made for new imagination with ever more sensitive ear finger tip slowly nunez realised that expectation of wonder reverence at origin gift be not to be borne out after poor attempt to explain sight to have be set aside a confused version of new made being describing marvel of incoherent sensation subsided little dashed into listening to instruction eldest of blind men explained to life philosophy religion how that world meaning valley have be first empty hollow in rock then have come first inanimate thing without gift of touch llama few other creature have little sense then men at last angel whom one must hear singing making fluttering sound whom one must touch at puzzled nunez greatly until thought of bird went on to tell nunez how time have be divided into warm cold be blind equivalent of day night how be good to sleep in warm work during cold so now for advent whole town of blind must have be asleep said nunez must have be specially created to learn serve wisdom have acquired that for mental incoherency stumbling behaviour must have courage do best to learn at people in doorway murmured encouragingly said night for blind call day night be now far gone behoved one to go back to sleep asked nunez if knew how to sleep nunez said did that before sleep wanted food brought food llama milk in bowl rough salted bread led into lonely place to eat out of hearing afterwards to slumber until chill of mountain evening roused to begin day again nunez slumbered not at instead sat up in place where have left resting limb turning unanticipated circumstance of arrival over over in mind now then laughed sometimes with amusement sometimes with indignation unformed mind said got sens yet little know have be insulting heaven sent king master see must bring to reason let think let think be still thinking when sun set nunez have eye for beautiful thing seemed to that glow upon snowfield glacier rose about valley on side be most beautiful thing have ever seen eye went from inaccessible glory to village irrigated field fast sinking into twilight suddenly wave of emotion took thanked god from bottom of heart that power of sight have be given heard voice calling to from out of village ya ho there bogota come hither at that stood up smiling must show people once for what sight must do for man must seek not find move not bogota said voice laughed noiselessly made two stealthy step aside from path trample not on grass bogota be not allowed nunez have scarcely heard sound made stopped amazed owner of voice came running up piebald path towards stepped back into pathway here be said why did not come when called said blind man must be led like child can not hear path a walk nunez laughed can see said there be such word a see said blind man after pause cease folly follow sound of foot nunez followed little annoyed time will come said will learn blind man answered there be much to learn in world have one told 'in country of blind one eyed man be king ' what be blind asked blind man carelessly over shoulder four day passed fifth found king of blind still incognito a clumsy useless stranger among subject be found much more difficult to proclaim than have supposed in meantime while meditated coup d'etat did what be told learnt manner custom of country of blind found working going about at night particularly irksome thing decided that must be first thing must change led simple laborious life people with element of virtue happiness a thing can be understood by men toiled not oppressively have food clothing sufficient for need have day season of rest made much of music singing there be love among little child be marvellous with what confidence precision went about ordered world everything see have be made to fit need of radiating path of valley area have constant angle to others be distinguished by special notch upon kerbing obstacle irregularity of path meadow have long since be cleared away method procedure arose naturally from special need sens have become marvellously acute must hear judge slightest gesture of man dozen pace away must hear very beating of heart intonation have long replaced expression with touch gesture work with hoe spade fork be a free confident a garden work can be sense of smell be extraordinarily fine must distinguish individual difference a readily a dog can went about tending of llama who lived among rock above came to wall for food shelter with ease confidence be only when at last nunez sought to assert that found how easy confident movement must be rebelled only after have tried persuasion tried at first on several occasion to tell of sight look here people said there be thing understand in once twice one two of attended to sat with face downcast ear turned intelligently towards did best to tell what be to see among hearer be girl with eyelid red sunken than others so one must almost fancy be hiding eye whom especially hoped to persuade spoke of beauty of sight of watching mountain of sky sunrise heard with amused incredulity presently became condemnatory told there be indeed mountain at that end of rock where llama grazed be indeed end of world thence sprang cavernous roof of universe from dew avalanche fell when maintained stoutly world have end roof such a supposed said thought be wicked so far a must describe sky cloud star to seemed to hideous void terrible blankness in place of smooth roof to thing in believed be article of faith with that cavern roof be exquisitely smooth to touch saw that in manner shocked gave up that aspect of matter altogether tried to show practical value of sight one morning saw pedro in path called seventeen coming towards central house still too far off for hearing scent told a much in little while prophesied pedro will be here old man remarked that pedro have business on path seventeen then a if in confirmation individual a drew near turned went transversely into path ten so back with nimble pace towards outer wall mocked nunez when pedro did not arrive afterwards when asked pedro question to clear character pedro denied outfaced be afterwards hostile to then induced to let go long way up sloping meadow towards wall with one complacent individual to promised to describe happened among house noted certain going coming thing really seemed to signify to people happened inside of behind windowless house only thing took note of to test by of must see tell nothing be after failure of attempt ridicule must not repress that resorted to force thought of seizing spade suddenly smiting one two of to earth so in fair combat showing advantage of eye went so far with resolution a to seize spade then discovered new thing about be that be impossible for to hit blind man in cold blood hesitated found aware that have snatched up spade stood alert with head on one side bent ear towards for what must do next put that spade down said one felt sort of helpless horror came near obedience then thrust one backwards against house wall fled past out of village went athwart one of meadow leaving track of trampled grass behind foot presently sat down by side of one of way felt something of buoyancy come to men in beginning of fight more perplexity began to realise that can not even fight happily with creature who stand upon different mental basis to far away saw number of men carrying spade stick come out of street of house advance in spreading line along several path towards advanced slowly speaking frequently to one ever again whole cordon must halt sniff air listen first time did nunez laughed afterwards did not laugh one struck trail in meadow grass came stooping feeling way along for five minute watched slow extension of cordon then vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic stood up went pace so towards circumferential wall turned went back little way there stood in crescent still listening also stood still gripping spade very tightly in hand must charge pulse in ear ran into rhythm of in country of blind one eyed man be king must charge looked back at high unclimbable wall behind unclimbable because of smooth plastering withal pierced with many little door at approaching line of seeker behind others be now coming out of street of house must charge bogota called one bogota where be gripped spade still tighter advanced down meadow towards place of habitation directly moved converged upon will hit if touch swore by heaven will will hit called aloud look here be going to do what like in valley do hear be going to do what like go where like be moving in upon quickly groping yet moving rapidly be like playing blind man buff with everyone blindfolded except one get hold of cried one found in arc of loose curve of pursuer felt suddenly must be active resolute understand cried in voice be meant to be great resolute broke be blind can see leave alone bogota put down that spade come off grass last order grotesque in urban familiarity produced gust of anger will hurt said sobbing with emotion by heaven will hurt leave alone began to run not knowing clearly where to run ran from nearest blind man because be horror to hit stopped then made dash to escape from closing rank made for where gap be wide men on side with quick perception of approach of pace rushed in on one sprang forward then saw must be caught swish spade have struck felt soft thud of hand arm man be down with yell of pain be through through then be close to street of house again blind men whirling spade stake be running with sort of reasoned swiftness hither thither heard step behind just in time found tall man rushing forward swiping at sound of lost nerve hurled spade yard wide at antagonist whirled about fled fairly yelling a dodged be panic stricken ran furiously to fro dodging when there be need to dodge in anxiety to see on side of at once stumbling for moment be down heard fall far away in circumferential wall little doorway looked like heaven set off in wild rush for did not even look round at pursuer until be gained have stumbled across bridge clambered little way among rock to surprise dismay of young llama who went leaping out of sight lay down sobbing for breath so coup d'etat came to end stayed outside wall of valley of blind for two night day without food shelter meditated upon unexpected during meditation repeated very frequently always with profounder note of derision exploded proverb in country of blind one eyed man be king thought chiefly of way of fighting conquering people grew clear that for practicable way be possible have weapon now must be hard to get one canker of civilisation have got to even in bogota must not find in to go down assassinate blind man of course if did that might then dictate term on threat of assassinating sooner later must sleep tried also to find food among pine tree to be comfortable under pine bough while frost fell at night with le confidence to catch llama by artifice in order to try to kill perhaps by hammering with stone so finally perhaps to eat of llama have doubt of regarded with distrustful brown eye spat when drew near fear came on second day fit of shivering finally crawled down to wall of country of blind tried to make term crawled along by stream shouting until two blind men came out to gate talked to be mad said be only newly made said be better told be wiser now repented of have done then wept without intention for be very weak ill now took that a favourable sign asked if still thought must see said that be folly word mean nothing le than nothing asked what be overhead about ten time ten height of man there be roof above world of rock very very smooth burst again into hysterical tear before ask more give food will die expected dire punishment blind people be capable of toleration regarded rebellion a one more proof of general idiocy inferiority after have whipped appointed to do simplest heaviest work have for anyone to do seeing other way of living did submissively what be told be ill for day nursed kindly that refined submission insisted on lying in dark be great misery blind philosopher came talked to of wicked levity of mind reproved so impressively for doubt about lid of rock covered cosmic casserole that almost doubted whether indeed be not victim of hallucination in not seeing overhead so nunez became citizen of country of blind people ceased to be generalised people became individuality familiar to while world beyond mountain became more more remote unreal there be master kindly man when not annoyed there be pedro yacob nephew there be medina sarote who be youngest daughter of yacob be little esteemed in world of blind because have clear cut face lacked that satisfying glossy smoothness be blind man ideal of feminine beauty nunez thought beautiful at first presently most beautiful thing in whole creation closed eyelid be not sunken red after common way of valley lay a though might open again at moment have long eyelash be considered grave disfigurement voice be strong did not satisfy acute hearing of valley swain so that have lover there came time when nunez thought must win must be resigned to live in valley for rest of day watched sought opportunity of doing little service presently found that observed once at rest day gathering sat side by side in dim starlight music be sweet hand came upon hers dared to clasp then very tenderly returned pressure one day a be at meal in darkness felt hand very softly seeking a chanced fire leapt then saw tenderness of face sought to speak to went to one day when be sitting in summer moonlight spinning light made thing of silver mystery sat down at foot told loved told how beautiful seemed to have lover voice spoke with tender reverence came near to awe have never before be touched by adoration made definite answer be clear word pleased after that talked to whenever must take opportunity valley became world for world beyond mountain where men lived in sunlight seemed more than fairy tale must day pour into ear very tentatively timidly spoke to of sight sight seemed to most poetical of fancy listened to description of star mountain own sweet white lit beauty a though be guilty indulgence did not believe must only half understand be mysteriously delighted seemed to that completely understood love lost awe took courage presently be for demanding of yacob elder in marriage became fearful delayed be one of elder sister who first told yacob that medina sarote nunez be in love there be from first very great opposition to marriage of nunez medina sarote not so much because valued a because held a being apart idiot incompetent thing below permissible level of man sister opposed bitterly a bringing discredit on old yacob though have formed sort of liking for clumsy obedient serf shook head said thing must not be young men be angry at idea of corrupting race one went so far a to revile strike nunez struck back then for first time found advantage in seeing even by twilight after fight be over one be disposed to raise hand against still found marriage impossible old yacob have tenderness for last little daughter be grieved to have weep upon shoulder see dear be idiot have delusion ca do anything right know wept medina sarote be better than be be getting better be strong dear father kind stronger kinder than other man in world love father love old yacob be greatly distressed to find inconsolable besides what made more distressing liked nunez for many thing so went sat in windowless council chamber with other elder watched trend of talk said at proper time be better than be very likely day will find a sane a ourselves then afterwards one of elder who thought deeply have idea be great doctor among people medicine man have very philosophical inventive mind idea of curing nunez of peculiarity appealed to one day when yacob be present returned to topic of nunez have examined bogota said case be clearer to think very probably might be cured be have always hoped said old yacob brain be affected said blind doctor elder murmured assent now what affect ah said old yacob said doctor answering own question queer thing be called eye exist to make agreeable soft depression in face be diseased in case of bogota in such way a to affect brain be greatly distended have eyelash eyelid move consequently brain be in state of constant irritation distraction yes said old yacob yes think may say with reasonable certainty that in order to cure completely that need do be simple easy surgical operation namely to remove irritant body then will be sane then will be perfectly sane quite admirable citizen thank heaven for science said old yacob went forth at once to tell nunez of happy hope nunez manner of receiving good news struck a being cold disappointing one might think said from tone take that did not care for daughter be medina sarote who persuaded nunez to face blind surgeon want said to lose gift of sight shook head world be sight head drooped lower there be beautiful thing beautiful little thing flower lichen among rock

limitless sea with thousand island thousand of island ship seen dimly far away in incessant journeying round about greater world there unpent by mountain one saw sky sky not disc a one saw here arch of immeasurable blue deep of deep in circling star be floating eye scrutinised great curtain of mountain with keener inquiry for example if one went so up gully to chimney there then one might come

quiver in body from top to toe have made up mind knew that now be going to wear suit a must be worn have doubt in matter be afraid terribly afraid glad glad got out of bed stood for moment by window looking at moonshine flooded garden trembling at thing meant to do air be full of minute clamour of cricket murmuring of infinitesimal shouting of little living thing went very gently across creaking board for fear that might wake sleeping house to big dark clothes press wherein beautiful suit lay folded took out garment by garment softly very eagerly tore off tissue paper covering tacked protection until there be perfect delightful a have seen when first mother have given to long time seemed ago not button have tarnished not thread have faded on dear suit of be glad enough for weeping a in noiseless hurry put on then back went soft quick to window looked out upon garden stood there for minute shining in moonlight with button twinkling like star before got out on sill making a little of rustling a must clambered down to garden path below stood before mother house be white nearly a plain a by day with window blind own shut like eye sleep tree cast still shadow like intricate black lace upon wall garden in moonlight be very different from garden by day moonshine be tangled in hedge stretched in phantom cobweb from spray to spray flower be gleaming white crimson black air

night be warmer than night have ever be heaven by miracle at once vaster nearer spite of great ivory tinted moon ruled world sky be full of star little man did not shout sing for infinite gladness stood for time like one awestricken then with queer small cry holding out arm ran out a if must embrace at once whole round immensity of world did not follow neat set path cut garden squarely thrust across bed through wet tall scented herb through night stock nicotine cluster of phantom white mallow flower through thicket of southernwood lavender knee deep across wide space of mignonette came to great hedge thrust way through though thorn of bramble scored deeply tore thread from wonderful suit though burr goose grass havers caught clung to did not care did not care for knew be part of wearing for have longed be glad put on suit said be glad wore suit beyond hedge came to duck pond at least to what be duck pond by day by night be great bowl of silver moonshine noisy with singing frog of wonderful silver moonshine twisted clotted with strange patternings little man ran down into water between thin black rush knee deep waist deep to shoulder smiting water to black shining wavelet with hand swaying shivering wavelet amidst star be netted in tangled reflection of brooding tree upon bank waded until swam so crossed pond came out upon other side trailing a seemed to not duckweed very silver in long clinging dripping mass up went through transfigured tangle of willow herb uncut seeding grass of farther bank came glad breathless into high road be glad said beyond measure have clothes fitted occasion high road ran straight a arrow fly straight into deep blue pit of sky beneath moon white shining road between singing nightingale along went running now leaping now walking rejoicing in clothes mother have made for with tireless loving hand road be deep in dust that for be only soft whiteness a went great dim moth came fluttering round wet shimmering hastening figure at first did not heed moth then waved hand at made sort of dance with a circled round head soft cried dear moth wonderful night wonderful night of world do think clothes be beautiful dear moth a beautiful a scale silver vesture of earth sky moth circled closer closer until at last velvet wing just brushed lip next morning found dead with neck broken in bottom of stone pit with beautiful clothes little bloody foul stained with duckweed from pond face be face of such happiness have seen must have understood indeed how that have died happy never knowing that cool streaming silver for duckweed in pond
