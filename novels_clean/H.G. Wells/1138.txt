magnificent prelude on fear aristocracy story of william porphyry benham be story of man who be led into adventure by idea be idea took possession of imagination quite early in life grew with changed with interwove at last completely with being story be story be traceably germinating in schoolboy be manifestly present in mind at very last moment of adventurous life belonged to fortunate minority who be independent of daily necessity so that be free to go about world under direction led far led into situation bordered upon fantastic made ridiculous came near to making sublime idea of be of such nature that in several aspect must document logic forced to introspection to making of record idea can play so large part in life must necessarily have something of complication protean quality of life be not to be stated justly in formula be not to be rendered by epigram a well one might show man skeleton for portrait yet essentially benham idea be simple have incurable almost innate persuasion that have to live life nobly thoroughly commoner expression for thorough living be aristocratic life by aristocratic meant something very different from quality of russian prince let say english peer meant intensity clearness nobility for be to get something out of individual existence flame jewel splendour be thing easier to understand than to say one might hesitate to call idea innate yet come soon into life when come at in benham case might trace back to day nursery at seagate might detect stirring already at petticoat stage in various private struttings valiant dreaming with helmet of pasteboard white metal sword have most of be at least a far a with benham have died like horatius slaying thousand for country have perished at stake faced levelled musket of firing party bandage eye because must not betray secret path meant destruction to city with vein be stronger increased instead of fading out a grew to manhood be le obscured by earthy acquiescence discretion saving sense of proportion have made most of so satisfactorily what be porphyry mother have discovered before be seventeen be excellent boy brilliant boy begin to see just little unbalanced interest of absurdity of story of be that most of be balanced in spite of occasional revery do come to term with limitation of life with desire dream discretion that to say least of qualify nobility take refuge in sense of humour congratulate ourselves on certain amiable freedom from priggishness presumption for benham that easy declension to humorous acceptance of life a be did not occur found limitation soon enough be perpetually rediscovering out of interment of spirit rose again remarkably when others have decided that to be plain about be not going to lead noble life at that thing be too ambitious expensive even to attempt have done so because there be other conception of existence be good enough for decided that instead of glorious impossible being of must figure in own eye a jolly fellow sly dog sane sound capable men brilliant success so forth practicable thing for benham exceptionally there be not practicable thing blundered fell short of have a will be told astonishing rebuff never turned aside for long went by nature for preposterous idea of nobility a linnet hatched in cage will try to fly when discovered in be assisted not little by friend at elbow when discovered that nobility be not simple thing have at first supposed to be set in mood only slightly disconcerted to discovery of nobility when dawned upon a did that one can not be noble so to speak in vacuo set to discover noble society began with simple belief fine attitude ended in conscious research if must not get through by stride then followed that must get through by climb spent greater part of life studying experimenting in noble possibility of man never lost absurd faith in conceivable splendour at first be always just round corner just through wood to last seemed still little way beyond distant mountain for reason story have be called research magnificent be real research be documented in room in westhaven street at last be a much a one must call home have accumulated material for one hesitates to call book let say be analysis of guide to noble life there after tragic death came old friend white journalist novelist under promise found paper found to extent of crammed bureau score of patent file quite distended writing table drawer full be greatly exercised to find be white declares be still after much experienced handling indigestible aggregation on point white be very assured when benham thought be gathering together book be dreaming white say there be book in perhaps too one might hazard benham be dreaming when thought noble life human possibility perhaps man like ape hyaena tapeworm many other of god necessary le attractive creature be not for such exalted end doubt never seems to have got lodgment in benham skull though at time one might suppose basis of white thought will find in benham story if only can be properly told now subdued now loud amazed distressed always traceable startled protesting question why devil be a though necessarily ought to be never faltered in persuasion that behind dingy face of world earthy stubbornness baseness dulness of of lurked living jewel of light of glory thing unspeakable at first seemed to that one have only just to hammer will at end after life of willing hammering be still convinced there be something something in nature of open sesame perhaps little more intricate than one have supposed at first little more difficult to secure still in nature must suddenly roll open for mankind magic cave of universe precious cave at heart of thing in one must believe then life life must be wonder so perplexingly just be benham did not go about world telling people of consuming research be not prophet preacher of idea be too living intricate uncertain part of to speak freely about be secret self to expose casually must have shamed drew sort of reserve about wore manifest imperfection turned up about like overcoat in bitter wind be content to be inexplicable thought led to conviction that magnificent research must not be more than other research can be solitary enterprise delayed expression in mighty writing stowing away of paper found relief from unpleasant urgency to confess explain prematurely so that white though knew benham with intimacy of old schoolfellow who have renewed friendship have shared last day be witness of death read sheet of manuscript often with surprise with sense of added elucidation being also trained maker of book white a read be more more distressed that accumulation so interesting must be so entirely unshaped for publication will never make book said white with note of personal grievance hasty promise in last moment together have bound seemed to task now found impossible must have to work upon tremendously even then did not see how must be done collection of paper be not story not essay not confession not diary be nothing definable went into conceivable cover be just white decided proliferation vast proliferation wanted even title there be sign that benham have intended to call aristocratic life that have tried at other time title of essay on aristocracy moreover must seem that towards end have be disposed to drop word aristocratic altogether adopt such phrase a larger life once be life set free have fallen away more more from nearly everything that one associate with aristocracy at end only ideal of fearlessness generosity remained of title aristocratic life seemed at first most like clue to white benham erratic movement sudden impulse anger unaccountable patience journey to strange place lapse into what have seemed to be pure adventurousness must all be put into system with before white have turned over three page of great fascicle of manuscript be called book two have found word bushido written with particularly flourishing capital letter twice repeated be inevitable said white with comforting regret one feel for friend banality date unreadable be early modern aristocracy new aristocracy read presently have still to be discovered understood be necessary next step for mankind a far a possible will discover understand a far a know will be be essential disposition of mind god know have appetite sloth habit blindness so far a be in power to release will escape to white sat far into night for several night turning over paper rummaging in untidy drawer memory came back to of dead friend pieced together with other memory joined on to scrap in writing bold yet convincing guess began to leap across gap story shaped story began with schoolfellow have known at minchinghampton school benham have come up from father preparatory school at seagate have be boy reserved rather than florid in act manner boy with pale face incorrigible hair brown eye went dark deep with excitement several time white have seen excited when be excited benham be capable of tensely daring thing on one occasion have insisted upon walking across field in be aggressive bull have be put there to prevent boy taking short cut to swimming place have bellowed tremendously finally charged have dodged got away at time have seemed immense feat to white others who be safely up field have walked to fence risking second charge by deliberation then have sat on fence declared intention of always crossing field so long a bull remained there have said with white intensity have stopped abruptly in mid sentence then suddenly have dropped to ground clutched fence struggled with heaving shoulder be sick combination of apparently stout heart manifestly weak stomach have exercised minchinghampton intelligence profoundly on one two other occasion benham have shown courage of same rather screwed up sort showed not only in physical in mental thing boy named prothero set fashion of religious discussion in school benham after self examination professed atheistical republicanism rather in manner of shelley brought into open conflict with roddles history master roddles have discovered theological controversy in mysterious way took upon to talk at benham prothero treated to common misapplication of fool who hath said in heart there be god did not perceive there be difference between fool who say thing in heart one who say in dormitory revived that delectable anecdote of eton boy who professed disbelief be at once soundly flogged by head master year afterwards that boy came back to thank gurr said prothero softly stew ard turn next benham whispered orthodox controversialist good lord 'd like to see said benham with forced loudness must scarcely be ignored subsequent controversy led to interview with head from benham emerged more whitely strung up than ever said must certainly swish if deserved said must certainly kill if did then told to go away think over said must preach about next sunday well swishing be likely thing anyhow must there be master here 'd stand thrashing from not one because choose to say what think 'd run amuck for week so school be exhilarated by vain ill concealed hope that head might try just to see if must be tantalizingly within bound of possibility incident came back to white mind a turned over newspaper in upper drawer of bureau drawer be labelled fear first limitation material in be evidently designed for opening volume of great unfinished book indeed portion of be already arranged written up a white read through manuscript be reminded of score of schoolboy discussion benham prothero have have together here be same old toughness of mind kind of intellectual hardihood have sometimes shocked schoolfellow benham have be one of boy who originate idea very freely who go out to with fierce sincerity believed disbelieved with emphasis prothero have first set doubting be benham own temperament took on to denial youthful atheism have be matter for secret consternation in white white did not believe very much in god even then positive disbelieving frightened be going too far there have be terrible moment in dormitory during thunderstorm thunderstorm so vehement that have awakened when latham humourist quietly devout boy have suddenly challenged benham to deny maker now say believe in god benham sat up in bed repeated negative faith while little hopkins bishop son being le certain about accuracy of providence than aim edged a far a must away from benham cubicle rolled head in bedclothes anyhow said benham when be clear that be not to be struck dead forthwith show poor idea of god to think 'd kill schoolboy for honest doubt even old roddles ca listen to cried latham humourist ca listen to be horrible well who began asked benham flash of lightning lit dormitory showed to white white faced ablaze with excitement sitting up with bed clothes about oh wailed muffled voice of little hopkins a thunder burst like giant pistol overhead buried head still deeper in bedclothes gave way to unappeasable grief latham voice came out of darkness atheism that billy prothero have brought into school started violently at vivid flash one remained silent waiting for thunder white remembered more of controversy because have made frightful discovery filled blocked mind time lightning flashed there be red light in benham eye be only three day after when prothero discovered exactly same phenomenon in school house boothole talked of cat cattle that white confidence in friend be partially restored fear first limitation title indicated spirit of benham opening book very clearly struggle with fear be very beginning of soul history continued to end have hardly decided to lead noble life before came bump against fact that be physical coward felt fear acutely fear wrote be foremost most persistent of shepherding power keep in safe fold drive back to beaten track comfort futility beginning of aristocracy be subjugation of fear at first struggle be so great that hated fear without qualification wanted to abolish altogether when be boy writes thought must conquer fear for good never more be troubled by be not to be done in way one might a well dream of having dinner for rest of one life time always have found that have to be conquered afresh to day fear little thing a well a big thing have to grapple with little dread day urge just a have to wash shave day believe be so with one be difficult to be sure few men who go into danger care very much to talk about fear later benham found excuse for fear came even to dealing with fear never however admits that universal instinct be better than kindly unintelligent nurse from whose fostering restraint be man duty to escape discretion declared must remain sense of proportion adequacy of enterprise discretion of aristocrat be in head tactical detail have nothing to do with visceral sinking ebb in nerve from top to bottom whole spectrum of fear be bad from panic

man be beast of kind no longer have left habitat go out to limitless living idea of man going out into new thing leaving security habit custom leaving normal life altogether behind underlay benham aristocratic conception be natural that must consider fear a entirely inconvenient treat indeed with ingratitude dwell upon immense liberation lie beyond for who will force through remonstrance benham confessed liability to fear quite freely in note fear of animal be ineradicable have have overwhelming dread of bear until be twelve thirteen child irrational dread of impossible bear bear lurking under bed in evening shadow confesses that even up to manhood must not cross field containing cattle without keeping wary eye upon bull adventure rather increased than diminished that disposition hated strange dog at heel must manoeuvre a soon a possible out of reach of teeth heel of horse peculiar dread of childhood be tiger gaping nursemaid confronted suddenly with tiger in cage in menagerie annexe of circus small mind be overwhelmed have never thought white read that tiger be much larger than st bernard dog great creature must not believe hunter must attack such monster except by stealth with weapon of enormous power jerked to fro across cramped rickety cage looked over head with yellow eye at phantom far away now then snarled contempt of detestable indifference sank deeper deeper into soul knew be cage to vanish must stand there motionless helpless prey knew be at large in same building with must be too terror stricken to escape at foot of ladder leading clear to escape must

father insatiable pedagoguery little son must be coward after understood must keep silence bear tiger alone for year thought of tiger immensity haunted mind in dream cowered before thousand time in dusk rarely failed on landing on way to bed there be patch of darkness beyond chest became lurking horror for sometimes door of father bedroom must stand open there be long buff crimson striped shape by day indeed ottoman by night must ottoman crouch stir in flicker of passing candle must ottoman come after noiselessly so close that must not even turn round upon when benham be already seventeen a supposed hardened against fear of beast friend prothero gave account of killing of old labouring man by stallion have escaped out of stable beast have careered across field leapt hedge come upon victim suddenly have run few pace stopped trying to defend head with horse rearing over beat down with two swift blow of fore hoof one two lifted up in long yellow teeth worried a terrier doe rat poor old wretch be still able to make bleating sound at dropped trampled kicked a tried to crawl away went on trampling battering until be no more than bloody inhuman bundle of clothes mire for more than hour continued then animal rage be exhausted desisted went grazed at little distance from misshapen hoof marked torn muddy remnant of man one seems horror stricken child knew what be happening picture of human indignity tortured benham imagination much more than tortured teller of tale filled with shame horror for three four year detail of circumstantial narrative seemed unforgettable little lapse from perfect health obsession returned must not endure neighing of horse when saw horse galloping in field with heart stood still life thereafter hated horse different sort of fear that also greatly afflicted benham be due to certain clumsiness insecurity felt in giddy unstable place there be more definitely balanced between hopelessly rash pitifully discreet have written account of private struggle between certain path of plank rock edge called bisse of leysin happened in adolescence have have bad attack of influenza doctor have sent to little hotel only hotel be in day at montana in valais there later when have picked up strength father be to join take mountaineering that second rate mountaineering be so dear to don schoolmaster when time came be ready for have have experience have gone through phase of real cowardice be afraid confessed before even reached montana be afraid of steepness of mountain have to drive ten twelve mile up up mountain side road of innumerable hairpin bend precipitous bank horse be gaunt ugly with disposition to shy confesses clutched side of vehicle speculated how must jump if presently whole turnout went tumbling over afterwards dreamt dream of precipice made stride over precipice fell fell with floating swiftness towards remote valley be assailed by eagle upon perilous ledge crumbled away left clinging by nail to nothing bisse of leysin be one of artificial water course bring water from distant source to pasture have insufficient uncertain supply be little better known than most because of certain exceptional boldness in construction for distance of few score yard run supported by iron staple across front of sheer precipice for perhaps mile hang like eyebrow over nearly quite vertical wall of pine set rock beside on outer side of run path becomes offhand gangway of planking at overhanging place at one corner give favourite picture postcard from montana rock project so sharply above water that passenger on gangway must crouch down upon bending plank a walk there be hand hold at path from montana take one over pine clad spur down precipitous zig zag upon middle of bisse thither benham came fascinated by very fact that here be something of mere report frightened have to walk across cold clear rush of bisse upon pine log then found upon one of gentler interlude of bisse track be scrambling path nearly two foot wide below be slope not so steep a to terrify at vast distance below saw through tree stem blue haze twisted strand of bright whiteness river join rhone at sion looped about passed out of sight remotely beneath foot turned to right came to corner overhung precipice craned head round corner saw evil place of picture postcard remained for long time trying to screw up to walk along jagged six inch edge of rock between cliff torrent into path have shrunken to sagging plank under overhanging rock beyond must not bring to do that happened that close to corner large lump of rock earth be breaking away cleft be opening so that presently seemed possible at moment mass must fall headlong into blue deep below impending avalanche be not in path along bisse be sort of danger to in way insecurity gave final touch to cowardice must not get round corner turned away went examined plank in other direction found le forbidding crossed one precipitous place with fall of twoscore foot le beneath found worse ahead there also managed third place be still more disagreeable plank be worn thin sagged under went along supporting against rock above bisse with extended hand halfway rock fell back so that there be nothing whatever to hold stopped hesitating whether must go back on plank there be going back because turning round seemed practicable while be still hesitating there came helpful intervention behind saw peasant appearing disappearing behind tree projecting rock mass coming across previous plank at vigorous trot under stimulus of spectator benham got to end of third place without much trouble then very politely stood aside for expert to go ahead so that must follow at own pace there be however more difficulty yet to come disagreeable humiliation confounded peasant developed parental solicitude after crossing waited presently began to offer advice encouragement at last came place where everything be overhanging where bisse be leaking plank wet slippery water ran out of leak near brim of wooden channel fell in long shivering thread of silver there be sound of fall just fell into void benham wished have not noted that groaned faced plank knew must be slowest affair of peasant surveyed from further side be afraid cried peasant in clumsy valaisian french returned returning along plank seemed quite sufficiently loaded without extending charitable hand damn whispered benham took hand afterwards rather ignobly tried to explain in public school french pa de peur said pa de peur mais la tete n ' pa l'habitude peasant failing to understand assured again that there be danger damn benham be led over other plank be led a if be old lady crossing glacier be led into absolute safety shamefacedly rewarded guide then went little way sat down swore softly watched honest man go striding plunging down towards lens until be out of sight now said benham to if go back along plank secret honour be gone for ever told that have not good head that be not well that sun be setting light no longer good that have very good chance indeed of getting killed then came to suddenly a clear simple truth a something luminously plain that be better to get killed than go away defeated by such fear unsteadiness a change came into mind a if white light be suddenly turned on where there have be nothing shadow darkness rose to foot went swiftly intently whole way back going with kind of temperate recklessness because be no longer careful easily went on beyond starting place toward corner did that supreme bit to fro bit where lump be falling away have to crouch a gaily a rest then recrossed bisse upon pine log clambered up through pine to crest returned through meadow to own hotel after that must have slept sleep of contentment instead have quite dreadful nightmare of hanging in frozen fear above incredible declivity of ill aimed leap across chasm to slippery foothold of plank swayed broke suddenly in middle headed down down next day in sunshine walked bisse again with dream like trailing mist in mind by comparison path of bisse be nothing be like walking along kerbstone be exercise for young lady in younger day benham have regarded fear a shameful secret a thing to be got rid of altogether seemed to that to feel fear be to fall short of aristocracy in spite of deep dread disgust haunted mind set about business of subjugation a if be spiritual amputation a emerged from egotism of adolescence came to realize that be too comprehensive operation one feel fear true aristocrat be not one who have eliminated one who control ignores brave men be men who do thing when be afraid to do just a nelson even when be seasick be frequently seasick be still master of sea benham developed two leading idea about fear one that be worse at first onset far worse than real experience other that fear be essentially social instinct set upon line to study what can call taming of fear nature care management of fear fear be very like pain in that be deterrent thing be superficial just a man skin be infinitely more sensitive than anything inside once have forced have be forced through outward fear into vivid action experience feel very little worst moment be before thing happen rowe african sportsman told that have seen cowardice often enough in presence of lion have never seen one actually charged by lion who did not behave well have heard same thing of many sort of danger began to suspect first in case of falling jumping down giddiness may be almost intolerable torture falling nothing of sort once saw face of old man who have flung out of high window in rome who have be killed instantly on pavement be not simply serene face be glad exalted suspect that when have broken shell of fear falling may be delightful jumping down be after only steeper tobogganing tobogganing milder jumping down always used to funk at top of cresta run suffered sometimes almost intolerably found almost impossible to get away first ten yard be like being slashed open with sharp sword afterwards there be nothing joyful thrill instinct too fought against when tried high diving managed began to like have to give up because of ear not until have established habit of stepping through moment of disinclination be challoner passenger when be killed at sheerness be queer unexpected experience may have supposed agony of terror indeed there be fear in at at rate remember moment of fear have gone clean out of memory if ever be there be swimming high fast three thousand foot so in clear sweet air over town of sheerness river with string of battleship be far away to west of endless grey blue flat of thames to north sun be low behind bank of cloud be watching motor car seemed to be crawling slowly enough though doubt be making respectable pace between two hedge down below be extraordinary how slowly everything seems to be going when one see from height then left wing of monoplane came up like door slam wire whistled past head one whipped off helmet then with seat slipping away from down went snatched unavailingly for helmet then gripped side be like dropping in boat suddenly into trough of wave going on dropping be strapped got foot against side clung to locked second wheel sensation be a though something like intermittent electric current be pouring through be ridiculous image to use ca justify be a if be having cold blue light squirted through pore of being there be astonishment feeling of confirmation course thing do happen sometimes told remember that challoner looked round said anything at be not sure that looked at there seemed to be long interval of intensely excited curiosity remember thinking 'lord will come smash in minute far ahead saw grey shed of eastchurch people strolling about apparently unaware of disaster there be sudden silence a challoner stopped engine point want to insist upon be that did not feel afraid be simply enormously terribly interested there came tremendous jolt lunge be tipped forward so that be hanging forehead down by strap looked a if shed be in sky then saw nothing sky then came vast swerve be falling sideways sideways be altogether out of breath physically astonished remember noting quite intelligently a hit ground how green grass have effect of pouring out in direction from below then remember jerk feeling be flying up again be astonished by tremendous popping fabric wire everything seemed going pop pop pop like machine gun then came flash of intense pain a arm crumpled up be quite impersonal pain a impersonal a seeing intense colour splinter remember word came into head instantly remember very definitely thought suppose arm be in splinter perhaps of scrap end of rod wire flying about be curious that while remember word can not recall idea when became conscious again chief thing present in mind be that fellow round be young soldier who must at understand bad behaviour arm be orchestral still far from being real suffering in also wanted to know what challoner have got must understand question then twisted round saw from negligent way foot came out from under engine that must be dead dark red stain with bright red froth of course there again chief feeling be sense of oddity be sorry for more than be for seemed to that be right with remarkable vivid right though there be little fear in aeroplane even when be smashing up there be fear about aeroplane there be something say very urgently `` to man who look up into sky be very interesting to note how at place like eastchurch brooklands necessary discretion trail old visceral feeling with how men will hang about ready to go up resolved to go up delaying men of indisputable courage will get into state between dread laziness waste whole hour of flying weather on excuse excuse once be up that inhibition vanishes man who be delaying delaying hour ago will now be cutting most venturesome caper in air few men be in hurry to get down again mean that quite apart from hesitation of landing like being up there then abruptly benham come back to theory fear see be inevitable janitor be not ruler of experience be what be driving at in bark of danger be worse than bite inside portal there may be event destruction terror stay defeated at door may be that when old man be killed by horse child who watched suffered more than did be sure be so a white read benham note saw how argument drove on be reminded again again of schoolboy day benham hardihood own instinctive unreasonable reluctance to follow gallant intellectual lead if fear be ancient instinctive boundary that modern life aristocratic life be bound to ignore transcend may not also be case with pain do little adventure into life beyond fear may not also think of adventuring into life beyond pain be pain saner warning than fear may not pain just a much a fear keep from possible splendid thing why ask question be already answered in principle in dentist chair benham idea however went much further than that be clearly suggesting that in pain pain endured beyond certain pitch there might come pleasure again intensity of sensation might have colour of delight betrayed real anxiety to demonstrate possibility have earnestness of man who be sensible of dissentient element within hated thought of pain even more than hated fear argument did not in least convince white who stopped to poke fire assure of own comfort in midst of reading young people unseasoned people benham argued be apt to imagine that if fear be increased carried to extreme pitch becomes unbearable one will faint die given weak heart weak artery such structural defect may well happen be just a possible that a stimulation increase one pass through brief ecstasy of terror to new sane world exalted a sane a normal existence there be calmness of despair benham have made note to enforce view of observed calm behaviour of men already hopelessly lost men on sinking ship men going to execution men already maimed awaiting final stroke for most part be merely reference to book periodical in exactly same way argued exaggerate range of pain a if be limitless think if be unthinking that pass into agony so beyond endurance to destruction probably doe nothing of kind benham compared pain to death range of electric current at certain voltage thrill at greater torment convulses at still greater kill at enormous voltage a tesla be first to demonstrate doe injury following on came memoranda on recorded behaviour of martyr on self torture of hindoo ascetic of defiance of red indian prisoner thing benham have written be much more horrible when one considers from point of view of easy chair white gave assenting nod be really horrible at be possible that charred slashed splintered person indian hanging from hook walker in fiery furnace have have glimpse through great window be worth price paid for have allowed check barrier be so important restraint upon childish enterprise to creep up into distress distort adult life modern world think too much a though painlessness freedom from danger be ultimate end be fear haunted be troubled by thought of pain death have never met except a well guarded child meet thing in exaggerated untestable form in menagerie in nightmare so think discovery of anaesthetic crowning triumph of civilization cosiness innocent amusement ideal of nursery whole purpose of mankind mm said white pressed lip together knotted brow shook head bulk of benham discussion of fear be not concerned with perverse overstrained suggestion of pleasure reached through torture exaggeration of man resolved not to shrink at anything be examination of present range use of fear led gradually to something like theory of control discipline second of two dominating idea be that fear be instinct arising only in isolation that in crowd there may be collective panic that there be real individual fear fear benham held drive man back to crowd dog to master wolf to pack when be felt that danger be pooled then fear leaf be quite prepared to meet objection that animal of solitary habit do nevertheless exhibit fear of apparent fear argued be merely discretion what be not discretion be survival of infantile characteristic fear felt by tiger cub be certainly social emotion drive back to other cub to mother dark hiding of lair fear of fully grown tiger sends into reed shadow to refuge must be still reminiscent of maternal lair fear have very little hold upon adult solitary animal change with extreme readiness to resentment rage like most inexperienced people ran note be astonished at reported feat of men in war believed be exaggerated that there be kind of unpremeditated conspiracy of silence about real behaviour when on way to visit india for third time turned off to see what must of fighting before adrianople discovered at once that thousand casually selected conscript will one of do thing together that not one of must by mean be induced to do alone saw men not merely obey order gave nearly certain prospect of death saw exceeding order saw men leap out of cover for mere sake of defiance fall shot through smashed by score of bullet saw number of bulgarian in hand of surgeon several quite frightfully wounded refuse chloroform merely to impress english onlooker of injury must scarcely endure to see watched line of infantry men go on up hill keep on quite manifestly cheerful with men dropping out wriggling men dropping out lying still until other man be down not one man must have gone up hill alone without onlooker rowe lion hunter told benham that only on one occasion in life have given way to ungovernable fear be when be alone many time have be in fearful situation in face of charging lion elephant once have be bowled over carried distance by lion on none of occasion have fear demoralized there be question of general pluck on one occasion be lost in rocky waterless country in somaliland strayed out in early morning while camel be being loaded followed antelope too far lost bearing looked up expecting to see sun on right hand found on left became bewildered wandered time then fired three signal shot got reply then losing head began shouting have only four five more cartridge water bottle men be accustomed to going on alone might not begin to remark upon absence until sundown chanced however that one of shikari noted water bottle have left behind organized hunt for long before found have passed to extremity of terror world have become hideous threatening sun be pitiless glare rocky ridge clambered became more dreadful than last new valley into looked more hateful desolate cramped thorn bush threatened gauntly rock have sinister lustre in blue shadow about night death lurked waited there be hurry for presently must spread out again join submerge presently in confederated darkness must be stalked seized slain yes admitted be real fear have cracked voice yelling a child yell then have become afraid of own voice now excess of fear in isolation comfort in crowd in support in refuge even when support refuge be quite illusory be just exactly what one must expect of fear if one believed to be instinct have become misfit in ease of soldier fear be so much misfit that instead of saving for most part destroys raw soldier under fire bunch together army fight in mass men be mowed down in swathe because only so be courage of common men sustained only so can be brave albeit spread out handling weapon a men of unqualified daring must handle must be infinitely safer more effective of may be be restrained by misfit fear from thousand bold successful gesture of mind body be held back from attainment of mighty security in pitiful temporary shelter be perhaps in end no better than trap from such consideration benham went on to speculate how far crowd can be replaced in man imagination how far substitute for social backing can be made to serve same purpose in neutralizing fear wrote with calm of man who weighs probability of riddle with zeal of man lost to material consideration writing seemed to white have something of enthusiastic whiteness of face enthusiastic brightness of eye can no more banish fear from being at present than can carve out fleshy pillar of heart pineal gland in brain be deep in inheritance a deep a hunger just a have to satisfy hunger in order that must leave free so have to satisfy unconquerable importunity of fear have to reassure faltering instinct there must be something to take place of lair familiar something not general that must carry with into lonely place for be true that man have now not only to learn to fight in open order instead of in phalanx have to think plan act in open order to live in open order then with one of abrupt transition benham have written brings to god devil doe said white roused to keener attention by feat of intention can achieve courage in loneliness so long a feel indeed alone isolated man egoist epicurean man will always fail in solitary place there must be something more with to sustain against vast universe than spark of life began yesterday must be extinguished to morrow there can be courage beyond social courage sustaining confidence of herd until there be in sense of god god be word that cover multitude of meaning when be boy be passionate atheist defied god so far a god be mere sanction of social tradition pressure mere dressing up of crowd will in canonicals do still deny repudiate that god heard of first from nursemaid in very truth be proper god of nursemaid of mankind there be god than god of obedience god immortal adventurer in god who call men from home country god scourged crowned with thorn who rose in nail pierced body out of death came not to bring peace sword with something bordering upon intellectual consternation white who be decent self respecting sceptic read last clamberings of benham spirit be written in pencil be unfinished when died surely man be not christian may be heedless of death suffering because think can not suffer die may be heedless of death pain because have identified life with honour of mankind insatiable adventurousness of man imagination so that possible death be negligible possible achievement altogether outweighs white shook head over pencilled fragment be member of rationalist press association have always taken for granted that benham be orthodox unbeliever be hopelessly unsound heresy perilous stuff almost seemed to posthumous betrayal one night when be in india spirit of adventure came upon benham have gone with kepple of forestry department into jungle country in hill above tapti have be very anxious to see something of aspect of indian life have snatched at chance kepple have given have scarcely started before expedition be brought to end by accident kepple be thrown by pony ankle broken benham bandaged a well a must litter be sent for meanwhile have to wait in camp be to have be centre of jungle raid second day of waiting be worse for kepple than first suffered much from pressure of amateurish bandaging in evening benham got cool water from well rearranged thing better two men dined smoked under thatched roof beneath big banyan then kepple tired out by day of pain be carried to tent presently fell asleep benham be left to now that heat be over found quite indisposed to sleep felt full of life anxious for happening went back sat down upon iron bedstead beneath banyan kepple have lain upon through day watched soft immensity of indian night swallow up last lingering colour of world left outline obliterated nothing stripped off superficial reality of thing moon be full high overhead light have not so much gone a changed from definition blazing glitter reflection of solidity

greedily then found that there be two then more of black thing three four of curiosity made benham draw nearer very softly presently one showed in patch of moonlight startlingly big huge black hairy

between everybody 'd have rich poor again in year billy perceived way of explaining away version of socialism must not involve uncivil contradiction nobody ever contradicted lady marayne lady marayne think there be lot of disorder injustice in world protested there must be ever so much more if socialist have way still think be unnecessary even to recapitulate universal controversy of time lunch table dinner table general talk of house drifted more more definitely at own level in same direction a private talk of prothero benham towards antagonism of privileged few many of trained traditioned against natural undisciplined of aristocracy against democracy at week end sir godfrey returned to bring fresh element said that democracy be unscientific to deny aristocracy be to deny existence of

be talking of eugenics family benham be almost knocked down by american trotter driven by lord breeze whup there said lord breeze in voice deliberately brutal benham roused from abstraction be partly fatigue have to jump aside stumbled against parapet a gaunt pacer went pounding by lord breeze grinned sort of grin man remembers passed damnation said benham with face have become suddenly very white then presently fool can do who care to go to trouble said prothero taking up unquenchable issue be feeling of democracy walk because choose to said thing rankled equestrianism began be matter of time money time even more than money want to read want to deal with idea fool can drive exactly said prothero a for riding mean more than elaborate study cultivation of horse have to know horse be individual made horse perhaps go round like omnibus for rest prothero made noise of sympathetic assent in country where equestrianism be assertion suppose one must be equestrian night malignant spirit kept benham awake great american trotter with vast wide striding foot long yellow teeth uncontrollable hard mouthed american trotter pounded over angry soul prothero said in hall next day be going to drive to morrow next day so soon a have lunched led way towards maltby in crosshampton lane something in bearing put question into prothero mind benham asked have ever driven before never said benham well be going to now something between pleasure alarm came into prothero eye quickened pace so a to get alongside friend scrutinize pale determination why be doing asked want to do benham be equestrian benham made audible reply proceeded resolutely in silence air of expectation prevailed in maltby yard in shaft of high bleak looking vehicle with vast side wheel throne like vehicle that impressed billy prothero a being gig very large angular black horse be being harnessed be mine said benham compactly be yours sir said ostler look quiet will find fresh enough sir benham made complicated ascent to driver seat be handed rein come on said prothero followed to le exalted seat at benham side seemed to be at very great height indeed horse be then led out into crosshampton lane faced towards trinity street discharged check said benham touched steed with whip started quite well ostler went back into yard visibly unanxious struck prothero that perhaps driving be le difficult than have supposed went along crosshampton lane high walled gulley with dignity with only slight suggestion of inaccuracy be presently to become apparent until met little old bearded don on bicycle then misunderstanding arose between benham horse little bearded don be driven into narrow pavement have to get off hastily made comment face became like gargoyle sorry said benham gave mind to corner there be difficulty about whether be to turn to right left at last benham seemed carried point went along narrow street past grey splendour of king rather in middle of way prothero considered beast in front of how proud disrespectful horse in dogcart can seem to behind moreover unaccustomed a be to horse be struck by strong resemblance bird eye view of horse bear to fiddle fiddle with devil ear of course said prothero be trotter must get trotter said benham thought must try sort of thing before tried trotter added then suddenly came disaster there be butcher cart on right benham mistrusting intelligence of steed insisted upon excessive amplitude of clearance did not reckon with hand barrow on left piled up with dirty plate from lunch of trinity hall have be left there custodian be away upon mysterious errand heaven know why trinity hall exhibited treasure of crockery thus stained deified in cambridge street did for benham prothero undoing prothero saw great wheel over be poised entangle with little wheel of barrow god whispered craned fascinated little wheel be manifestly intrigued beyond self control by great wheel clung to went before heedless of barrow of be inseparable part barrow came about with appearance of unwillingness locked against great wheel reared towards prothero began smash smash smash to shed higher plate be clear that benham be grappling with crisis upon basis of inadequate experience number of people shouted haphazard thing then too late barrow have persuaded little wheel to give up fancy for great wheel there be enormous crash whoa cried benham whoa also unfortunately sawed hard at horse mouth animal being in perplexity danced little in narrow street then have come about be backing backing on narrow pavement towards plate glass window of book newspaper shop benham tugged at mouth much harder than ever prothero saw window bending under pressure of wheel sense of profound seriousness of life of folly of expedition came upon with extreme nimbleness got down just a window burst went with explosion like pistol shot then clatter of falling glass people sprang seemed from nowhere jostled about prothero so that became peripheral figure in discussion perceived that man in green apron be holding horse that various people be engaged in simultaneous conversation with benham who with pale serenity of face awful calm of manner dealt with of in turn be sorry be saying somebody ought to have be in charge of barrow here be card be ready to pay for damage barrow ought not to have be there yes be going on of course be going on thank beckoned to man who have held horse handed crown glanced at prothero a one might glance at stranger check said horse went on gravely benham lifted out whip appeared to have clean forgotten prothero perhaps presently must miss went on past trinity past ruddy brick of st john curve of street hid from prothero eye prothero started in pursuit glimpsed dog cart turning into bridge street have impression benham used whip at corner that dog cart went forward out of sight with startled jerk prothero quickened pace when got to fork between huntingdon road cottenham road road be clear spent time in hesitation then went along huntingdon road until came upon road mender learnt that benham have passed that way going pretty fast ' e be said road mender whipping 'be 'orse else might ' thought e be

sun shone upon horse upon benham erect figure upon face gleam of fire kept flashing from head to rim like gleam of drawn sword seen from afar a drew nearer halo detached from became wheel sticking up behind large clumsy looking bicycle be attached to dog cart behind expression of benham golden face be still stony expression regarded friend with hard eye right benham cried prothero advancing into road eye examined horse looked all right if anything be trifle subdued there be little foam about mouth not very much whoa said benham horse stopped be coming up prothero prothero clambered up beside

modern career begin suddenly man see line intention yet though be of writing long novel white world be literary world be how looked to profess to set out life of men part of journey crucial passage among sphinx be still done when be done at slightly evasively why white fell back on professionalism doe not make book make novel into treatise turn into dissertation even a white said to knew be

in sunlit thicket second opened at once with bicycle accident brought two young people together so that be never afterwards disentangled third failing to produce heroine in thirty page have to be rearranged next white returned from unprofitable digression to matter before first of benham early essay be written in almost boyish hand be youthfully amateurish in nervous disposition to definition distinction in elaborate linking of part to part be called true democracy manifestly be written before incident of trinity hall plate most of have be done after prothero visit to chexington white must feel that now inaudible interlocutor there be even trace of sir godfrey marayne assertion that democracy be contrary to biology from outset be clear that else meant true democracy following analogy of true politeness true courage true honesty true marriage did not mean democracy at benham be in fact taking prothero word trying to impose upon own solidifying crystallizing opinion of life be not a yet very large well formed crystal proposition struggled to develop be true democracy did not mean equal share in government meant equal opportunity to share in government men be by nature in most various way unequal true democracy aimed only at removal of artificial inequality be on truth of statement that men be by nature unequal that debate have turned prothero be passionately against idea at time be felt separating from benham more more spoke with personal bitterness found chief ally in rigorous voluble frenchman named carnac aggressive roman catholic who opened speech by saying that first aristocrat be devil shocked prothero by claiming a probably only other sound christian in room several biologist be present one tall fair youth with wearisome forefinger tried to pin carnac with question must admit men be taller than others then others be broader be smaller altogether nimbler be notorious of smaller be le nimble than others then have better nightmare how can tell biologist be temporarily incapacitated talk went on over prostrate attempt to rally protest second biologist seemed to benham to come nearer gist of dispute when said that be not discussing importance of men relative inequality nobody be denying equal importance of everybody there be virtue of man virtue of nobody must dispute equal importance of wheel in machine of atom in universe prothero carnac be angry because thought denial of absolute equality be denial of equal importance be not so man mattered in place politically economically intellectually might be lowly place at point carnac interrupted with whooping great violence volley of obscure french colloquialism be understood to convey that speaker be jew did not in least mean what be saying second paper be altogether maturer more characteristic production be no longer necessary to answer prothero prothero have be incorporated benham have fairly got away with great idea be evident to white that paper have be worked over on several occasion since first composition that benham have intended to make part of book there be correction in pencil correction in different shade of ink there be unfinished new peroration be clearly latest addition of substance have be there always gave youth just grown to manhood anyhow fully grown presented far dreaming intellectualist shaped benham have called aristocracy be far away by now from political aristocracy time have not begun with definition generalization with curiously subjective appeal have not pretended to be theorizing at large longer be manifestly thinking of own life a manifestly be thinking of life a matter of difficulty unexpected thwarting see life wrote not only life in world outside life in own self a immense choice of possibility indeed for in particular who have come up here who be not under urgent necessity to take line that life be apparently pure choice be quite easy to think be going to choose pattern of life like best work out in own way meanwhile there be great hurry want to begin by saying that choice be so easy so necessary a seems think be going to choose presently in end may never choose at choice need perhaps more energy than think great multitude of older people can observe in world outside there have chosen either in matter of world outside where will go what will do what part will play in matter of world within what will be what be

discussion even amanda mother listened visibly betty said be certainly democratic mr wilder have always thought to be so outside circle round fire amanda hovered impatiently not quite sure of side a yet eager to come down with emphasis at first flash of intimation came down vehemently on benham being very clear cutting personality with instinct for material rendering of thing also came sat beside on little square cornered sofa of course mr rathbone sander said of course world must belong to people who dare of course people be alike dull people a mr benham say spiteful people narrow people have right to voice at in thing in saying did echo benham very word said did that evening be in quick response to benham earnest expression of view found benham delightful novelty liked to argue because there be other talk so lively have perhaps lurking intellectual grudge against mr rathbone sander made welcome ally everything from night even verge upon notable have be told yet sufficed together with something in clear long line of limb in voice in general physical quality to convince benham that be freest finest bravest spirit that have ever encountered in paper left behind be to be found

familiarity sir philip perceived with start be instantly controlled greeted with unnatural ease sir philip seemed be fishing reading playing cricket in neighbourhood struck benham a poor way of spending summer sort of soft holiday man learns to take from scholar literary men man like sir philip thought ought to have be aviating travelling moreover when sir philip greeted amanda seemed to benham that there be flavour of established association in manner then sir philip be also very assiduous with lady marayne called pip afterwards amanda called across tennis court to pip then called amanda when wilder girl came up to join tennis be just a brotherly next day came to lunch during meal benham became more aware than have ever be before of peculiar deep expressiveness of young man eye watched watched amanda with solicitude seemed at once pained tender there be something about kind of hard brightness impartiality air of something undefinably suspended that gave intuitive certitude that afternoon sir philip must be spoken to privately that then must pack up go away in state of illumination from chexington before must be spoken to contrived to speak to benham be left to smoke after lunch then be took advantage of pause to commit little indiscretion mr benham said look amazingly well extraordinarily well think yes said benham startled yes certainly keep very well miss

something one dismissed put behind in mere effort to be aristocratic begin to realize that be not quite so easily settled with one like to know possibly one want to know too much in phase of fatigue particularly in phase of sleeplessness when one be leaving one care for behind becomes irrational torment be not only in that be astonished by power of base motive see too in queer business of prothero how strongly jealousy how strongly sense of proprietorship weighs with man there be clear reason why one must insist upon human being being one ownest own utterly one own there be of course clear reason for most human motif one doe there be something dishonouring in distrust to distrusted one who distrust after apparently have be too hot stuffy to continue benham did not see amanda again

sentimentalize be clear that unless be to be lost one must be content to leave alone people that one can reach only by sentimentalizing amanda yet somehow love for still must not leave one alone so be always feverishly weaving net of false relationship until very self be forgotten so will go on until end with easton have be necessary for to key to simple exalted romanticism be entirely insincere have so accustomed to pose that innate gesture be forgotten must not recover must not even reinvent between there be momentary gleam a though presently must be frank former self again be never more

clearly believed that under circumstance amanda must have tried to recover anybody have dressed for morning encounter in very becoming intimate wrap of soft mauve white silk have washed dried dark hair so that be vapour about face set with single mind to persuade benham that be inseparable lover must not be deflected by grim determination to discus condition of separation when asked whether wanted divorce offered to throw over sir philip banish for ever a lightly a great lady might sacrifice objectionable poodle to connubial peace benham passed through perplexing phase so that began to feel that practice with easton have spoilt hand initial grimness must understand partially breakdown into irritability be puzzled by laughter for laughed abruptly know amanda came home in mood of tremendous tragedy really be lark then overriding altogether told what meant to do about future future of little son want divorce fuss then will leave thing perceive have intention of marrying more 'd

sympathizer spectator upon side walk at head of two men disputed seemed to be differing about direction of whole crowd suddenly one smote other with fist blow hurled sideways then turned with triumphant gesture to following rank waving arm in air be tall lean man hatless collarless greyhaired wild eyed on came gesticulating gauntly past hotel then up street something happened benham attention be turned round to by checking by kind of catch in breath on part of advancing procession under verandah roadway beyond club have suddenly become clear across dozen soldier have appeared dismounted methodically lined out with carbine in readiness mounted men at club corner have vanished people there have swayed about towards new threat quite abruptly miscellaneous noise of crowd ceased understanding seized upon one soldier be going to fire brown uniformed figure moved like automaton rifle shot rang out almost in one report there be rush in crowd towards doorway side street
