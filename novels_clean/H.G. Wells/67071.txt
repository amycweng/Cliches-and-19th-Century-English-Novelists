illustration above be lava hot gas ash below seething flood whole earth swayed rumbled with earthquake here be impressive story based on inter action of planetary body of sun upon great star be seen approaching earth at first be only object of interest to general public there be astronomer on earth who be watching phase making mathematical calculation for know intimate relation of gravitation between body effect on rotating body of same force from outside source fear sort of wreckage on earth warns people a usual discount all say label mad be not mad h g well in own way give picturesque description of approach of new body through long day nightshe tell how earth natural phenomenon of earth will react though star never touch sphere devastation destruction wrought by be complete horrible story be correct in astronomical aspect star by h g well author of war of world time machine etc be on first day of new year that announcement be made almost simultaneously from three observatory that motion of planet neptune outermost of planet wheeled about sun have become erratic ogilvy have already called attention to suspected retardation in velocity in december such piece of news be scarcely calculated to interest world greater portion of whose inhabitant be unaware of existence of planet neptune outside astronomical profession did subsequent discovery of faint remote speck of light in region of perturbed planet cause great excitement scientific people however found intelligence remarkable enough even before became known that new body be rapidly growing larger brighter that motion be quite different from orderly progress of planet that deflection of neptune satellite be becoming now of unprecedented kind few people without training in science can realize huge isolation of solar system sun with speck of planet dust of planetoid impalpable comet swim in vacant immensity that almost defeat imagination beyond orbit of neptune there be space vacant so far
