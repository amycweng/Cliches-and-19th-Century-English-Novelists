time be now known be member of aeronautical society albeit contributed nothing to discussion of body preferring doubt to mature great conception without external assistance within two year of paper before society of art be hastily taking out number of patent proclaiming in various undignified way completion of divergent inquiry made flying machine possible first definite statement to effect appeared in halfpenny evening paper through agency of man who lodged in same house with filmer final haste after long laborious secret patience seems to have be due to needle panic bootle notorious american scientific quack having made announcement filmer interpreted wrongly a anticipation of idea now what precisely be filmer idea really very simple one before time pursuit of aeronautics have taken two divergent line have developed on one hand balloon large apparatus lighter than air easy in ascent comparatively safe in descent floating helplessly before breeze took on other flying machine flew only in theory vast flat structure heavier than air propelled kept up by heavy engine for most part smashing at first descent neglecting fact that inevitable final collapse rendered impossible weight of flying machine gave theoretical advantage that must go through air against wind necessary condition if aerial navigation be to have practical value be filmer particular merit that perceived way in contrasted hitherto incompatible merit of balloon heavy flying machine might be combined in one apparatus must be at choice heavier lighter than air took hint from contractile bladder of fish pneumatic cavity of bird devised arrangement of contractile absolutely closed balloon when expanded must lift actual flying apparatus with ease when retracted by complicated musculature wove about be withdrawn almost completely into frame built large framework balloon sustained of hollow rigid tube air in by ingenious contrivance be automatically pumped out a apparatus fell then remained exhausted so long a aeronaut desired there be wing propeller to machine such a there have be to previous aeroplane only engine required be compact powerful little appliance needed to contract balloon perceived that apparatus a have devised might rise with frame exhausted balloon expanded to considerable height might then contract balloon let air into frame by adjustment of weight slide down air in desired direction a fell must accumulate velocity at same time lose weight momentum accumulated by down rush must be utilised by mean of shifting of weight to drive up in air again a balloon expanded conception be still structural conception of successful flying machine needed however vast amount of toil upon detail before must actually be realised such toil filmer a be accustomed to tell numerous interviewer who crowded upon in heyday of fame ungrudgingly unsparingly gave particular difficulty be elastic lining of contractile balloon found needed new substance in discovery manufacture of new substance have a never failed to impress upon interviewer performed far more arduous work than even in actual achievement of seemingly greater discovery must not be imagined that interview followed hard upon filmer proclamation of invention interval of nearly five year elapsed during timidly remained at rubber factory seems to have be entirely dependent on small income from source making misdirected attempt to assure quite indifferent public that really have invented what have invented occupied greater part of leisure in composition of letter to scientific daily press so forth stating precisely net result of contrivance demanding financial aid that alone must have sufficed for suppression of letter spent such holiday a must arrange in unsatisfactory interview with door keeper of leading london paper be singularly not adapted for inspiring hall porter with confidence positively attempted to induce war office to take up work with there remains confidential letter from major general volleyfire to earl of frog man crank bounder to boot say major general in bluff sensible army way so left open for japanese to secure a subsequently did priority in side of warfare priority still to great discomfort retain then by stroke of luck membrane filmer have invented for contractile balloon be discovered to be useful for valve of new oil engine obtained mean for making trial model of invention threw up rubber factory appointment desisted from further writing with certain secrecy seems to have be inseparable characteristic of proceeding set to work upon apparatus seems to have directed making of part collected most of in room in shoreditch final putting together be done at dymchurch in kent did not make affair large enough to carry man made extremely ingenious use of what be then called marconi ray to control flight first flight of first practicable flying machine took place over field near burford bridge near hythe in kent filmer followed controlled flight upon specially constructed motor tricycle flight be considering thing amazing success apparatus be brought in cart from dymchurch to burford bridge ascended there to height of nearly three hundred foot swooped thence very nearly back to dymchurch came about in sweep rose again circled finally sank uninjured in field behind burford bridge inn at descent curious thing happened filmer got off tricycle scrambled over intervening dyke advanced perhaps twenty yard towards triumph threw out arm in strange gesticulation fell down in dead faint one must then recall ghastliness of feature evidence of extreme excitement have observed throughout trial thing might otherwise have forgotten afterwards in inn have unaccountable gust of hysterical weeping altogether there be not twenty witness of affair for most part uneducated men new romney doctor saw ascent not descent horse being frightened by electrical apparatus on filmer tricycle giving nasty spill two member of kent constabulary watched affair from cart in unofficial spirit grocer calling round marsh for order two lady cyclist seem almost to complete list of educated people there be two reporter present one representing folkestone

halfpenny penny six penny more expensive paper alike acknowledged by whole world a greatest discoverer of age have invented practicable flying machine day down among surrey hill life sized model be getting ready when be ready followed a clear inevitable consequence of having invented made everybody in world indeed seemed to take for granted there be gap anywhere in serried front of anticipation that must proudly cheerfully get aboard ascend with fly know now pretty clearly that simple pride cheerfulness in such act be singularly out of harmony with filmer private constitution occurred to one at time there fact be can guess with confidence now that must have be drifting about in mind great deal during day from little note to physician complaining of persistent insomnia have soundest reason for supposing dominated night idea that must be after in spite of theoretical security abominably sickening uncomfortable dangerous thing for to flap about in nothingness thousand foot so in air must have dawned upon quite early in period of being greatest discoverer of age vision of doing that with extensive void below perhaps somewhen in youth have looked down great height fallen down in excessively uncomfortable way perhaps habit of sleeping on wrong side have resulted in disagreeable falling nightmare one know given horror of strength of horror there remains now not particle of

from banghurst magnificent laboratory be interviewed lionised wore good clothes ate good food lived in elegant flat enjoying very abundant feast of such good coarse wholesome fame success a man starved for year a have be starved might be reasonably expected to enjoy after time weekly gathering in fulham ceased model have failed one day just for moment to respond to filmer guidance have be distracted by compliment of archbishop at rate suddenly dug nose into air just little too steeply a archbishop be sailing through latin quotation for world like archbishop in book came down in fulham road within three yard of 'bus horse stood for second perhaps astonishing in attitude astonished then crumpled shivered into piece 'bus horse be incidentally killed filmer lost end of archiepiscopal compliment stood up stared a invention swooped out of sight reach of long white hand still gripped useless apparatus archbishop followed skyward stare with apprehension unbecoming in archbishop then came crash shout uproar from road to relieve filmer tension god whispered sat down one else almost be staring to see where machine have vanished rushing into house making of big machine progressed more rapidly for over making presided filmer always little slow very careful in manner always with growing preoccupation in mind care over strength soundness of apparatus be prodigious slightest doubt delayed everything until doubtful part must be replaced wilkinson senior assistant fumed at of delay insisted be for most part unnecessary banghurst magnified patient certitude of filmer in new paper reviled bitterly to wife macandrew second assistant approved filmer wisdom be not wanting fiasco man said macandrew be perfectly well advised whenever opportunity arose filmer must expound to wilkinson macandrew just exactly how part of flying machine be to be controlled worked so that in effect must be just a capable even more capable when at last time came of guiding through sky now must imagine that if filmer have seen fit at stage to define just what be feeling to take definite line in matter of ascent might have escaped that painful ordeal quite easily if have have clearly in mind must have done endless thing must surely have found difficulty with specialist to demonstrate weak heart something gastric pulmonary to stand in way be line be astonished did not take might have be man enough have declared simply finally that did not intend to do thing fact be though dread be hugely present in mind thing be by mean sharp clear fancy that through period kept telling that when occasion came must find equal to be like man just gripped by great illness who say feel little out of sort expects to be better presently meanwhile delayed completion of machine let assumption that be going to fly take root flourish exceedingly about even accepted anticipatory compliment on courage barring secret squeamishness there can be doubt found praise distinction fuss got delightful even intoxicating draught lady mary elkinghorn made thing little more complicated for how began be subject of inexhaustible speculation to hick probably in beginning be just little nice to with impartial partiality of hers may be that to eye standing out conspicuously a did ruling monster in upper air have distinction that hick be not disposed to find somehow must have have moment of sufficient isolation great discoverer moment of sufficient courage for something just little personal to be mumbled blurted however began there be doubt that did begin presently became quite perceptible to world accustomed to find in proceeding of lady mary elkinghorn matter of entertainment complicated thing because state of love in such virgin mind a filmer must brace resolution if not sufficiently at rate considerably towards facing danger feared hampered in such attempt at evasion a must otherwise be natural congenial remains matter for speculation just how lady mary felt for filmer just what thought of at thirty eight one may have gathered much wisdom still be not altogether wise imagination still function actively enough in creating glamour effecting impossible came before eye a very central man always count have power unique power a seemed at rate in air performance with model have just touch of quality of potent incantation woman have ever displayed unreasonable disposition to imagine that when man have power must necessarily have power given so much what be not good in filmer manner appearance became added merit be modest hated display given occasion where true quality be needed then then one must see late mr bampton thought wise to convey to lady mary opinion that filmer thing considered be rather grub be certainly not sort of man have ever met before said lady mary with quite unruffled serenity mr bampton after swift imperceptible glance at serenity decided that so far a saying anything to lady mary went have done a much a must be expected of said great deal to other people at last without undue haste unseemliness day dawned great day when banghurst have promised public world in fact that flying must be finally attained overcome filmer saw dawn watched even in darkness before dawned watched star fade grey pearly pink give place at last to clear blue sky of sunny cloudless day watched from window of bedroom in new built wing of banghurst tudor house a star be overwhelmed shape substance of thing grew into being out of amorphous dark must have seen more more distinctly festive preparation beyond beech clump near green pavilion in outer park three stand for privileged spectator raw new fencing of enclosure shed workshop venetian mast fluttering flag that banghurst have considered essential black limp in breezeless dawn amidst thing great shape covered with tarpauling strange terrible portent for humanity be that shape beginning must surely spread widen change dominate affair of men to filmer be very doubtful whether appeared in anything narrow personal light several people heard pacing in small hour for vast place be packed with guest by proprietor editor who before understood compression about five o'clock if not before filmer left room wandered out of sleeping house into park alive by time with sunlight bird squirrel fallow deer macandrew who be also early riser met near machine went have look at together be doubtful if filmer took breakfast in spite of urgency of banghurst so soon a guest began to be about in number seems to have retreated to room thence about ten went into shrubbery very probably because have seen lady mary elkinghorn there be walking up down engaged in conversation with old school friend mr brewis craven although filmer have never met latter lady before joined walked beside for time there be several silence in spite of lady mary brilliance situation be difficult one mr brewis craven did not master difficulty struck said afterwards with luminous self contradiction a very unhappy person who have something to say wanted before thing to be helped to say how be one to help when one did know what be at half past eleven enclosure for public in outer park be crammed there be intermittent stream of equipage along belt circle outer park house party be dotted over lawn shrubbery corner of inner park in series of brilliantly attired knot making for flying machine filmer walked in group of three with banghurst who be supremely conspicuously happy sir theodore hickle president of aeronautical society mr banghurst be close behind with lady mary elkinghorn georgina hickle dean of stay banghurst be large copious in speech such interstice a left be filled in by hickle with complimentary remark to filmer filmer walked between saying not word except by way of unavoidable reply behind mr banghurst listened to admirably suitable shapely conversation of dean with fluttered attention to ampler clergy ten year of social ascent ascendency have not cured in lady mary watched doubt with entire confidence in world disillusionment drooping shoulder of sort of man have never met before there be cheering a central party came into view of enclosure be not very unanimous invigorating cheering be within fifty yard of apparatus when filmer took hasty glance over shoulder to measure distance of lady behind decided to make first remark have initiated since house have be left voice be just little hoarse cut in on banghurst in mid sentence on progress say banghurst said stopped yes said banghurst wish moistened lip be not feeling well banghurst stopped dead eh shouted queer feeling filmer made to move on banghurst be immovable know may be better in minute if not perhaps macandrew be not feeling well said banghurst stared at white face dear said a mr banghurst came up with filmer say be feeling well little queer exclaimed filmer avoiding lady mary eye may pas off there be pause came to filmer that be most isolated person in world in case said ascent must be made perhaps if be to sit down somewhere for moment be crowd think said filmer there be second pause banghurst eye rested in scrutiny on filmer then swept sample of public in enclosure be unfortunate said sir theodore hickle still suppose assistant of course if feel out of condition disinclined think mr filmer must permit that for moment said lady mary if mr filmer nerve be run might even be dangerous for to attempt hickle coughed be just because be dangerous began lady mary felt have made point of view filmer plain enough conflicting motif struggled for filmer feel ought to go up said regarding ground looked up met lady mary eye want to go up said smiled whitely at turned towards banghurst if must just sit down somewhere for moment out of crowd sun banghurst at least be beginning to understand case come into little room in green pavilion said be quite cool there took filmer by arm filmer turned face to lady mary elkinghorn again will be right in five minute said be tremendously sorry lady mary elkinghorn smiled at must think said to hickle obeyed compulsion of banghurst pull rest remained watching two recede be so fragile said lady mary be certainly highly nervous type said dean whose weakness be to regard whole world except married clergyman with enormous family a neurotic of course said hickle be absolutely necessary for to go up because have invented how must avoid asked lady mary with faintest shadow of scorn be certainly most unfortunate if be going to be ill now said mr banghurst little severely be not going to be ill said lady mary certainly have met filmer eye will be right said banghurst a went towards pavilion want be nip of brandy ought to be know will be 'd get rough know if let man oh want to go said filmer will be all right a matter of fact be almost inclined now think will have nip of brandy first banghurst took into little room routed out empty decanter departed in search of supply be gone perhaps five minute history of five minute can not be written at interval filmer face must be seen by people on easternmost of stand erected for spectator against window pane peering out then must recede fade banghurst vanished shouting behind grand stand presently butler appeared going pavilionward with tray apartment in filmer came to last solution be pleasant little room very simply furnished with green furniture old bureau for banghurst be simple in private way be hung with little engraving after morland have shelf of book a happened banghurst have left rook rifle sometimes played with on top of desk on corner of mantelshelf be tin with three four cartridge remaining in a filmer went up down room wrestling with intolerable dilemma went first towards neat little rifle athwart blotting pad then towards neat little red label long thing must have jumped into mind in moment nobody seems to have connected report with though gun being fired in confined space must have sounded loud there be several people in billiard room separated from only by lath plaster partition directly banghurst butler opened door smelt sour smell of smoke knew say what have happened for servant at least of banghurst household have guessed something of what be going on in filmer mind through trying afternoon banghurst behaved a held man must behave in presence of hopeless disaster guest for most part succeeded in not insisting upon fact though to conceal perception of be impossible that banghurst have be pretty elaborately completely swindled by deceased public in enclosure hick told dispersed like party have be ducking welsher there be soul in train to london seems who have known along flying be quite impossible thing for man might have tried said many after carrying thing so far in evening when be comparatively alone banghurst broke down went on like man of clay have be told wept must have made imposing scene certainly said filmer have ruined life offered sold whole apparatus to macandrew for crown have be thinking said macandrew at conclusion of bargain stopped next morning name of filmer be for first time le conspicuous in new paper than in other daily paper in world rest of world instructor with varying emphasis according to dignity degree of competition between new paper proclaimed entire failure of new flying machine suicide of impostor in district of north surrey reception of news be tempered by perception of unusual aerial phenomenon overnight wilkinson macandrew have fallen into violent argument on exact motif of principal rash act man be certainly poor cowardly body so far a science went be impostor said macandrew be prepared to give proposition very practical demonstration mr wilkinson so soon a have got place little more to ourselves for have faith in publicity for experimental trial to end while world be reading of certain failure of new flying machine macandrew be soaring curvetting with great amplitude dignity over epsom wimbledon division banghurst restored once more to hope energy regardless of public security board of trade be pursuing gyration trying to attract attention on motor car in pyjama have caught sight of ascent when pulling up blind of bedroom window equipped among other thing with film camera be subsequently discovered to be jammed filmer be lying on billiard table in green pavilion with sheet about body magic shop have seen magic shop from afar several time have passed once twice shop window of alluring little object magic ball magic hen wonderful cone ventriloquist doll material of basket trick pack of card looked right sort of thing never have thought

be asked make charge for glass ball said shopman politely get picked one out of elbow a spoke free produced from back of neck laid beside predecessor on counter gip regarded glass ball sagely then directed look of inquiry at two on counter finally brought round eyed scrutiny to shopman who smiled may have too said shopman if mind one from mouth so gip counselled mutely for moment then in profound silence put away four ball resumed reassuring finger nerved for next event get smaller trick in way shopman remarked laughed in manner of one who subscribes to jest instead of going to wholesale shop said of course be cheaper in way shopman said though pay in end not so heavily a people suppose larger trick daily provision other thing want get out of hat know sir if will excuse saying there be wholesale shop not for genuine magic good sir know if noticed inscription genuine magic shop drew business card from cheek handed to genuine said with finger on word added there be

egotist pawing at enchanted pane be good sir said shopman a moved with natural helpfulness doorward presently spoilt child be carried off howling how do manage said breathing little more freely magic said shopman with careless wave of hand behold spark of coloured fire flew out of finger vanished into shadow of shop be saying said addressing to gip before came in that must like one of 'buy one astonish friend box gip after gallant effort said yes be in pocket leaning over counter really have extraordinarily long body amazing person produced article in customary conjurer manner paper said took sheet out of empty hat with spring string behold mouth be string box from drew unending thread when have tied parcel bit off seemed to swallowed ball of string then lit candle at nose of one of

broad spacious valley difficult winding trench of pebble along have tracked fugitive for so long expanded to broad slope with common impulse three men left trail rode to little eminence set with olive dun tree there halted two others a became little behind man with silver studded bridle for space scanned great expanse below with eager eye spread remoter remoter with only few cluster of sere thorn bush here there dim suggestion of now waterless ravine to break desolation of yellow grass purple distance melted at last into bluish slope of further hill hill might be of greener kind above invisibly supported seeming indeed to hang in blue be snowclad summit of mountain grew larger bolder to north westward a side of valley drew together westward valley opened until distant darkness under sky told where forest began three men looked east west only steadfastly across valley gaunt man with scarred lip be first to speak nowhere said with sigh of disappointment in voice after have full day start know be after said little man on white horse must know said leader bitterly a if speaking to even then ca go fast have got beast mule to day girl foot have be bleeding man with silver bridle flashed quick intensity of rage on do think have seen that snarled help anyhow whispered little man to gaunt man with scarred lip stared impassively ca be over valley said if ride hard glanced at white horse paused curse white horse said man with silver bridle turned to scan beast curse included little man looked down between melancholy ear of steed did best said two others stared again across valley for space gaunt man passed back of hand across scarred lip come up said man who owned silver bridle suddenly little man started jerked rein horse hoof of three made multitudinous faint pattering upon withered grass a turned back towards trail rode cautiously down long slope before so came through waste of prickly twisted bush strange dry shape of horny branch grew amongst rock into level below there trail grew faint for soil be scanty only herbage be scorched dead straw lay upon ground still by hard scanning by leaning beside horse neck pausing ever again even white men must contrive to follow after prey there be trodden place bent broken blade of coarse grass ever again sufficient intimation of footmark once leader saw brown smear of blood where half caste girl may have trod at under breath cursed for fool gaunt man checked leader tracking little man on white horse rode behind man lost in dream rode one after man with silver bridle led way spoke never word after time came to little man on white horse that world be very still started out of dream besides little noise of horse equipment whole great valley kept brooding quiet of painted scene before went master fellow intently leaning forward to left impassively moving with pace of horse shadow went before still noiseless tapering attendant nearer crouched cool shape be own looked about be have gone then remembered reverberation from bank of gorge perpetual accompaniment of shifting jostling pebble moreover there be breeze be what vast still place be monotonous afternoon slumber sky open blank except for sombre veil of haze have gathered in upper valley straightened back fretted with bridle puckered lip to whistle simply sighed turned in saddle for time stared at throat of mountain gorge out of have come blank blank slope on side with never sign of decent beast tree much le man what land be what wilderness dropped again into former pose filled with momentary pleasure to see wry stick of purple black flash out into form of snake vanish amidst brown after infernal valley be alive then to rejoice still more came little breath across face whisper came went faintest inclination of stiff black antlered bush upon little crest first intimation of possible breeze idly wetted finger held up pulled up sharply to avoid collision with gaunt man who have stopped at fault upon trail just at guilty moment caught master eye looking towards for time forced interest in tracking then a rode on again studied master shadow hat shoulder appearing disappearing behind gaunt man nearer contour have ridden four day out of very limit of world into desolate place short of water with nothing strip of dried meat under saddle over rock mountain where surely none fugitive have ever be before for be for girl mere wilful child man have whole cityfuls of people to do basest bidding girl woman why in name of passionate folly one in particular asked little man scowled at world licked parched lip with blackened tongue be way of master be knew just because sought to evade eye caught whole row of high plumed cane bending in unison then tail of silk that hung before neck flapped fell breeze be growing stronger somehow took stiff stillness out of thing be well hullo said gaunt man three stopped abruptly what asked master what over there said gaunt man pointing up valley what something coming towards a spoke yellow animal crested rise came bearing down upon be big wild dog coming before wind tongue out at steady pace running with intensity of purpose that did not seem to see horseman approached ran with nose up following be plain neither scent quarry a drew nearer little man felt for sword be mad said gaunt rider shout said little man shouted dog came on then when little man blade be already out swerved aside went panting by past eye of little man followed flight there be foam said for space man with silver studded bridle stared up valley oh come on cried at last what doe matter jerked horse into movement again little man left insoluble mystery of dog fled from nothing wind lapsed into profound musing on human character come on whispered to why must be given to one man to say 'come on ' with stupendous violence of effect always life man with silver bridle have be saying that if said thought little man people marvelled when master be disobeyed even in wildest thing half caste girl seemed to seemed to one mad blasphemous almost little man by way of comparison reflected on gaunt rider with scarred lip a stalwart a master a brave indeed perhaps braver yet for there be obedience nothing to give obedience duly stoutly certain sensation of hand knee called little man back to more immediate thing became aware of something rode up beside gaunt fellow do notice horse said in undertone gaunt face looked interrogation like wind said little man dropped behind a man with silver bridle turned upon be right said gaunt faced man rode on again for space in silence foremost two rode downcast upon trail hindmost man watched haze crept down vastness of valley nearer nearer noted how wind grew in strength moment by moment far away on left saw line of dark bulk wild hog perhaps galloping down valley of that said nothing did remark again upon uneasiness of horse then saw first one then second great white ball great shining white ball like gigantic head of thistle down drove before wind athwart path ball soared high in air dropped rose again caught for moment hurried on passed at sight of restlessness of horse increased then presently saw that more of drifting globe then soon very many more be hurrying towards down valley became aware of squealing athwart path huge boar rushed turning head for one instant to glance at then hurling on down valley again at three stopped sat in saddle staring into thickening haze be coming upon if be not for thistle down began leader now big globe came drifting past within score of yard of be really not even sphere at vast soft ragged filmy thing sheet gathered by corner aerial jelly fish a be rolling over over a advanced trailing long cobwebby thread streamer floated in wake be thistle down said little man like stuff said gaunt man looked at one curse cried leader air full of up there if keep on at pace long will stop altogether instinctive feeling such a line out herd of deer at approach of ambiguous thing prompted to turn horse to wind ride forward for few pace stare at advancing multitude of floating mass came on before wind with sort of smooth swiftness rising falling noiselessly sinking to earth rebounding high soaring with perfect unanimity with still deliberate assurance right left of horseman pioneer of strange army passed at one rolled along ground breaking shapelessly trailing out reluctantly into long grappling ribbon band three horse began to shy dance master be seized with sudden unreasonable impatience cursed drifting globe roundly get on cried get on do thing matter how can matter back to trail fell swearing at horse sawed bit across mouth shouted aloud with rage will follow trail tell cried where be trail gripped bridle of prancing horse searched amidst grass long clinging thread fell across face grey streamer dropped about bridle arm big active thing with many leg ran down back of head looked up to discover one of grey mass anchored a be above by thing flapping out end a sail flap when boat come about noiselessly have impression of many eye of dense crew of squat body of long many jointed limb hauling at mooring rope to bring thing down upon for space stared up reining in prancing horse with instinct born of year of horsemanship then flat of sword smote back blade flashed overhead cut drifting balloon of spider web free whole mass lifted softly drove clear away spider cried voice of gaunt man thing be full of big spider look lord man with silver bridle still followed mass drove away look lord master found staring down at red smashed thing on ground that in spite of partial obliteration must still wriggle unavailing leg then when gaunt man pointed to mass that bore down upon drew sword hastily up valley now be like fog bank torn to rag tried to grasp situation ride for little man be shouting ride for down valley what happened then be like confusion of battle man with silver bridle saw little man go past slashing furiously at imaginary cobweb saw cannon into horse of gaunt man hurl rider to earth own horse went dozen pace before must rein in then looked up to avoid imaginary danger then back again to see horse rolling on ground gaunt man standing slashing over at rent fluttering mass of grey streamed wrapped about thick fast a thistle down on waste land on windy day in july cobweb mass be coming on little man have dismounted dared not release horse be endeavouring to lug struggling brute back with strength of one arm while with other slashed aimlessly tentacle of second grey mass have entangled with struggle second grey mass came to mooring slowly sank master set teeth gripped bridle lowered head spurred horse forward horse on ground rolled over there be blood moving shape upon flank gaunt man suddenly leaving ran forward towards master perhaps ten pace leg be swathed encumbered with grey made ineffectual movement with sword grey streamer waved from there be thin veil of grey across face with left hand beat at something on body suddenly stumbled fell struggled to rise fell again suddenly horribly began to howl oh ohoo ohooh master must see great spider upon others upon ground a strove to force horse nearer to gesticulating screaming grey object struggled up down there came clatter of hoof little man in act of mounting swordless balanced on belly athwart white horse clutching mane whirled past again clinging thread of grey gossamer swept across master face about over seemed drifting noiseless cobweb circled drew nearer to day of death never knew just how event of moment happened did indeed turn horse did really of own accord stampede after fellow suffice that in second be galloping full tilt down valley with sword whirling furiously overhead about on quickening breeze spider airship air bundle air sheet seemed to to hurry in conscious pursuit clatter clatter thud thud man with silver bridle rode heedless of direction with fearful face looking up now right now left sword arm ready to slash few hundred yard ahead of with tail of torn cobweb trailing behind rode little man on white horse still imperfectly in saddle reed bent before wind blew fresh strong over shoulder master must see web hurrying to overtake be so intent to escape spider web only a horse gathered together for leap did realise ravine ahead then realised only to misunderstand interfere be leaning forward on horse neck sat up back too late if in excitement have failed to leap at rate have not forgotten how to fall be horseman again in mid air came off clear with mere bruise upon shoulder horse rolled kicking spasmodic leg lay still master sword drove point into hard soil snapped clean across a though chance refused longer a knight splintered end missed face by inch so be on foot in moment breathlessly scanning onrushing spider web for moment be minded to run then thought of ravine turned back ran aside once to dodge one drifting terror then be swiftly clambering down precipitous side out of touch of gale there under lee of dry torrent steeper bank might crouch watch strange grey mass pas pas in safety till wind fell became possible to escape there for long time crouched watching strange grey ragged mass trail streamer across narrowed sky once stray spider fell into ravine close beside full foot measured from leg to leg body be man hand after have watched monstrous alacrity of search escape for little while tempted to bite broken sword lifted up iron heeled boot smashed into pulp swore a did so for time sought up down for then presently when be surer spider swarm must not drop into ravine found place where must sit down sat fell into deep thought began after manner to gnaw knuckle bite nail from be moved by coming of man with white horse heard long before saw a clattering of hoof stumbling footstep reassuring voice then little man appeared rueful figure still with tail of white cobweb trailing behind approached other without speaking without salutation little man be fatigued shamed to pitch of hopeless bitterness came to stop at last face to face with seated master latter winced little under dependant eye well said at last with pretence of authority left horse bolted know so did mine laughed at master mirthlessly say horse bolted said man who once have silver studded bridle coward said little man other gnawed knuckle through meditative moment with eye on inferior call coward said at length be coward like coward possibly there be limit beyond man must fear that have learnt at last not like be where difference come in never must have dreamt must have left saved life two minute before why be lord master gnawed knuckle again countenance be dark man call coward said broken sword be better than none one spavined white horse can not be expected to carry two men four day journey hate white horse time can not be helped begin to understand perceive that be minded on strength of what have seen fancy to taint reputation be men of sort who unmake king besides never liked lord said little man said master no stood up sharply a little man moved for minute perhaps faced one overhead spider ball went driving there be quick movement among pebble running of foot cry of despair gasp blow towards wind fell sun set in calm serenity man who have once possessed silver bridle came at last very cautiously by easy slope out of ravine again now led white horse once belonged to little man must have gone back to horse to get silver mounted bridle again feared night quickening breeze might still find in valley besides disliked greatly to think might discover horse swathed in cobweb perhaps unpleasantly eaten a thought of cobweb of danger have be through manner in have be preserved that day hand sought little reliquary that hung about neck clasped for moment with heartfelt gratitude a did so eye went across valley be hot with passion said now have met reward also doubt behold far away out of wooded slope across valley in clearness of sunset distinct unmistakable saw little spire of smoke at expression of serene resignation changed to amazed anger smoke turned head of white horse about hesitated a did so little rustle of air went through grass about far away upon reed swayed tattered sheet of grey looked at cobweb looked at smoke perhaps after be not said at last knew better after have stared at smoke for time mounted white horse a rode picked way amidst stranded mass of web for reason there be many dead spider on ground lived feasted guiltily on fellow at sound of horse hoof fled time have passed from ground without wind to carry winding sheet ready thing for poison must do little evil flicked with belt at fancied came too near once where number ran together over bare place be minded to dismount trample with boot

more carefully coming down by way of mantel be really most extraordinary spectacle that great fat apoplectic looking man upside down trying to get from ceiling to floor prescription said too successful how loss of weight almost complete then of course understood by jove pyecraft said what wanted be cure for fatness always called weight must call weight somehow be extremely delighted quite liked pyecraft for time let help said took hand pulled down kicked about trying to get foothold somewhere be very like holding flag on windy day that table said pointing be solid mahogany very heavy

handy interfering sort of man with screw driver made sort of ingenious adaptation for ran wire to bring bell within reach turned electric light up instead of down so on whole affair be extremely curious interesting to be delightful to think of pyecraft like great fat blow fly crawling about on ceiling clambering round lintel of door from one room to never never never coming to club more then know fatal ingenuity got better of be sitting by fire drinking whisky be up in favourite corner by cornice tacking turkey carpet to ceiling when idea struck by jove pyecraft said be totally unnecessary before must calculate complete consequence of notion blurted out lead underclothing said mischief be done pyecraft received thing almost in tear to be right way up again said gave whole

day sir inquired leant forward over bill a spoke be mr skelmersdale said be sir said without looking up be true that have be in fairyland looked up at for moment with wrinkled brow with aggrieved exasperated face o shut said after moment of hostility eye to eye went on adding up bill four six half said after pause thank sir so unpropitiously acquaintance with mr skelmersdale began well got from to confidence through series of toilsome effort picked up again in village room where of night went to play billiards after supper mitigate extreme seclusion from kind be so helpful to work during day contrived to play with afterwards to talk with found one subject to avoid be fairyland on everything else be open amiable in commonplace sort of way on that have be worried be manifest taboo only once in room did hear slightest allusion to experience in presence be by cross grained farm hand who be losing to skelmersdale have run break into double figure by bignor standard be uncommonly good play steady on said adversary none of fairy fluke skelmersdale stared at for moment cue in hand then flung down walked out of room why ca leave 'im alone said respectable elder who

clapton hill tried to get out of threw over partly because refused partly because a said fairly gave 'ump then when time after let out to one carelessly that have be in fairyland wanted to go back when thing spread simple badinage of countryside came into play threw up situation abruptly came to bignor to get out of fuss a to what have happened in fairyland none of people knew there gathering in village room went to piece like pack at fault one said said that air in dealing with marvel be ostensibly critical sceptical must see considerable amount of belief showing through guarded qualification took line of intelligent interest tinged with reasonable doubt of whole story if fairyland inside aldington knoll said why dig out be what say said young ploughboy there be many have tried to dig on aldington knoll said respectable elder solemnly one time there be none a go about to day to tell what got by digging unanimity of vague belief surrounded be rather impressive felt there must surely be something at root of so much conviction already pretty keen curiosity felt about real fact of case be distinctly whetted if real fact be to be got from one be to be got from

assistant skelmersdale like too many of class be something of snob have told to shut only under sudden excessive provocation with be certain subsequent repentance be knew quite glad to be seen walking about village with in due course accepted proposal of pipe whisky in room readily enough there scenting by happy instinct that there be trouble of heart in knowing that confidence beget confidence plied with much of interest suggestion from real fictitious past be after third whisky of third visit of sort if remember rightly that propos of artless expansion of little affair have touched left in teen that did at last of own free will motion break ice be like with said over there at aldington be just that be so rum first did care bit be afterwards when be too late be in manner of speaking forbore to jump upon allusion so presently threw out in little while be making a plain a daylight that one thing wanted to talk about now be fairyland adventure have sat tight upon for so long see 'd done trick with from being just half incredulous must be facetious stranger have by wealth of shameless self exposure become possible confidant have be bitten by desire to show that too have lived felt many thing fever be upon be certainly confoundedly allusive at first eagerness to clear up with few precise question be only equalled controlled by anxiety not to get to sort of thing too soon in meeting so basis of confidence be complete from first to last think got most of item aspect indeed got quite number of time over almost everything that mr skelmersdale with very limited power of narration will ever be able to tell so come to story of adventure piece together again whether really happened whether imagined dreamt fell upon in strange hallucinatory trance profess to say that invented will not for one moment entertain man simply honestly belief thing happened a say happened be transparently incapable of lie so elaborate sustained in belief of simple yet often keenly penetrating rustic mind about find very strong confirmation of sincerity belief nobody can produce positive fact to falsify belief a for with much of endorsement transmit story be little old now to justify explain say went to sleep on aldington knoll about ten o'clock one night be quite possibly midsummer night though have never thought of date can not be sure within week so be fine night windless with rising moon have be at pain to visit knoll thrice since story grew up under persuasion once went there in twilight summer moonrise on what be perhaps similar night to of adventure jupiter be great splendid above moon in north northwest sky be green vividly bright over sunken sun knoll stand out bare bleak under sky surrounded at little distance by dark thicket a went up towards

troubled in earlier love affair a say not caring where went there sat down to think over so sulking grieving be overtaken by sleep so fell into fairy power quarrel have upset be trivial matter enough between girl at clapton hill to whom be engaged be farmer daughter said skelmersdale very respectable doubt excellent match for girl lover be very young with just mutual jealousy intolerantly keen edge of criticism that irrational hunger for beautiful perfection that life wisdom do presently most mercifully dull what precise matter of quarrel be have idea may have said liked men in gaiter when have gaiter on may have said liked better in different sort of hat however began got by series of clumsy stage to bitterness tear doubt got tearful smeary grew dusty drooping parted with invidious comparison grave doubt whether ever have really cared for clear certainty must never care again with sort of thing upon mind came out upon aldington knoll grieving presently after long interval perhaps quite inexplicably fell asleep woke to find on softer turf than ever have slept on before under shade of very dark tree completely hid sky always indeed in fairyland sky be hidden seems except for one night when fairy be dancing mr skelmersdale during time with never saw star of night be in doubt whether be in fairyland proper out where ring rush be in low meadow near railway line at smeeth be light under tree for on leaf amidst turf shone multitude of glow worm very bright fine mr skelmersdale first impression be that be small next that quite number of people still smaller be standing about for reason say be neither surprised frightened sat up quite deliberately rubbed sleep out of eye there about stood smiling elf who have caught sleeping under privilege have brought into fairyland what elf be like have failed to gather so vague imperfect be vocabulary so unobservant of minor detail doe seem to have be be clothed in something very light beautiful be wool silk leaf

sleeve gave little glimpse of arm throat think be little displayed because speaks of beauty of neck chin there be necklace of coral about white throat in breast coral coloured flower have soft line of little child in chin cheek throat eye be of kindled brown very soft straight sweet under level brow see by particular how greatly lady must have loomed in mr skelmersdale picture certain thing tried to express must not express way moved said several time fancy sort of demure joyousness radiated from lady be in company of delightful person a guest chosen companion of delightful person mr skelmersdale set out to be taken into intimacy of fairyland welcomed gladly little warmly suspect pressure of hand in of hers lit face to after ten year ago young skelmersdale may have be very comely youth once took arm once think led by hand adown glade that glow worm lit just how thing chanced happened there be telling from mr skelmersdale disarticulated skeleton of description give little unsatisfactory glimpse of strange corner doings of place where there be many fairy together of toadstool thing shone pink of fairy food of must only say must have tasted of fairy music like little musical box came out of nodding flower there be great open place where fairy rode raced on thing what mr skelmersdale meant by here thing rode there be telling larva perhaps cricket little beetle elude so abundantly there be place where water splashed gigantic king cup grew there in hotter time fairy bathed together there be game being played dancing much elvish love making too think among moss branch thicket there can be doubt that fairy lady made love to mr skelmersdale doubt that young man set to resist time came indeed when sat on bank beside in quiet secluded place smelling of vi'lets talked to of love when voice went low whispered said mr skelmersdale laid 'er 'and on 'and know came close with soft warm friendly way 'ad be a much a must do to keep 'ead seems kept head to certain limited unfortunate extent saw 'ow wind be blowing say so sitting there in place smelling of violet with touch of lovely fairy lady about mr skelmersdale broke to gently that be engaged have told loved dearly that be sweet human lad for whatever must ask of must have even heart desire mr skelmersdale who fancy tried hard to avoid looking at little lip a just dropped apart came together led up to more intimate question by saying must like enough capital to start little shop 'd just like to feel said have money enough to do imagine little surprise in brown eye talked about seemed sympathetic for asked many question about little shop laughing like time so got to complete statement of affianced position told about millie said everything said mr skelmersdale just who be where lived everything about sort of felt 'ad to time did 'whatever want will have ' said fairy lady 'that be a good a done will feel have money just a wish now know must kiss mr skelmersdale pretended not to hear latter part of remark said be very kind that really did deserve must be so kind fairy lady suddenly came quite close to whispered kiss said mr skelmersdale like fool did there be kiss kiss be told must have be quite other sort from millie resonant signal of regard there be something magic in kiss assuredly marked turning point at rate be one of passage that thought sufficiently important to describe most at length have tried to get right have tried to disentangle from hint gesture through came to have doubt that be different from telling far finer sweeter in soft filtered light subtly stirring silence of fairy glade fairy lady asked more about millie be very lovely so on great many time a to millie loveliness conceive answering that be right then on such occasion fairy lady told have fallen in love with a slept in moonlight so have be brought into fairyland have thought not knowing of millie that perhaps might chance to love now know ca said so must stop with just little while then must go back to millie told that know skelmersdale be already in love with pure inertia of mind kept in way be going imagine sitting in sort of stupefaction amidst glowing beautiful thing answering about millie little shop projected need of horse cart that absurd state of affair must have gone on for day day see little lady hovering about trying to amuse too dainty to understand complexity too tender to let go know hypnotised a be by earthly position went way with hither thither blind to everything in fairyland wonderful intimacy have come to be hard be impossible to give in print effect of radiant sweetness shining through jungle of poor skelmersdale rough broken sentence to at least shone clear amidst muddle of story like glow worm in tangle of weed there must have be many day of thing while be happening once say danced under moonlight in fairy ring stud meadow near smeeth at last came to end led into great cavernous place lit by red nightlight sort of thing where there be coffer piled on coffer cup golden box great heap of what certainly seemed to mr skelmersdale sens coined gold there be little gnome amidst wealth who saluted at coming stood aside suddenly turned on there with brightly shining eye now said have be kind to stay with so long be time let go must go back to millie must go back to millie here just a promised will give gold choked like said mr skelmersdale at have sort of feeling touched breastbone a though be fainting here felt pale know shivering even then 'ad thing to say paused yes said scene be beyond describing know that kissed good bye said nothing nothing said stood like stuffed calf just looked back once know stood smiling like cry must see shine of eye then be gone there be little fellow bustling about stuffing 'ands pocket back of collar everywhere with gold then be when fairy lady have vanished that mr skelmersdale really understood knew suddenly began plucking out gold be thrusting upon shouting out at to prevent giving more ' want yer gold ' said 'ave done yet be not going want to speak to fairy lady again ' started off to go after held back yes stuck little 'ands against middle shoved back kept giving more more gold until be running all down trouser leg dropping out of 'ands want yer gold ' say to ' want just to speak to fairy lady again did came to tussle before saw did see when got out

dancing in derision little gnome came out of cave after carrying gold in handful casting after shouting fairy love fairy gold fairy love fairy gold when heard word came great fear that be over lifted up voice called to by name suddenly set to run down slope from mouth of cavern through place of thorn brier calling after very loudly often elf danced about unheeded pinching pricking will o ' wisp circled round dashed into face gnome pursued shouting pelting with fairy gold a ran with strange rout about distracting suddenly be knee deep in swamp suddenly be amidst thick twisted root caught foot in one stumbled fell fell rolled over in instant found sprawling upon aldington knoll lonely under star sat up sharply at once say found be very stiff cold clothes be damp with dew first pallor of dawn chilly be coming up together must have believed whole thing strangely vivid dream until thrust hand into side pocket found stuffed with ash then knew for certain be fairy gold have given must feel pinch prick still though there be never bruise upon in manner so suddenly mr skelmersdale came out of fairyland back into world of men even then fancied thing be matter of night until returned to shop at aldington corner discovered amidst astonishment that have be away three week lor ' trouble said mr skelmersdale how explaining suppose have never have anything like to explain never said

gave opening of story have golfed until golfing be invisible have dined be in mood of tranquil kindliness when men will suffer story when clayton began to tell one naturally supposed be lying may be that indeed be lying of that reader will speedily be able to judge a well a began be true with air of matter of fact anecdote that thought be only incurable artifice of man say remarked after long consideration of upward rain of spark from log that sanderson have thumped know be alone here last night except for domestic said wish who sleep in other wing said clayton yes well pulled at cigar for

stabber affected talked to asked wish for space probably of hour chatty said joining party of sceptic poor devil be in trouble said clayton bowed over cigar end with very faintest note of reproof sobbing one asked clayton heaved realistic sigh at memory good lord said yes then poor fellow yes where did strike asked evans in best american accent never realised said clayton ignoring poor sort of thing ghost might be hung up again for time while sought for match in pocket lit warmed to cigar took advantage reflected at last be none of in hurry character said remains just same character for

that be alone that poor young sander be singing be in jimmy goggles except helmet 'easy say always 'there be mast after 'd have just one squint over gunwale caught up bogey almost tipped out a old sander brought boat round when window be screwed everything be right valve from air belt in order to help sinking jumped overboard foot foremost for have ladder left boat pitching of staring down into water after a head sank down into weed blackness that lay about mast suppose nobody not most cautious chap in world must have bothered about lookout at desolate place stunk of solitude of course must understand be greenhorn at diving none of be diver 'd have to muck about with thing to get way of be first time 'd be deep feel damnable ear hurt beastly know if have ever hurt yawning sneezing take like only ten time worse pain over eyebrow here splitting feeling like influenza in head be heaven in lung thing going down feel like beginning of lift only keep on ca turn head to see what be above ca get fair squint at what be happening to foot without bending down something painful being deep be dark let alone blackness of ash mud formed bottom be like going down out of dawn back into night so to speak mast came up like ghost out of black then lot of fish then lot of flapping red seaweed then whack came with kind of dull bang on deck of ocean pioneer fish have be feeding on dead rose about like swarm of fly from road stuff in summer time turned on compressed air again for suit be bit thick mackintoshery after in spite of rum stood recovering struck coolish down there that helped take off stuffiness bit when began to feel easier started looking about be extraordinary sight even light be extraordinary kind of reddy coloured twilight on account of streamer of seaweed floated up on side of ship far overhead just moony deep green blue deck of ship except for slight list to starboard be level lay dark long between weed clear except where mast have snapped when rolled vanishing into black night towards forecastle there be dead on deck most be in weed alongside suppose afterwards found two skeleton lying in passenger cabin where death have come to be curious to stand on deck recognise bit by bit place against rail where 'd be fond of smoking by starlight corner where old chap from sydney used to flirt with widow have aboard comfortable couple 'd be only month ago now must have got meal for baby crab off of have always have bit of philosophical turn dare say spent best part of five minute in such thought before went below to find where blessed dust be stored be slow work hunting feeling be for most part pitchy dark with confusing blue gleam down companion there be thing moving about dab at glass once once pinch at leg crab expect kicked lot of loose stuff puzzled stooped picked up something knob spike what do think backbone never have particular feeling for bone have talked affair over pretty thoroughly always knew just where stuff be stowed found that trip lifted box one end inch more broke off in story have lifted said a near a forty thousand pound worth of pure gold gold shouted inside helmet a kind of cheer hurt ear be getting confounded stuffy tired by time must have be down twenty five minute more thought be good enough went up companion again a eye came up flush with deck thundering great crab gave kind of hysterical jump went scuttling off sideways quite start gave stood up clear on deck shut valve behind helmet to let air accumulate to carry up again noticed kind of whacking from above a though be hitting water with oar did look up fancied be signalling to come up then something shot down by something heavy stood quiver in plank looked there be long knife 'd seen young sander handling think be dropped be still calling kind of fool that for might have hurt serious when began to lift drive up towards daylight just about level of top spar of ocean pioneer whack came against something sinking down boot knocked in front of helmet then something else struggling frightful be big weight atop of whatever be moving twisting about 'd have thought big octopus such thing if have be for boot octopus wear boot be in moment of course felt sinking down again threw arm about to keep steady whole lot rolled free of shot down a went up paused saw young sander face over naked black shoulder spear driven clean through neck out of mouth neck what looked like spirt of pink smoke in water down went clutching one turning over too far gone to leave go in second helmet came whack fit to split against nigger canoe be nigger two canoe full be lively time tell overboard came always with three spear in there be leg of three four black chap kicking about in water must see much saw game be up at glance gave valve tremendous twist went bubbling down again after poor always in a awful state of scare astonishment a can well imagine passed young sander nigger going up again struggling still bit in moment be standing in dim again on deck of ocean pioneer think 'here be fix nigger at first must see anything for stifle below stab above did properly understand how much air there be to last did feel like standing very much more of down below be hot frightfully heady quite apart from blue funk be in 'd never repined with beastly native filthy papuan beast be good coming up where be have to do something on spur of moment clambered over side of brig landed among weed set off through darkness a fast a must just stopped once knelt twisted back head in helmet have look up be most extraordinary bright green blue above two canoe boat floating there very small distant like kind of twisted h made feel sick to squint up at think what pitching swaying of three meant be just about most horrible ten minute ever have blundering about in darkness pressure something awful like being buried in sand pain across chest sick with funk breathing nothing a seemed smell of rum mackintosh gummy after bit found going up steepish sort of slope have squint to see if anything be visible of canoe boat then kept on stopped with head foot from surface tried to see where be going of course nothing be to be seen reflection of bottom then out dashed like knocking head through mirror directly got eye out of water saw 'd come up kind of beach near forest have look round native brig be hidden by big hummucky heap of twisted lava born fool in suggested run for wood did take helmet off eased open one of window after bit of pant went on out of water 'd hardly imagine how clean light air tasted of course with four inch of lead in boot sol head in copper knob size of football be thirty five minute under water break record running ran like ploughboy going to work way to tree saw dozen nigger more coming out in gaping astonished sort of way to meet just stopped dead cursed for fool out of london have about a much chance of cutting back to water a turned turtle just screwed up window again to leave hand free waited for there be anything else for to do did come on very much began to suspect why 'jimmy goggles say 'it beauty doe ' be inclined to be little light headed think with danger about change in pressure of blessed air be ye staring at ' said a if savage must hear 'what d 'ye take for be hanged if give something to stare at said with screwed up escape valve turned on compressed air from belt until be swelled out like blown frog regular imposing must have be be blessed if 'd come on step presently one then went down on hand knee did know what to make of be doing extra polite be very wise reasonable of have half mind to edge back seaward cut run seemed too hopeless step back 'd have be after out of sheer desperation began to march towards up beach with slow heavy step waving blown out arm about in dignified manner inside of be singing a small a tomtit there be nothing like striking appearance to help man over difficulty have found that before since people like ourselves who be up to diving dress by time be seven can scarcely imagine effect of one on simple minded savage one two of nigger cut run others started in great hurry trying to knock brain out on ground on went a slow solemn silly looking artful a jobbing plumber be evident took for something immense then up jumped one began pointing making extraordinary gesture to a did so others began sharing attention between something out at sea 'what be matter now said turned slowly on account of dignity there saw coming round point poor old pride of banya towed by couple of canoe sight fairly made sick evidently expected recognition so waved arm in striking sort of non committal manner then turned stalked on towards tree again at time be praying like mad remember over over again 'lord help through with lord help through with ' be only fool who know nothing of danger can afford to laugh at praying nigger be going to let walk through away like that started kind of bowing dance about sort of pressed to take pathway lay through tree be clear to did take for british citizen else thought of for own part be never le anxious to own up to old country 'd hardly believe perhaps unless be familiar with savage poor misguided ignorant creature took straight to kind of joss place to present to blessed old black stone there by time be beginning to sort of realise depth of ignorance directly set eye on deity took cue started baritone howl wow ' very long on one note began waving arm about lot then very slowly ceremoniously turned image over on side sat down on wanted to sit down badly for diving dress ai much wear in tropic to put different like be sight too much took away breath must see sitting on joss in le time than minute made up mind be hard at work worshipping can tell felt bit relieved to see thing turning out so well in spite of weight on shoulder foot what made anxious be what chap in canoe might think when came back if 'd seen in boat before went down without helmet on for might have be spying hiding since over night must very likely take different view from others be in deuce of stew about for hour a seemed until shindy of arrival began took down whole blessed village took down at cost of sitting up stiff stern a much like sitting egyptian image one see a must manage for pretty nearly twelve hour must guess at least on end got over 'd hardly think what meant in heat stink think of dreamt of man inside be just wonderful leathery great joss have come up with luck out of water fatigue heat beastly closeness mackintosheriness rum fuss lit stinking fire on kind of lava slab there be before brought in lot of gory muck worst part of what be feasting on outside beast burnt in honour be getting bit hungry understand now how god manage to do without eating what with smell of burnt offering about brought in lot of stuff 'd got off brig among other stuff what be bit relieved to see kind of pneumatic pump be used for compressed air affair then lot of chap girl came in danced about something disgraceful be extraordinary different way different people have of showing respect if 'd have hatchet handy 'd have gone for lot of made feel that wild time sat a stiff a company not knowing anything better to do at last when nightfall came wattle joss house place got bit too shadowy for taste here savage be afraid of dark know started sort of beoo noise built big bonfire outside left alone in peace in darkness of hut free to unscrew window bit think thing over feel just a bad a liked lord be sick be weak hungry mind kept on behaving like beetle on pin tremendous activity nothing done at end of come round just where be before there be sorrowing for other chap beastly drunkard certainly not deserving such fate young sander with spear through neck must go out of mind there be treasure down there in ocean pioneer how one might get hide somewhere safer get away come back for there be puzzle where to get anything to eat tell be fair rambling be afraid to ask by sign for food for fear of behaving too human so there sat hungered until very near dawn then village got bit quiet must stand longer went out got stuff like artichoke in bowl sour milk what be left of put away among other offering just to give hint of taste in morning came to worship found sitting up stiff respectable on previous god just a 'd left overnight 'd got back against central pillar of hut practically be asleep be how became god among heathen false god doubt blasphemous one ca always pick choose now want to crack up a god beyond merit must confess that while be god to people be extraordinary successful say there be anything in mind won battle with tribe got lot of offering did want through have wonderful fishing crop of pourra be exceptional fine counted capture of brig among benefit brought must say think be poor record for perfectly new hand though perhaps 'd scarcely credit be tribal god of beastly savage for pretty nearly four month what else must do man did wear that diving dress time made rig up sort of holy of holy deuce of time have too making understand what be wanted to do indeed be great difficulty making understand wish must let down by talking lingo badly even if 'd be able to speak at must go flapping lot of gesture at so drew picture in sand sat down beside hooted like one o'clock sometimes did thing wanted right sometimes did wrong be always very willing certainly while be puzzling how be to get confounded business settled night before dawn used to march out in full rig go off to place where must see channel in ocean pioneer lay sunk once even one moonlight night tried to walk out to weed rock dark clean beat did get back till full day then found silly nigger out on beach praying sea god to return to be that vexed tired messing tumbling about coming up going down again must have punched silly head round when started rejoicing be hanged if like so much ceremony then came missionary that missionary be in afternoon be sitting in state in outer temple place sitting on old black stone of theirs when came heard row outside jabbering then voice speaking to interpreter worship stock stone said knew what be up in flash have one of window out for comfort sang out straight away on spur of moment betocks stone say 'you come inside say 'and will punch blooming head ' there be kind of silence more jabbering in came bible in hand after manner of little sandy chap in speck pith helmet flatter that sitting there in shadow with copper head big goggles struck bit of heap at first 'well say 'how trade in calico ' for hold with missionary have lark with missionary be raw hand quite outclassed with man like gasped out who be told to read inscription at foot if wanted to know down go to read interpreter being of course a superstitious a of took a act of worship plumped down like shot people gave howl of triumph there be more business to be done in village after journey not by like of of course be fool to choke off like if 'd have sense must have told straight away of treasure taken into co have doubt 'd have come into co child with few hour to think over must have seen connection between diving dress loss of ocean pioneer week after left went out one morning saw motherhood salver ship from starr race towing up channel sounding whole blessed game be up trouble thrown away gummy how wild felt guying in stinking silly dress four month sunburnt man story degenerated again think of said when emerged to linguistic purity once more forty thousand pound worth of gold did little missionary come back asked oh yes bless pledged reputation there be man inside god started out to see a much with tremendous ceremony there be got sold again always did hate scene explanation long before came be out of going home to banya along coast hiding in bush by day thieving food from village by night only weapon spear clothes money nothing face be fortune a saying be just squeak of eight thousand pound of gold fifth share native cut up rusty thank goodness because thought be have driven luck away new accelerator certainly if ever man found guinea when be looking for pin be good friend professor gibberne have heard before of investigator overshooting mark never quite to extent that have done have really time at rate without touch of exaggeration in phrase found something to revolutionise human life that when be simply seeking round nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to stress of pushful day have tasted stuff now several time can not do better than describe effect thing have on that there be astonishing experience in store for in search of new sensation will become apparent enough professor gibberne a many people know be neighbour in folkestone unless memory play trick portrait at various age have already appeared in strand magazine think late in be unable to look up because have lent volume to one who have never sent back reader may perhaps recall high forehead singularly long black eyebrow give mephistophelian touch to face occupies one of pleasant little detached house in mixed style make western end of upper sandgate road so interesting be one with flemish gable moorish portico be in little room with mullioned bay window that work when be down here in of evening have so often smoked talked together be mighty jester besides like to talk to about work be one of men who find help stimulus in talking so have be able to follow conception of new accelerator right up from very early stage of course greater portion of experimental work be not done in folkestone in gower street in fine new laboratory next to hospital that have be first to use a one know at least a intelligent people know special department in gibberne have gained so great deserved reputation among physiologist be action of drug upon nervous system upon soporific sedative anaesthetic be be told unequalled be also chemist of considerable eminence suppose in subtle complex jungle of riddle centre about ganglion cell axis fibre there be little cleared place of making little glade of illumination that until see fit to publish result be still inaccessible to other living man in last few year have be particularly assiduous upon question of nervous stimulant already before discovery of new accelerator very successful with medical science have to thank for at least three distinct absolutely safe invigorator of unrivalled value to practising men in case of exhaustion preparation known a gibberne b syrup have suppose saved more life already than lifeboat round coast none of

stimulates round that wake up for time from crown of head to tip of great toe make go two even three to everybody else one eh be thing be after must tire man said not doubt of 'd eat double treble just think what thing must mean imagine with little phial like held up little bottle of green glass marked point with in precious phial be power to think twice a fast move twice a quickly do twice a much work in given time a must otherwise do be such thing possible believe so if be have wasted time for year various preparation of hypophosphites for example seem to show that something of sort even if be only one half time a fast must do must do said if be statesman in corner for example time rushing up against something urgent to be done eh must dose private secretary said gain double time think if for example wanted to finish book usually said wish 'd never begun doctor driven to death want to sit down think out case barrister man cramming for examination worth guinea drop said more to men like in duel again said gibberne where depends on quickness in pulling trigger in fencing echoed see said gibberne if get a round thing will really do harm at except perhaps to infinitesimal degree brings nearer old age will just have lived twice to other people once suppose meditated in duel must be fair be question for second said gibberne harked back further really think thing be possible said a possible said gibberne glanced at something went throbbing by window a motor bus a matter of fact paused smiled at deeply tapped slowly on edge of desk with green phial think know stuff already have got something coming nervous smile upon face betrayed gravity of revelation rarely talked of actual experimental work unless thing be very near end may be may be must be surprised may even do thing at greater rate than twice will be rather big thing hazarded will be think rather big thing think quite knew what big thing be to be for remember have several talk about stuff after that new accelerator called tone about grew more confident on occasion sometimes talked nervously of unexpected physiological result use might have then must get little unhappy at others be frankly mercenary debated long anxiously how preparation might be turned to commercial account be good thing said tremendous thing know be giving world something think only reasonable must expect world to pay dignity of science be very well think somehow must have monopoly of stuff for say ten year see why fun in life must go to dealer in ham own interest in coming drug certainly did not wane in time have always have queer little twist towards metaphysics in mind have always be given to paradox about space time seemed to that gibberne be really preparing le than absolute acceleration of life suppose man repeatedly dosed with preparation must live active record life indeed must be adult at eleven middle aged at twenty five by thirty well on road to senile decay seemed to that so far gibberne be only going to do for one who took drug exactly what nature have done for jew oriental who be men in teen aged by fifty quicker in thought act than be time marvel of drug have always be great to mind can madden man calm man make incredibly strong alert helpless log quicken passion allay that by mean of drug here be new miracle to be added to strange armoury of phial doctor use gibberne be far too eager upon technical point to enter very keenly into aspect of question be th th of august when told distillation must decide failure success for time be going forward a talked be on th that told thing be done new accelerator tangible reality in world met a be going up sandgate hill towards folkestone think be going to get hair cut came hurrying down to meet suppose be coming to house to tell at once of success remember that eye be unusually bright face flushed noted even then swift alacrity of step be done cried gripped hand speaking very fast be more than done come up to house see really really shouted incredibly come up see doe twice doe more much more scare come up see stuff taste try be most amazing stuff on earth gripped arm walking at pace that forced into trot went shouting with up hill whole char banc ful of people turned stared at in unison after manner of people in char banc be one of hot clear day folkestone see so much of colour incredibly bright outline hard there be breeze of course not so much breeze a sufficed under condition to keep cool dry panted for mercy be not walking fast be cried gibberne slackened pace to quick march have be taking of stuff puffed said at utmost drop of water stood in beaker from have washed out last trace of stuff took last night know be ancient history now go twice said nearing doorway in grateful perspiration go thousand time many thousand time cried gibberne with dramatic gesture flinging open early english carved oak gate phew said followed to door know how many time go said with latch key in hand throw sort of light on nervous physiology kick theory of vision into perfectly new shape heaven know how many thousand time will try after thing be to try stuff now try stuff said a went along passage rather said gibberne turning on in study there be in little green phial there unless happen to be afraid be careful man by nature only theoretically adventurous be afraid on other hand there be pride well haggled say have tried have tried said look hurt by do even look livery feel sat down give potion said if worst come to worst will save having hair cut think be one of most hateful duty of civilised man how do take mixture with water said gibberne whacking down carafe stood up in front of desk regarded in easy chair manner be suddenly affected by touch of harley street specialist be rum stuff know said made gesture with hand must warn in first place a soon a have got down to shut eye open very cautiously in minute so time one still see sense of vision be question of length of vibration not of multitude of impact there be kind of shock to retina nasty giddy confusion just at time if eye be open keep shut shut said good next thing be keep still begin to whack about may fetch something nasty rap if do remember will be going several thousand time faster than ever did before heart lung muscle brain everything will hit hard without knowing wo know know will feel just a do now only everything in world will seem to be going ever so many thousand time slower than ever went before be what make so deuced queer lor said mean will see said took up little measure glanced at material on desk glass said water here must take too much for first attempt little phial glucked out precious content forget what told said turning content of measure into glass in manner of italian waiter measuring whisky sit with eye tightly shut in absolute stillness for two minute said then will hear speak added inch so of water to little dose in glass by by said put glass down keep in hand rest hand on knee yes so now raised glass new accelerator said new accelerator answered touched glass drank instantly closed eye know that blank non existence into one drop when one have taken gas for indefinite interval be like then heard gibberne telling to wake up stirred opened eye there stood a have be standing glass still in hand be empty that be difference well said nothing out of way nothing slight feeling of exhilaration perhaps nothing more sound thing be still said by jove yes be still except sort of faint pat patter like rain falling on different thing what be analysed sound think said be not sure glanced at window have ever seen curtain before window fixed in way before followed eye there be end of curtain frozen a be corner high in act of flapping briskly in breeze said be odd here said opened hand held glass naturally winced expecting glass to smash so far from smashing did not even seem to stir in mid air motionless roughly speaking said gibberne object in latitude fall foot in first second glass be falling foot in second now only see have be falling yet for hundredth part of second give idea of pace of accelerator waved hand round round over under slowly sinking glass finally took by bottom pulled down placed very carefully on table eh said to laughed that seems right said began very gingerly to raise from chair felt perfectly well very light comfortable quite confident in mind be going fast over heart for example be beating thousand time second caused discomfort at looked out of window immovable cyclist head down with frozen puff of dust behind driving wheel scorched to overtake galloping char banc did not stir gaped in amazement at incredible spectacle gibberne cried how long will confounded stuff last heaven know answered last time took went to bed slept off tell be frightened must have lasted minute think seemed like hour after bit slows down rather suddenly believe be proud to observe did not feel frightened suppose because there be two of why must go out asked why not will see not goodness why will be going thousand time faster than quickest conjuring trick be ever done come along way will go window door out by window went assuredly of strange experience have ever have imagined read of other people having imagining little raid made with gibberne on folkestone lea under influence of new accelerator be strangest maddest of went out by gate into road there made minute examination of statuesque passing traffic top of wheel of leg of horse of char banc end of whip lash lower jaw of conductor who be just beginning to yawn be perceptibly in motion rest of lumbering conveyance seemed still quite noiseless except for faint rattling came from one man throat a part of frozen edifice there be driver know conductor eleven people effect a walked about thing began by being madly queer ended by being disagreeable there be people like ourselves yet not like ourselves frozen in careless attitude caught in mid gesture girl man smiled at one leering smile threatened to last for evermore woman in floppy capelline rested arm on rail stared at gibberne house with unwinking stare of eternity man stroked moustache like figure of wax stretched tiresome stiff hand with extended finger towards loosened hat stared at laughed at made face at then sort of disgust of came upon turned away walked round in front of cyclist towards lea goodness cried gibberne suddenly look there pointed there at tip of finger sliding down air with wing flapping slowly at speed of exceptionally languid snail be bee so came out upon lea there thing seemed madder than ever band be playing in upper stand though sound made for be low pitched wheezy rattle sort of prolonged last sigh that passed at time into sound like slow muffled ticking of monstrous clock frozen people stood erect strange silent self conscious looking dummy hung unstably in mid stride promenading upon grass passed close to little poodle dog suspended in act of leaping watched slow movement of leg a sank to earth lord look here cried gibberne halted for moment before magnificent person in white faint striped flannel white shoe panama hat who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed lady have passed wink studied with such leisurely deliberation a must afford be unattractive thing loses quality of alert gaiety one remark that winking eye doe not completely close that under drooping lid appears lower edge of eyeball little line of white heaven give memory said will never wink again smile said gibberne with eye on lady answering teeth be infernally hot somehow said let go slower oh come along said gibberne picked way among bath chair in path many of people sitting in chair seemed almost natural in passive pose contorted scarlet of bandsman be not restful thing to see purple faced little gentleman be frozen in midst of violent struggle to refold newspaper against wind there be many evidence that people in sluggish way be exposed to considerable breeze breeze have existence so far a sensation went came out walked little way from crowd turned regarded to see multitude changed to picture smitten rigid a be into semblance of realistic wax be impossibly wonderful be absurd of course filled with irrational exultant sense of superior advantage consider wonder of have said thought done since stuff have begun to work in vein have happened so far a people so far a world in general went in twinkling of eye new accelerator began gibberne interrupted there be that infernal old woman said what old woman life next door to said gibberne have lapdog yap god temptation be strong there be something very boyish impulsive about gibberne at time before must expostulate with have dashed forward snatched unfortunate animal out of visible existence be running violently with towards cliff of lea be most extraordinary little brute know did bark wriggle make slightest sign of vitality kept quite stiffly in attitude of somnolent repose gibberne held by neck be like running about with dog of wood gibberne cried put down then said something else if run like gibberne cried will set clothes on fire linen trouser be going brown a be clapped hand on thigh stood hesitating on verge gibberne cried coming up put down heat be too much be running so two three mile second friction of air what said glancing at dog friction of air shouted friction of air going too fast like meteorite thing too hot gibberne gibberne be over pricking sort of perspiration can see people stirring slightly believe stuff working off put that dog down eh said be working off repeated be too hot stuff working off be wet through stared at then at band wheezy rattle of whose performance be certainly going faster then with tremendous sweep of arm hurled dog away from went spinning upward still inanimate hung at last over grouped parasol of knot of chattering people gibberne be gripping elbow by jove cried believe be sort of hot pricking yes that man moving pocket handkerchief perceptibly must get out of sharp must not get out of sharply enough luckily perhaps for might have run if have run must believe have burst into flame almost certainly must have burst into flame know have of thought of before must even begin to run action of drug have ceased be business of minute fraction of second effect of new accelerator passed like drawing of curtain vanished in movement of hand heard gibberne voice in infinite alarm sit down said flop down upon turf at edge of lea sat scorching a sat there be patch of burnt grass there still where sat down whole stagnation seemed to wake up a did so disarticulated vibration of band rushed together into blast of music promenaders put foot down walked way paper flag began flapping smile passed into word winker finished wink went on way complacently seated people moved spoke whole world have come alive again be going a fast a be rather be going no faster than rest of world be like slowing down a one come into railway station everything seemed to spin round for second two have most transient feeling of nausea be little dog have seemed to hang for moment when force of gibberne arm be expended fell with swift acceleration clean through lady parasol be saving of unless be for one corpulent old gentleman in bath chair who certainly did start at sight of afterwards regarded at interval with darkly suspicious eye finally believe said something to nurse about doubt if solitary person remarked sudden appearance among plop must have appeared abruptly ceased to smoulder almost at once though turf beneath be uncomfortably hot attention of one including even amusement association band on occasion for only time in history got out of tune be arrested by amazing fact still more amazing yapping uproar caused by fact that respectable over fed lap dog sleeping quietly to east of bandstand must suddenly fall through parasol of lady on west in slightly singed condition due to extreme velocity of movement through air in absurd day too when be trying to be a psychic silly superstitious a possible people got up trod on other people chair be overturned lea policeman ran how matter settled know be much too anxious to disentangle from affair get out of range of eye of old gentleman in bath chair to make minute inquiry a soon a be sufficiently cool sufficiently recovered from giddiness nausea confusion of mind to do so stood up skirting crowd directed step back along road below metropole towards gibberne house amidst din heard very distinctly gentleman who have be sitting beside lady of ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threat language to one of chair attendant who have inspector written on cap if did throw dog said who did sudden return of movement familiar noise natural anxiety about clothe be still dreadfully hot front of thigh of gibberne white trouser be scorched drabbish brown prevented minute observation must have liked to make on thing indeed really made observation of scientific value on return bee of course have gone looked for cyclist be already out of sight a came into upper sandgate road hidden from by traffic char banc however with people now alive stirring be clattering along at spanking pace almost abreast of nearer church noted however that window sill on have stepped in getting out of house be slightly singed that impression of foot on gravel of path be unusually deep so be have first experience of new accelerator practically have be running about saying doing sort of thing in space of second so of time have lived hour while band have played perhaps two bar effect have upon be that whole world have stopped for convenient inspection considering thing particularly considering rashness in venturing out of house experience might certainly have be much more disagreeable than be showed doubt that gibberne have still much to learn before preparation be manageable convenience practicability certainly demonstrated beyond cavil since adventure have be steadily bringing use under control have several time without slightest bad result taken measured dos under direction though must confess have not yet ventured abroad again while under influence may mention for example that story have be written at one sitting without interruption except for nibbling of chocolate by mean began at watch be now very nearly at minute past half hour convenience of securing long uninterrupted spell of work in midst of day full of engagement can not be exaggerated gibberne be now working at quantitative handling of preparation with especial reference to distinctive effect upon different type of constitution then hope to find retarder with to dilute present rather excessive potency retarder will of course have reverse effect to accelerator used alone must enable patient to spread few second over many hour of ordinary time so to maintain apathetic inaction glacier like absence of alacrity amidst most animated irritating surroundings two thing together must necessarily work entire revolution in civilised existence be beginning of escape from time garment of carlyle speaks while accelerator will enable to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon moment occasion that demand utmost sense vigour retarder will enable to pas in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship tedium perhaps be little optimistic about retarder have indeed still to be discovered about accelerator there be possible sort of doubt appearance upon market in convenient controllable assimilable form be matter of next few month will be obtainable of chemist druggist in small green bottle at high considering extraordinary quality by mean excessive price gibberne nervous accelerator will be called hope to be able to supply in three strength one in one in one in distinguished by yellow pink white label respectively doubt use render great number of very extraordinary thing possible for of course most remarkable possibly even criminal proceeding may be effected with impunity by thus dodging a be into interstice of time like potent preparation will be liable to abuse have however discussed aspect of question very thoroughly have decided that be purely matter of medical jurisprudence altogether outside province will manufacture sell accelerator a for consequence will see mr ledbetter vacation friend mr ledbetter be round faced

that saw quite distinctly inside of house a well a street saw little people dining talking in private house men woman dining playing billiards drinking in restaurant hotel several place of entertainment crammed with people be like watching affair of glass hive such be mr bessel exact word a took down when told story quite forgetful of mr vincey remained for space observing thing

doing what be find hard to describe compare obstacle to sheet of glass felt a kitten may feel said when go for first time to pat reflection in mirror again again on occasion when heard tell story mr bessel returned to comparison of sheet of glass be not altogether precise comparison because a reader will speedily see there be interruption of generally impermeable resistance mean of getting through barrier to material world again naturally there be very great difficulty in expressing unprecedented impression in language of everyday experience thing impressed instantly weighed upon throughout experience be stillness of place be in world without sound at first mr bessel mental state be unemotional wonder thought chiefly concerned with where might be be out of body out of material

fear for perceived at first indistinctly then suddenly very clearly that be surrounded by face that roll coil of seeming cloud stuff be face such face face of thin shadow face of gaseous tenuity face like face glare with intolerable strangeness upon sleeper in evil hour of dream evil greedy eye be full of covetous curiosity face with knit brow snarling smiling lip vague hand clutched at mr bessel a passed rest of body be elusive streak of trailing darkness never word said never sound from mouth seemed to gibber about pressed in dreamy silence passing freely through dim mistiness be body gathering ever more numerously about shadowy mr bessel now suddenly fear stricken drove through silent active multitude of eye clutching hand so inhuman be face so malignant staring eye shadowy clawing gesture that did not occur to mr bessel to attempt intercourse with drifting creature idiot phantom seemed child of vain desire being unborn forbidden boon of being whose only expression gesture told of envy craving for life be one link with existence say much for resolution amidst swarming cloud of noiseless spirit of evil must still think of mr vincey made violent effort of will found knew not how stooping towards staple inn saw vincey sitting attentive alert in arm chair by fire clustering also about a clustered ever about life breathes be multitude of vain voiceless shadow longing desiring seeking loophole into life for space mr bessel sought ineffectually to attract friend attention tried to get in front of eye to move object in room to touch mr vincey remained unaffected ignorant of being be so close to own strange something mr bessel have compared to sheet of glass separated impermeably at last mr bessel did desperate thing have told how in strange way must see not only outside of man a see within extended shadowy hand thrust vague black finger a seemed through heedless brain then suddenly mr vincey started like man who recall attention from wandering thought seemed to mr bessel that little dark red body situated in middle of mr vincey brain swelled glowed a did so since experience have be shown anatomical figure of brain know now that be that useless structure a doctor call pineal eye for strange a will seem to many have deep in brain where can not possibly see earthly light eye at time with rest of internal anatomy of brain be quite new to at sight of changed appearance however thrust forth finger rather fearful still of consequence touched little spot instantly mr vincey started mr bessel knew that be seen at instant came to mr bessel that evil have happened to body behold great wind blew through world of shadow tore away so strong be persuasion that thought no more of mr vincey turned about forthwith countless face drove back with like leaf before gale returned too late in instant saw body that have left inert collapsed lying indeed like body of man just dead have arisen have arisen by virtue of strength will beyond

not tell where body have lost might be whether still raved about earth whether be closed forever in death against return that be spirit of dead believe doctor wilson paget think be rational soul of men who be lost in madness on earth at last mr bessel chanced upon place where little crowd of such disembodied silent creature be gathered thrusting through saw below brightly lit room four five

away voice writing of hand changed so that what said be disorderly confused for most part now fragment of one soul message now fragment of now babbled insane fancy of spirit of vain desire then mr bessel understood that spoke for spirit have touch of began to struggle very furiously towards be on outside of crowd at time must not reach at last growing anxious went away to find what have happened meanwhile to body for long time went to fro seeking in vain fearing that must have be killed then found at bottom of shaft in baker street writhing furiously cursing with pain leg arm two rib

for scar with countless window arch way tier upon tier for thousand foot vast carving of grey broken by vine clad terrace lemon orange grove mass of agave prickly pear puff of almond blossom out under archway be built over piccola marina other boat be coming a came round cape within sight of mainland little string of boat came into view driving before wind towards southwest in little while multitude have come out remoter just little speck of ultramarine in shadow of eastward cliff 'it be love reason ' said 'fleeing from madness of war though presently saw squadron of aeroplane flying across southern sky did not heed there be line of little dot in sky then more dotting southeastern horizon then still more until quarter of sky be stippled with blue speck now be thin little stroke of blue now one now multitude must heel catch sun become short flash of light came rising falling growing larger like huge flight of gull rook such like bird moving with marvellous uniformity ever a drew nearer spread over greater width of sky southward wing flung in arrow headed cloud athwart sun then suddenly swept round to eastward streamed eastward growing smaller smaller clearer clearer again until vanished from sky after noted to northward very high evesham fighting machine hanging high over naples like evening swarm of gnat seemed to have more to do with than flight of bird even mutter of gun far away in southeast seemed to to signify nothing day dream after be still exalted still seeking that refuge where might live love fatigue have come upon pain many distress for though be dusty stained by toilsome tramping half starved with horror of dead men have seen flight of peasant for very soon gust of fighting swept up peninsula with thing haunting mind still resulted only in deepening resolution to escape o be brave patient who have never faced hardship exposure have courage for herself went to fro seeking outlet over country commandeered ransacked by gathering host of

many of men be impressed kept away from thing have brought money to bribe passage north feared for lady at hand of conscript crowd have landed at salerno have be turned back from cava have tried to cross towards taranto by pas over mount alburno have be driven back for want of food so have come down among marsh by paestum where great temple stand alone have vague idea that by paestum might be possible to find boat something take once more to sea there be battle overtook sort of soul blindness have plainly must see that be being hemmed in great net of giant warfare have in toil many time have seen levy have come down from north going to fro have come upon in distance amidst mountain making way for ammunition preparing mounting of gun once fancied have fired at taking for spy at rate shot have gone shuddering over several time have hidden in wood from hovering aeroplane thing matter now night of flight pain be in open place near great temple at paestum at last on blank stony place dotted with spiky bush empty desolate so flat that grove of eucalyptus far away showed to foot of stem how can see lady be sitting down under bush resting little for be very weak weary be standing up watching to see if must tell distance of firing came went be still know fighting far from other with terrible new weapon have never before be used gun must carry beyond sight aeroplane must do what must do man must foretell knew that be between two army that drew together knew be in danger that must not stop there rest though thing be in mind be in background seemed to be affair beyond concern chiefly be thinking of lady aching distress filled for first time have owned beaten have fallen weeping behind must hear sobbing must not turn round to because knew have need of weeping have held so far so long for be well thought that must weep rest then must toil on again for have inkling of thing hung so near even now can see a sat there lovely hair upon shoulder can mark again deepening hollow of cheek 'if have parted ' said have let go ' 'no said 'even now repent will not repent made choice will hold on to end then overhead in sky something flashed burst about heard bullet making noise like handful of pea suddenly thrown chipped stone about whirled fragment from brick passed put hand to mouth then moistened lip at flash have turned about know stood up stood up know moved step towards a though wanted to reach have be shot through heart stopped stared at felt that foolish incapacity englishman feel on such occasion met eye for moment then stared out of window for long space kept silence when at last looked at be sitting back in corner arm folded teeth gnawing at knuckle bit nail suddenly stared at carried said towards temple in arm a though mattered know why seemed sort of sanctuary know have lasted so long suppose must have died almost instantly only talked to way silence again have seen temple said abruptly indeed have brought still sunlit arcade of worn sandstone very vividly before be brown one big brown one sat down on fallen pillar held in arm silent after first babble be over after little while lizard came out ran about again a though nothing unusual be going on a though nothing have changed be tremendously still there sun high shadow still even shadow of weed upon entablature be still in spite of thudding banging went about sky seem to remember that aeroplane came up out of south that battle went away to west one aeroplane be struck overset fell remember that though did interest in least did seem to signify be like wounded gull know flapping for time in water must see down aisle of temple black thing in bright blue water three four time shell burst about beach then ceased time happened lizard scuttled in hid for space be mischief done except once stray bullet gashed stone hard by made just fresh bright surface a shadow grew longer stillness seemed greater curious thing remarked with manner of man who make trivial conversation be did think did think at sat with in arm amidst stone in sort of lethargy stagnant remember waking up remember dressing day know found in office with letter slit open in front of how be struck by absurdity of being there seeing that in reality be sitting stunned in paestum temple with dead woman in arm read letter like machine have forgotten what be about stopped there be long silence suddenly perceived that be running down incline from chalk farm to euston started at passing of time turned on with brutal question with tone of now never did dream again yes seemed to force to finish voice be very low once more a be only for few instant seemed to have suddenly awakened out of great apathy to have risen into sitting position body lay there on stone beside gaunt body not know so soon be not may have heard voice know only knew clearly that men be coming into solitude that be last outrage stood up walked through temple then there came into sight first one man with yellow face dressed in uniform of dirty white trimmed with blue then several climbing to crest of old wall of vanished city crouching there be little bright figure in sunlight there hung weapon in hand peering cautiously before further away saw others then more at point in wall be long lax line of men in open order presently man have first seen stood up shouted command men came tumbling down wall into high weed towards temple scrambled down with led came facing towards when saw stopped at first have watched men with mere curiosity when have seen meant to come to temple be moved to forbid shouted to officer must not come here ' cried be here be here with dead stared then shouted question back to in unknown tongue repeated what have said shouted again folded arm stood still presently spoke to men came forward carried drawn sword signed to to keep away continued to advance told again very patiently clearly 'you must not come here be old temple be here with dead presently be so close must see face clearly be narrow face with dull grey eye black moustache have scar on upper lip be dirty unshaven kept shouting unintelligible thing question perhaps at know now that be afraid of at time did not occur to a tried to explain to interrupted in imperious tone bidding suppose stand aside made to go past caught hold of saw face change at grip fool ' cried know be dead ' started back looked at with cruel eye saw sort of exultant resolve leap into delight then suddenly with scowl swept sword back so thrust stopped abruptly became aware of change in rhythm of train brake lifted voice carriage jarred jerked present world insisted upon became clamorous saw through steamy window huge electric light glaring down from tall mast upon fog saw row of stationary empty carriage passing by then signal box hoisting constellation of green red into murky london twilight marched after looked again at drawn feature ran through heart be with sort of astonishment fear no pain just amazement that felt pierce felt sword drive home into body did hurt know did hurt at yellow platform light came into field of view passing first rapidly then slowly at last stopping with jerk dim shape of men passed to fro without euston cried voice do mean there be pain no sting smart amazement then darkness sweeping over everything hot brutal face before face of man who have killed seemed to recede swept out of existence euston clamoured voice outside euston carriage door opened admitting flood of sound porter stood regarding sound of door slamming hoof clatter of cab horse behind thing featureless remote roar of london cobble stone came to ear truckload of lighted lamp blazed along platform darkness flood of darkness opened spread blotted out thing luggage sir said porter be end asked seemed to hesitate then almost inaudibly answered mean must get to be there on other side of temple then yes insisted yes nightmare cried nightmare indeed god great bird fought tore
