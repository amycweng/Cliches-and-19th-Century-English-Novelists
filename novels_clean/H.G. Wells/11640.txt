quite impossible to put up hand investigate be near trembling with excitement pace act be usually automatic became uncertain difficult one might have thought have never passed human being before still nearer ten yard now nine eight must go past without looking up then eye met have hazel eye mr lewisham being amateur about eye must find word for looked demurely into face seemed to find nothing there glanced away from among tree passed nothing remained in front of empty avenue sunlit green shot void incident be over from far away soughing of breeze swept towards in moment twig about be quivering

found out looked at one for next move decided to plead in extenuation teddy frobisher be cousin know be very wrong seemed to have lot to do to be in such trouble have nothing to do in fact be who offered stopped looked at seemed to consider remark complete that meeting of eye have oddly disconcerting quality tried to keep to business of imposition ought not to have done that said encountering steadfastly looked down then into face again said suppose ought not to be very sorry looking down up again produced unreasonable effect seemed to lewisham that be discussing something quite other than topic of conversation persuasion patently absurd only to be accounted for by general disorder of faculty made serious attempt to keep footing of reproof must have detected writing know of course must be very wrong of to persuade did assure seemed in such trouble thought made break there be faint deepening of colour in cheek suddenly stupidly own adolescent cheek began to glow became necessary to banish sense of duplicate topic forthwith can assure said now very earnestly never give punishment never unless be merited make that rule er always make that rule be very careful indeed be really sorry interrupted with frank contrition be silly of lewisham felt unaccountably sorry must have to apologise spoke at once with idea of checking reddening of face think that said with sort of belated alacrity really be kind of know very kind of indeed know can quite understand er kindness ran away with now poor little teddy will get into worse trouble for letting oh said mr lewisham perceiving

awfully kind of said be nothing really explained nothing most people must know pause be all right said really must have given world for something more to say something witty original nothing came pause lengthened glanced over shoulder down vacant avenue interview momentous series of thing unsaid be coming to end looked at hesitatingly smiled again held out hand doubt be proper thing to do took searching void tumultuous mind in vain be awfully kind of said again a did so matter bit said mr lewisham sought vainly for other saying doorway remark into new topic hand be cool soft firm most

said surprised quite naturally may have why felt breathless pleasure like of sliding down slope of snow must like to have smiled raised eyebrow excitement be now too great for smiling look here said displayed sheet crumpled into ball laughed with touch of effort mind said mr lewisham laughing too captured paper by insistent gesture smoothed out with finger trembled mind said mind what if keep why must pause eye met again there be odd constraint about of palpitating interval of silence really must be going said suddenly breaking spell by effort turned about left with crumpled piece of paper in fist held book other hand lifting mortar board in dignified salute again watched receding figure heart be beating with remarkable rapidity how light how living seemed little round flake of sunlight raced down a went walked fast then slowly looking sideways once twice not back until reached park gate then looked towards remote friendly little figure made gesture of farewell disappeared face be

already easter face set in dark hair came with strange effect of mingled freshness familiarity looked at calmly felt very awkward be for cutting new acquaintance then hesitated raised hat with jerk a if to mr frobisher lady acknowledged salute may possibly have be little unexpected then young siddons dropped hymn book stooped to pick up lewisham almost fell over entered church in mood of black despair consolation of sort came soon enough a took seat distinctly glanced up at gallery afterwards a knelt to pray peeped between finger saw looking up again be certainly not laughing at in day much of lewisham mind be still unknown land to believed among other thing that be always same consistent intelligent human being whereas under certain stimulus became no longer reasonable disciplined purely imaginative emotional person music for instance carried away particularly effect of many voice in unison whirled off from almost state of mind to fine massive emotionality evening service at whortley church at evening service surplice be worn chanting singing vague brilliance of numerous candle flame multitudinous unanimity of congregation down there kneeling rising thunderously responding invariably inebriated inspired if will turned prose of life into poetry chance coming to aid of dame nature dropped just apt suggestion into now highly responsive ear second hymn be simple popular one dealing with theme of faith hope charity having verse ending with word love conceive long drawn out disarticulate faith will van ish in to sight hope be emp tied in deli ight love in heaven will shine more bri ight there fore give love at third repetition of refrain lewisham looked down across chancel met eye for brief instant stopped singing abruptly then consciousness of serried rank of face below there came with almost overwhelming force upon dared not look at again felt blood rushing to face love greatest of greatest of thing better than fame better than knowledge so came great discovery like flood across mind pouring over with cadence of hymn sending tide of pink in sympathy across forehead rest of service be phantasmagorial background to great reality phantasmagorial background little inclined to stare mr lewisham be in love men be so preoccupied that found whole congregation subsiding into seat still standing rapt sat down spasmodically with impact seemed to to re echo through church a came out of porch into thickening night seemed to see everywhere fancied have gone on in front hurried up boy in hope of overtaking pushed through throng of dim people going homeward must raise hat to again be susie hopbrow in light coloured dress raven in dove plumage felt curious mixture of relief disappointment must see more that night hurried from school to lodging

to stile in sight of frobisher house selected only lit window a hers behind blind mr frobisher thirty eight be busy with curl paper used paper because be better for hair discussing certain neighbour in fragmentary way with mr frobisher who be in bed presently moved candle to examine faint discolouration of complexion that rendered uneasy outside mr lewisham eighteen stood watching orange oblong

returned from school to lodging circuitously through avenue so back to avenue for thirty minute so before afternoon school when mr lewisham be not looking over top of book during period of open air study then commonly be glancing over shoulder at last who must see saw out of corner of eye turned away at once pretending not to have seen whole being be suddenly irradiated with emotion hand holding book gripped very tightly did not glance back again walked slowly steadfastly reading ode that must not have translated to save life listening acutely for approach after interminable time a seemed came faint footfall swish of skirt behind felt a though head be directed forward by clutch of iron mr lewisham said close to turned with quality of movement be almost convulsive raised cap clumsily took extended hand by afterthought held until withdrew be so glad to have met said so be said lewisham simply stood facing one for expressive moment then by movement indicated intention to walk along avenue with wanted so much said looking down at foot to thank for letting teddy off know be why wanted to see lewisham took first step beside be odd be said looking up into face must meet here in just
