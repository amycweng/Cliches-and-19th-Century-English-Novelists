of ill conceived book one doe not settle down very readily at two forty to new way of living have found with teeming interest of life have abandoned still buzzing like swarm of homeless bee in head mind have be full of confused protest justification in case must have found difficulty enough in expressing complex thing have to tell have added greatly to trouble have great analogue that certain niccolo machiavelli chanced to fall out of politics at very much age have reached wrote book to engage restlessness of mind very much a have wanted to do wrote about relation of great constructive spirit in politics to individual character weakness so far achievement lie like deep rut in road of intention have taken far astray be matter of many week now diversified indeed by long drive into mountain behind memorable sail to genoa across blue purple water drowned shelley since began laboured futile imitation of prince sat up late last night with jumbled accumulation at last made little fire of olive twig burnt sheet by sheet to begin again clear morning incidentally have re read most of machiavelli not excepting scandalous letter of to vettori seems to now have released altogether from literary precedent that still have use for in spite of vast prestige claim kindred with set name upon title page in partial intimation of matter of story take with sympathy not only by reason of dream pursued humanity of politics by mixture of nature vice come in essential to issue be dead gone immediate correlation to party faction have faded to insignificance leaving only on one hand broad method conception upon other intimate living personality exposed down to salacious corner a soul of contemporary can ever be exposed of double strand be have to write of subtle protesting perplexing play of instinctive passion desire against too abstract dream of statesmanship thing seemed to lie very far apart in machiavelli time have come near to one be simple story of white passion struggling against red have to tell state making dream be very old dream indeed in world history play too small part in novel plato confucius be highest of great host of mind have have kindred aspiration have dreamt of world of men better ordered happier finer securer imagined city grown more powerful people made rich multitudinous by effort thought in term of harbour shining navy great road engineered marvellously jungle cleared desert conquered ending of muddle disease dirt misery ending of confusion waste human possibility thought of thing with passion desire a other men think of soft line tender beauty of woman thousand of men there be to day almost mastered by white passion of statecraft in nearly one who read think must find suspect sort of answering response in one present extraordinarily entangled mixed up with other more intimate thing be so with machiavelli picture at san casciano a lived in retirement upon property after fall of republic perhaps with twinge of torture punished conspiracy still lurking in limb such twinge must not stop dreaming then be prince be written day went about personal affair saw homely neighbour dealt with family gave vent to everyday passion must sit in shop of donato del corno gossiping curiously among vicious company pace lonely wood of estate book in hand full of bitter meditation in evening returned home went to study at entrance say pulled off peasant clothes covered with dust dirt of immediate life washed put on noble court dress closed door on world of toiling getting private loving private hating personal regret sat down with sigh of contentment to wider dream like to think of so with brown book before lit by light of candle in silver candlestick heading new chapter of prince with grey quill in clean fine hand so writing becomes symbol for le none because of animal queer indecent side because of such lapse into utter meanness a made sound note of begging letter writer even in dedication reminding magnificence very urgently a if be gist of matter of continued malignity of fortune in affair flaw complete be reason for preferring a symbol to plato of whose indelicate side know nothing whose correspondence with dionysius of syracuse have perished to confucius who travelled china in search of prince might instruct with lapse indignity now lost in mist of age have achieved apotheosis of individual forgetfulness plato have added glory of acquired beauty that bust of indian bacchus be now indissolubly mingled with tradition have passed into world of ideal humbug take freedom with name machiavelli more recent le popular be still human earthly fallen brother at same time nobly dressed nobly dreaming writer at desk that vision of strengthened perfected state be protagonist in story a re read prince thought out manner of now abandoned project came to perceive how stir whirl of human thought one call by way of embodiment french revolution have altered absolutely approach to question machiavelli like plato pythagoras confucius two hundred odd decade before saw only one method by thinking man not powerful might do work of state building be by seizing imagination of prince directly men turned thought towards realisation attitude became what will call secretarial machiavelli be true have little doubt about particular prince wanted whether be caesar borgia of giuliano lorenzo prince have to be before saw clearly difference of own time searched mind for modern equivalent of prince at various time redrafted parallel dedication to prince of wale to emperor william to mr

intimation of human splendour justly organised state may yet attain glimpse for bewildering instant height may be scaled splendid enterprise made possible appeal go out now in other form in book catch at thousand of reader for eye of prince diffused be old appeal indeed for unification of human effort ending of confusion instead of machiavellian deference to flattered lord man cry out of heart to unseen fellowship about last written dedication of burnt last night be to single man to socially constructive passion in man there be moreover second great difference in kind between world machiavelli be discovering woman be a if have come across vast interval since time into very chamber of statesman in machiavelli outlook interest of womanhood be in region of life almost infinitely remote from statecraft be vehicle of child only imperial rome new world of to day have ever have inkling of significance might give in state did work thought a ploughed earth bear crop apart from function of fertility gave humorous twist to life stimulated worthy men to toil wasted hour of prince left thought of woman outside with other dusty thing when went into study to write dismissed from mind modern

be real independent of individual be common habit of so called educated people who have metaphysical aptitude metaphysical training lead to progressive misunderstanding of world be favourite trick of altiora to speak of everybody a type saw men a sample moving dining room became chamber of representative gave tremendously scientific air to many of generalisation using scientific in nineteenth

then suddenly isabel found ourselves passionately in love change came so entirely without warning intention that find impossible now to tell order of phase what disturbed pebble started avalanche can not trace perhaps be simply that barrier between masked aspect of life have be wearing down unperceived there came change in isabel be like change in cycle of nature like onset of spring sharp brightness uneasiness became restless with work little encounter with men began to happen encounter not quite in quality of earlier proposal then came odd incident of told somehow felt did tell completely told be able to tell have be at dance at roper man rather well known in london have kissed thing amazed beyond measure be sort of thing immediately possible between man woman one never expects to happen until happens have surprising effect of judge generally known to be bald suddenly whipping off wig in court absolutely unexpected revelation must have quite same quality of shock

remember made profession of passionate love for one talked a though fact of intense love for other have always be patent between there be so long frank intimacy between that talked far more like brother sister husband wife than two people engaged in war of sex wanted to know what be going to do whatever did meant to do in most perfect concert felt extraordinary accession of friendship tenderness then what again be curious very little passion there be also in spite of perplexity faced immense satisfaction about day be a if have taken off something have hindered view of other like people who unvizored to talk more easily at masked ball have have since to view relation from standpoint of ordinary observer find vision in most preposterous contrast with really went on between

hesitate draw back with vague instinctive terror of immensity of opposition challenge isabel be timid people weighed what be against decided just exactly a score of thousand of people have decided in very matter that if be possible to keep thing to ourselves there be nothing against so took first step with hunger of love in be easy to conclude might be lover still keep everything to ourselves

rather lamely sat listening why did turn back without going to denver wanted to come back be restless restlessness said thought be restless in venice said be restlessness took to america again studied turned little awkwardly to tea thing poured needle water from silver kettle into teapot then sat still for moment looking at equipage with expressionless eye saw hand upon edge of table tremble slightly watched closely vague uneasiness possessed what might not know guess spoke at last with effort wish be in parliament again said life doe give event enough if be in parliament again must be on conservative side know said be still more thoughtful lately began paused lately have be reading did help out with what have to say waited did understand what be after have misjudged did know think perhaps be rather stupid eye be suddenly shining with tear did give much chance to understand turned upon suddenly with voice full of tear husband said abruptly holding two hand out to want to begin over again took hand perplexed beyond measure dear said want to begin over again bowed head to hide face found hand in mine kissed ah said slowly withdrew hand leant forward with arm on sofa back

tension tell plainly what mean by sat little away from then took teacup in hand with odd effect of defending have be reading that old book of mine asked that paper took complete set from beginning down to durham with have read over thought over did understand what be teaching there be little pause seems so plain to now said so true be profoundly disconcerted put down teacup stood up in middle of hearthrug began talking be tremendously glad margaret that have come to see be not altogether perverse began launched out into rather trite windy exposition of view sat close to on sofa looking up into face hanging on word deliberate invincible convert yes said yes have never doubted new conception before now doubted profoundly went on talking be grim irony in life of politician writer public

have brought back with mentioned in talk walked in with put down on table turned to go husband cried held out slender arm to be compelled to go to kiss twined softly about neck drew to kissed disentangled very gently took wrist kissed back of hand good night said there came little pause good night margaret repeated walked very deliberately with kind of sham preoccupation to door did not look at must feel standing watching if have looked up must knew have held out arm to at very outset that secret be to touch one isabel have reached out to stab human being whole world have changed for isabel tried to pretend that nothing have changed except small matter between believed quite honestly at time that be possible to keep thing have happened from reaction at save perhaps through magically enhanced vigour in work upon world about seen in retrospect one can realise absurdity of belief within week realised that doe not alter fact that did believe a much that people who be deeply in love unable to marry will continue to believe so to very end of time will continue to believe out of existence consideration separate until have come together then will count cost a two have to do be telling story not propounding theory in book chiefly be telling of idea influence emotion have happened to a sort of sounding board for world moralist be at liberty to go over conduct with measure say at point at that went wrong ought to have done so so point of interest to statesman be that did for moment occur to to do so so when time for doing came amazes now to think how little of troubled about established right wrong of situation have atom of respect for innate acquired guardian of public moral will say be very bad people submit in defence that be very bad guardian provocative guardian when at last there came claim against have effective validity for be in full tide of passionate intimacy have night of nearly sleepless perplexity after margaret return have suddenly presented to like something dramatically recalled fine generous infinitely capable of feeling be amazed how much have forgotten in contempt for vulgarised conventionalised honour have forgotten that for there be such reality a honour here be warm near to living breathing unsuspecting margaret pride be honour have have no right even to imperil now remember if thought at time of going to isabel putting new aspect of case before perhaps did perhaps may have considered even then possibility of ending what have so freshly passionately begun if did vanished next day at sight of regret came in darkness daylight brought obstinate confidence in resolution again must declared pull thing off margaret must not know margaret must not know if margaret did not know then harm must be done tried to sustain that for brief time have be like two people in magic cell magically cut off from world full of light of own then began to realise that be not in least cut off that world be about pressing in upon limiting threatening resuming possession of tried to ignore injury to margaret of unreciprocated advance tried to maintain to myself that hidden love made difference to now irreparable breach between husband wife never spoke of to isabel let see that aspect of case how must time for have gone then in new shape relation came trouble distressful element crept in by reason of unavoidable furtiveness ignored hid from other attempted to hide from successful love be thing of abounding pride have to be secret be delightful at first to be secret whispering warm conspiracy then presently became irksome little shameful essential frankness of soul be against mask falsehood that many woman must have enjoyed together in secrecy relaxed then in presence of other people again be tiresome to have to watch for careless too easy phrase to snatch back one hand from limitless betrayal of light familiar touch love becomes poor thing at best poor beautiful thing if develops continuing habitual intimacy be always meeting most gloriously loving beginning then have to snatch at remorseless ticking watch hurry to catch train go back to that be very well for intrigue of idle people perhaps not for intense personal relationship be like lighting candle for sake of lighting over over again time blowing out that doubt must be very amusing to child playing with match not to people who love warm light want in order to do fine honourable thing together have achieved give ugly phrase express increasing discolouration in mind illicit intercourse to end at now perceived be in style where be to end perhaps might at stage have given up think if must have seen ahead around might have done so glow of cell blinded wonder what might have happened if at time have given up propounded met again in secret to discus overpowering passion for one reduced that meeting to absurdity presently idea of child crept between came in from conception of life public service be found in quality of mind physical love without child be little weak timorous more than little shameful with imaginative people there very speedily come time when realisation be inevitable have thought of before be natural to

recall even curious exaltation of grief that made mental atmosphere distinctive memorable have seen so much of one have become so intimate that talked of parting even a parted with sense of incredible remoteness went together up over cliff to place where fall towards sea past white quaint lanterned lighthouse of south foreland there in kind of niche below crest sat talking be spacious day serenely blue warm on wrinkled water remotely below black tender six hooded submarine came presently engaged in mysterious manoeuvers shrieking gull chattering jackdaw circled over below dived swooped skerry of weedy fallen chalk appeared gradually disappeared again a tide fell rose talked thought that afternoon on aspect of relation seems to now talked so wide far that scarcely issue in life between man woman can arise that did not at least touch upon lying there at isabel foot have become for symbol of world wide problem between duty conscious passionate love world have still to solve because be solved there be wrong in way sky wide horizon seemed to lift out of ourselves until be something representative general be womanhood become articulate talking to lover ought said never to have loved be thing planned said ought never to have let talk slip to never to have turned back from america be glad did said think repent looked at will never repent said never a though clung to life in saying remember talked for long time of divorce seemed to then seems to still that ought to have be possible for margaret to divorce for to marry without scandalous ugly publicity taint ostracism follow readjustment went on to whole perplexing riddle of marriage criticised current code how muddled conventionalised have become how modified by subterfuge concealment new necessity increasing freedom of woman be like bromstead when building came said for have often talked to of early impression of purpose dissolving again into chaotic force there be clear right in world more world be byzantine justest man to day must practise tainted goodness question need discussion magnificent frankness of discussion if standard be again to establish effective hold upon educated people discretion a have said already will never hold one worth holding longer than held against shalt not there must be why not plainly put why not largest plainest law deduced from purpose isabel said have always be little disregardful of duty partly at least because idea of duty come to so ill clad oh know there be extravagant insubordinate strain in be wish humbug must leave duty alone wish duty be covered with slime be where real mischief come in passion can always contrive to clothe in beauty strip splendid carried for mean association there be duty come rather late to not so late that wo be atrociously hard to do be queer to think of now said isabel who must believe did have done honestly well in manner honestly who must believe thought might be hidden who must trace step by step from time when found that certain boldness in talk be pleasing talked of love master there be not much for to do in way of apologia that one will credit yet if be possible to tell very heart of story doe margaret really want to go on with asked shield knowing of be certain understand just a understand shoesmith doe people walk on solid ground be just thin air to have got something have got assurance wonder then be later talked of shoesmith what life might be with be good said be kindly be everything magic be very image of decent sober honourable life ca say thing against except that something something in imagination something in tone of voice fails for why love be better man than why be better man than be usage be honour be right thing be breed tradition gentleman be erring incalculable self suppose woman will trust sort love sort to very end of time lay side by side nibbled at grass stalk a talked seemed enormously unreasonable to that two people who have come to pitch of easy confident affection happiness held between must be obliged to part shun one murder substance of life felt crushed beaten by indiscriminating machine destroys happiness in service of jealousy mass of people feel thing in quite same manner a feel said be because be different in grain educated out of primitive instinct be because have explored love little know more than gateway said lust then jealousy simple conception have gone past wandered hand in hand remember that for time watched two of larger sort of gull whose wing be brownish white circle hover against blue then lay looked at band of water mirror clear far out to sea wondered why breeze rippled rest must leave so serene in state of ours resumed eh said isabel rolling over into sitting posture looking out at horizon let talk more of thing can never see talk to of work be doing will do after have parted have said too little of have have red life be over thank heaven though stole talk about work dear thing will go on doing just a though be still together will still be together in sense through thing have in common so talked of politics outlook be interested to pitch of self forgetfulness weighed person force discussed probability of next general election steady drift of public opinion in north west away from liberalism towards be very manifest that in spite of wardenham expurgator must come into new government strongly party have one else young men be formally informally with esmeer must have office lord tarvrille very probably there must be something for shoesmith for own part said count on backing on liberal side for last two year have be forcing competition in constructive legislation between party liberal have not be long in following up endowment of motherhood lead will have to give vote lip service anyhow reader of blue weekly say be liberal remember talking about thing of sort with old willersley said ever so many year ago be place near locarno looked down lake shone weltering just a now look over sea then dreamt in indistinct featureless way of that be doing now said isabel laughed well of such thing said remained for awhile silent thinking of locarno recalled once more largeness release from small personal thing have felt in youth statecraft became real wonderful again with memory gigantic handling of gigantic problem began to talk out thought sitting up beside a must never talk of to one isabel began to recover again purpose that lay under political ambition adjustment anticipation saw state splendid wide a have seen in first travel of mine now be mere distant prospect of spire pinnacle populous with fine trained

preparation for circumstance betrayed be partly shoesmith unwisdom in delaying marriage until after end of session partly own amazing folly in returning within four day to westminster be of intent upon defeat of scandal complete restoration of appearance seemed necessary that shoesmith marriage must not seem to be hurried still more necessary must not vanish inexplicably have to be visible with margaret in london just a much a possible went to restaurant visited theatre must even contemplate possibility of presence at wedding for however have schemed weekend visit to wale fictitious sprained ankle at last moment must justify absence can not convey to intolerable wretchedness rebellion of separation from isabel seemed that in past two year thought have spun commisures to isabel brain must

never felt before in life have little sleep in daytime did hundred thing even spoke in house on two occasion by own low standard spoke well seemed to that be going about in own brain like hushed

asserted first a penetrating emphatic smell of burning rubber be caused by fusing of electric wire reek forced way into discussion of pekin massacre that have sprung up between evesham waulsort others at end of table something burning said man next to something must be burning said panmure tarvrille hated undignified interruption have particularly imperturbable butler with cadaverous sad face eye

manservant with heavier clean shaved face indistinctly seen in dimness behind then be coloured emotionally for by aching sense of loss sacrifice by chance trend of talk to breach unreality of civilised scheme seemed little transitory circle of light in universe of darkness violence effect to diminishing smell of burning rubber trampling of foot overhead swish of water added enormously everybody unless perhaps be evesham drank rather carelessly because of suppressed excitement of situation talked louder more freely what flimsy thing civilisation be said evesham mere thin net of
