coin into pocket be struck by contrast of mr marvel appearance with suggestion of opulence thence mind wandered back again to topic have taken curiously firm hold of imagination book said suddenly noisily finishing with toothpick mr marvel started looked at oh yes said yes theyre book there extra ordinary thing in book said mariner believe said mr marvel extra ordinary thing out of em said mariner true likewise said mr marvel eyed interlocutor then glanced about there extra ordinary thing in newspaper for example said mariner there be in newspaper said mariner ah said mr marvel there story said mariner fixing mr marvel with eye be firm deliberate there story about invisible man for instance mr marvel pulled mouth askew scratched cheek felt ear glowing what will be writing next asked faintly ostria america said mariner here lord said mr marvel starting when say here said mariner to mr marvel intense relief dont of course mean here in place mean hereabouts invisible man said mr marvel whats be up to everything said mariner controlling marvel with eye then amplifying everyblessedthing aint seen paper four day said marvel ipings place started at said mariner in deed said mr marvel started there where came from nobody dont seem to know here be pe culiar story from iping say in paper that evidence be extra ordinary strongextra ordinary lord said mr marvel then extra ordinary story there be clergyman medical gent witnessessaw im right properor leastways didnt see im be staying say at coach horse one dont seem to have be aware of misfortune say aware of misfortune until in altercation in inn say bandage on head be torn off be then ob served that head be invisible attempt be at once made to secure casting off garment say succeeded in escaping not until after desperate struggle in have inflicted serious injury say on worthy able constable mr j jaffers pretty straight story eh name everything lord said mr marvel looking nervously about trying to count money in pocket by unaided sense of touch full of strange novel idea sound most astonishing dont extra ordinary call never heard tell of invisible men before havent nowadays one hears such lot of extra ordinary thingsthat did asked marvel trying to seem at ease enough aint said mariner didnt go back by chance asked marvel just escaped thats eh said mariner whyaint enough quite enough said marvel must think be enough said mariner must think be enough didnt have palsit dont say have pal doe asked mr marvel anxious aint one of sort enough for asked mariner thank heaven a one might say didnt nodded head slowly make regular uncomfortable bare thought of chap running about country be at present at large from certain evidence be supposed that hastakentook suppose meanthe road to port stowe see be right in none of american wonder time just think of thing might do whered be if took drop over above have fancy to go for suppose want to robwho can prevent can trespass can burgle must walk through cordon of policeman a easy a must give slip to blind man easier for here blind chap hear uncommon sharp im told wherever there be liquor fancied he got tremenjous advantage certainly said mr marvel andwell youre right said mariner have time mr marvel have be glancing about intently listening for faint footfall trying to detect imperceptible movement seemed on point of great resolution coughed behind hand looked about again listened bent towards mariner lowered voice fact of isi happento know just thing two about invisible man from private source oh said mariner interested yes said mr marvel indeed said mariner may ask youll be astonished said mr marvel behind hand tremenjous indeed said mariner fact be began mr marvel eagerly in confidential undertone suddenly expression changed marvellously ow said rose stiffly in seat face be eloquent of physical suffering wow said whats up said mariner concerned toothache said mr marvel put hand to ear caught hold of book must be getting on think said edged in curious way along seat away from interlocutor be just going to tell about here invisible man protested mariner mr marvel seemed to consult with hoax said voice hoax said mr marvel in paper said mariner hoax same said marvel know chap started lie there aint invisible man whatsoeverblimey how bout paper dyou mean to say not word of said marvel stoutly mariner stared paper in hand mr marvel jerkily faced about wait bit said mariner rising speaking slowly dyou mean to say do said mr marvel then why did let go on tell blarsted stuff then what dyer mean by letting man make fool of like for eh mr marvel blew out cheek mariner be suddenly very red indeed clenched hand be talking here ten minute said little pot bellied leathery faced son of old boot couldnt have elementary manner dont come bandying word with said mr marvel bandying word im jolly good mind come up said voice mr marvel be suddenly whirled about started marching off in curious spasmodic manner youd better move on said mariner who moving on said mr marvel be receding obliquely with curious hurrying gait with occasional violent jerk forward way along road began muttered monologue protest recrimination silly devil said mariner leg wide apart elbow akimbo watching receding figure ill show silly asshoaxing hereon paper mr marvel retorted incoherently receding be hidden by bend in road mariner still stood magnificent in midst of way until approach of butcher cart dislodged then turned towards port stowe full of extra ordinary ass said softly to just to take down bitthat be silly gameits on paper there be extraordinary thing be presently to hear that have happened quite close to be vision of fist full of money le travelling without visible agency along by wall at corner of st michael lane brother mariner have seen wonderful sight very morning have snatched at money forthwith have be knocked headlong when have got to foot butterfly money have vanished mariner be in mood to believe anything declared be bit too stiff afterwards however began to think thing over story of flying money be true about neighbourhood even from august london country banking company from till of shop innsdoors standing that sunny weather entirely openmoney have be quietly dexterously making off day in handful rouleau floating quietly along by wall shady place dodging quickly from approaching eye of men have though man have traced invariably ended mysterious flight in pocket of agitated gentleman in obsolete silk hat sitting outside little inn on outskirt of port stowe be ten day afterand indeed only when burdock story be already oldthat mariner collated fact began to understand how near have be to wonderful invisible man chapter xv man who be running in early evening time dr kemp be sitting in study in belvedere on hill overlooking burdock be pleasant little room with three windowsnorth west southand bookshelf covered with book scientific publication broad writing table under north window microscope glass slip minute instrument culture scattered bottle of reagent dr kemps solar lamp be lit albeit sky be still bright with sunset light blind be up because there be offence of peering outsider to require pulled down dr kemp be tall slender young man with flaxen hair moustache almost white work be upon must earn hoped fellowship of royal society so highly did think of eye presently wandering from work caught sunset blazing at back of hill be over against own for minute perhaps sat pen in mouth admiring rich golden colour above crest then attention be attracted by little figure of man inky black running over hill brow towards be shortish little man wore high hat be running so fast that leg verily twinkled of fool said dr kemp like as who ran into morning round corner with visible man coming sir cant imagine what posse people one might think be in thirteenth century got up went to window stared at dusky hillside dark little figure tearing down seems in confounded hurry said dr kemp doesnt seem to be getting on if pocket be full of lead couldnt run heavier spurted sir said dr kemp in moment higher of villa have clambered up hill from burdock have occulted running figure be visible again for moment again then again three time between three detached house came next then terrace hid ass said dr kemp swinging round on heel walking back to writing table who saw fugitive nearer perceived abject terror on perspiring face being in open roadway did not share in doctor contempt by man pounded a ran chinked like well filled purse be tossed to fro looked to right left dilated eye stared straight downhill to where lamp be being lit people be crowded in street ill shaped mouth fell apart glairy foam lay on lip breath came hoarse noisy passed stopped began staring up road down interrogating one with inkling of discomfort for reason of haste then presently far up hill dog playing in road yelped ran under gate a still wondered somethinga winda pad pad pada sound like panting breathing rushed by people screamed people sprang off pavement passed in shout passed by instinct down hill be shouting in street before marvel be halfway there be bolting into house slamming door behind with news heard made one last desperate spurt fear came striding by rushed ahead of in moment have seized town invisible man be coming invisible man chapter xvi in jolly cricketer jolly cricketer be just at bottom of hill where tram line begin barman leant fat red arm on counter talked of horse with anaemic cabman while black bearded man in grey snapped up biscuit cheese drank burton conversed in american with policeman off duty whats shouting about said anaemic cabman going off at tangent trying to see up hill over dirty yellow blind in low window of inn somebody ran by outside fire perhaps said barman footstep approached running heavily door be pushed open violently marvel weeping dishevelled hat gone neck of coat torn open rushed in made convulsive turn attempted to shut door be held half open by strap coming bawled voice shrieking with terror he coming visible man after for gawds sake elp elp elp shut door said policeman who coming whats row went to door released strap slammed american closed other door lem go inside said marvel staggering weeping still clutching book lem go inside lock insomewhere tell he after give slip said hed kill will youre safe said man with black beard door shut whats about lem go inside said marvel shrieked aloud a blow suddenly made fastened door shiver be followed by hurried rapping shouting outside hullo cried policeman who there mr marvel began to make frantic dive at panel looked like door hell kill mehes got knife something for gawds sake here be said barman come in here held up flap of bar mr marvel rushed behind bar a summons outside be repeated dont open door screamed please dont open door where will hide invisible man then asked man with black beard with one hand behind guess about time saw window of inn be suddenly smashed in there be screaming running to fro in street policeman have be standing on settee staring out craning to see who be at door got down with raised eyebrow that said barman stood in front of bar parlour door be now locked on mr marvel stared at smashed window came round to two other men everything be suddenly quiet wish have truncheon said policeman going irresolutely to door once open in come there stopping dont be in too much hurry about door said anaemic cabman anxiously draw bolt said man with black beard if come showed revolver in hand wont do said policeman thats murder know what country im in said man with beard im going to let off at leg draw bolt not with blinking thing going off behind said barman craning over blind very well said man with black beard stooping down revolver ready drew barman cabman policeman faced about come in said bearded man in undertone standing back facing unbolted door with pistol behind one came in door remained closed five minute afterwards when second cabman pushed head in cautiously be still waiting anxious face peered out of bar parlour supplied information be door of house shut asked marvel he going roundprowling round he a artful a devil good lord said burly barman there back just watch door say looked about helplessly bar parlour door slammed heard key turn there yard door private door yard door rushed out of bar in minute reappeared with carving knife in hand yard door be open said fat underlip dropped may be in house now said first cabman he not in kitchen said barman there two woman there ive stabbed inch of with little beef slicer dont think he come in havent noticed have fastened asked first cabman im out of frock said barman man with beard replaced revolver even a did so flap of bar be shut down bolt clicked then with tremendous thud catch of door snapped bar parlour door burst open heard marvel squeal like caught leveret forthwith be clambering over bar to rescue bearded man revolver cracked looking glass at back of parlour starred came smashing tinkling down a barman entered room saw marvel curiously crumpled up struggling against door led to yard kitchen door flew open while barman hesitated marvel be dragged into kitchen there be scream clatter of pan marvel head down lugging back obstinately be forced to kitchen door bolt be drawn then policeman who have be trying to pas barman rushed in followed by one of cabman gripped wrist of invisible hand collared marvel be hit in face went reeling back door opened marvel made frantic effort to obtain lodgment behind then cabman collared something got said cabman barman red hand came clawing at unseen here be said barman mr marvel released suddenly dropped to ground made attempt to crawl behind leg of fighting men struggle blundered round edge of door voice of invisible man be heard for first time yelling out sharply a policeman trod on foot then cried out passionately fist flew round like flail cabman suddenly whooped doubled up kicked under diaphragm door into bar parlour from kitchen slammed covered mr marvel retreat men in kitchen found clutching at struggling with empty air wheres gone cried man with beard out way said policeman stepping into yard stopping piece of tile whizzed by head smashed among crockery on kitchen table ill show shouted man with black beard suddenly steel barrel shone over policeman shoulder five bullet have followed one into twilight whence missile have come a fired man with beard moved hand in horizontal curve so that shot radiated out into narrow yard like spoke from wheel silence followed five cartridge said man with black beard thats best of four ace joker get lantern someone come feel about for body chapter xvii dr kemps visitor dr kemp have continued writing in study until shot aroused crack crack crack came one after other hullo said dr kemp putting pen into mouth again listening who letting off revolver in burdock be ass at now went to south window threw up leaning out stared down on network of window beaded gas lamp shop with black interstice of roof yard made up town at night look like crowd down hill said by cricketer remained watching thence eye wandered over town to far away where ship light shone pier gloweda little illuminated facetted pavilion like gem of yellow light moon in first quarter hung over westward hill star be clear almost tropically bright after five minute during mind have travelled into remote speculation of social condition of future lost at last over time dimension dr kemp roused with sigh pulled down window again returned to writing desk must have be about hour after that front door bell rang have be writing slackly with interval of abstraction since shot sat listening heard servant answer door waited for foot on staircase did not come wonder what be said dr kemp tried to resume work failed got up went downstairs from study to landing rang called over balustrade to housemaid a appeared in hall below be that letter asked only runaway ring sir answered im restless to night said to went back to study time attacked work resolutely in little while be hard at work again only sound in room be ticking of clock subdued shrillness of quill hurrying in very centre of circle of light lampshade threw on table be two oclock before dr kemp have finished work for night rose yawned went downstairs to bed have already removed coat vest when noticed that be thirsty took candle went down to dining room in search of syphon whiskey dr kemps scientific pursuit have made very observant man a recrossed hall noticed dark spot on linoleum near mat at foot of stair went on upstairs then suddenly occurred to to ask what spot on linoleum might be apparently subconscious element be at work at rate turned with burden went back to hall put down syphon whiskey bending down touched spot without great surprise found have stickiness colour of drying blood took up burden again returned upstairs looking about trying to account for blood spot on landing saw something stopped astonished door handle of own room be blood stained looked at own hand be quite clean then remembered that door of room have be open when came down from study consequently have not touched handle at went straight into room face quite calmperhaps trifle more resolute than usual glance wandering inquisitively fell on bed on counterpane be mess of blood sheet have be torn have not noticed before because have walked straight to dressing table on further side bedclothes be depressed a if someone have be recently sitting there then have odd impression that have heard low voice say good heavenskemp dr kemp be believer in voice stood staring at tumbled sheet be that really voice looked about again noticed nothing further than disordered blood stained bed then distinctly heard movement across room near wash hand stand men however highly educated retain superstitious inkling feeling be called eerie came upon closed door of room came forward to dressing table put down burden suddenly with start perceived coiled blood stained bandage of linen rag hanging in mid air between wash hand stand stared at in amazement be empty bandage bandage properly tied quite empty must have advanced to grasp touch arrested voice speaking quite close to kemp said voice eh said kemp with mouth open keep nerve said voice im invisible man kemp made answer for space simply stared at bandage invisible man said be invisible man repeated voice story have be active to ridicule only that morning rushed through kemps brain doe not appear to have be very much frightened very greatly surprised at moment realisation came later thought be lie said thought uppermost in mind be reiterated argument of morning have bandage on asked yes said invisible man oh said kemp then roused say said be nonsense trick stepped forward suddenly hand extended towards bandage met invisible finger recoiled at touch colour changed keep steady kemp for god sake want help badly stop hand gripped arm struck at kemp cried voice kemp keep steady grip tightened frantic desire to free took possession of kemp hand of bandaged arm gripped shoulder be suddenly tripped flung backwards upon bed opened mouth to shout corner of sheet be thrust between teeth invisible man have down grimly arm be free struck tried to kick savagely listen to reason will said invisible man sticking to in spite of pounding in rib by heaven youll madden in minute lie still fool bawled invisible man in kemps ear kemp struggled for moment then lay still if shout ill smash face said invisible man relieving mouth im invisible man foolishness magic really be invisible man want help dont want to hurt if behave like frantic rustic must dont remember kemp griffin of university college let get up said kemp ill stop where be let sit quiet for minute sat up felt neck be griffin of university college have made invisible be just ordinary mana man have knownmade invisible griffin said kemp griffin answered voice younger student than be almost albino six foot high broad with pink white face red eye who won medal for chemistry be confused said kemp brain be rioting what have to do with griffin be griffin kemp thought horrible said what devilry must happen to make man invisible devilry process sane intelligible enough horrible said kemp how on earth horrible enough im wounded in pain tired great god kemp be man take steady give food drink let sit down here kemp stared at bandage a moved across room then saw basket chair dragged across floor come to rest near bed creaked seat be depressed quarter of inch so rubbed eye felt neck again beat ghost said laughed stupidly thats better thank heaven youre getting sensible silly said kemp knuckled eye give whiskey im near dead didnt feel so where be if get up will run into there right whiskey here where will give to chair creaked kemp felt glass drawn away from let go by effort instinct be against came to rest poised twenty inch above front edge of seat of chair stared at in infinite perplexity isthis must behypnotism have suggested be invisible nonsense said voice frantic listen to demonstrated conclusively morning began kemp that invisibility never mind what demonstratedim starving said voice night be chilly to man without clothes food said tumbler of whiskey tilted yes said invisible man rapping down have dressing gown kemp made exclamation in undertone walked to wardrobe produced robe of dingy scarlet do asked be taken from hung limp for moment in mid air fluttered weirdly stood full decorous buttoning sat down in chair drawer sock slipper must be comfort said unseen curtly food anything be insanest thing ever be in in life turned out drawer for article then went downstairs to ransack larder came back with cold cutlet bread pulled up light table placed before guest never mind knife said visitor cutlet hung in mid air with sound of gnawing invisible said kemp sat down on bedroom chair always like to get something about before eat said invisible man with full mouth eating greedily queer fancy suppose that wrist be right said kemp trust said invisible man of strange wonderful exactly odd must blunder into house to get bandaging first stroke of luck anyhow meant to sleep in house to night must stand that filthy nuisance blood showing isnt quite clot over there get visible a coagulates see only living tissue ive changed only for a long a im alive ive be in house three hour hows done began kemp in tone of exasperation confound whole businessits unreasonable from beginning to end quite reasonable said invisible man perfectly reasonable reached over secured whiskey bottle kemp stared at devouring dressing gown ray of candle light penetrating torn patch in right shoulder made triangle of light under left rib be shot asked how did shooting begin there be real fool of mana sort of confederate of minecurse himwho tried to steal money have done so be invisible too no well cant have more to eat before tell im hungryin pain want to tell story kemp got up didnt do shooting asked not said visitor fool id never seen fired at random lot of got scared got scared at curse themi sayi want more to eat than kemp ill see what there be to eat downstairs said kemp not much im afraid after have done eating made heavy meal invisible man demanded cigar bit end savagely before kemp must find knife cursed when outer leaf loosened be strange to see smoking mouth throat pharynx naris became visible a sort of whirling smoke cast blessed gift of smoking said puffed vigorously im lucky to have fallen upon kemp must help fancy tumbling on just now im in devilish scrapeive be mad think thing have be through will do thing yet let tell helped to more whiskey soda kemp got up looked about fetched glass from spare room wildbut suppose may drink havent changed much kemp dozen year fair men dont cool methodicalafter first collapse must tell will work together how be done said kemp how did get like for god sake let smoke in peace for little while then will begin to tell story be not told that night invisible man wrist be growing painful be feverish exhausted mind came round to brood upon chase down hill struggle about inn spoke in fragment of marvel smoked faster voice grew angry kemp tried to gather what must be afraid of must see that be afraid of said invisible man many time over meant to give sliphe be always casting about what fool be cur must have killed where did get money asked kemp abruptly invisible man be silent for space cant tell to night said groaned suddenly leant forward supporting invisible head on invisible hand kemp said ive have sleep for near three day except couple of doze of hour so must sleep soon well have roomhave room how can sleep if sleephe will get away ugh what doe matter whats shot wound asked kemp abruptly nothingscratch blood oh god how want sleep why not invisible man appeared to be regarding kemp because ive particular objection to being caught by fellow men said slowly kemp started fool that be said invisible man striking table smartly ive put idea into head chapter xviii invisible man sleep exhausted wounded a invisible man be refused to accept kemps word that freedom must be respected examined two window of bedroom drew up blind opened sash to confirm kemps statement that retreat by must be possible outside night be very quiet still new moon be setting over down then examined key of bedroom two dressing room door to satisfy that also must be made assurance of freedom finally expressed satisfied stood on hearth rug kemp heard sound of yawn im sorry said invisible man if can not tell have done to night be worn out grotesque doubt horrible believe kemp in spite of argument of morning be quite possible thing have made discovery meant to keep to myself cant must have partner can do such thing to morrow now kemp feel a though must sleep perish kemp stood in middle of room staring at headless garment suppose must leave said itsincredible three thing happening like overturning preconceptionswould make insane real be there anything more can get only bid good night said griffin good night said kemp shook invisible hand walked sideways to door suddenly dressing gown walked quickly towards understand said dressing gown attempt to hamper capture kemps face changed little thought gave word said kemp closed door softly behind key be turned upon forthwith then a stood with expression of passive amazement on face rapid foot came to door of dressing room that too be locked kemp slapped brow with hand be dreaming have world gone mador have laughed put hand to locked door barred out of own bedroom by flagrant absurdity said walked to head of staircase turned stared at locked door fact said put finger to slightly bruised neck undeniable fact shook head hopelessly turned went downstairs lit dining room lamp got out cigar began pacing room ejaculating now then must argue with invisible said be there such thing a invisible animal in sea yes thousandsmillions larva little nauplii tornarias microscopic thing jelly fish in sea there be more thing invisible than visible never thought of before in pond too little pond life thingsspecks of colourless translucent jelly in air no cant be after allwhy not if man be made of glass must still be visible meditation became profound bulk of three cigar have passed into invisible diffused a white ash over carpet before spoke again then be merely exclamation turned aside walked out of room went into little consulting room lit gas there be little room because dr kemp did not live by practice in be day newspaper morning paper lay carelessly opened thrown aside caught up turned over read account of strange story from iping that mariner at port stowe have spelt over so painfully to mr marvel kemp read swiftly wrapped up said kemp disguised hiding one seems to have be aware of misfortune what devil be game dropped paper eye went seeking ah said caught up st james gazette lying folded up a arrived now will get at truth said dr kemp rent paper open couple of column confronted entire village in sussex go mad be heading good heaven said kemp reading eagerly incredulous account of event in iping of previous afternoon have already be described over leaf report in morning paper have be reprinted re read ran through street striking right left jaffers insensible mr huxter in great painstill unable to describe what saw painful humiliationvicar woman ill with terror window smashed extraordinary story probably fabrication too good not to printcum grano dropped paper stared blankly in front of probably fabrication caught up paper again re read whole business when doe tramp come in why deuce be chasing tramp sat down abruptly on surgical bench he not only invisible said he mad homicidal when dawn came to mingle pallor with lamp light cigar smoke of dining room kemp be still pacing up down trying to grasp incredible be altogether too excited to sleep servant descending sleepily discovered be inclined to think that over study have worked ill on gave extraordinary quite explicit instruction to lay breakfast for two in belvedere studyand then to confine to basement ground floor then continued to pace dining room until morning paper came that have much to say little to tell beyond confirmation of evening before very badly written account of remarkable tale from port burdock gave kemp essence of happening at jolly cricketer name of marvel have made keep with twenty four hour marvel testified certain minor fact be added to iping story notably cutting of village telegraph wire there be nothing to throw light on connexion between invisible man tramp for mr marvel have supplied information about three book money with be lined incredulous tone have vanished shoal of reporter inquirer be already at work elaborating matter kemp read scrap of report sent housemaid out to get one of morning paper must also devoured be invisible said read like rage growing to mania thing may do thing may do he upstairs free a air what on earth ought to do for instance must be breach of faith if went to little untidy desk in corner began note tore up half written wrote read over considered then took envelope addressed to colonel adye port burdock invisible man awoke even a kemp be doing awoke in evil temper kemp alert for sound heard pattering foot rush suddenly across bedroom overhead then chair be flung over wash hand stand tumbler smashed kemp hurried upstairs rapped eagerly chapter xix certain first principle whats matter asked kemp when invisible man admitted nothing be answer confound smash fit of temper said invisible man forgot arm sore youre rather liable to sort of thing be kemp walked across room picked up fragment of broken glass fact be out about said kemp standing up with glass in hand happened in iping down hill world have become aware of invisible citizen one know be here invisible man swore secret out gather be secret dont know what plan be of course im anxious to help invisible man sat down on bed there breakfast upstairs said kemp speaking a easily a possible be delighted to find strange guest rose willingly kemp led way up narrow staircase to belvedere before can do anything else said kemp must understand little more about invisibility of yours have sat down after one nervous glance out of window with air of man who have talking to do doubt of sanity of entire business flashed vanished again a looked across to where griffin sat at breakfast tablea headless handle dressing gown wiping unseen lip on miraculously held serviette simple enoughand credible enough said griffin putting serviette aside leaning invisible head on invisible hand doubt to kemp laughed well yes to seemed wonderful at first doubt now great god will do great thing yet came on stuff first at chesilstowe chesilstowe went there after left london know dropped medicine took up physic well did light fascinated ah optical density whole subject be network of riddlesa network with solution glimmering elusively through being two twenty full of enthusiasm said will devote life to be worth while know what fool be at two twenty fool then fool now said kemp a though knowing must be satisfaction to man went to worklike slave have hardly worked thought about matter six month before light came through one of mesh suddenlyblindingly found general principle of pigment refractiona formula geometrical expression involving four dimension fool common men even common mathematician know anything of what general expression may mean to student of molecular physic in booksthe book that tramp have hiddenthere be marvel miracle be not method be idea might lead to method by must be possible without changing other property of matterexcept in instance coloursto lower refractive index of substance solid liquid to of airso far a practical purpose be concerned phew said kemp thats odd still dont see quite can understand thereby must spoil valuable stone personal invisibility be far cry precisely said griffin consider visibility depends on action of visible body on light body absorbs light reflects refracts doe thing if reflects refracts absorbs light can not of be visible see opaque red box for instance because colour absorbs of light reflects rest red part of light to if did not absorb particular part of light reflected then must be shining white box silver diamond box must neither absorb much of light reflect much from general surface just here there where surface be favourable light must be reflected refracted so that must get brilliant appearance of flashing reflection translucenciesa sort of skeleton of light glass box must not be so brilliant so clearly visible a diamond box because there must be le refraction reflection see that from certain point of view must see quite clearly through kind of glass must be more visible than others box of flint glass must be brighter than box of ordinary window glass box of very thin common glass must be hard to see in bad light because must absorb hardly light refract reflect very little if put sheet of common white glass in water still more if put in denser liquid than water must vanish almost altogether because light passing from water to glass be only slightly refracted reflected indeed affected in way be almost a invisible a jet of coal gas hydrogen be in air for precisely same reason yes said kemp be pretty plain sailing here be fact will know to be true if sheet of glass be smashed kemp beaten into powder becomes much more visible while be in air becomes at last opaque white powder be because powdering multiplies surface of glass at refraction reflection occur in sheet of glass there be only two surface in powder light be reflected refracted by grain pass through very little get right through powder if white powdered glass be put into water forthwith vanishes powdered glass water have much same refractive index be light undergoes very little refraction reflection in passing from one to other make glass invisible by putting into liquid of nearly same refractive index transparent thing becomes invisible if be put in medium of almost same refractive index if will consider only second will see also that powder of glass might be made to vanish in air if refractive index must be made same a of air for then there must be refraction reflection a light passed from glass to air yes yes said kemp man not powdered glass said griffin he more transparent nonsense that from doctor how one forgets have already forgotten physic in ten year just think of thing be transparent seem not to be so paper for instance be made up of transparent fibre be white opaque only for same reason that powder of glass be white opaque oil white paper fill up interstice between particle with oil so that there be longer refraction reflection except at surface becomes a transparent a glass not only paper cotton fibre linen fibre wool fibre woody fibre bone kemp flesh kemp hair kemp nail nerve kemp in fact whole fabric of man except red of blood black pigment of hair be made up of transparent colourless tissue so little suffices to make visible one to other for most part fibre of living creature be more opaque than water great heaven cried kemp of course of course be thinking only last night of sea larva jelly fish now have knew have in mind year after left londonsix year ago kept to myself have to do work under frightful disadvantage oliver professor be scientific bounder journalist by instinct thief of ideashe be always prying know knavish system of scientific world simply must not publish let share credit went on working got nearer nearer making formula into experiment reality told living soul because meant to flash work upon world with crushing effect become famous at blow took up question of pigment to fill up certain gap suddenly not by design by accident made discovery in physiology yes know red colouring matter of blood can be made whitecolourlessand remain with function have now kemp gave cry of incredulous amazement invisible man rose began pacing little study may well exclaim remember night be late at daytime one be bothered with gaping silly studentsand worked then sometimes till dawn came suddenly splendid complete in mind be alone laboratory be still with tall light burning brightly silently in great moment have be alone one must make animala tissuetransparent one must make invisible except pigmentsi must be invisible said suddenly realising what meant to be albino with such knowledge be overwhelming left filtering be doing went stared out of great window at star must be invisible repeated to do thing must be to transcend magic beheld unclouded by doubt magnificent vision of invisibility might mean to manthe mystery power freedom drawback saw none have only to think shabby poverty struck hemmed in demonstrator teaching fool in provincial college might suddenly becomethis ask kemp if anyone tell must have flung upon research worked three year mountain of difficulty toiled over showed from summit infinite detail exasperation professor provincial professor always prying when be going to publish work of yours be everlasting question student cramped mean three year have of after three year of secrecy exasperation found that to complete be impossibleimpossible how asked kemp money said invisible man went again to stare out of window turned around abruptly robbed old manrobbed father money be not shot chapter xx at house in great portland street for moment kemp sat in silence staring at back of headless figure at window then started struck by thought rose took invisible man arm turned away from outlook be tired said while sit walk about have chair placed between griffin nearest window for space griffin sat silent then resumed abruptly have left chesilstowe cottage already said when happened be last december have taken room in london large unfurnished room in big ill managed lodging house in slum near great portland street room be soon full of appliance have bought with money work be going on steadily successfully drawing near end be like man emerging from thicket suddenly coming on unmeaning tragedy went to bury mind be still on

snivelling cold remember walking back to empty house through place have once be village be now patched tinkered by jerry builder into ugly likeness of town way road ran out at last into desecrated field ended in rubble heap rank wet weed remember a gaunt black figure going along slippery shiny pavement strange sense of detachment felt from squalid respectability sordid commercialism of place

from world into desolate place appreciated loss of sympathy put down to general inanity of thing re entering room seemed like recovery of reality there be thing knew loved there stood apparatus experiment arranged waiting now there be scarcely difficulty left beyond planning of detail will tell kemp sooner later complicated process need not go into now for most part saving certain gap chose to remember be written in cypher in book tramp have hidden must hunt down must get book again essential phase be to place transparent object whose refractive index be to be lowered between two

of human perception one know where went what did one can imagine hurrying through hot june forenoon up hill on to open downland behind port burdock raging despairing at intolerable fate sheltering at last heated weary amid thicket of hintondean to piece together again shattered scheme against specie seems most probable refuge for for there be re asserted in grimly tragical manner about two in afternoon one wonder what state of mind may have be during time what plan devised doubt be almost ecstatically exasperated by kemps treachery though may be able to understand motif led to deceit may still imagine even sympathise little with fury attempted surprise must have occasioned perhaps something of stunned astonishment of oxford street experience may have returned to for have evidently counted on kemps co operation in brutal dream of terrorised world at rate vanished from human ken about midday living witness can tell what did until about half past two be fortunate thing perhaps for humanity for be fatal inaction during time growing multitude of men scattered over countryside be busy in morning have still be simply legend terror in afternoon by virtue chiefly of kemps drily worded proclamation be presented a tangible antagonist to be wounded captured overcome countryside began organising with inconceivable rapidity by two oclock even might still have removed out of district by getting aboard train after two became impossible passenger train along line on great parallelogram between southampton manchester brighton horsham travelled with locked door good traffic

rode along country lane stopping at cottage warning people to lock up house keep indoors unless be armed elementary school have broken up by three oclock child scared keeping together in group be hurrying home kemps proclamationsigned indeed by adyewas posted over almost whole district by four five oclock in afternoon gave briefly clearly condition of struggle necessity of keeping invisible

area of several hundred square mile be in stringent state of siege before too thrill of horror went through whole watching nervous countryside going from whispering mouth to mouth swift certain over

project involved use of weapon can not know what project be evidence that have iron rod in hand before met wicksteed be to at least overwhelming of course can know nothing of detail of encounter occurred on edge of gravel pit not two hundred yard from lord burdock lodge gate everything point to desperate strugglethe trampled ground numerous wound mr wicksteed received splintered walking stick why attack be made save in murderous frenzy be impossible to imagine indeed theory of madness be almost unavoidable mr wicksteed be man of forty five forty six steward to lord burdock of inoffensive habit appearance very last person in world to provoke terrible antagonist against must seem invisible man used iron rod dragged from broken piece of fence stopped quiet man going quietly home to midday meal attacked beat down feeble defence broke arm felled smashed head to jelly of course must have dragged rod out of fencing before met victimhe must have be carrying ready in hand only two detail beyond what have already be stated seem to bear on matter one be circumstance that gravel pit be not in mr wicksteeds direct path home nearly couple of hundred yard out of way other be assertion of little girl to effect going to afternoon school saw murdered man trotting in peculiar manner across field towards gravel pit pantomime of action suggests man pursuing something on ground before striking at ever again with walking stick be last person to see alive passed out of sight to death struggle being hidden from only by clump of beech tree slight depression in ground now to present writer mind at least lift murder out of realm of absolutely wanton may imagine that griffin have taken rod a weapon indeed without deliberate intention of using in murder wicksteed may then have come by noticed rod inexplicably moving through air without thought of invisible manfor port burdock be ten mile awayhe may have pursued be quite conceivable that may not even have heard of invisible man one can then imagine invisible man making offquietly in order to avoid discovering presence in neighbourhood wicksteed excited curious pursuing unaccountably locomotive objectfinally striking at doubt invisible man must easily have distanced middle aged pursuer under ordinary circumstance position in wicksteeds body be found suggests that have ill luck to drive quarry into corner between drift of stinging nettle gravel pit to who appreciate extraordinary irascibility of invisible man rest of encounter will be easy to imagine be pure hypothesis only undeniable factsfor story of
