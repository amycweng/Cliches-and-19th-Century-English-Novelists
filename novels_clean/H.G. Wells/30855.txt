driver to make detour gave quite best of park mind of mr brumley be also agreeably excited dispersed on occasion be occasion of have be dreaming very frequently of late have invented quite remarkable dialogue during dream now too be conversationally inadequate with similar feeling of unexpected adventure be now no more ready to go to root of thing than lady harman talked on way down chiefly of route be following of change in london traffic due to motor traction of charm amenity of richmond park be only after have arrived at hampton court dismissed taxi spent time upon border that came at last to seat under grove beside long piece of water bearing water lily sat down made beginning with good talk then indeed tried to gather together head of perplexity mr brumley did best to do justice to confidence reposed in wasnt at conversation have dreamt of be halting be inconclusive be full of vague dissatisfaction root of dissatisfaction lay perhaps more than anything else in inattention to

refreshment trade limit of individual responsibility in matter conclusion that be unawakened be inevitable dream of awakening sleeping beauty associated in logical sequence with interpretation say that such thought be clear in mr brumleys mind be not into shape form of thought fell such thing dimly felt below clear level of consciousness be in gave attempt to take up answer question that perplexed something of quality of attempt to clothe serve hidden purpose must not be evident to that effort of lady harman to free little from husband circumvallation to disentangle little from reality of commercial life might lead to liberation a must leave like nascent element ready to recombine be entirely in vein of drift of thought in that must resolve upon assiduous proximity against moment of release awakening do mr brumley a human lover justice if lead to suppose that plotted thus clearly calculatingly yet be in mind be in mr brumley wasnt mr brumley presented with a portrait of mind must have denied indignantlyand knowing be there have grown little flushed in denial quite equally in mind be simple desire to please to do what wished to help because wanted help quite keen desire to be clean honest about everything connected with for own sake a well a for sakefor sake of relationship so have mr brumley on green seat under great tree at hampton court in neat london clothes quite becoming silk hat above neatly handsome intelligent profile with glove in hand one arm over seat back going now very earnestly thoughtfully into question of social benefit of international bread cake store whether be possible for to do anything to repair wrong might have arisen out of organization will understand why there be little flush in cheek why sentence be trifle disconnected tentative why eye wanders now to soft raven tress about lady harmans ear now to sweet movement of speaking lip now to gracious droop of pose a sits forward elbow upon crossed knee chin on glove jab parasol at ground in unaccustomed effort to explain discus difficulty of position will understand too why be that doesnt deal with question before so simply impartially a seems to do obscuring extremely interesting problem of woman growing to man like sense of responsibility in social consequence be dramatic proclivity make see merely a something must necessarily weaken lady harmans loyalty qualify submission to sir isaac make want to utilize develop in direction moreover so complex be thought of man there be also stream of mental activity flowing in darker recess of mr

taxi at gate of hampton court fare be nine tenpence only piece of gold have be half sovereign there be handful of loose silver in trouser pocket so fare tip be manageable will be going back sir asked

court to be paid off to wait loyally until original passenger return thereby little machine be restrained from ticking out twopence must go in main to absent proprietor feeling of mutuality be established between driver fare of course cab being released presently found passenger went away have written in vain if have not conveyed to that mr brumley be gentleman of great cultivated delicacy that liked seemly handsome side of thing dreaded appearance of flaw upon prosperity a only man trained in english public school can do be intolerable to think of hitch in happy excursion be to establish knew not what confidence between lady harman from first to last felt have to go with airand be first class fare from hampton court to putneywhich latter station believed be on line from hampton court to londonand must one possibly pretend be unnecessary to have tea so while lady harman talked about husband businessour business called itand shrank from ever saying anything more about more intimate question have most in mind limit to wife obedience mr brumley listened with financial solicitude showing through expression giving quality of intensity that found remarkably reassuring once twice made miss point in remark that forced back upon very inferior substitute for apt answer judicious um must be quite impossible to go without tea decided wanted tea quite badly must think better when have have tea crisis came at tea have tea at inn upon green struck mr brumley a being most likely to be cheap pretended to choose for trivial charm about window wasnt cheap when at last mr brumley be faced by little slip of bill must draw money from pocket look at knew worst worst be worse than have expected bill be five shilling must dispute too ugly altogether dispute with probably ironical waiter money in hand amounted to four shilling sixpence acted surprise with waiter eye upon must ask for credit might be frightfully disagreeable in such cockney resort a tut tut said mr brumley thena little late for itresorted to discovered emptiness of sovereign purse realized that be out of picture at stage felt ear nose cheek grow hot pink waiter colleague across room became interested in proceeding have idea said mr brumley be premeditated falsehood be anything matter asked lady harman with sisterly interest dear lady harman find myselfridiculous position might borrow sovereign felt sure that two waiter exchanged glance looked at thema mistake againand got hotter oh said lady harman regarded with frank amusement in eye thing struck at first in light of joke ive only got one eightpence didnt expect blushed a beautifully a ever then produced small plutocratic looking purse handed to most remarkableinconvenient said mr brumley opening precious thing extracting shilling will do said dismissed waiter with tip of sixpence then with open purse still in hand spent much of remaining strength trying to look amused unembarrassed feeling time that with flushed face in view of circumstance of case must be really looking very silly fluffy really most inconvenient remarked never thought of theof be silly of said lady harman oh oh dear no silliness can assure be mine cant tell how entirely apologeticridiculous fix after have persuaded to come here still be able to pay consoled have to get home hadnt so far thought of that brought sir isaac suddenly into picture by half past five said with just faintest flavour of interrogation mr brumley looked at watch be ten minute to five waiter said how do train run from here to putney dont think sir that have train from here to putney abc railway guide be found mr brumley learnt for first time that putney hampton court be upon two distinct separate a far a must judge by time table mutually hostile branch of south western railway at earliest must not get to putney before six oclock mr brumley be extremely disconcerted perceived that ought to have kept taxi amounted almost to debt of honour to deliver lady secure untarnished at house within next hour reflection did not in least degree assist to carry out a matter of fact mr brumley became flurried did not carry out be not used to being without money unnerved gave way to kind of hectic savoir faire demanded taxi of waiter tried to evolve taxi by will power alone went out with lady harman back towards gate of hampton court to look for taxi then occurred to that might be losing up so hurried over bridge of station have vague notion that must be able to get ticket on credit at booking office if presented visiting card clerk in charge seemed to find something uncongenial in proposal did not seem to like what saw of mr brumley through little square window mr brumley found something slighting unpleasant in manner be one of little temperamental jar happen to men of delicate sensibility mr brumley tried to be reassuringly overbearing in manner then lost temper be threatening so wasted precious moment what time lady harman waited on platform with certain shadow of doubt falling upon confidence in watched five twenty five gather together start londonward mr brumley came out of ticket office resolved to travel without ticket carry thing through with high hand just a became impossible to do so by train then regret to say returned for further haughty passage with ticket clerk upon duty of public servant to point out such oversight a led to repartee did nothing to help lady harman on homeward way then discovered current time table learnt now even be ticket difficulty over ridden must not get lady harman to putney before twenty minute past seven so completely be south western railway not organized for conveying people from hampton court to putney explained a well a must to lady harman then led out of station in last desperate search for taxi can always come back for next train said doesnt go for hour can not blame sufficiently said for eighth ninth time be already well past quarter to six before mr brumley

be have natural disposition towards truthfulness worried mind that while be struggling to assert right to common social freedom must be tacitly admitting kind of justice in husband objection by concealing fact that afternoon companion be man tried not to recognize existence of doubt deep down in mind there did indeed lurk weakening uncertainty about right of woman to free conversation with man own reason disowned that uncertainty with scorn wouldnt go away for reason went about in mind doing utmost to cut doubt dead tried to go back to beginning think out a be not used to thinking thing

of friend take on in fact privilege of grown up person in asserting that have never anticipated that participation of household must be invoked that general breach might open between husband have seemed just definite little point at issue at sir isaac angry dozen other matter have seemed safely remote matter have never yet quite properly thought about have be drawn into controversy be not only that drew in thing from outside evoked thing within discovered be disposed to fight not simply to establish certain liberty for alsowhich have certainly not be in mind beforeto keep husband away from something latent in situation have surprised with effect have arisen out of quarrel like sharpshooter out of ambuscade right to go out alone have now only value of mere pretext for far more extensive independence ultimate extent of independence still dared not contemplate be more than little scared wasnt prepared for so wide revision of life a involved wasnt at sure of rightfulness of position conception of marriage contract at time be liberal towards husband after didnt owe obedience didnt owe subordinate co operation didnt in fact owe whole marriage service contract when thought of figure

borrow be on evening of second day that chance remark from peter turned mind to extensive possibility of liquidation that lay close at hand be discussing dinner dress with peter wanted something very plain high unattractive peter who disapproved of tendency be for female wile propitiation fell into admiration of pearl necklace thought perhaps by so doing might induce lady harman to wear if wore sir isaac might be little propitiated if sir isaac be little propitiated must be much more comfortable for snagsby everyone be reminded of story of lady who sold one substituted imitation pearl one

be certain sapphire diamond ring didnt like never wore that sir isaac have given a birthday present two year ago of course must never dream of selling anything at utmost need pawn reflected decided that on whole must be wiser not to ask peter how one pawned occurred to to consult encyclopdia britannica on subject though learnt that chinese pawnshop must not charge more than three per cent per

article be omission sir isaac monogamy with other instance might be akin to be not pure exalted that call readjustment be view that in article mr brumley conspicuously doesnt display a if for moment pen in hand have eddied back to old absolute position in very little while mr brumley lady beach mandarin have almost persuaded other that sir isaac be applying physical torture to proudly silent wife mr brumley be no longer dreaming glancing at steadily facing possibility of pure minded handsomely done elopement to free lady harman must be followed in due course by marriage true marriage on level

simplified also greatly falsified outlook proposal that best people will applaud higher rightness be to be revealed in projected elopement be in very essence of romantic attitude other people be still to remain under law there be to be nothing revolutionary with exceptional person under exceptional condition mr brumley stated case over over again to utmost satisfaction always at great moral altitude with kind of transcendent orthodoxy more difficult aspect of affair appeared from orthodox standpoint more valiantly mr brumley soared if came to living with lady harman for time before must be properly married amidst picturesque foreign scenery in little casa by side of stream then water in stream be to be quite purest water conceivable scenery association a morally faultless a view have

terrible gift of independent responsibility to lady harman in direction lay region that mr brumley have still to explore lady harman considered be married wrongly disastrously held to be essentially fault of sir isaacwith perhaps slight blame attaching to lady harmans mother only path of escape must conceive a yet for lady harman lay through chivalry of other man that woman must possibly rebel against one man without sympathy moral maintenance of be still outside range of mr brumleys understanding be still outside range of most men understandingsand of great many woman if generalized at from persuasion be in direction that in interest of true marriage there must be greater facility for divorce also kind of respectable ization of divorce then false marriage might be rectified without suffering reason for divorce felt must be extended to include thing not generally reprehensible chivalrous people coming into court must be protected from indelicate publicity of free reporting mr brumley be still contemplating rather inconclusively possibility of long intimate talk leading up to preparing for elopement with lady harman when read of jago street escapade of impending appearance at south hampsmith police court be astonished more contemplated thing greater became astonishment even at first impact realized that line have taken wasnt quite in picture with line have proposed for feltleft out felt a though door have slammed between affair to have supposed essential must not understand why have done thing instead of coming straight to flat making use of chivalrous service

explanation hurried to secure elbowed unsavoury corner in back of court in order to hear defence have to wait through long stuffy space of time before appeared there be dozen other window smashersplain at least untidy looking young woman magistrate told be silly soul of mr brumley acquiesced one tried to make speech be such poor speechsqueaky when at last lady harman entered boxthe strangest place seemed for herhe tried to emerge from jostling crowd about into visibility to catch eye to give support of devoted presence twice at least glanced in direction gave sign of seeing be surprised that must look without fear detestation indeed once with gesture of solicitude at sir isaac be astonishingly serene there seemed to be just faintest shadow of smile about lip a stipendiary explained impossibility of giving anything le than month uneasy object like smashed remains of colossal box of bonbon be riding out gale down in middle of court turned round at last completely revealed a hat of lady beach mandarin though mr brumley waved hand must not even make lady aware of presence powerful rude criminal looking man who stood in front of smelt grossly of stable must not give fair chance of showing developed strong personal hostility to on account of alleged shoving about must not felt be of slightest help to lady harman for to involve in personal struggle with powerful powerfully flavoured criminal be very dreadful after proceeding be over lady harman have be led away into captivity went out took taxi in agitated distraught manner to lady beach mandarin house meant said lady beach mandarin to have month holiday from think thing out shes got perhaps be mr brumley must not tell spent day in state of perplexity like weariness herald cold mark so often

met eye a went over new wing with sir isaac have so manifestlyand when one came to think of so tranquillyseemed to understand be such extraordinary thing to go smashing window like thatwhen there be at hand ready to help knew address did for moment mr brumley cherished that wild surmise be that perhaps surely must have looked in telephone directory who who if be truth of matter must have looked behaved differently in courtquite differently must have be looking for must have seen be queer too to recall what have said in court about daughter must be have frightful qualm that after allhe wasnt man how little knew of really wretched agitation said mr brumley trying to flounder away anyhow from disconcerting riddle seems to unbalance found impossible to believe that lady harman be seriously unbalanced if mr brumleys system of romantically distorted moral assumption be shattered by lady harmans impersonal blow at post office window when rule seemed to require to fly from oppression of one man to chivalry of what word can convey devastating effect upon of conduct after release to crisis have be looking forward continually to record variety of expectation must fill large volume

must have be very blond very nosey person indeed be homely practical contributed very usefully to conversation remained trifle fragmentary faintly uncomfortable to end mr brumley avoided a much a must looking at lady harman because knew sir isaac be alert for be acutely aware of presence dispensing tea moving about room being good wife be first impression of lady harman a good wife disliked

reasonable confidential spoke to mr brumley a if son be slightly deaf better than fretting said mr brumley returned to london in state of extreme mental emotional unrest sight of lady harman have restored passion for too manifest fact that be receding beyond reach stirred with unavailing impulse impossible extremity of effort have filled mind so much that must not endure thought of living without hope of what hope be there of be jealous detestably jealous so jealous that in direction did not dare to let mind go sawed at bit brought back must have have to writhe about carriage thought ran furiously over place to avoid pit now found flashing at moment into wild hopeless rebellion against institution of marriage of have hitherto sought always to be dignified smiling champion against innovator over critical young have never rebelled before be so astonished at violence of own objection that lapsed from defiance to incredulous examination of own novel attitude not true marriage object to told marriage like rat trap alluring scarcely unavoidable so that in go then with escapeunless tear to rag escape came to that there be at least one way out for lady harman sir isaac might die pulled up presently astonished dismayed at activity of own imagination among other thing have wondered if by chance lady harman have ever allowed mind to travel in same post mortem direction at time surely thing must have shone upon a possibility hope from that have branched off to more general speculation how many people be there in world nice people kind people moral delicate minded people to whom death of person mean release from inflexible barrierpossibilities of secretly desired happiness realization of crushed forbidden dream have vision of human society like vision of night landscape seen suddenly in lightning flash a of people caught by couple in trap quietly hoping for one anothers death good heaven said mr brumley what be coming to got up in railway compartmenthe have to himselfand walked up down narrow limit until jolt over point made suddenly sit down again most marriage be happy said mr brumley like man who have fallen into river scramble back to safety one mustnt judge by exceptional case though of course there area good manyexceptional case folded arm crossed leg frowned reasoned with himselfresolved to dismiss post mortem speculationsabsolutely be not

dream perhaps god on painted ceiling have such tie acting beautifully by very nature here on floor of world one have one have to make best of be making best of mr brumley be off again that last thought opened way to speculative wilderness into mr brumley went wandering with novel desperate enterprise to find kind of marriage must suit began to reform marriage law did utmost not to think especially of lady harman while be doing so must just take up whole question deal with in temperate reasonable way be so necessary to be reasonable temperate in questionsand not to think of death a solution marriage to begin with be too easy to make too difficult to break countless girlslady harman be only typewere married long before must know beginning of own mind wanted to delay middle twenty say why not if by infirmity of humanity one must have marriage before then there ought to be especial opportunity of rescinding later lady harman ought to have be able to rescind marriage what ought to be marriageable age in civilized community when mind be settled into general system of opinion mr brumley thought then lapsed into speculation whether mind didnt keep changing developing through life lady harmans be certainly still doing so pointed to logical consequence of undesirable sort little mind slide occurred just at point found thinking that perhaps sir isaac might last for year year might even outlive wife exhausted by nursing anyhow to wait for death to leave thing one loved in embrace of moribund wrenched thought back a quickly a possible to disinterested reform of marriage law what have decided so far only for more deliberation riper age in marrying surely must appeal even to most orthodox that alone must not eliminate mistake deception altogether sir isaac skin have peculiar unhealthy look there ought in addition to be widest facility for divorce possible mr brumley tried to draw up schedule in head of ground for divorce that really civilized community must entertain there be practical difficulty marriage be not simply sexual union be economic one of peculiarly inseparable sortand there be child jealousy of course so far a economics went kind of marriage settlement might meet most of difficulty a for child mr brumley be longer in mood of enthusiastic devotion to child have made birth of george edmund so tremendous event child alone afforded reason for indissoluble lifelong union face thing frankly how long be absolutely necessary for people to keep home together for child prosperous class best class in community packed little creature off to school at age of nine ten one might overdowe be overdoing in writing nowadays thisphiloprogenitive enthusiasm found thinking of george meredith idea of ten year marriage mind recoiled to sir isaac pillowed up possession what flimsy stuff talk of altered marriage be thing did not even touch essential of matter thought of sir isaac thin lip wary knowing eye what possible divorce law must wit of man devise

moment wilt under first fierce breath of reality marriage property be twin child of man individualistic nature only on term can be drawn into society mr brumley found little scheme for novelty in marriage divorce lying dead for most part still born in mind in despair to set to work to alter marriage in essential point be realized a if ant must start to climb thousand foot of cliff great institution rose upon imagination like insurmountable sierra blue sombre between life of lady harman that desired there might be certain amount of tinkering with matrimonial law in next few year of petty tinkering must abolish few pretence give ease to few amiable people if be to come back to life thousand year hence felt must still find ancient gigantic barrier crossed perhaps by dangerous road pierced perhaps by narrow tunnel so in great essential same between lady harman wasnt that be rational wasnt that be justifiable be one with blood in one vein rain cloud in sky necessity in nature of present thing before mankind emerged from valley of restraintsif ever did emergethousands of generation must follow one there must be ten of thousand of year of struggle thought trial in teeth of

appearance of life social secrecy by peoplehow must one put itpeople who agree with established institution people at rate not merely egoistic jealous a crowd be egoistic jealous hide help one to mitigate inflexible austerity of great unreason yes mr brumley have got to phrase of quality for undiscriminating imperative of fundamental social institution see how particular situation may undermine assumption of mind originally devoted to uncritical acceptance still insisted be necessary great unreason absolutely necessaryfor mass of people part of natural expression of must imagine possibilityof understanding mr brumley be very vague about understanding mystery of exalted be to filch happiness from destroying grasp of crude jealous have to be vague for secret noble be idea like oil water may fling together with force of will in little while will separate again for time dream of impossible secrecy be uppermost in mr brumleys meditation came into head with effect of discovery

differentif only in simplicity there be something about others put whole world apart from who be held so tethered from furtive adventure by filmy tentacle of responsibility tie strand of relationship essential delicacy momentary vision of ellen a countess martin broke up into absurdity directly looked at fully steadfastly from thinking of two woman a similar type passed into thinking of a opposite thrse hard clear sensuous secretive trained by brilliant tradition in technique of connubial betrayal be very antithesis of ellens vague invincible veracity openness not for nothing have anatole france made heroine daughter of grasping financial adventurer of course cave be part of mountain mind drifted away to still more general speculation always be trying not to see figure of sir isaac grimly yet meanly resolutein possession always too like open mouthed yokel at fair who know nothing of insult chalked upon back disregarded how coveted desired must if must have gripped forgot own watchful attention to euphemia in past did think what might have be if lady harman have be wife needed chill veracity of small hour to bring to that thought now of crude egotism a having sir isaac

one else to tell so george edmund went on talking mr brumley went on thinking mr brumley must not sleep at until be nearly five intelligence seemed to be making up at last for year of speculative restraint in world for most part given up to slumber mr brumley may be imagined a clambering hand over fist in silence feverishly wonderfully overtaking age in morning got up pallid shaved badly be

reflection lady harman perceived that explained sort of thing in conversation particularly flash of hardness at end even then thing must have be hanging over while lady harman be making meritorious

hasnt seen thing a ive seen doesnt feel a do about thing thus susan discourse so puzzled lady harman that bethought of mr brumley called in only too readily accorded advice asked to tea on day when knew unofficially that sir isaac must be away showed plan sketched probable development then with charming confidence of hers in knowledge ability put doubt fear before what did really think of place what did think of susan burnets idea of ruined lodging house keeper used to think store be good thing said be likely to be good thing at mr brumley said um great number of time realized that be humbug fenced with affected sagacity for time suddenly threw down defence confessed knew a little of business a did see be complex question andits interesting one too may enquire into for think might be able to hunt up few particular went away in glow of resolution georgina be about only intimate who regarded new development without misgiving think youre going to do sort of thing with hostel ella said a matter of fact theyre bound to become just exactly what weve always wanted what may be asked mr sawbridge over macram work stronghold for garrison of suffragette said georgina with light of great insane movement in eye ringing note in voice fort chabrols for woman for month in negative occasionally almost negligent fashion mr brumley have be living up to impassioned resolve to be unselfish lover of lady harman have be rather at loose end intellectually deprived of old assumption habitual attitude rather chaotic in matter of new conviction have given most of productive hour to writing of novel be to be entire departure from euphemia tradition more got on with more clearly realized that be essentially insignificant when re read what have written be surprised by crudity where have intended sincerity rhetoric where scheme have demanded passion be matter with be stirred that lady harman must send for inability to deal with perplexity deepened realization of ignorance superficiality have so long masked even from beneath trick pretension of gay scepticism went away fully resolved to grapple with entire hostel question put patched tortured manuscript of new novel aside with certain satisfaction to do more reflected upon nature of study proposed for more attracted be such reality a have be wanting must presently doubt whether must ever go back to novel writing again at least to sort of novel writing have be doing hitherto to invent story to save middle aged prosperous middle class people from distress of thinking be surely work for self respecting man stevenson in very deep of dishonourable traffic have realized a much likened to fille de joie haggard of same school period have abandoned blood thunder at climax of success for honest study of agricultural condition newer success be turning out work le le conventional agreeable more more stiffened with fact sincerity must show lady harman that certain debonair quality have always affected wasnt incompatible with powerful grasp of general condition wanted done suppose did in way made necessary to suppose did very well set to work understanding a do certain quality of chameleon in mr brumleys moral nature will understand that worked through considerable variety of mood sometimes worked with disinterested passion sometimes be greatly sustained by thought here be something must weave in with gravity of life give perhaps new inlet to intimacy presently third thing came to help be discovery that question arising out of attempt to realize importance of hostel be in very fascinating question for intelligent person because before have done with business of modern employ must if be intelligent person have taken view of whole vast process of social reorganization began with development of factory labour big town be even now scarcely advanced enough for to see general trend for time mr brumley did not realize magnitude of thing be looking at when did theory sprouted in mind like mushroom babbled with mental excitement came in state of utmost lucidity to explain theory to lady harman struck that lady at time a being most illuminating suggestion have ever encountered threw appearance of order of process over world of trade employment competition have hitherto seemed too complex mysterious for understanding see said mr brumleythey have met that day in kensington garden be sitting side by side upon green chair near frozen writing of physical energyyou see if may lecture little putting thing a simply a possible world have be filling up new space ever since discovery of america period from then to about let say be period of rapid increase of population in response to new opportunity of living new fulnesses of life in direction during time four hundred year of roughly there be huge development of family life to marry rear quite considerable family became chief business of everybody celibacy grew rare monastery nunnery have abounded vanished like thing dissolving in flood even priest became protestant against celibacy took unto wife have huge family natural check upon increase famine pestilence be lifted by more systematized communication by scientific discovery altogether a consequence world now have probably three four time human population ever carried before everywhere in period family prevailed again prospering multiplying household be return to family to reproductive social grouping of early barbaric life naturally thought of modern world have emerged since fifteenth century fall into form so see lady harman generation of grandfather in opening nineteenth century have two shaping idea two form of thought family progress not realizing that very progress have suddenly reopened door of opportunity for family have revived ancient injunction to increase multiply replenish earth might presently close that door again declare world be filled be what be happening now door close that immense swarming multiplying of little people be over force of social organization have be coming into play now more more for century half to produce new wholesale way of doing thing new great organization organization invade autonomous family more more be perhaps destined ultimately to destroy altogether supersede at least be so make reading of history in matter yes said lady harman with knitted brow yes wondered privately whether must be possible to get from opening to matter of hostel before be time for to return for sir isaac tea mr brumley continued to talk with eye fixed a be upon thought thing lady harman go on at different pace in different region will not trouble with discussion of of emigration of of detail of vast proliferation preceded present phase suffice now tendency be back towards restraint upon increase to increasing celibacy to fall in birth rate in average size of family toto release of woman from entire devotion to numerous offspring so at last to supersession of little family unit that for four century have made up substance of social life determined nearly moral sentimental attitude autonomy of family be being steadily destroyed be being replaced by autonomy of individual in relation to syndicated economic effort think said lady harman slowly arresting by gesture if must make about little clearer mr brumley did went on to point out with lucidity of university extension lecturer what meant by singular phrase listened intelligently with effort be much too intent upon getting thing expressed to own satisfaction to notice absurdity in preoccupation with theory about population of world in face of immediate practical difficulty declared that onset of new phase in human life modern phase wherein there be apparently to be no more proliferating instead settling down of population towards stable equilibrium became apparent first with expropriation of english peasantry birth of factory system machine production since time one can trace steady substitution of wholesale collective method for household family method have gone far with now instead of woman drawing water from well pipe tap of water company instead of home made rushlight electric lamp instead of home spun ready made clothes instead of home brewed brewer cask instead of home baked first little baker then clean punctual international bread cake store instead of child learning at mother knee compulsory elementary school flat take place of separate house instead of little holding big farm instead of child working at home factory everywhere synthesis everywhere little independent proprietor give place to company company to trust follow lady harman go on said encouraged by transitory glimpse of store in discourse now londonand england generallyhad period of expansion got on to beginning at least of period of synthesis be following sooner than other country in world because be first to reach new stage developed characteristic of new stage with stronger flavour of old than did such later growth of civilization a new york bombay berlin be why london british big city generally be congestion of little house little home while newer great city run to apartment flat hadnt grasped logical consequence of what be in for so completely a people abroad did who caught later be why a began to develop new floating population of mainly celibate employee childless people have mostly to go into lodging went into home be intended for family a accessory to family be able to go in because family be no longer so numerous a used to be london be still largely city of landlady lodging in other part of world be there so big population of lodger business of hostel be nothing more le than beginning of end of just a great refreshment caterer have mopped up ancient multitude of coffee house squalid little special feeding arrangement of day of tittlebat titmouse dick swiveller so now hostel be going to mop up lodging house system of london of course there be other kindred movement naturally ywca ymca london girl club union so forth be doing kindred work what mr brumley what be to become of landlady asked lady harman mr brumley be checked in mid theory hadnt thought of landlady said after short pause worry said lady harman um said mr brumley thrown out do know other day went into chelsea where there be whole street of lodging andi suppose be wrong of went pretended to be looking for room for girl clerk knew sawoh end of room such poor old woman such dingy worked out broken old woman with kind of fearful sharpness so eager so dreadfully eager to get girl clerk who didnt exist looked at with expression of pained enquiry said mr brumley that think be question so to speak for social ambulance if perhaps might go onthat particular difficulty might consider later think be talking of general synthesis yes said lady harman what be exactly be to take place of isolated little home dreary little lodging here be husband rushing in with new thing just a rushed in with store thirty year ago overset little baker confectioner refreshment dealer by hundred of thempoor dearstheyi dont like to think wasnt good thing made after allonly hard sort of thing made shop of hiswith girl who strike say be sweated driven now here be making kind of barrack place for people to live in expressed rest of idea with gesture of hand admit process have danger said mr brumley like supersession of small holding by latifundia in italy thats just where great opportunity come in synthetic phase have occurred before in world history history be history of lost opportunity need ours be have feeling a though something have slipped through finger feel said that be more important to than anything else in life that hostel anyhow be springing so rapidly from chance suggestion of mine shouldnt be lost opportunity exactly said mr brumley with gesture of one who recovers thread be just what be driving at finger of extended hand felt in warm afternoon air for moment then said ah in tone of recovery while waited respectfully for resumed thread see said regard process of synthesis substitution of wholesale collective method for homely individual one a under existing condition inevitableinevitable phase live in to have to adapt ourselves be a little under control mine a movement of sun through zodiac practically be what have to do be not think to sigh for lost home age of gold spade husbandry pig hen in home so on to make new synthetic life tolerable for mass of men woman hopeful for mass of men woman thing developing ascending thats where hostel come in lady harman thats where theyre so important theyre pioneer movement if succeedand thing in sir isaac hand have way of succeeding at rate to paying pointthen therell be headlong rush of imitation imitating good feature imitating bad feature deepening groove see point yes said make memore afraid than ever hopeful said mr brumley presuming to lay hand for instant on arm big enough to be inspiring im afraid said laying down line of new social lifeno le what make so strange so typical too of way social force work nowadays be that husband who have instinctive insistence upon right restriction of family relation in private life who be narrowly passionately for home in own case who hate book discussion seem to touch must in business activity be striking tremendous new blow at ancient organization for see be what amount to yes said lady harman slowly yes of course doesnt know mr brumley be silent for little while see resumed at worst new social life may become sort of slavery in barrack at bestit might become something very wonderful mind be busy now for day thinking just how wonderful new life might be instead of old bickering crowded family home new home of comrade made pause thought ran off upon fresh track in looking up thing came upon queer little literature of pamphlet so forth dealing with case of shop assistant have great grievance in what call living in system employer herd in dormitory over shop usually feed by gaslight in basement fine keep almost intolerable grip upon make go to bed at half past ten make go to church on sundaysall sort of petty tyranny assistant be passionately against theyve got power to strike where must go if struck into street only people who live out have home of own to sulk in can strike naturally therefore a preliminary to other improvement in shop assistant life young people want to live out practically thats impossible demand at present because couldnt get lodging live out with decency at on what cost employer to lodge feed in well here see curious possibility for hostel open prospect of living out system for shop assistant just in degree in choose to interfere with regulate bully deal with wholesale through employer do make new living out method approximate to living in thats curious side development isnt lady harman appreciated that thats only beginning of business there something more hostel might touch mr brumley gathered together for new aspect there marriage said one of most interesting unsatisfactory aspect of life of employee to dayand know employee be now in majority in adult populationis see hold celibate hold celibate for longer longer period average age at marriage rise steadily so long a remain celibate be prepared with sort of idea about future development of social life club hostel living in so forth at present havent idea at about adaptation of natural pairing instinct to new state of affair ultimately employee marries hold out a long a possibly can ultimately have to have to even in face of economic system hold out prospect of anything insecurity increasing chance of trouble disaster to employee family group what happens be that drop back into distressful crippled insecure imitation of old family life a one have in what might call multiplying period of history start homethey dream of cottage drift to lodging usually isnt best sort of lodging for landlady hate wife other lodger detest baby often young couple doesnt have baby see be more intelligent than peasant intelligence fecundity vary reciprocally said mr brumley mean interrupted lady harman softly there be world wide fall in birth rate people dont have family did yes said lady harman understand now more prosperous more sanguine take suburban little house hutch make such place a hendon nightmare of monotony go into ridiculous jerry built sham cottage in garden suburb where young wife doe own housework pretend to like have sort of happiness for time suppose woman stop outside work man very much handicapped go on competing against single men thennothing more happens except difficulty world go dull grey for look about for lodger perhaps have read gissings paying guest suppose said lady harman suppose be like one try not to think be so one neednt let believe that dullness be unhappiness said mr brumley dont want to paint thing sadder than be not fine life not full life life in neo malthusian suburban hutch neo asked lady harman mere phrase said mr brumley hastily extraordinary thing be that until set looking into thing with question ive always taken sort of thing for granted a though couldnt be otherwise now seem to see with kind of freshness im astounded at muddle of waste aimlessness of here again be lady harman think opportunity come in with hostel a might be projected now seem to have possibility of modernized more collective civilized family life than old close congestion of single home see reason at why shouldnt carry that collective life on to married stage a thing be now little community dont go beyond pairingand out drift to find homestead will never posse what have be borne in upon more more forcibly a have gone

situation in flank like many people who be not easily clear lady harman when be clear acted with very considerable decision be perhaps none le effective because of large softness of manner surprised sir isaac by coming of own accord into study where with altogether novel disfavour sat contemplating detailed plan for sydenham hostel think ive found out what trouble be said what trouble about hostel how do know ive be finding out what girl be saying theyd say anything dont think theyre clever enough for said lady harman after consideration recovered thread see isaac theyve be frightened by

make feel will be un homelike that there will be kind of repetition in evening of discipline regulation have to put up with during day have to put up with murmured sir isaac wish have be thought of sooner if have made place look little more ordinary called osborne house something little old fashioned like something with touch of old queen about kind of thing cant go to expense of taking down big gilt letter just to please fancy of miss babs wheeler too late now to do perhaps must do something think to remove suspicion want isaaci think pulled together to announce determination think if be to go to girl meet delegation of just talk to plainly about what mean by hostel cant go making speech must just be talking to such come down said sir isaac after momentary contemplation of possibility for time talked without getting very far from position have assumed at last sir isaac shifted back upon expert cant talk about to mr pembrose know more about sort of business than do im not going to talk to mr pembrose said lady harman after little interval unusual quality in quiet voice made sir isaac lift eye to face for moment so one saturday afternoon lady harman have meeting with roomful of recalcitrant girl at regent street refreshment branch looked very odd to with grey cotton wrapper over everything blind down for first time came face to face with people for whom almost in spite of be working be meeting summoned by international branch of national union of waitress miss babs wheeler mr graper be so to speak north south pole of little group upon improvised platform from lady harman be to talk to gathering must have liked support of mr brumley couldnt contrive unostentatious way of bringing into business without putting upon footing must have involved appearance of sir isaac mr pembrose andeverybody essentially wasnt to be everybody be to be little talk lady harman rather liked appearance of miss babs wheeler met more than answering approval in insubordinate young woman eye miss wheeler be minute swaggering person much akimbo with little round blue eyed innocent face that shone with delight at lark of living three companion who be in lobby with to receive usher in lady harman seemed just a young be relatively unilluminated except by manifest devotion to leader displayed rather than concealed opinion of a dear fair wonder meeting generally seemed to be gathering of very human young woman rather restless then agog to see clothes then somehow allayed by appearance quite amiably attentive to what have to say majority be young girl dressed with cheap smartness of suburb rest be for most part older dingier here there be dotted young lady of remarkable questionable smartness in front row full of shy recognition little disguised by unfamiliar hat be susans sister alice a lady harman have made up mind that be not going to deliver speech felt diffidence in speaking be far too intent on message to be embarrassed by thought of effect be producing talked a might have talked in one of easier mood to mr brumley a talked happened that miss babs wheeler quite number of other girl present watched face fell in love with began with habitual prelude see said stopped began again wanted to tell with clumsy simplicity told how hostel have arisen out of desire that must have something better than uncomfortable lodging in lived werent business enterprise werent sort of charity wanted to be sort of place in must feel quite free hadnt sort of intention of having interfered with hate being interfered with understand just a well a anyone can that dont like either wanted hostel to be sort of place that might perhaps after time almost manage run for yourselves might have committee something only know isnt always easy to do a one want thing dont always go in world a one want to goparticularly if one isnt clever lost for moment at point then went on to say didnt like new rule have be drawn up in hurry have only read after be printed sort of thing in seemed to be losing theme again mr graper handed offending card big varnished wall placard with eyelet tape complete glanced at for example said wasnt idea to have fine great long continued applause there be something have always disliked about fine renewed applause rule must easily be torn up a said a meeting broke into acquiescence again occurred to that there be card of rule in hand nothing must be simpler than to tear up there then resisted for moment compressed lip then have in half tearing be so satisfactory to that tore again then again a tore have pleasant irrational feeling that be tearing mr pembrose mr grapers face betrayed shocked feeling meeting have become charged with strong desire to show how entirely approved of made crowning attempt at applause hammered umbrella on floor clapped hand rattled chair gave shrill cheer chair be broken wish said lady harman when storm have abated youd come look at hostel couldnt come next saturday afternoon must have stand up tea must see place then afterwards committee iand husbandcould make out real set of rule went on for little time longer appealed to with strength of honest purpose to help to make possible good thing real good thing not to suspect not to be hard on herand husbandnot to make difficult thing impossible be so easy to do when finished be in happiest possession of meeting came thronging round with flushed face bright eye wanted to come near wanted to touch wanted to assure that for be quite prepared to live in kind of place for come talk to lady harman said one well show nobody hasnt told lady harman how hostel be yours come talk to again lady harman didnt wait for following saturday on monday morning mr pembrose received thirty seven application to take up room for next few year be to be matter of recurrent heart searching for lady harman whether have be profoundly wise extremely foolish in tearing up card of projected rule at time seemed most natural obvious little action imaginable be long before realized just how symbolical determining few movement of hand wrist can be fixed line not so much for a for others put definitely much more definitely than conviction warranted on side of freedom against discipline for indeed conviction like most of conviction kept along tortuous watershed between two be only few rare extravagant spirit who be wholly for warp wholly for woof of human affair girl applauded loved at one stroke have acquired terrible liability of partisan made champion sanction be responsible for endless succession of difficulty flowered out of interpretation of act hostel have seemed passing out of control suddenly turned back upon took possession of be never simple difficulty right wrong refused to unravel for side of issue seemed to be so often in suicidal competition with antagonist for inferior case if force of order discipline showed perennially harsh narrow did not blind perplexed eye to fact that girl be frequently extremely naughty wished very often did so wishthey wouldnt be set out with kind of eagerness for conflict very loyalty to expressed not so much in sustained attempt to make hostel successful a in cheering inconveniently in embarrassing declaration of preference in ingenious systematic rudeness to anyone suspected of imperfect devotion to first comer into hostel be much more like swelling inrush of tide than a mr pembrose must have preferred like something laid on through pipe when lady wanted to go on with old rule until sir isaac have approved of new new arrival went into cutting out room manifested lady harman have to be telephoned for to allay manifestation then arose question of deportment trivial in of gravest moment for welfare of hostel there be phrase about noisy improper conduct in revised
