lost inheritance sad story of dramatic critic slip under microscope plattner story whether story of gottfried plattner be to be credited not be pretty question in value of evidence on one hand have seven witness to be perfectly exact have six half pair of eye one undeniable fact on other have what be prejudice common sense inertia of opinion never be there seven more honest seeming witness never be there more undeniable fact than inversion of gottfried plattner anatomical structure never be there more preposterous story than one have to tell most preposterous part of story be worthy gottfried contribution for count a one of seven heaven forbid must be led into giving countenance to superstition by passion for impartiality so come to share fate of eusapia patron frankly believe there be something crooked about business of gottfried plattner what that crooked factor be will admit a frankly know have be surprised at credit accorded to story in most unexpected authoritative quarter fairest way to reader however will be for to tell without further comment gottfried plattner be in spite of name free born englishman father be alsatian who came to england in sixty married respectable english girl of unexceptionable antecedent died after wholesome uneventful life devoted understand chiefly to laying of parquet flooring in gottfried age be seven twenty be by virtue of heritage of three language modern language master in small private school in south of england to casual observer be singularly like other modern language master in other small private school costume be very costly very fashionable on other hand be not markedly cheap shabby complexion like height bearing be inconspicuous must notice perhaps that like majority of people face be not absolutely symmetrical right eye little larger than left jaw trifle heavier on right side if a ordinary careless person be to bare chest feel heart beating must probably find quite like heart of anyone else here trained observer must part company if found heart quite ordinary trained observer must find quite otherwise once thing be pointed out to too must perceive peculiarity easily enough be that gottfried heart beat on right side of body now be not only singularity of gottfried structure although be only one must appeal to untrained mind careful sounding of gottfried internal arrangement by well known surgeon seems to point to fact that other unsymmetrical part of body be similarly misplaced right lobe of liver be on left side left on right while lung too be similarly contraposed what be still more singular unless gottfried be consummate actor must believe that right hand have recently become left since occurrence be about to consider a impartially a possible have found utmost difficulty in writing except from right to left across paper with left hand can not throw with right hand be perplexed at meal time between knife fork idea of rule of road be cyclist be still dangerous confusion there be not scrap of evidence to show that before occurrence gottfried be at left handed there be yet wonderful fact in preposterous business gottfried produce three photograph of have at age of five six thrusting fat leg at from under plaid frock scowling in photograph left eye be little larger than right jaw be trifle heavier on left side be reverse of present living condition photograph of gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict fact be because be one of cheap gem photograph be then in vogue taken direct upon metal therefore reversing thing just a looking glass must third photograph represents at one twenty confirms record of others there seems here evidence of strongest confirmatory character gottfried have exchanged left side for right yet how human being can be so changed short of fantastic pointless miracle be exceedingly hard to suggest in one way of course fact might be explicable on supposition that plattner have undertaken elaborate mystification on strength of heart displacement photograph may be fudged left handedness imitated character of man doe not lend to such theory be quiet practical unobtrusive thoroughly sane from nordau standpoint like beer smoke moderately take walking exercise daily have healthily high estimate of value of teaching have good untrained tenor voice take pleasure in singing air of popular cheerful character be fond not morbidly fond of reading chiefly fiction pervaded with vaguely pious optimism sleep well rarely dream be in fact very last person to evolve fantastic fable indeed so far from forcing story upon world have be singularly reticent on matter meet inquirer with certain engaging bashfulness be almost word disarms most suspicious seems genuinely ashamed that anything so unusual have occurred to be to be regretted that plattner aversion to idea of post mortem dissection may postpone perhaps for ever positive proof that entire body have have left right side transposed upon fact mainly credibility of story hang there be way of taking man moving about in space a ordinary people understand space will result in changing side do right be still right left left can do with perfectly thin flat thing of course if be to cut figure out of paper figure with right left side must change side simply by lifting up turning over with solid be different mathematical theorist tell that only way in right left side of solid body can be changed be by taking that body clean out of space a know taking out of ordinary existence be turning somewhere outside space be little abstruse doubt anyone with knowledge of mathematical theory will assure reader of truth to put thing in technical language curious inversion of plattner right left side be proof that have moved out of space into what be called fourth dimension that have returned again to world unless choose to consider victim of elaborate motiveless fabrication be almost bound to believe that have occurred so much for tangible fact come now to account of phenomenon attended temporary disappearance from world appears that in sussexville proprietary school plattner not only discharged duty of modern language master also taught chemistry commercial geography book keeping shorthand drawing other additional subject to changing fancy of boy parent might direct attention knew little nothing of various subject in secondary a distinguished from board elementary school knowledge in teacher be very properly by mean so necessary a high moral character gentlemanly tone in chemistry be particularly deficient knowing say nothing beyond three gas three gas may be a however pupil began by knowing nothing derived information from caused anyone little inconvenience for several term then little boy named whibble joined school who have be educated seems by mischievous relative into inquiring habit of mind little boy followed plattner lesson with marked sustained interest in order to exhibit zeal on subject brought at various time substance for plattner to analyse plattner flattered by evidence of power of awakening interest trusting to boy ignorance analysed even made general statement a to composition indeed be so far stimulated by pupil a to obtain work upon analytical chemistry study during supervision of evening preparation be surprised to find chemistry quite interesting subject so far story be absolutely commonplace now greenish powder come upon scene source of greenish powder seems unfortunately lost master whibble tell tortuous story of finding done up in packet in disused limekiln near down must have be excellent thing for plattner possibly for master whibble family if match must have be applied to powder there then young gentleman certainly did not bring to school in packet in common eight ounce graduated medicine bottle plugged with masticated newspaper gave to plattner at end of afternoon school four boy have be detained after school prayer in order to complete neglected task plattner be supervising in small classroom in chemical teaching be conducted appliance for practical teaching of chemistry in sussexville proprietary school a in most small school in country be characterised by severe simplicity be kept in small cupboard standing in recess having about same capacity a common travelling trunk plattner being bored with passive superintendence seems to have welcomed intervention of whibble with green powder a agreeable diversion unlocking cupboard proceeded at once with analytical experiment whibble sat luckily for at safe distance regarding four malefactor feigning profound absorption in work watched furtively with keenest interest for even within limit of three gas plattner practical chemistry be understand temerarious be practically unanimous in account of plattner proceeding poured little of green powder into test tube tried substance with water hydrochloric acid nitric acid sulphuric acid in succession getting result emptied out little heap nearly bottleful in fact upon slate tried match held medicine bottle in left hand stuff began to smoke melt then exploded with deafening violence blinding flash five boy seeing flash being prepared for catastrophe ducked below desk be none of seriously hurt window be blown out into playground blackboard on easel be upset slate be smashed to atom plaster fell from ceiling other damage be done to school edifice appliance boy at first seeing nothing of plattner fancied be knocked down lying out of sight below desk jumped out of place to go to assistance be amazed to find space empty being still confused by sudden violence of report hurried to open door under impression that must have be hurt have rushed out of room carson foremost nearly collided in doorway with principal mr lidgett mr lidgett be corpulent excitable man with one eye boy describe a stumbling into room mouthing of tempered expletive irritable schoolmaster accustom to use lest worse befall wretched mumchancer said where mr plattner boy be agreed on very word wobbler snivelling puppy mumchancer be seems among ordinary small change of mr lidgett scholastic commerce where mr plattner be question be to be repeated many time in next few day really seemed a though frantic hyperbole blown to atom have for once realised there be not visible particle of plattner to be seen not drop of blood stitch of clothing to be found apparently have be blown clean out of existence left not wrack behind not so much a must cover sixpenny piece to quote proverbial expression evidence of absolute disappearance a consequence of explosion be indubitable be not necessary to enlarge here upon commotion excited in sussexville proprietary school in sussexville elsewhere by event be quite possible indeed that of reader of page may recall hearing of remote dying version of excitement during last summer holiday lidgett must seem did everything in power to suppress minimise story instituted penalty of twenty five line for mention of plattner name among boy stated in schoolroom that be clearly aware of assistant whereabouts be afraid explains that possibility of explosion happening in spite of elaborate precaution taken to minimise practical teaching of chemistry might injure reputation of school so might mysterious quality in plattner departure indeed did everything in power to make occurrence seem a ordinary a possible in particular cross examined five eye witness of occurrence so searchingly that began to doubt plain evidence of sens in spite of effort tale in magnified distorted state made nine day wonder in district several parent withdrew son on colourable pretext not least remarkable point in matter be fact that large number of people in neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dream of plattner during period of excitement before return that dream have curious uniformity in almost of plattner be seen sometimes singly sometimes in company wandering about through coruscating iridescence in case face be pale distressed in gesticulated towards dreamer one two of boy evidently under influence of nightmare fancied that plattner approached with remarkable swiftness seemed to look closely into very eye others fled with plattner from pursuit of vague extraordinary creature of globular shape fancy be forgotten in inquiry speculation when on wednesday next one after monday of explosion plattner returned circumstance of return be a singular a of departure so far a mr lidgett somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from plattner hesitating statement must appear that on wednesday evening towards hour of sunset former gentleman having dismissed evening preparation be engaged in garden picking eating strawberry fruit of be inordinately fond be large old fashioned garden secured from observation fortunately by high ivy covered red brick wall just a be stooping over particularly prolific plant there be flash in air heavy thud before must look round heavy body struck violently from behind be pitched forward crushing strawberry held in hand that so roughly that silk hat mr lidgett adheres to older idea of scholastic costume be driven violently down upon forehead almost over one eye heavy missile slid over sideways collapsed into sitting posture among strawberry plant proved to be long lost mr gottfried plattner in extremely dishevelled condition be collarless hatless linen be dirty there be blood upon hand mr lidgett be so indignant surprised that remained on four with hat jammed down on eye while expostulated vehemently with plattner for disrespectful unaccountable conduct scarcely idyllic scene completes what may call exterior version of plattner story exoteric aspect be quite unnecessary to enter here into detail of dismissal by mr lidgett such detail with full name date reference will be found in larger report of occurrence be laid before society for investigation of abnormal phenomenon singular transposition of plattner right left side be scarcely observed for first day so then first in connection with disposition to write from right to left across blackboard concealed rather than ostended curious confirmatory circumstance a considered must unfavourably affect prospect in new situation displacement of heart be discovered month after when be having tooth extracted under anaesthetic then very unwillingly allowed cursory surgical examination to be made of with view to brief account in journal of anatomy exhaust statement of material fact may now go on to consider plattner account of matter first let clearly differentiate between preceding portion of story what be to follow have told thus far be established by such evidence a even criminal lawyer must approve one of witness be still alive reader if have leisure may hunt lad out tomorrow even brave terror of redoubtable lidgett cross examine trap test to heart content gottfried plattner twisted heart three photograph be producible may be taken a proved that did disappear for nine day a consequence of explosion that returned almost a violently under circumstance in nature annoying to mr lidgett detail of circumstance may be that returned inverted just a reflection return from mirror from last fact a have already stated follows almost inevitably that plattner during nine day must have be in state of existence altogether out of space evidence to statement be indeed far stronger than upon most murderer be hanged for own particular account of where have be with confused explanation well nigh contradictory detail have only mr gottfried plattner word wish to discredit must point out what so many writer upon obscure psychic phenomenon fail to do that be passing here from practically undeniable to kind of matter reasonable man be entitled to believe reject a think proper previous statement render plausible discordance with common experience tilt towards incredible must prefer not to sway beam of reader judgment way simply to tell story a plattner told gave narrative may state at house at chislehurst so soon a have left that evening went into study wrote down everything a remembered subsequently be good enough to read over type written copy so that substantial correctness be undeniable state that at moment of explosion distinctly thought be killed felt lifted off foot driven forcibly backward be curious fact for psychologist that thought clearly during backward flight wondered whether must hit chemistry cupboard blackboard easel heel struck ground staggered fell heavily into sitting position on something soft firm for moment concussion stunned became aware at once of vivid scent of singed hair seemed to hear voice of lidgett asking for will understand for time mind be greatly confused at first be distinctly under impression that be still in classroom perceived quite distinctly surprise of boy entry of mr lidgett be quite positive upon score did not hear remark that ascribed to deafening effect of experiment thing about seemed curiously dark faint mind explained that on obvious mistaken idea that explosion have engendered huge volume of dark smoke through dimness figure of lidgett boy moved a faint silent a ghost plattner face still tingled with stinging heat of flash be say muddled first definite thought seem to have be of personal safety thought be perhaps blinded deafened felt limb face in gingerly manner then perception grew clearer be astonished to miss old familiar desk other schoolroom furniture about only dim uncertain grey shape stood in place of then came thing made shout aloud awoke stunned faculty to instant activity two of boy gesticulating walked one after other clean through neither manifested slightest consciousness of presence be difficult to imagine sensation felt came against say with more force than wisp of mist plattner first thought after be that be dead having be brought up with thoroughly sound view in matter however be little surprised to find body still about second conclusion be that be not dead that others be that explosion have destroyed sussexville proprietary school soul in except that too be scarcely satisfactory be thrown back upon astonished observation everything about be extraordinarily dark at first seemed to have altogether ebony blackness overhead be black firmament only touch of light in scene be faint greenish glow at edge of sky in one direction threw into prominence horizon of undulating black hill say be impression at first a eye grew accustomed to darkness began to distinguish faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in circumambient night against background furniture occupant of classroom seems stood out like phosphorescent spectre faint impalpable extended hand thrust without effort through wall of room by fireplace describes a making strenuous effort to attract attention shouted to lidgett tried to seize boy a went to fro only desisted from attempt when mr lidgett whom a assistant master naturally disliked entered room say sensation of being in world yet not part of be extraordinarily disagreeable one compared feeling not inaptly to of cat watching mouse through window whenever made motion to communicate with dim familiar world about found invisible incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse then turned attention to solid environment found medicine bottle still unbroken in hand with remainder of green powder therein put in pocket began to feel about apparently be sitting on boulder of rock covered with velvety moss dark country about be unable to see faint misty picture of schoolroom blotting out have feeling due perhaps to cold wind that be near crest of hill that steep valley fell away beneath foot green glow along edge of sky seemed to be growing in extent intensity stood up rubbing eye must seem that made few step going steeply down hill then stumbled nearly fell sat down again upon jagged mass of rock to watch dawn became aware that world about be absolutely silent be a still a be dark though there be cold wind blowing up hill face rustle of grass soughing of bough must have accompanied be absent must hear therefore if must not see that hillside upon stood be rocky desolate green grew brighter moment a did so faint transparent blood red mingled with did not mitigate blackness of sky overhead rocky desolation about having regard to what follows be inclined to think that redness may have be optical effect due to contrast something black fluttered momentarily against livid yellow green of lower sky then thin penetrating voice of bell rose out of black gulf below oppressive expectation grew with growing light be probable that hour more elapsed while sat there strange green light growing brighter moment spreading slowly in flamboyant finger upward towards zenith a grew spectral vision of world became relatively absolutely fainter probably for time must have be about of earthly sunset so far a vision of world went plattner by few step downhill have passed through floor of classroom be now seemed sitting in mid air in larger schoolroom downstairs saw boarder distinctly much more faintly than have seen lidgett be preparing evening task noticed with interest that several be cheating with euclid rider by mean of crib compilation whose existence have hitherto never suspected a time passed faded steadily a steadily a light of green dawn increased looking down into valley saw that light have crept far down rocky side that profound blackness of abyss be now broken by minute green glow like light of glow worm almost immediately limb of huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over basaltic undulation of distant hill monstrous hill mass about came out gaunt desolate in green light deep ruddy black shadow became aware of vast number of ball shaped object drifting a thistledown drift over high ground there be none of nearer to than opposite side of gorge bell below twanged quicker quicker with something like impatient insistence several light moved hither thither boy at work at desk be now almost imperceptibly faint extinction of world when green sun of other universe rose be curious point upon plattner insists during other world night be difficult to move about on account of vividness with thing of world be visible becomes riddle to explain why if be case in world catch glimpse of other world be due perhaps to comparatively vivid illumination of world of ours plattner describes midday of other world at brightest a not being nearly so bright a world at full moon while night be profoundly black consequently amount of light even in ordinary dark room be sufficient to render thing of other world invisible on same principle that faint phosphorescence be only visible in profoundest darkness have tried since told story to see something of other world by sitting for long space in photographer dark room at night have certainly seen indistinctly form of greenish slope rock only must admit very indistinctly indeed reader may possibly be more successful plattner tell that since return have dreamt seen recognised place in other world be probably due to memory of scene seems quite possible that people with unusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch glimpse of strange other world about however be digression a green sun rose long street of black building became perceptible though only darkly indistinctly in gorge after hesitation plattner began to clamber down precipitous descent towards descent be long exceedingly tedious being so not only by extraordinary steepness also by reason of looseness of boulder with whole face of hill be strewn noise of descent now then heel struck fire from rock seemed now only sound in universe for beating of bell have ceased a drew nearer perceived that various edifice have singular resemblance to tomb mausoleum monument saving only that be uniformly black instead of being white a most sepulchre be then saw crowding out of largest building very much a people disperse from church number of pallid rounded pale green figure dispersed in several direction about broad street of place going through side alley reappearing upon steepness of hill others entering of small black building lined way at sight of thing drifting up towards plattner stopped staring be not walking be indeed limbless have appearance of human head beneath tadpole like body swung be too astonished at strangeness too full indeed of strangeness to be seriously alarmed by drove towards in front of chill wind be blowing uphill much a soap bubble drive before draught a looked at nearest of approaching saw be indeed human head albeit with singularly large eye wearing such expression of distress anguish a have never seen before upon mortal countenance be surprised to find that did not turn to regard seemed to be watching following unseen moving thing for moment be puzzled then occurred to that creature be watching with enormous eye something be happening in world have just left nearer came nearer be too astonished to cry out made very faint fretting sound a came close to then struck face with gentle pat touch be very cold drove past upward towards crest of hill extraordinary conviction flashed across plattner mind that head have strong likeness to lidgett then turned attention to other head be now swarming thickly up hillside none made slightest sign of recognition one two indeed came close to head almost followed example of first dodged convulsively out of way upon most of saw same expression of unavailing regret have seen upon first heard same faint sound of wretchedness from one two wept one rolling swiftly uphill wore expression of diabolical rage others be cold several have look of gratified interest in eye one at least be almost in ecstasy of happiness plattner doe not remember that recognised more likeness in saw at time for several hour perhaps plattner watched strange thing dispersing over hill not till long after have ceased to issue from clustering black building in gorge did resume downward climb darkness about increased so much that have difficulty in stepping true overhead sky be now bright pale green felt hunger thirst later when did found chilly stream running down centre of gorge rare moss upon boulder when tried at last in desperation be good to eat groped about among tomb ran down gorge seeking vaguely for clue to inexplicable thing after long time came to entrance of big mausoleum like building from head have issued in found group of green light burning upon kind of basaltic altar bell rope from belfry overhead hanging down into centre of place round wall ran lettering of fire in character unknown to while be still wondering at purport of thing heard receding tramp of heavy foot echoing far down street ran out into darkness again must see nothing have mind to pull bell rope finally decided to follow footstep although ran far never overtook shouting be of avail gorge seemed to extend interminable distance be a dark a earthly starlight throughout length while ghastly green day lay along upper edge of precipice there be none of head now below be seemed busily occupied along upper slope looking up saw drifting hither thither hovering stationary flying swiftly through air reminded said of big snowflake only be black pale green in pursuing firm undeviating footstep that never overtook in groping into new region of endless devil dyke in clambering up down pitiless height in wandering about summit in watching drifting face plattner state that spent better part of seven eight day did not keep count say though once twice found eye watching have word with living soul slept among rock on hillside in gorge thing earthly be invisible because from earthly standpoint be far underground on altitude so soon a earthly day began world became visible to found sometimes stumbling over dark green rock arresting on precipitous brink while about green branch of sussexville lane be swaying again seemed to be walking through sussexville street watching unseen private business of household then be discovered that to almost human being in world there pertained of drifting head everyone in world be watched intermittently by helpless disembodiments what be watcher of living plattner never learned two presently found followed be like childhood memory of father mother now then other face turned eye upon eye like of dead people who have swayed injured helped in youth manhood whenever looked at plattner be overcome with strange sense of responsibility to mother ventured to speak made answer looked sadly steadfastly tenderly little reproachfully too seemed into eye simply tell story doe not endeavour to explain be left to surmise who watcher of living may be if be indeed dead why must so closely passionately watch world have left for ever may be indeed to mind seems just when life have closed when evil good be no longer choice for may still have to witness working out of train of consequence have laid if human soul continue after death then surely human interest continue after death be merely own guess at meaning of thing seen plattner offer interpretation for none be given be well reader must understand clearly day after day with head reeling wandered about strange lit world outside world weary towards end weak hungry by day by earthly day be ghostly vision of old familiar scenery of sussexville about irked worried must not see where to put foot ever again with chilly touch one of watching soul must come against face after dark multitude of watcher about intent distress confused mind beyond describing great longing to return to earthly life be so near yet so remote consumed unearthliness of thing about produced positively painful mental distress be worried beyond describing by own particular follower must shout at to desist from staring at scold at hurry away from be always mute intent run a might over uneven ground followed destiny on ninth day towards evening plattner heard invisible footstep approaching far away down gorge be then wandering over broad crest of same hill upon have fallen in entry into strange other world of turned to hurry down into gorge feeling way hastily be arrested by sight of thing be happening in room in back street near school of people in room knew by sight window be open blind up setting sun shone clearly into so that came out quite brightly at first vivid oblong of room lying like magic lantern picture upon black landscape livid green dawn in addition to sunlight candle have just be lit in room on bed lay lank man ghastly white face terrible upon tumbled pillow clenched hand be raised above head little table beside bed carried few medicine bottle toast water empty glass now then lank man lip fell apart to indicate word must not articulate woman did not notice that wanted anything because be busy turning out paper from old fashioned bureau in opposite corner of room at first picture be very vivid indeed a green dawn behind grew brighter brighter so became fainter more more transparent a echoing footstep paced nearer nearer footstep sound so loud in other world come so silently in plattner perceived about great multitude of dim face gathering together out of darkness watching two people in room never before have seen so many of watcher of living multitude have eye only for sufferer in room multitude in infinite anguish watched woman a hunted with greedy eye for something must not find crowded about plattner came across sight buffeted face noise of unavailing regret be about saw clearly only now then at other time picture quivered dimly through veil of green reflection upon movement in room must have be very still plattner say candle flame streamed up into perfectly vertical line of smoke in ear footfall echo beat like clap of thunder face two more particularly near woman one woman also white clear featured face might have once be cold hard be now softened by touch of wisdom strange to earth other might have be woman father be evidently absorbed in contemplation of act of hateful meanness so seemed must no longer guard against prevent behind be others teacher may be who have taught ill friend whose influence have failed over man too multitude none seemed to be parent teacher face might once have be coarse now purged to strength by sorrow in forefront one face girlish one angry remorseful merely patient weary a seemed to plattner waiting for relief power of description fail at memory of multitude of ghastly countenance gathered on stroke of bell saw in space of second must seem that be so worked on by excitement that quite involuntarily restless finger took bottle of green powder out of pocket held before doe not remember that abruptly footstep ceased waited for next there be silence then suddenly cutting through unexpected stillness like keen thin blade came first stroke of bell at that multitudinous face swayed to fro louder cry began about woman did not hear be burning something now in candle flame at second stroke everything grew dim breath of wind icy cold blew through host of watcher swirled about like eddy of dead leaf in spring at third stroke something be extended through to bed have heard of beam of light be like beam of darkness looking again at plattner saw that be shadowy arm hand green sun be now topping black desolation of horizon vision of room be very faint plattner must see that white of bed struggled be convulsed that woman looked round over shoulder at startled cloud of watcher lifted high like puff of green dust before wind swept swiftly downward towards temple in gorge then suddenly plattner understood meaning of shadowy black arm stretched across shoulder clutched prey did not dare turn head to see shadow behind arm with violent effort covering eye set to run made perhaps twenty stride then slipped on boulder fell fell forward on hand bottle smashed exploded a touched ground in moment found stunned bleeding sitting face to face with lidgett in old walled garden behind school there story of plattner experience end have resisted believe successfully natural disposition of writer of fiction to dress up incident of sort have told thing a far a possible in order in plattner told to have carefully avoided attempt at style effect construction must have be easy for instance to have worked scene of death bed into kind of plot in plattner might have be involved quite apart from objectionableness of falsifying most extraordinary true story such trite device must spoil to mind peculiar effect of dark world with livid green illumination drifting watcher of living unseen unapproachable to be yet lying about remains to add that death did actually occur in vincent terrace just beyond school garden so far a can be proved at moment of plattner return deceased be rate collector insurance agent widow who be much younger than married last month mr whymper veterinary surgeon of allbeeding a portion of story given here have in various form circulated orally in sussexville have consented to use of name on condition make distinctly known that emphatically contradicts detail of plattner account of husband last moment burnt will say although plattner never accused of doing so husband made one will just after marriage certainly from man who have never seen be account of furniture of room be curiously accurate one other thing even at risk of irksome repetition must insist upon lest seem to favour credulous superstitious view plattner absence from world for nine day be think proved that doe not prove story be quite conceivable that even outside space hallucination may be possible that at least reader must bear distinctly in mind argonaut of air one saw monson flying machine from window of train passing either along south western main line along line between wimbledon worcester park to be more exact one saw huge scaffolding limited flight of apparatus rose over

with utter contempt for journalistic wit ignorance have irritated hampered predecessor have spent be said rather more than immense fortune upon experiment result to impatient generation seemed inconsiderable when five year have passed after growth of colossal iron grove at worcester park monson still failed to put in fluttering appearance over trafalgar square even isle of wight tripper

steering diminished in number day by day too money trickled away until balance be no longer matter of hundred of thousand of ten at last came anniversary monson sitting in little drawing shed suddenly noticed date on woodhouse calendar be five year ago to day that began said to woodhouse suddenly be said woodhouse be alteration play devil with said monson biting paper fastener drawing for new van

made rose up close by machine be hidden by upper edge of window through grove of iron pillar red painted ornate with row of bolt one have glimpse of pretty scenery towards train went gliding noiselessly across middle distance rattle drowned by hammering of workman overhead monson must imagine grinning face at window of carriage swore savagely under breath dabbed viciously at blowfly

impulsively extended hand thanks said right said woodhouse gripping hand with queer softening of feature trust then men turned to big apparatus lay with flat wing extended upon carrier stared at

petroleum engine for screw navigator sat deep in canoe like recess foremost one steering being protected by low screen with two plate glass window from blinding rush of air on side monstrous flat framework with curved front border must be adjusted so a to lie horizontally to be tilted upward down wing worked rigidly together by releasing pin one must be tilted through small angle independently of fellow front edge of wing must also be shifted back so a to diminish wing area about one sixth machine be not only not designed to hover be also incapable of fluttering monson idea be to get into air with initial rush of apparatus then to skim much a playing card may be skimmed keeping up rush by mean of screw at stern rook gull fly enormous distance in way with scarcely perceptible movement of wing bird really drive along on aerial switchback glide slanting downward for space until have gained considerable momentum then altering inclination of wing glide up again almost to original

south western season ticket holder one to seaside excursionist saturday to monday tripper from sussex hampshire dorset devon eminent literary people from hazlemere remarked eagerly one to will be off day a familiar scaffolding came in sight actually one bright morning in full view of ten past ten train from basingstoke monson flying machine started on journey saw carrier running swiftly along rail white gold screw spinning in air heard rapid rumble of wheel thud a carrier reached buffer at end of run then whirr a flying machine be shot forward into network that majority of have seen heard before thing went with drooping flight through framework rose again then beholder shouted screamed yelled shrieked after kind for instead of customary concussion stoppage flying machine flew out of five year cage like bolt from crossbow drove slantingly upward into air curved round little so a to cross line soared in direction of wimbledon common seemed to hang momentarily in air grow smaller then ducked vanished over clustering blue tree top to east of coombe hill one stopped staring gasping until long after have disappeared that be what people in train from basingstoke saw if have drawn line down middle of train from engine to guard van must not have found living soul on opposite side to flying machine be mad rush from window to window a thing crossed line engine driver stoker never took eye off low hill about wimbledon never noticed that have run clean through coombe maiden raynes park until with returning animation found pelting at most indecent pace into wimbledon station from moment when monson have started carrier with now woodhouse said word men sat with clenched teeth monson have crossed line with curve be too sharp woodhouse have opened shut white lip spoke woodhouse simply gripped seat breathed sharply through teeth watching blue country to west rushing past down away from monson knelt at post forward hand trembled on spoked wheel moved wing must see nothing before mass of white cloud in sky machine went slanting upward travelling with enormous speed still losing momentum moment land ran away underneath with diminishing speed now said woodhouse at last with violent effort monson wrenched over wheel altered angle of wing machine seemed to hang for minute motionless in mid air then saw hazy blue house covered hill of kilburn hampstead jump up before eye rise steadily until little sunlit dome of albert hall appeared through window for moment scarcely understood meaning of upward rush of horizon a nearer nearer house came into view realised what have done have turned wing over too far be swooping steeply downward towards thames thought question realisation be business of second of time too much gasped woodhouse monson brought wheel half way back with jerk forthwith kilburn hampstead ridge dropped again to lower edge of window have be thousand foot above coombe maiden station fifty second after whizzed at frightful pace not eighty foot above east putney station on metropolitan district line to screaming astonishment of platformful of people monson flung up van against air over fulham rushed up atmospheric switchback again steeply too steeply 'buses went floundering across fulham road people yelled then down again too steeply still distant tree house about primrose hill leapt up across monson window then suddenly saw straight before greenery of kensington garden tower of imperial institute be driving straight down upon south kensington pinnacle of natural history museum rushed up into view there came one fatal second of swift thought moment of hesitation must try clear tower swerve eastward made hesitating attempt to release right wing left catch half released gave frantic clutch at wheel nose of machine seemed to leap up before wheel pressed hand with irresistible force jerked out of control woodhouse sitting crouched together gave hoarse cry sprang up towards monson too far cried then be clinging to gunwale for dear life monson have be jerked clean overhead be falling backwards upon so swiftly have thing happened that barely quarter of people going to fro in hyde park brompton road exhibition road saw anything of aerial catastrophe distant winged shape have appeared above clustering house to south have fallen risen growing larger a did so have swooped swiftly down towards imperial institute broad spread of flying wing have swept round in quarter circle dashed eastward then suddenly sprang vertically into air black object shot out of came spinning downward man two men clutching other came whirling down separated a struck roof of student club bounded off into green bush on southward side for perhaps minute pointed stem of big machine still pierced vertically upward screw spinning

furniture stood out in a vague blot of absolute darkness stared with eye just over bedclothes came into mind that someone have entered room to rob of rouleau of money after lying for moment breathing regularly to simulate sleep realised be mere fancy nevertheless uneasy assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of with effort raised head from pillow peered about at dark what be must not conceive

high pressure water must hit a hard a bullet must simply smash flatten must tear down throat into lung must blow in ear what detailed imagination have protested steevens who saw thing vividly be simple statement of inevitable said lieutenant globe must just give out few little bubble must settle down comfortably against day of judgment among ooze bottom clay with poor elstead spread over own smashed cushion like butter over bread repeated sentence a though liked very much like butter over bread said having look at jigger said voice elstead stood behind spick span in white with cigarette between teeth eye smiling out of shadow of ample hat brim what be about bread butter weybridge grumbling a usual about insufficient pay of naval officer wo be more than day now before start be to get sling ready to day clean sky gentle swell be just kind of thing for swinging off dozen ton of lead iron be wo affect much said weybridge seventy eighty foot down will be there in dozen second there be not particle moving though wind shriek hoarse up above water lift halfway to cloud down there moved to side of ship other two followed three leant forward on elbow stared down into yellow green water peace said elstead finishing thought aloud be dead certain that clockwork will act asked weybridge presently have worked thirty five time said elstead be bound to work if doe why must must go down in confounded thing said weybridge for twenty thousand pound cheerful chap be said elstead spat sociably at bubble below understand yet how mean to work thing said steevens in first place be screwed into sphere said elstead when have turned electric light off on three time to show be cheerful be swung out over stern by crane with big lead sinker slung below top lead weight have roller carrying hundred fathom of strong cord rolled up be join sinker to sphere except sling will be cut when affair be dropped use cord rather than wire rope because be easier to cut more buoyant necessary point a will see through of lead weight notice there be hole iron rod will be run through will project six foot on lower side if rod be rammed up from below knock up lever set clockwork in motion at side of cylinder on cord wind very well whole affair be lowered gently into water sling be cut sphere float with air in be lighter than water lead weight go down straight cord run out when cord be paid out sphere will go down too pulled down by cord why cord asked steevens why not fasten weight directly to sphere because of smash down below whole affair will go rushing down mile after mile at headlong pace at last must be knocked to piece on bottom if be for cord weight will hit bottom directly do buoyancy of sphere will come into play will go on sinking slower slower come to stop at last then begin to float upward again that be where clockwork come in directly weight smash against sea bottom rod will be knocked through will kick up clockwork cord will be rewound on reel will be lugged down to sea bottom there will stay for hour with electric light on looking about then clockwork will release spring knife cord will be cut up will rush again like soda water bubble cord will help flotation if must chance to hit ship said weybridge must come up at pace must go clean through said elstead like cannon ball need worry about suppose nimble crustacean must wriggle into clockwork must be pressing sort of invitation for to stop said elstead turning back on water staring at sphere have swung elstead overboard by eleven o'clock day be serenely bright calm with horizon lost in haze electric glare in little upper compartment beamed cheerfully three time then let down slowly to surface of water sailor in stern chain hung ready to cut tackle held lead weight sphere together globe have looked so large on deck looked smallest thing conceivable under stern of ship rolled little two dark window floated uppermost seemed like eye turned up in round wonderment at people who crowded rail voice wondered how elstead liked rolling be ready sang out commander ay ay sir then let go rope of tackle tightened against blade be cut eddy rolled over globe in grotesquely helpless fashion someone waved handkerchief someone else tried ineffectual cheer middy be counting slowly eight nine ten roll then with jerk splash thing righted seemed to be stationary for moment to grow rapidly smaller then water closed over became visible enlarged by refraction dimmer below surface before one must count three have disappeared there be flicker of white light far down in water diminished to speck vanished then there be nothing depth of water going down into blackness through shark be swimming then suddenly screw of cruiser began to rotate water be crickled shark disappeared in wrinkled confusion torrent of foam rushed across crystalline clearness have swallowed up elstead what be idee said one ab to be going to lay off about couple of mile 'fear must hit when come up said mate ship steamed slowly to new position aboard almost everyone who be unoccupied remained watching breathing swell into sphere have sunk for next half hour be doubtful if word be spoken that did not bear directly indirectly on elstead december sun be now high in sky heat very considerable will be cold enough down there said weybridge say that below certain depth sea water always just about freezing where will come up asked steevens have lost bearing be spot said commander who prided on omniscience extended precise finger south eastward reckon be pretty nearly moment said be be thirty five minute how long doe take to reach bottom of ocean asked steevens for depth of five mile reckoning a did acceleration of two foot per second way be just about three quarter of minute then be overdue said weybridge pretty nearly said commander suppose take few minute for cord of to wind in forgot said weybridge evidently relieved then began suspense minute slowly dragged out sphere shot out of water followed nothing broke low oily swell sailor explained to one little point about winding in of cord rigging be dotted with expectant face come up elstead called one hairy chested salt impatiently others caught up shouted a though be waiting for curtain of theatre to rise commander glanced irritably at of course if acceleration le than two said will be longer be absolutely certain be proper figure be slavish believer in calculation steevens agreed concisely one on quarter deck spoke for couple of minute then steevens watchcase clicked when twenty one minute after sun reached zenith be still waiting for globe to reappear not man aboard have dared to whisper that hope be dead be weybridge who first gave expression to realisation spoke while sound of eight bell still hung in air always distrusted that window said quite suddenly to steevens good god said steevens think well said weybridge left rest to imagination be great believer in calculation said commander dubiously so be not altogether hopeless yet at midnight gunboat be steaming slowly in spiral round spot where globe have sunk white beam of electric light fled halted swept discontentedly onward again over waste of phosphorescent water under little star if window have burst smashed said weybridge then be cursed sight worse for clockwork have gone wrong be alive now five mile under foot down there in cold dark anchored in little bubble of where never ray of light have shone human being lived since water be gathered together be there without food feeling hungry thirsty scared wondering whether will starve stifle will be myers apparatus be running out suppose how long do last good heaven exclaimed what little thing be what daring little devil down there mile mile of water water empty water about sky gulf threw hand out a did so little white streak swept noiselessly up sky travelled more slowly stopped became motionless dot a though new star have fallen up into sky then went sliding back again lost amidst reflection of star white haze of sea phosphorescence at sight stopped arm extended mouth open shut mouth opened again waved arm with impatient gesture then turned shouted el stead ahoy to first watch went at run to lindley search light saw said starboard there light on be just shot out of water bring light round ought to see drifting when lift on swell never picked up explorer until dawn then almost ran down crane be swung out boat crew hooked chain to sphere when have shipped sphere unscrewed manhole peered into darkness of interior for electric light chamber be intended to illuminate water about sphere be shut off entirely from general cavity air be very hot within cavity indiarubber at lip of manhole be soft there be answer to eager question sound of movement within elstead seemed to be lying motionless crumpled up in bottom of globe ship doctor crawled in lifted out to men outside for moment so did not know whether elstead be alive dead face in yellow light of ship lamp glistened with perspiration carried down to own cabin be not dead found in state of absolute nervous collapse besides cruelly bruised for day have to lie perfectly still be week before must tell experience almost first word be that be going down again sphere must have to be altered said in order to allow to throw off cord if need be be have have most marvellous experience thought must find nothing ooze said laughed at exploration have discovered new world told story in disconnected fragment chiefly from wrong end so that be impossible to re tell in word what follows be narrative of experience began atrociously said before cord ran out thing kept rolling over felt like frog in football must see nothing crane sky overhead with occasional glimpse of people on ship rail must tell bit way thing must roll next suddenly must find foot going up try to step over went rolling head over heel just anyhow on padding other shape must have be more comfortable other shape be to be relied upon under huge pressure of nethermost abyss suddenly swaying ceased globe righted when have picked up saw water about greeny blue with attenuated light filtering down from above shoal of little floating thing went rushing up past a seemed to towards light even a looked grew darker darker until water above be a dark a midnight sky albeit of greener shade water below black little transparent thing in water developed faint glint of luminosity shot past in faint greenish streak feeling of falling be just like start of lift said only kept on one have to imagine what mean that keeping on be then of time elstead repented of adventure saw chance against in altogether new light thought of big cuttlefish people knew to exist in middle water kind of thing find half digested in whale at time floating dead rotten half eaten by fish suppose one caught hold must let go have clockwork really be sufficiently tested whether wanted to go on to go back mattered not slightest now in fifty second everything be a black a night outside except where beam from light struck through water picked out now then fish scrap of sinking matter flashed by too fast for to see what be once think passed shark then sphere began to get hot by friction against water have underestimated seems first thing noticed be that be perspiring then heard hissing growing louder under foot saw lot of little bubble very little bubble be rushing upward like fan through water outside steam felt window be hot turned on minute glow lamp lit own cavity looked at padded watch by stud saw have be travelling now for two minute came into head that window must crack through conflict of temperature for knew bottom water be very near freezing then suddenly floor of sphere seemed to press against foot rush of bubble outside grew slower slower hissing diminished sphere rolled little window have not cracked nothing have given knew that danger of sinking at anyrate be over in minute so must be on floor of abyss thought said of steevens weybridge rest of five mile overhead higher to than very highest cloud that ever floated over land be to steaming slowly staring down wondering what have happened to peered out of window there be more bubble now hissing have stopped outside there be heavy blackness a black a black velvet except where electric light pierced empty water showed colour of yellow green then three thing like shape of fire swam into sight following other through water whether be little near big far off must not tell be outlined in bluish light almost a bright a light of fishing smack light seemed to be smoking greatly along side of be speck of like lighter porthole of ship phosphorescence seemed to go out a came into radiance of lamp saw then that be little fish of strange sort with huge head vast eye dwindling body tail eye be turned towards judged be following down supposed be attracted by glare presently others of same sort joined a went on down noticed that water became of pallid colour little speck twinkled in ray like mote in sunbeam be probably due to cloud of ooze mud that impact of leaden sinker have disturbed by time be drawn down to lead weight be in dense fog of white that electric light failed altogether to pierce for more than few yard many minute elapsed before hanging sheet of sediment subsided to extent then lit by light by transient phosphorescence of distant shoal of fish be able to see under huge blackness of super incumbent water undulating expanse of greyish white ooze broken here there by tangled thicket of growth of sea lily waving hungry tentacle in air farther away be graceful translucent outline of group of gigantic sponge about floor there be scattered number of bristling flattish tuft of rich purple black decided must be sort of sea urchin small large eyed blind thing having curious resemblance to woodlouse others to lobster crawled sluggishly across track of light vanished into obscurity again leaving furrowed trail behind then suddenly hovering swarm of little fish veered about came towards a flight of starling might do passed over like phosphorescent snow then saw behind larger creature advancing towards sphere at first must see only dimly faintly moving figure remotely suggestive of walking man then came into spray of light that lamp shot out a glare struck shut eye dazzled stared in rigid astonishment be strange vertebrated animal dark purple head be dimly suggestive of chameleon have high forehead braincase a reptile ever displayed before vertical pitch of face gave most extraordinary resemblance to human being two large protruding eye projected from socket in chameleon fashion have broad reptilian mouth with horny lip beneath little nostril in position of ear be two huge gill cover out of floated branching tree of coralline filament almost like tree like gill very young ray shark posse humanity of face be not most extraordinary thing about creature be biped almost globular body be poised on tripod of two frog like leg long thick tail fore limb grotesquely caricatured human hand much a frog do carried long shaft of bone tipped with copper colour of creature be variegated head hand leg be purple skin hung loosely upon even a clothes might do be phosphorescent grey stood there blinded by light at last unknown creature of abyss blinked eye open shading with disengaged hand opened mouth gave vent to shouting noise articulate almost a speech might be that penetrated even steel case padded jacket of sphere how shouting may be accomplished without lung elstead doe not profess to explain then moved sideways out of glare into mystery of shadow bordered on side elstead felt rather than saw that be coming towards fancying light have attracted turned switch cut off current in moment something soft dabbed upon steel globe swayed then shouting be repeated seemed to that distant echo answered dabbing recurred globe swayed ground against spindle over wire be rolled stood in blackness peered out into everlasting night of abyss presently saw very faint remote other phosphorescent quasi human form hurrying towards hardly knowing what did felt about in swaying prison for stud of exterior electric light came by accident against own small glow lamp in padded recess sphere twisted then threw down heard shout like shout of surprise when rose to foot saw two pair of stalked eye peering into lower window reflecting light in moment hand be dabbing vigorously at steel casing there be sound horrible enough in position of metal protection of clockwork being vigorously hammered that indeed sent heart into mouth for if strange creature succeeded in stopping that release must never occur scarcely have thought a much when felt sphere sway violently floor of press hard against foot turned off small glow lamp lit interior sent ray of large light in separate compartment out into water sea floor man like creature have disappeared couple of fish chasing other dropped suddenly by window thought at once that strange denizen of deep sea have broken rope that have escaped drove up faster faster then stopped with jerk sent flying against padded roof of prison for minute perhaps be too astonished to think then felt that sphere be spinning slowly rocking seemed to that be also being drawn through water by crouching close to window managed to make weight effective roll that part of sphere downward must see nothing save pale ray of light striking down ineffectively into darkness occurred to that must see more if turned lamp off allowed eye to grow accustomed to profound obscurity in be wise after minute velvety blackness became translucent blackness then far away a faint a zodiacal light of english summer evening saw shape moving below judged creature have detached cable be towing along sea bottom then saw something faint remote across undulation of submarine plain broad horizon of pale luminosity extended way way a far a range of little window permitted to see to be being towed a balloon might be towed by men out of open country into town approached very slowly very slowly dim irradiation be gathered together into more definite shape be nearly five o'clock before came over luminous area by time must make out arrangement suggestive of street house grouped about vast roofless erection be grotesquely suggestive of ruined abbey be spread out like map below house be roofless enclosure of wall substance being a afterwards saw of phosphorescent bone gave place appearance a if be built of drowned moonshine among inner cave of place waving tree of crinoid stretched tentacle tall slender glassy sponge shot like shining minaret lily of filmy light out of general glow of city in open space of place must see stirring movement a of crowd of people be too many fathom above to distinguish individual in crowd then slowly pulled down a did so detail of place crept slowly upon apprehension saw that course of cloudy building be marked out with beaded line of round object then perceived that at several point below in broad open space be form like encrusted shape of ship slowly surely be drawn down form below became brighter clearer more distinct be being pulled down perceived towards large building in centre of town must catch glimpse ever again of multitudinous form be lugging at cord be astonished to see that rigging of one of ship formed prominent feature of place be crowded with host of gesticulating figure regarding then wall of great building rose about silently hid city from eye such wall be of water logged wood twisted wire rope iron spar copper bone skull of dead men skull ran in zigzag line spiral fantastic curve over building in out of eye socket over whole surface of place lurked played multitude of silvery little fish suddenly ear be filled with low shouting noise like violent blowing of horn gave place to fantastic chant down sphere sank past huge pointed window through saw vaguely great number of strange ghostlike people regarding at last came to rest a seemed on kind of altar stood in centre of place now be at such level that must see strange people of abyss plainly once more to astonishment perceived that be prostrating before save one dressed a seemed in robe of placoid scale crowned with luminous diadem who stood with reptilian mouth opening shutting a though led chanting of worshipper curious impulse made elstead turn on small glow lamp again so that became visible to creature of abyss albeit glare made disappear forthwith into night at sudden sight of chanting gave place to tumult of exultant shout elstead being anxious to watch turned light off again vanished from before eye for time be too blind to make out what be doing when at last must distinguish be kneeling again thus continued worshipping without rest intermission for space of three hour most circumstantial be elstead account of astounding city people people of perpetual night who have never seen sun moon star green vegetation living air breathing creature who know nothing of fire light phosphorescent light of living thing startling a be story be yet more startling to find that scientific men of such eminence a adam jenkins find nothing incredible in tell see reason why intelligent water breathing vertebrated creature inured to low temperature enormous pressure of such heavy structure that alive dead must float might not live upon bottom of deep sea quite unsuspected by descendant like ourselves of great theriomorpha of new red sandstone age must be known to however a strange meteoric creature wont to fall catastrophically dead out of mysterious blackness of watery sky not only ourselves ship metal appliance must come raining down out of night sometimes sinking thing must smite down crush a if be judgment of unseen power above sometimes must come thing of utmost rarity utility shape of inspiring suggestion one can understand perhaps something of behaviour at descent of living man if one think what barbaric people might do to whom enhaloed shining creature came suddenly out of sky at one time elstead probably told officer of ptarmigan detail of strange twelve hour in abyss that also intended to write down be certain never did so unhappily have to piece together discrepant fragment of story from reminiscence of commander simmons weybridge steevens lindley others see thing darkly in fragmentary glimpse huge ghostly building bowing chanting people with dark chameleon like head faintly luminous clothing elstead with light turned on again vainly trying to convey to mind that cord by sphere be held be to be severed minute after minute slipped away elstead looking at watch be horrified to find that have oxygen only for four hour more chant in honour kept on a remorselessly a if be marching song of approaching death manner of release doe not understand to judge by end of cord that hung from sphere have be cut through by rubbing against edge of altar abruptly sphere rolled over swept up out of world a ethereal creature clothed in vacuum must sweep through own atmosphere back to native ether again must have torn out of sight a hydrogen bubble hastens upward from air strange ascension must have seemed to sphere rushed up with even greater velocity than when weighted with lead sinker have rushed down became exceedingly hot drove up with window uppermost remembers torrent of bubble frothing against glass moment expected to fly then suddenly something like huge wheel seemed to be released in head padded compartment began spinning about fainted next recollection be of cabin of doctor voice be substance of extraordinary story that elstead related in fragment to officer of ptarmigan promised to write down at later date mind be chiefly occupied with improvement of apparatus be effected at rio remains only to tell on february made second descent into ocean abyss with improvement first experience suggested what happened will probably never know never returned ptarmigan beat about over point of submersion seeking in vain for thirteen day then returned to rio news be telegraphed to friend so matter remains for present be hardly probable that further attempt will be made to verify strange story of hitherto unsuspected city of deep sea apple must get rid of said man in corner of carriage abruptly breaking silence mr hinchcliff looked up hearing imperfectly have be lost in rapt contemplation of college cap tied by string to portmanteau handle outward visible sign of newly gained pedagogic position in rapt appreciation of college cap pleasant anticipation excited for mr hinchcliff have just matriculated at london university be going to be junior assistant at holmwood grammar school very enviable position stared across carriage at fellow traveller why not give away said person give away why not be tall dark sunburnt man with pale face arm be folded tightly foot be on seat in front of be pulling at lank black moustache stared hard at toe why not said mr hinchcliff coughed stranger lifted eye be curious dark grey eye stared blankly at mr hinchcliff for best part of minute perhaps expression grew to interest yes said slowly why not end quite follow be afraid said mr hinchcliff with cough quite follow said stranger quite mechanically singular eye wandering from mr hinchcliff to bag with ostentatiously displayed cap back to mr hinchcliff downy face be so abrupt know apologised mr hinchcliff why must said stranger following thought be student said addressing mr hinchcliff be by correspondence of london university said mr hinchcliff with irrepressible pride feeling nervously at tie in pursuit of knowledge said stranger suddenly took foot off seat put fist on knee stared at mr hinchcliff a though have never seen student before yes said flung out index finger then rose took bag from hat rack unlocked quite silently drew out something round wrapped in quantity of silver paper unfolded carefully held out towards mr hinchcliff small very smooth golden yellow fruit mr hinchcliff eye mouth be open did not offer to take object if be intended to take said fantastic stranger speaking very slowly be apple of tree of knowledge look at small bright wonderful knowledge be going to give to mr hinchcliff mind worked painfully for minute then sufficient explanation mad flashed across brain illuminated whole situation one humoured madman put head little on one side apple of tree of knowledge eigh said mr hinchcliff regarding with finely assumed air of interest then looking at interlocutor want to eat besides how did come by never fade have have now three month be ever bright smooth ripe desirable a see laid hand on knee regarded fruit musingly then began to wrap again in paper a though have abandoned intention of giving away how did come by said mr hinchcliff who have argumentative side how do know that be fruit of tree bought fruit said stranger three month ago for drink of water crust of bread man who gave to because kept life in be armenian armenia wonderful country first of country where ark of flood remains to day buried in glacier of mount ararat man say fleeing with others from kurd who have come upon went up into desolate place among mountain place beyond common knowledge of men fleeing from imminent pursuit came to slope high among mountain peak green with grass like knife blade that cut slashed most pitilessly at anyone who went into kurd be close behind there be nothing for to plunge in worst of be that path made through at price of blood served for kurd to follow one of fugitive be killed save armenian heard scream cry of friend swish of grass about who be pursuing be tall grass rising overhead then shouting answer when presently paused everything be still pushed out again not understanding cut bleeding until came out on steep slope of rock below precipice then saw grass be on fire smoke of rose like veil between enemy stranger paused yes said mr hinchcliff yes there be torn bloody from knife blade of grass rock blazing under afternoon sun sky molten brass smoke of fire driving towards dared not stay there death did not mind torture far away beyond smoke heard shout cry woman screaming so went clambering up gorge in rock everywhere be bush with dry branch stuck out like thorn among leaf until clambered over brow of ridge hid then met companion shepherd who have also escaped counting cold famine thirst a nothing against kurd went on into height among snow ice wandered three whole day third day came vision suppose hungry men often do see vision then there be fruit lifted wrapped globe in hand have heard too from other mountaineer who have known something of legend be in evening time when star be increasing that came down slope of polished rock into huge dark valley set about with strange contorted tree in tree hung little globe like glow worm sphere strange round yellow light suddenly valley be lit far away many mile away far down with golden flame marching slowly athwart made stunted tree against black a night turned slope about figure to likeness of fiery gold at vision knowing legend of mountain instantly knew that be eden saw sentinel of eden fell upon face like men struck dead when dared to look again valley be dark for space then light came again returning burning amber at that shepherd sprang to foot with shout began to run down towards light other man be too fearful to follow stood stunned amazed terrified watching companion recede towards marching glare hardly have shepherd set out when there came noise like thunder beating of invisible wing hurrying up valley great terrible fear at that man who gave fruit turned if might still escape hurrying headlong up slope again with tumult sweeping after stumbled against one of stunted bush ripe fruit came off into hand fruit forthwith wing thunder rolled about fell fainted when came to sens be back among blackened ruin of own village others be attending to wounded vision golden fruit of tree be still clutched in hand there be others there who knew legend knew what that strange fruit might be paused be said be most extraordinary story to be told in third class carriage on sussex railway be a if real be mere veil to fantastic here be fantastic poking through be be mr hinchcliff must say legend said stranger tell that thicket of dwarfed tree growing about garden sprang from apple adam carried in hand when eve be driven forth felt something in hand saw half eaten apple flung petulantly aside there grow in desolate valley girdled round with everlasting snow there fiery sword keep ward against judgment day thought thing be mr hinchcliff paused fable parable rather do mean to tell that there in armenia stranger answered unfinished question with fruit in open hand know said mr hinchcliff that be fruit of tree of knowledge man may have have sort of mirage say suppose look at said stranger be certainly strange looking globe not really apple mr hinchcliff saw curious glowing golden colour almost a though light be wrought into substance a looked at began to see more vividly desolate valley among mountain guarding sword of fire strange antiquity of story have just heard rubbed knuckle into eye said have kept like smooth full three month longer than that be now by day drying withering decay said mr hinchcliff really believe be forbidden fruit there be mistaking earnestness of man manner perfect sanity fruit of knowledge said suppose be said mr hinchcliff after pause still staring at after said mr hinchcliff be not kind of knowledge not sort of knowledge mean adam eve have eaten already inherit sin not knowledge said stranger must make clear bright again must see into everything through everything into deepest meaning of everything why eat then said mr hinchcliff with inspiration took intending to eat said stranger man have fallen merely to eat again must scarcely knowledge be power said mr hinchcliff be happiness be older than more than twice a old time after time have held in hand heart have failed at thought of one might know terrible lucidity suppose suddenly world became pitilessly clear that think must be great advantage said mr hinchcliff on whole suppose saw into heart mind of everyone about into most secret recess people loved whose love valued 'd soon find out humbug said mr hinchcliff greatly struck by idea worse to know bare of most intimate illusion to see in place that lust weakness prevented doing merciful perspective might be excellent thing too 'know know be young said stranger if care to eat bother why throw away there again perhaps will not understand to how must one throw away thing like glowing wonderful once one have one be bound on other hand to give away to give away to someone who thirsted after knowledge who found terror in thought of clear perception of course said mr hinchcliff thoughtfully might be sort of poisonous fruit then eye caught something motionless end of white board black lettered outside carriage window mwood saw started convulsively gracious said mr hinchcliff holmwood practical present blotted out mystic realisation have be stealing upon in moment be opening carriage door portmanteau in hand guard be already fluttering green flag mr hinchcliff jumped out here said voice behind saw dark eye of stranger shining golden fruit bright bare held out of open carriage door took instinctively train be already moving shouted stranger made snatch at a if to take back stand away cried country porter thrusting forward to close door stranger shouted something mr hinchcliff did not catch head arm thrust excitedly out of window then shadow of bridge fell on in trice be hidden mr hinchcliff stood astonished staring at end of last waggon receding round bend with wonderful fruit in hand for fraction of minute mind be confused then became aware that two three people on platform be regarding with interest be not new grammar school master making debut occurred to that so far a must tell fruit might very well be naive refreshment of orange flushed at thought thrust fruit into side pocket where bulged undesirably there be help for so went towards awkwardly concealing sense of awkwardness to ask way to grammar school mean of getting portmanteau two tin box lay up platform thither of odd fantastic yarn to tell fellow luggage must be taken on truck for sixpence found must precede on foot fancied ironical note in voice be painfully aware of contour curious earnestness of man in train glamour of story told have for time diverted current of mr hinchcliff thought drove like mist before immediate concern fire went to fro preoccupation of new position impression be to produce upon holmwood generally school people in particular returned upon with reinvigorating power before left station cleared mental atmosphere be extraordinary what inconvenient thing addition of soft rather brightly golden fruit not three inch in diameter may prove to sensitive youth on best appearance in pocket of black jacket bulged dreadfully spoilt line altogether passed little old lady in black felt eye drop upon excrescence at once be wearing one glove carrying other together with stick so that to bear fruit openly be impossible in one place where road into town seemed suitably secluded took encumbrance out of pocket tried in hat be just too large hat wobbled ludicrously just a be taking out again butcher boy came driving round corner confound said mr hinchcliff must have eaten thing attained omniscience there then must seem so silly to go into town sucking juicy fruit certainly felt juicy if one of boy must come by might do serious injury with discipline so to be seen juice might make face sticky get upon cuff might be acid juice a potent a lemon take colour out of clothes then round bend in lane came two pleasant sunlit girlish figure be walking slowly towards town chattering at moment might look round see hot faced young man behind carrying kind of phosphorescent yellow tomato must be sure to laugh hang said mr hinchcliff with swift jerk sent encumbrance flying over stone wall of orchard that there abutted on road a vanished felt faint twinge of loss lasted scarcely moment adjusted stick glove in hand walked on erect conscious to pas girl in darkness of night mr hinchcliff have dream saw valley flaming sword contorted tree knew that really be apple of tree of knowledge that have thrown regardlessly away awoke very unhappy in morning regret have passed afterwards returned troubled never however when be happy busily occupied at last one moonlight night about eleven when holmwood be quiet regret returned with redoubled force therewith impulse to adventure slipped out of house over playground wall went through silent town to station lane climbed into orchard where have thrown fruit nothing be to be found of there among dewy grass faint intangible globe of dandelion down under knife what if die under thought recurred again again a walked home from haddon be purely personal question be spared deep anxiety of married man knew there be few of intimate friend must find death troublesome chiefly on account of duty of regret be surprised indeed perhaps little humiliated a turned matter over to think how few must possibly exceed conventional requirement thing came before stripped of glamour in clear dry light during walk from haddon house over primrose hill there be friend of youth perceived now that affection be tradition foregathered rather laboriously to maintain there be rival helper of later career suppose have be cold blooded undemonstrative one perhaps implies other may be that even capacity for friendship be question of physique there have be time in own life when have grieved bitterly enough at loss of friend a walked home afternoon emotional side of imagination be dormant must not pity feel sorry for friend conceive of a grieving for be interested in deadness of emotional nature doubt concomitant of stagnating physiology thought wandered off along line suggested once before in hot youth have suffered sudden loss of blood have be within ace of death remembered now that affection a well a passion have drained out of leaving scarce anything tranquil resignation dreg of self pity have be week before old ambition tenderness complex moral interplay of man have reasserted occurred to that real meaning of numbness might be gradual slipping away from pleasure pain guidance of animal man have be proven take a thoroughly a anything can be proven in world that higher emotion moral feeling even subtle tenderness of love be evolved from elemental desire fear of simple animal be harness in man mental freedom go may be that a death overshadows a possibility of acting diminishes complex growth of balanced impulse propensity aversion whose interplay inspires act go with leaving what be

on one of green chair line way in minute have dozed into dream tide of thought washed up vision of resurrection be still sitting in chair thought actually dead withered tattered dried one eye saw

have shone motionless against black background of infinite space presently seemed a though group of star about hercules scorpion be contracting while orion aldebaran neighbour be scattering apart flashing suddenly out of darkness there came flying multitude of particle of rock glittering like dust speck in sunbeam encompassed in faintly luminous haze swirled about vanished again in twinkling far behind then saw that bright spot of light shone little to one side of path be growing very rapidly larger perceived that be planet saturn rushing towards larger larger grew swallowing up heaven

progression what be be indeed immaterial vague persuasion of body gathering about came into suspense abysmal darkness about hand filled with impalpable suggestion with uncertain fluctuating shape then suddenly came sound like sound of tolling bell faint a if infinitely far muffled a though heard through thick swathing of darkness deep vibrating resonance with vast gulf of silence between stroke hand appeared to tighten on rod saw far above hand towards apex of darkness circle of dim phosphorescence ghostly sphere whence sound came throbbing at last stroke hand vanished for hour have come

spoken of a pain operation have not killed perceived suddenly that dull melancholy of year be lifted from mind sea raider until extraordinary affair at peculiar specie haploteuthis ferox be known to science only generically on strength of half digested tentacle obtained near azores decaying body pecked by bird nibbled by fish found early in by mr jennings near land end in department of zoological science indeed be quite so much in dark a with regard to deep sea cephalopod mere accident for instance be that led to prince of monaco discovery of nearly dozen new form in summer of discovery in before mentioned tentacle be included chanced that cachalot be killed off terceira by sperm whaler in last struggle charged almost to prince yacht missed rolled under died within twenty yard of rudder in agony threw up number of large object prince dimly perceiving be strange important be by happy expedient able to secure before sank set screw in motion kept circling in vortex thus created until boat must be lowered specimen be whole cephalopod fragment of cephalopod of gigantic proportion almost of unknown to science must seem indeed that large agile creature living in middle depth of sea must to large extent for ever remain unknown to since under water be too nimble for net be only by such rare unlooked for accident that specimen can be obtained in case of haploteuthis ferox for instance be still altogether ignorant of habitat a ignorant a be of breeding ground of herring sea way of salmon zoologist be altogether at loss to account for sudden appearance on coast possibly be stress of hunger migration drove hither out of deep will be perhaps better to avoid necessarily inconclusive discussion to proceed at once with narrative first human being to set eye upon living haploteuthis first human being to survive be for there can be little doubt now that wave of bathing fatality boating accident travelled along coast of cornwall devon in early may be due to cause be retired tea dealer of name of fison who be stopping at sidmouth boarding house be in afternoon be walking along cliff path between sidmouth ladram bay cliff in direction be very high down red face of in one place kind of ladder staircase have be made be near when attention be attracted by what at first thought to be cluster of bird struggling over fragment of food caught sunlight glistened pinkish white tide be right out object be not only far below remote across broad waste of rock reef covered with dark seaweed interspersed with silvery shining tidal pool be moreover dazzled by brightness of further water in minute regarding again perceived that judgment be in fault for over struggle circled number of bird jackdaw gull for most part latter gleaming blindingly when sunlight smote wing seemed minute in comparison with curiosity be perhaps aroused more strongly because of first insufficient explanation a have nothing better to do than amuse decided to make object whatever be goal of afternoon walk instead of ladram bay conceiving might perhaps be great fish of sort stranded by chance flapping about in distress so hurried down long steep ladder stopping at interval of thirty foot so to take breath scan mysterious movement at foot of cliff be of course nearer object than have be on other hand now came up against incandescent sky beneath sun so a to seem dark indistinct be pinkish of be now hidden by skerry of weedy boulder perceived that be made up of seven rounded body distinct connected that bird kept up constant croaking screaming seemed afraid to approach too closely mr fison torn by curiosity began picking way across wave worn rock finding wet seaweed that covered thickly rendered extremely slippery stopped removed shoe sock coiled trouser above knee object be of course merely to avoid stumbling into rocky pool about perhaps be rather glad a men be of excuse to resume even for moment sensation of boyhood at anyrate be to doubt that owes life approached mark with assurance absolute security of country against form of animal life give inhabitant round body moved to fro be only when surmounted skerry of boulder have mentioned that realised horrible nature of discovery came upon with suddenness rounded body fell apart a came into sight over ridge displayed pinkish object to be partially devoured body of human being whether of man woman be unable to say rounded body be new ghastly looking creature in shape somewhat resembling octopus with huge very long flexible tentacle coiled copiously on ground skin have glistening texture unpleasant to see like shiny downward bend of tentacle surrounded curious excrescence at bend tentacle large intelligent eye gave creature grotesque suggestion of face be size of fair sized swine about body tentacle seemed to to be many foot in length there be think seven eight at least of creature twenty yard beyond amid surf of now returning tide two others be emerging from sea body lay flatly on rock eye regarded with evil interest doe not appear that mr fison be afraid that realised that be in danger possibly confidence be to be ascribed to limpness of attitude be horrified of course intensely excited indignant at such revolting creature preying upon human flesh thought have chanced upon drowned body shouted to with idea of driving off finding did not budge cast about picked up big rounded lump of rock flung at one then slowly uncoiling tentacle began moving towards creeping at first deliberately making soft purring sound to other in moment mr fison realised that be in danger shouted again threw boot started off with leap forthwith twenty yard off stopped faced about judging slow behold tentacle of leader be already pouring over rocky ridge on have just be standing at that shouted again time not threatening cry of dismay began jumping striding slipping wading across uneven expanse between beach tall red cliff seemed suddenly at vast distance saw a though be creature in world two minute workman engaged in repair of ladder way little suspecting race for life be beginning below at one time must hear creature splashing in pool not dozen foot behind once slipped almost fell chased to very foot of cliff desisted only when have be joined by workman at foot of ladder way up cliff three of men pelted with stone for time then hurried to cliff top along path towards sidmouth to secure assistance boat to rescue desecrated body from clutch of abominable creature ii a if have not already be in sufficient peril that day mr fison went with boat to point out exact spot of adventure a tide be down required considerable detour to reach spot when at last came off ladder way mangled body have disappeared water be now running in submerging first one slab of slimy rock then four men in boat workman be boatman mr fison now turned attention from bearing off shore to water beneath keel at first must see little below save dark jungle of laminaria with occasional darting fish mind be set on adventure expressed disappointment freely presently saw one of monster swimming through water seaward with curious rolling motion suggested to mr spinning roll of captive balloon almost immediately after waving streamer of laminaria be extraordinarily perturbed parted for moment three of beast became darkly visible struggling for what be probably fragment of drowned man in moment copious olive green ribbon have poured again over writhing group at four men greatly excited began beating water with oar shouting immediately saw tumultuous movement among weed desisted to see more clearly a soon a water be smooth saw a seemed to whole sea bottom among weed set with eye ugly swine cried one of men why there be dozen forthwith thing began to rise through water about mr fison have since described to writer startling eruption out of waving laminaria meadow to seemed to occupy considerable time be probable that really be affair of few second only for time nothing eye then speaks of tentacle streaming out parting weed frond way that then thing growing larger until at last bottom be hidden by intercoiling form tip of tentacle rose darkly here there into air above swell of water one came up boldly to side of boat clinging to with three of sucker set tentacle threw four others over gunwale a if with intention of oversetting boat of clambering into mr fison at once caught up boathook jabbing furiously at soft tentacle forced to desist be struck in back almost pitched overboard by boatman who be using oar to resist similar attack on other side of boat tentacle on side at once relaxed hold at slid out of sight splashed into water 'd better get out of said mr fison who be trembling violently went to tiller while boatman one of workman seated began rowing other workman stood up in fore part of boat with boathook ready to strike more tentacle might appear nothing else seems to have be said mr fison have expressed common feeling beyond amendment in hushed scared mood with face white drawn set about escaping from position into have so recklessly blundered oar have scarcely dropped into water before dark tapering serpentine rope have bound be about rudder creeping up side of boat with looping motion came sucker again men gripped oar pulled be like trying to move boat in floating raft of weed help here cried boatman mr fison second workman rushed to help lug at oar then man with boathook name be ewan ewen sprang up with curse began striking downward over side a far a must reach at bank of tentacle now clustered along boat bottom at same time two rower stood up to get better purchase for recovery of oar boatman handed to mr fison who lugged desperately meanwhile boatman opened big clasp knife leaning over side of boat began hacking at spiring arm upon oar shaft mr fison staggering with quivering rocking of boat teeth set breath coming short vein starting on hand a pulled at oar suddenly cast eye seaward there not fifty yard off across long roller of incoming tide be large boat standing in towards with three woman little child in boatman be rowing little man in pink ribboned straw hat white stood in stern hailing for moment of course mr fison thought of help then thought of child abandoned oar forthwith threw up arm in frantic gesture screamed to party in boat to keep away for god sake say much for modesty courage of mr fison that doe not seem to be aware that there be quality of heroism in action at juncture oar have abandoned be at once drawn under presently reappeared floating about twenty yard away at same moment mr fison felt boat under lurch violently hoarse scream prolonged cry of terror from boatman caused to forget party of excursionist altogether turned saw hill crouching by forward rowlock face convulsed with terror right arm over side drawn tightly down gave now succession of short sharp cry oh oh oh oh mr fison belief that must have be hacking at tentacle below water line have be grasped by of course be quite impossible to say now certainly what have happened boat be heeling over so that gunwale be within ten inch of water ewan other labourer be striking down into water with oar boathook on side of hill arm mr fison instinctively placed to counterpoise then hill who be burly powerful man made strenuous effort rose almost to standing position lifted arm indeed clean out of water hanging to be complicated tangle of brown rope eye of one of brute have hold of glaring straight resolute showed momentarily above surface boat heeled more more green brown water came pouring in cascade over side then hill slipped fell with rib across side arm mass of tentacle about splashed back into water rolled over boot kicked mr fison knee a gentleman rushed forward to seize in moment fresh tentacle have whipped about waist neck after brief convulsive struggle in boat be nearly capsized hill be lugged overboard boat righted with violent jerk that sent mr fison over other side hid struggle in water from eye stood staggering to recover balance for moment a did so became aware that struggle inflowing tide have carried close upon weedy rock again not four yard off table of rock still rose in rhythmic movement above in wash of tide in moment mr fison seized oar from ewan gave one vigorous stroke then dropping ran to bow leapt felt foot slide over rock by frantic effort leapt again towards further mass stumbled over came to knee rose again look out cried someone large drab body struck be knocked flat into tidal pool by one of workman a went down heard smothered choking cry that believed at time came from hill then found marvelling at shrillness variety of hill voice someone jumped over curving rush of foamy water poured over passed scrambled to foot dripping without looking seaward ran a fast a terror must let shoreward before over flat space of scattered rock stumbled two workman one dozen yard in front of other looked over shoulder at last seeing that be not pursued faced about be astonished from moment of rising of cephalopod out of water have be acting too swiftly to fully comprehend action now seemed to a if have suddenly jumped out of evil dream for there be sky cloudless blazing with afternoon sun sea weltering under pitiless brightness soft creamy foam of breaking water low long dark ridge of rock righted boat floated rising falling gently on swell about dozen yard from shore hill monster stress tumult of fierce fight for life have vanished a though have never be mr fison heart be beating violently be throbbing to finger tip breath came deep there be something missing for second must not think clearly enough what might be sun sky sea rock what be then remembered boatload of excursionist have vanished wondered whether have imagined turned saw two workman standing side by side under projecting mass of tall pink cliff hesitated whether must make one last attempt to save man hill physical excitement seemed to desert suddenly leave aimless helpless turned shoreward stumbling wading towards two companion looked back again there be now two boat floating one farthest out at sea pitched clumsily bottom upward iii so be haploteuthis ferox made appearance upon devonshire coast so far have be most serious aggression mr fison account taken together with wave of boating bathing casualty to have already alluded absence of fish from cornish coast that year point clearly to shoal of voracious deep sea monster prowling slowly along sub tidal coastline hunger migration have know be suggested a force drove for own part prefer to believe alternative theory of hemsley hemsley hold that pack shoal of creature may have become enamoured of human flesh by accident of foundered ship sinking among have wandered in search of out of accustomed zone first waylaying following ship so coming to shore in wake of atlantic traffic to discus hemsley cogent admirably stated argument must be out of place here must seem that appetite of shoal be satisfied by catch of eleven people for so far a can be ascertained there be ten people in second boat certainly creature gave further sign of presence off sidmouth that day coast between seaton budleigh salterton be patrolled that evening night by four preventive service boat men in be armed with harpoon cutlass a evening advanced number of more le similarly equipped expedition organised by private individual joined mr fison took part in of expedition about midnight excited hail be heard from boat about couple of mile out at sea to south east of sidmouth lantern be seen waving in strange manner to fro up down nearer boat at once hurried towards alarm venturesome occupant of boat seaman curate two schoolboy have actually seen monster passing under boat creature seems like most deep sea organism be phosphorescent have be floating five fathom deep so like creature of moonshine through blackness of water tentacle retracted a if asleep rolling over over moving slowly in wedge like formation towards south east people told story in gesticulated fragment a first one boat drew alongside then at last there be little fleet of eight nine boat collected together from tumult like chatter of marketplace rose into stillness of night there be little disposition to pursue shoal people have weapon experience for dubious chase presently even with certain relief may be boat turned shoreward now to tell what be perhaps most astonishing fact in whole astonishing raid have not slightest knowledge of subsequent movement of shoal although whole south west coast be now alert for may perhaps be significant that cachalot be stranded off sark on june two week three day after sidmouth affair living haploteuthis came ashore on calais sand be alive because several witness saw tentacle moving in convulsive way be probable that be dying gentleman named pouchet obtained rifle shot be last appearance of living haploteuthis others be seen on french coast on th of june dead body almost complete be washed ashore near torquay few day later boat from marine biological station engaged in dredging off plymouth picked up rotting specimen slashed deeply with cutlas wound how former specimen have come by death be impossible to say on last day of june mr egbert caine artist bathing near newlyn threw up arm shrieked be drawn under friend bathing with made attempt to save swam at once for shore be last fact to tell of extraordinary raid from deeper sea whether be really last of horrible creature be a yet premature to say be believed certainly be to be hoped that have returned now returned for good to sunless depth of middle sea out of have so strangely so mysteriously arisen pollock porroh man be in swampy village on lagoon river behind turner peninsula that pollock first encounter with porroh man occurred woman of country be famous for good look be gallina with dash of european blood date from day of vasco de gama english slave trader porroh man too be

back of chair here be said have impulse to warn in undertone must not frame word go beware of struggled in mind swift moment passed got said horrocks standing with door half open raut stepped towards better say good bye to mr horrocks said ironmaster even more grimly quiet in tone than before raut started turned good evening mr horrocks said hand touched horrocks held door open with ceremonial politeness unusual in towards men raut went out then after wordless look at husband followed stood motionless while raut light footfall husband heavy tread like bass treble passed down passage together front door slammed heavily went to window moving slowly stood watching leaning forward two men appeared for moment at gateway in road passed under street lamp be hidden by black mass of shrubbery lamplight fell for moment on face showing only unmeaning pale patch telling nothing of what still feared doubted craved vainly to know then sank down into crouching attitude in big arm chair
