might allay recognized that time have come for to speak be deplorable sir eliphaz began put down hand gripped seat of chair a if to hold on to very tightly looked very hard at horizon a if be trying to decipher remote inscription have imported tone into discussion tried got off at third attempt be extremely painful thing to mr hus that to standing a do on very brink of great chasm must be necessary to speak in most cordial helpful tone be duty be duty to hold firmly to principle have always guided a governor of woldingstanton school speak must say with extreme arrogance of institution

brick without straw must not have built up woldingstanton without money obtained by commercialism for display such unqualified contempt sordid cits be who planted who watered mr hus seemed about to speak said nothing exactly what say said mr dad turning for confirmation to mr farr school be essentially modern commercial school must be run a mr farr nodded white face ambiguously with eye on sir eliphaz must have be chary mr hus of wrangling about particular share contribution on occasion so solemn a since will have so since challenge discussion turned to colleague a if for support go on said mr dad fact be fact sir eliphaz cleared throat continued to read horizon have raised point mr hus by way of opening gist of what have to say lie deeper so far have dealt with thing have said only in relation to a against assume own righteousness flout poor judgment sweep aside school must be continued on line teaching must follow scheme can imagine alternative opinion god forbid must say word in own defence have given freely of time of money to school must tax secretary now to reckon up how much make claim none let now put discussion upon wider graver footing be not only poor intention arraign strange thing have dropped from mr hus in discussion thing have at once pained astonished to hear from have spoken not only of man ingratitude of god must scarcely believe ear indeed heard say that god be silent unhelpful that too have deserted in spite of most meritorious exertion on part standing a do on very margin of great secret want to plead very earnestly with against that have said sir eliphaz seemed to meditate remotely returned like soaring vulture to victim must be last man to obtrude religious feeling upon anyone make parade of religion mr hus none at many people think better than unbeliever here be bound to make confession owe much to god mr hus glowered at sick man abandoned grip upon seat of chair for moment to make gesture with hairy claw of hand attitude to god be far deeper offence to than merely personal attack must be under chastening blow under trial humbler spirit must receive with thankfulness construe a lesson warning betray more proud more self assured morefroward be not too harsh wordmore froward mr hus than be even in day when used to fret under on founder day in great hall when must dictate to that here must have extension there must have museum picture room what not leaving nothing to opinion making gift duty will not recognise virtue of gift grace in man god can not see dear mr hus falsity of position be upon point want to talk to now god doe not smite man needlessly world be one vast intention not sparrow fall to ground unless will that sparrow to fall be heart so sure of doe nothing have happened suggest to that there may be something in conduct direction of woldingstanton have made not quite so acceptable offering to god a have imagined to be sir eliphaz paused with air of giving mr hus chance meeting with response resumed be old man mr hus have seen much of world more particularly of world of finance industry world of swift opportunity sudden temptation have watched career of many young men of part who have seemed to be under impression that world have be waiting for overlong have seen more promotion scheme enterprise great grandiose than care to recall developing woldingstanton from mere endowed school of market town be to present position have be for subordinate incident holiday task piece of by play upon crowded scene experience have be on far greater scale far greater in experience have never seen what must call really right minded man perish innocent dealerprovided be that took ordinary precautionsdestroyed ups down doubt there be for good a well a bad have seen foolish taking root for timeit be for time have watched manuvres of exceedingly crafty men sir eliphaz shook head slowly from side to side hair on head waved about hesitated for moment decided to favour hearer with scrap of autobiography quite recently began there be fellow came to just a be laying down plant for production on large scale be very plausible energetic young fellow indeed american armenian well happened to know somehow that be going to use kaolin from felspar by product of new potash process have got hold of scheme for washing london clay produced assured accessible kaolin just a good for purpose not tenth of cost of norwegian stuff must have reduced prime cost something like thirty per cent let alone tonnage excuse technicality on face of be thoroughly good thing point be that knew along stuff retained certain amount of sulphur couldnt possibly make building block to last that wouldnt prevent selling using stuff with practical impunity wasnt up to to know one must have made liable thing indeed looked so plain safe that admit tempted sorely then mr hus god came in received secret intimation want to tell of in good faith simplicity in night when world be deep in sleep awoke be in extremest terror very bone be shaking sat up in bed afraid almost to touch switch of electric light hair stood on end must see nothing must hear nothing be a if spirit passed in front of face in spite of silence something seemed to be saying to how about god sir eliphaz have at last forgotten how can must dwell in house of clay whose foundation be dust escape judgment be mr hus just that whose foundation be dust straight to point well mr hus be not religious man threw over that armenian mr dad made sound to intimate that must have done same mention experience interventionand be not only one of must tellbecause want to get view that if enterprise even though be a fair honest seeming business a woldingstanton school begin suddenly to crumple wilt mean that somehow somewhere must have be putting wrong sort of clay into mean not that god be wrong going back upon that be wrong may be great famous teacher now mr hus thanks not little to pedestal have made for god be greater more famous teacher manifestly have not convinced even if must have convinced of woldingstantons present perfection be practically have to say when propose in humility to turn school about into new le pretentious course oppose be answer if have done a well wisely a declare must not be in position discussion must never have arisen paused said with truth dignity said mr dad have put opinion sir eliphaz better than must have put thank coughed briefly question put to have put to said mr hus thought deeply for little while feel convicted of wrong doing still believe work set to do be right right in spirit intention right in plan method invite to confess faith broken in dust faith be never so sure there be god in heart in heart at least there be god who have always guided to right who guide now conscience remains unassailable affliction that speak of a trial warning can only see a inexplicable disaster perplex cow strike a pointless irrelevant event be terrible said mr dad deeply shocked push back sir eliphaz from discussion of school affair to more fundamental question have raised problem of moral government of world problem have be distressing mind since first came here to sundering whether indeed failure be condemnation success sunshine of god approval believe that great god of star sea mountain be attentive to conduct responds to sense of right be same sense of right a ours endorses common aim prosperity be mark of harmony with supreme god wouldnt go so far a mr dad interjected arrogance misfortune express disapproval well have believed have believed that rightness of schoolmaster conscience must need be same thing a rightness of destiny too have fallen into comforting persuasion of prosperity series of smashing experience have have culminating in proposal to wipe out whole effect significance of life brings face to face with fundamental question whether order of great universe god of star have regard relationship to problem of conscience effort of man to do right be question echo to down age so far have always professed christian well must hope so said mr dad considering term of school foundation for take creed declare in beautiful symbol that god who be present in heart be one with universal father at same time beloved son continually eternally begotten from universal fatherhood crucified only to conquer have come into poor life to raise up at last to to believe be to believe in significance continuity of whole effort of mankind life of man must be like perpetual spreading of fire if right wrong be to perish together indifferently if there be aimless fruitless suffering if there open hope for eternal survival in consequence of good thing then there be meaning in such belief a christianity be mere superstition of priest sacrifice have read thing into be never truly there rushlight of faith burn in windy darkness will see dawn nay said sir eliphaz nay if there be god in work can not destroy be doing best said mr hus now be not sure that will fail at one time must have defied now be not sure have sat here through dreary dreadful day lain awake through interminable night have thought of many thing men in day of prosperity be apt to dismiss from mind be no longer sure of goodness of world without in plan of fate perhaps be only in within heart that light of god flickersand flicker insecurely where have thought god somehow akin to ourselves ruled in universe may be there be nothing black emptiness coldness worse than cruelty mr dad be about to interrupt restrained by great effort be commonplace of pietistic work that natural thing be perfect thing that whole world of life if be not for sinfulness of man must be perfect paley will remember sir eliphaz in evidence of christianity from have suffered declares that earth be manifestly made for happiness of sentient being living thereon ask to consider for little dispassionately whether life through stage up to including man be not rather scheme of uneasiness imperfect satisfaction positive misery arent getting bit out of depth in mr dad burst out put at thatout of depth what doe sort of carping questioning amount to mr hus doe do good doe help in slightest degree why must go into why cant be humble leave deep question to who make specialty of dealing with dont know rope cant here be mr farr for instance of whole time schoolmaster so to speak here sir eliphaz toiling night day to make simple cheap suitable home for mass who probably wont say thank to when see here overworked engineer understaffed most cruelly not to speak of most unfair impossible labour demand so that never know where be what wont ask next in midst of be to start argey bargey about goodness of god be busy men mr hus what do know of world being scheme of imperfect satisfaction what where doe come in practical value word be word getting away from plain definite question came to talk over settle have done with such talk will confess make uncomfortable give bible simple religion learnt at mother knee thats good enough for cant just have faith leave question alone be men in reality after argument worm just worm well then let have decency to behave a such stick to business do best in state of life unto have pleased god to call thats what say said mr dad jerked head back coughed shortly adjusted tie nodded to mr farr in resolute manner simple straightforward commercial technical education added by way of explanatory colophon thats what be after mr hus stared absently at mr dad for moment then resumed let look squarely at world about be true lot of life be there slightest justification for assuming that conception of right happiness be reflected anywhere in outward universe be there for instance much animal happiness do health well being constitute normal state of animal paused mr dad got up stood looking out of window with back to mr hus pulling nature to piece said over shoulder turned urged further with snarl of bitterness in voice suppose thing be so what be good of calling attention to wheres benefit attitude of sir eliphaz conveyed readiness to listen before became too ill to go out here said mr hus went for walk in country behind place be weary before started be impelled to go by almost irresistible desire will seize upon one at time to get out of one immediate surroundings wanted to escape from wretched room wanted to be alone secure from interruption free to think in peace there be treacherous promise in day outside much sunshine breeze have heard of wood mile so inland conjured up vision of cool green shade kindly stream beneath

shone sir eliphaz said let finish said mr hus for have still to remind of most stubborn fact of in such argument a have ever thought of significance of such creature a entozoan vast multitude of other sort of specialized parasite whose very existence be cruelty there be thousand of order genus of insect crustacea arachnid worm lowlier thing be adapted in most complicated way to prey upon living suffering tissue of fellow creature can live in other way have ever thought what that mean if forethought framed horror what sort of benevolence be there in forethought will not distress by describing

filthy petty enormous display carelessness indifference disregard for justice voice of mr hus faded out for time mr farr have be manifesting sign of impatience pause gave opportunity spoke with sort of restrained volubility sir eliphaz mr dad after what have passed in relation to must have preferred to have said nothing in discussion nothing so far a be concerned will still say nothing upon issue be impossible to keep silence mr hus have said terrible thing thing must surely never be said at woldingstanton think of what such teaching a may mean among young susceptible boy think of such stuff in school pulpit chary a be of wrangling must not set up for moment to wrangle against mr hus yet feel that cavilling against god universe multitude of evil word must be answered be imperative to answer plainly sternly be duty to god who have made what be mr hus in present diseased state seem incapable of realizing enormous egotism of depreciation of god marvel indeed have suffered from sort of incapacity always be new thing have not chafed under arrogant assurance for twelve long year right now a ever be only right doctrine alone be pure must that god must speak open lip against how voice must shatter everything about how must shrivel amidst blasphemy excuse gentleman if be too forcible said mr farr moistening white lip mr dad nodded fierce approval thus encouraged mr farr proceeded when first came into room mr hus be full of pity for afflictioni think werewe be pitiful now be clear to that god exacts from le than iniquity deserves surely supreme sin be pride criticize belittle god universe what sort of universe must give mr hus if be creator pardon if startle gentleman be fair question to ask for be clear to now mr hus that le than will satisfy woldingstanton for wonder have wrought there in spite of fact that never before never again can there be such head in spite of fact that have lit candle there a may one day set world ablaze be clearly too small field

problem of liver fluke suppose will provide euthanasia for parasite abruptly mr farr passed from vein of terrible humour to earnest pleading manner mr hus with mortal danger so close to entreat to reconsider wild wicked talk of yours take few superficial aspect of world frame judgment on try with poor foot rule of mind to measure plan of god plan be longer than earth wider than sea ask how can such insolence help in supreme emergency there can be little time left providence be manifestly resolved to give mr farr maximum of dramatic effect what be said mr farr stood up looked out of window somebody have rung bell now with effect of impatience be rapping at knocker of sea view chapter fourth do truly die mr croome be heard in passage someone be admitted there be voice handle of parlour

concerned with history philosophy than have be under mr hus wont sit down doctor doctor sat down still watching sir eliphaz with hard intelligence well have drifted from sir eliphaz continued not so far a may think said mr hus at rate mr hus have be regaling with discourse upon misery of life how be eaten up by parasite utterly wretched how everything be wretched accursed world ruled either by cruel god god so careless a to be practically god at nice stuff for nineteen eighteen ad said mr dad putting much meaning into ad since left woldingstanton came here said mr hus have done little else think have not slept during night have have nothing to occupy during day have be thinking about fundamental thing have be forced to revise faith to look more closely than have ever done before into meaning of belief into spring of action have be wrenched away from habitual confidence in order of thing seemed more natural state for mind to be in have only widened difference already existed between three gentleman be showing very plainly in day when success still justified grip upon woldingstanton suddenly swiftly have have misfortune following upon misfortunewithout cause justification be thrown now into darkest doubt dismay universe seems harsh black to whereas formerly believed that at core of universally pervading be will of god of light have always denied even when faith be undimmed that god of righteousness ruled world in detail entirely giving day by day daily reward punishment gentleman on contrary do believe that say that god doe rule world traceably directly that success be measure of approval pain suffering fulfilment of unrighteousness a for what have to do with educationit have to do with education can settle practical question until have settled such dispute a before can prepare boy to play part in world must ask what be world for prepare be tragedy comedy what be nature of drama in be to play dr barrack indicated that statement be noted approved for clearly said mr hus if success be justification of life must train for success there be need for men to understand life then so long a do job in be opinion of governor of mine have be opinion of most men of worldalways obey thing be be lesson must have taught to boy acquiesce life for be not adventure not struggle simply obedience enjoyment of reward dr barrack be what such technical education a want set up at woldingstanton really mean have believed always taught always that what god demand from man be utmost effort to co operate understand have taught imagination first most have made knowledge knowledge of what man be what man world be what man may be be adventure of mankind substance of teaching at woldingstanton have taught philosophy have taught whole history of mankind if must not have done without leaving chemistry physic mathematics language out of curriculum altogether must have left out see why dr barrack see position certainly said dr barrack now that heaven be darkened now that eye have be opened to wretchedness futility horror in texture of life still cling cling more than ever to spirit of righteousness within if there be god mercy human kindliness in great frame of space time if life be writhing torment itch upon one little planet star away there in void no more than huge empty flare signifying nothing then brighter shine flame of god in heart if god in heart be son of heavenly father then be prometheus rebel doe not shake faith that be master for whom will live die more do cling to fire of human tradition have lit upon little planet if be one gleam of spirit in windy vastness of dead empty universe dr barrack seemed about to interrupt with comment then be manifest deferred interpolation loneliness littleness said mr hus harshness in sky above in texture of thing if so be that thing be so must see baby in mother arm feel safe in safe creation child in home many men woman have lived died happy in illusion of security war have torn away veil of illusion from million of men mankind be coming of age can see life at last for what be what be not here spin upon ball of rock nickel steel upon film of water few score mile of air lie like

heart god of mankind cry be there voice outside in cold empty universe echo that ah mr hus mr hus said sir eliphaz eye seemed seeking point of attachment found at last in steel engraving of queen victoria giving bible to dusky potentate adorned little parlour sickness colour vision said sir eliphaz what say be so profoundly true so utterly false mysteriously evolved living a say in mere bloom of air moisture upon tiny planet how must exist how must continue be not sustained in moment by mercy wisdom of god flimsier life be greater wonder of providence not sparrow said sir eliphaz then enlarging metaphor with boom in voice not hair of head fall to ground without knowledge consent be man much occupied can not do reading must while have be reviling work of god have be thinking of wonder sir eliphaz lifted up hand with thumb finger opposed a though held exquisite thing therein human eye said sir eliphaz with intensity of appreciation brought tear to own cross fertilization of plant marvellous transformation of higher insect highly elaborate wing scale of lepidoptera mercy temper wind to shorn lamb dark warm marvel of embryology order rhythm obedience with cell of

corpuscle cell in brain of man to mirror universe go to own appointed place must that must do like said sir eliphaz then consider water said sir eliphaz be not deeply versed in physical science there be certain thing about water fill with wonder amaze other liquid contract when solidify with one two exceptionsuseful in art water expands now water be non conductor of heat if water contracted became heavier when became ice must sink to bottom of polar sea remain there unmelted more ice must sink down to until ocean be ice life ceased water doe not do so no be not for vapour of water catch entangles sun heat world must scorch by day freeze by night mercy upon mercy said sir eliphaz in tone of happy confession be ninety per cent water be think how mercifully winter be tempered to by snow when water freeze in air in winter time doe not come pelting down a lump of ice conceivably might then where must be belongs to hexagonal systema system prone to graceful framework crystallizes into

even parasite have use be told be not for parasitic bacteria man must not digest food lichen again be made up of alga fungus mutually parasitic be called symbiosisliving together for mutual benefit maybe one of thousand of parasite deem so horrible be working way upward towards arrangement sir eliphaz weighed word mutually advantageous arrangement with host paying guest finally said sir eliphaz with roll of distant thunder in voice think of stately procession of life upon earth through myriad of form glorious crescendo of evolution up to climax man what work be man paragon of creation microcosm of cosmos ultimate birth of time must have doubt guiding hand ceased with gesture mr dad made noise like response in church certain beauty in world be mark of god favour said mr hus there be beauty one may not balance by equal ugliness wart hog hyna tapeworm stinkhorn be equally god creation nothing have said point to anything cold indifference towards of order in live beauty happens be not given pain suffering happiness there be heed only in heart of man burn fire of righteousness for time mr hus be silent then went on answering sir eliphaz spoke of wonder of cross fertilization of plant do not know that curious elaborate adaptation no longer work scarcely be evolution completed before special need produced ceased intricate flower see be a futile a ruin of palmyra be self fertilized wind fertilized transformation of higher insect give gnat wasp malaria apple maggot in due season be matter for human astonishment rather than human gratitude if there be design in strange intricate happening surely be design of misplaced inhuman ingenuity scale of lepidoptera again have wasted glittering splendour for million of year if be meant for man why do most beautiful specie fly by night in tropical forest a for human eye oculist optician be scarcely of opinion hymn peculiar property of water make life possible make possible do make other than be have talked of marvel of

chromoplast of division slide along spindle line divide not a if divine hand guided with remorseless logic with pitiless consistency of mathematical process divide marshal turn way that to make idiot to make congenital cripple million of such miracle pile upand produce swaying drunkard at pot house door talk of crescendo of evolution of first beginning of life how scheme unfolds until culminates in usus here under circumstance mr dad farr mewaiting for knife must must see such crescendo see change indeed change change without plan without heart consider for example migration of bird across mediterranean tragic absurdity of incident age ago for long age there stretched continuous land connexion from africa to europe then instinct be formed bird flew over land from heated south to northern summer to build breed slowly age by age sea crept over neck of land linking tract have be broken now for hundred thousand year yet over constantly widening sea in myriad perish exhausted instinct blind pitiless still drive bird again think of vain urgency for purpose long since forgotten drive swarming lemming to fate look at man evolution crown consider want of balance invalidism of woman extravagant disproportion of desire consider record of rock honestly frankly where can trace crescendo suggest there have be great age of marvellous tree fern wonderful forest swamp glorious growth have died did not go on reached climax died sort of plant succeeded then think of wonderful fauna of mesozoic time age of leviathan theriodonts reptilian beast leaping dinosaur mososaurs

ancestor be hiding under leaf climbing into tree to be out of way of crescendo a motif of crescendo sang exceedingly small now for little while world be ours wax in turn to what good to what end tell who say world be good tell end how can escape at last common fate under darkling sky of frozen world paused for moment weary with speaking there be comfort said in flower star assurance in past sure hope in future there be nothing god of faith courage in heart of men give sign of power earnest of victory give sign whereupon sir eliphaz breathed word immortality let say word two upon immortality said sir eliphaz breaking suddenly into eagerness for presume be thing have forgotten that see be difference between mr hus be why can sit here content to play partial rles knowing full surely that day broken line inconsecutivenesses perplex in life will be revealed resolved into perfect circle while to whom earthly life be final must need be rebel must need preach doctrine between defiance despair if indeed death ended ah then indeed might claim that reason be on side affliction of man be very many why must deny patentee chief proprietor of temanite block paused for moment yes said peering up through eyebrow at sky be real issue blind to that be blind to everything dont know whether be with on question of immortality sir eliphaz warned dr barrack coughing shortly for part im altogether with said mr dad if there be immortal lifewell whats good of being temperate decent careful for five fifty year sir eliphaz have decided now to drop apologetics for scheme of nature place of trial place of stimulus training said respice finem clue be allbeyond if really consider world a place for soul making said mr hus what do think be doing when propose to turn woldingstanton over to farr at rate said farr tartly want soul blackening counsel of despair at woldingstanton want boy taught to serve help first in lowly economic sphere cheerfully enterprisingly then in higher thing before pas on if death end then what be good of trying mr dad said still brooding over question if thought that added with deep conviction must let go anyone must blew heavily stuck hand in pocket sat more deeply in chair indignant man business man asked to give up something for nothing for moment little gathering hung only too manifestly contemplating spectacle of mr dad amidst wine woman waistcoat without restraint letting go eating drinking rejoicing being perfect devil because on morrow have to die immortal said mr hus did not expect immortality to come into discussion be immortal farr asked abruptly hope so said mr farr unworthy though be exactly said mr hus so be way out for mr dad from factory sir eliphaz from building office be to soar be arranged for be why tragic greatness of life be to be hidden from boy yet even so continued mr hus see why must be so anxious for technical science so hostile to history of mankind because be not true history said sir eliphaz hair waving about like hair of man electrified by fresh idea because be bunch of loose end be really not end at only beginning that pas suddenly into unseen admit that in world nothing be rationalized nothing be clearly just admit everything say reason reason because life be only first page of great book have to read sit here mr hus like men in waiting room life be like waiting outside in place of disorder before being admitted to wider reality larger sphere where cruelty confusion everythingwill be explained justifiedand set right paused then perceiving that mr hus be about to speak resumed raising voice slightly speak without book in matter said have be greatly impressedand what be more lady burrow have be greatly impressed by writing of two thoroughly scientific men two thoroughly scientific men dr conan doyle sir oliver lodge ever since lost younger sister early in life lady burrow have followed up interest have be great consolation to point be a sir oliver insists in wonderful book raymond continued existence in world be a proven now a atomic theory in chemistry be not matter of faith knowledge partition be breached at last be in communication news be coming through scientific certainty sir eliphaz cleared throat have already evidence description of life into will pas remember be idle talk deception by sludge like be great english scientific man who publishes record be great french philosopher no le man than wonderful thinkerand how thinksprofessor bergson who counselled publication glory of science glory of philosophy combine to reassure walk at last upon path of fact into further world know already much know for example that who have passed over to higher plane have body still that foundcomforting without thatone must feel bleak message say internal organ be constituted differently naturally a one must have expected dietary be gather practically non existent needle a outline be same space be presume used for other purpose sort of astral storage bleed interesting fact lady burrow sister be now practically bloodless teethshe have lost several suffered greatly with teethher teeth have be replaceda beautiful set used now only for articulate speech raymond over again said doctor have read book said sir eliphaz doctor grunted in manner mingled assent disapproval expression betrayed scientific bigot know now detail of passage said sir eliphaz have particular know for instance that people blown to piece take little time to reconstitute there be correlation between corruptible body spirit body replaces there be sort of spirit doctor over there very helpful in such case burnt body too be trouble sex be still distinct coarseness of sex be gone passion fade in better world passion even habit of smoking craving for alcohol fade not at first newly dead will sometimes ask for cigar be given cigar higher plane cigar ask for more there be child born there nothing of sort that be very important to understand here be place of birth be where life begin coarse little planet be seed bed of life when have served purpose populated higher plane then indeed may freeze a say mere empty hull seed case have served purpose mattering nothing be thought comforting beautiful thought receive endorsement of highest scientific philosophical intelligence one think of life there doubt in other dimension of space that world arranged in planesmetaphorical plane of course in people go to fro living in sort of house surrounded by sort of beautiful thing made so be told from smell of thing have here be curious not irrational favorite doggy will be there sublimated also thought have be great comfort to lady burrow have dog called fido leetle teeny fellowpractically human blessed one engage very largely in conversation other occupation found difficult to trace raymond attended sort of reception on very highest plane be special privilege perhaps compliment to sir oliver met truth of revealed religion so to speak personally be wonderful moment sir oliver suppresses more solemn detail lady burrow intends to write to be anxious for particular will not dilate said sir eliphaz will not dilate believe stuff said doctor in tone of deepest disgust sir eliphaz waved upon questioner so far a poor earthly expression can body forth spiritual thing hedged regarded colleague with eye of florid defiance mr farr mr dad have slightly shamefaced expression mr dad ear be red mr dad cleared throat im sure there something in itanyhow said mr dad hoarsely doing best in support if be born with hare lip said doctor must be put right do congenital idiot get sublimated what becomes of dog one have shot for hydrophobia to of such question said sir eliphaz serenely answer iswe dont know why must mr hus seemed lost in meditation pale sunken face crumpled pose contrasted strongly with bristling intellectual rectitude mounting choler of dr elihu barrack sir eliphaz said mr hus sighed repeated what poor phantom of world people conjure up what mockery of loss love very mother lover who mourn dead will not believe foolish story restoration be crowning indignity make think of nothing in world dear boy body broken crumpled creature half fool half impostor sitting upon getting between talking cheap rubbish over about plane of being astral body after teach sir eliphaz life for grossness pain horror be not so bad a might beif such thing a be true need sifting of evidence to know be untrue sane man belief stuff for ten minute together be impossible to believe dr elihu barrack applauded sir eliphaz acted fine self restraint be contrary to texture of everything know said mr hus be le convincing than wildest dream by pain by desire by muscular effort by feeling of sunshine of rain in face by sense of justice suchlike essential thing do men test reality of appearance before certainly be reality have none of feel of reality will not even argue about be thrust now upon suffering world a comfort even a comfort for people stunned uncritical with grief fails lady burrow may be pleased to think that somehow two with teeth restored complexion rejuvenated will meet again sublimation of faithful fido at rate thank god for know clearly that so will never meet son never have gone from for moment mental physical suffering gripped must not speak purpose to continue be so manifested by sweating face gripping hand that spoke until spoke again now let speak plainly about immortality for surely stand nearest to possibility of of here immortality then be such dodging away a imagine from strange world be so desolating so dreadful so inexplicableand at time so utterly lonely there may be god in universe there may not be god if exists can be terribly silent if there be god be coherent god if there be god above in scheme of thing then not only dead son crushed frog trampled anthill signify on that god in heart insists there have to be answer not only to death of son to dying penguin roasted alive for farthing worth of oil there must be answer to men who go in ship to do such thing there have to be justification for filth wretchedness of louse fluke will not have slipping by on other side chattering of plane of living sublimated atom while there be drunken mother man dying of cholera in world will not hear of god who be just mean for getting away foulness beastliness there be must square god with there be universal god only coldness vast cruel difference must not make peace with god if must tell of black sinister reality what do reply that be all right because after death will get away from why if presently go down under surgeon knife down out of hot weary world then find being put together by spirit doctor in beyond of yours waking up to new world of amiable conversation artificial flower having hair restored gap among teeth filled up will feel like someone who have deserted kind who have sneaked from sickroom into party wellmy infection will go with will talk of nothing tragedy out of have comewhich still remainswhich continuestragedy yet believe in immortality dr barrack who have hitherto be following mr hus with evident approval started sounded note of surprise protest fixed accusing eye upon for moment did not interrupt be not that be immortal god within personal immortality of talk be mockery of personality what be there personal in can live what make very self be matter of little mean thing small difference slight defect where doe personal love gripon just petty thing oh dearly bitterly did love son what be that heart most craves for now virtue ambition achievement none of thing for certain queer flush among freckle for kind of high crack in voice certain absurd hopefulness in talk sound of footstep little halt there be in rhythm of be thing long for be thing wring heart thing be just mortal thing just defect must be touched out upon higher plane talk about must give back to smoothed polished regularized so grant must be if there be to be higher plane what doe leave of personal distinction what doe leave of personal love when son have have defect smoothed away then will be like son when older men have be ironed out will be like younger men there be personality in hope honour righteousness truth son have gone have gone for evermore pain may day go immortal thing in be least personal thing be not who go on living be man life on man universal go on living tragic rebel in same world in other mr hus leant back in chair there burn undying fire in heart of men by fire live by know god of salvation will be truth will be

failure perplexity though universe torment slay yet will trust in if also must dienevertheless can do more must serve ceased for moment one spoke silenced by intensity chapter fifth elihu reproves job dont know how strike said mr farr turning suddenly upon dr barrack wellits interestin said dr barrack leaning forward upon folded arm upon table considering word carefully interestin repeated dont know how far want to hear what think about im rather downright person sir eliphaz with great urbanity motioned to speak on there be if youll forgive nonsense upon side turned to sir eliphaz spook stuff said paused compressed lip shook head wont do have given little attention to evidence in matter im something of psychologista doctor have to be of course sir eliphaz youre not responsible for nonsense have be talking about sublimated brick spook dog made of concentrated smell sir eliphaz be convulsed tut tut said indeed offence sir eliphaz if dont want to talk wont if do then must say what have in mind a say dont hold responsible for thing have be saying cheap medium stuff have be shot upon world by sir oliver j lodge handed out by to people distraught with grief in great fat impressive looking volume end of have tried utmost to take seriously be pitiful business ive doubt man be honest after light what light be obstinate credulity posing a liberalism take pretence dodge of medium accepts explanation edits babble rearranges to make seem striking look at critical ability because many of medium be fairly respectable people who either make money by theirrevelations at most very ordinary livingits guinea go believe usuallyhe insists upon honesty thats key blunder doctor must tell a must have told after first year practice that telling truth be very last triumph of human mind hardly of patient tell truthever isnt only that havent tithe of critical ability detachment necessary havent real desire to tell truth want to produce effect human being be artistic still arent beginning to be scientific minimize exaggerate do if saw cat run over outside came in here to tell about must certainly touch up story make more dramatic hurt cat more make dray bigger so on must want to justify telling story put woman in chair there tell to close eye feel odd shell feel odd right enough tell to produce word sentence that find in head shell produce give hint that come from eastern asia stuff will begin to correspond to idea of pigeon english isnt that be cunningly elaborately deceiving be that want to come up to expectation be focussing interest on human being like to have interest focussed on so long a isnt too hostile shell cling to interest know how shell cling instinctively most of medium never held attention of roomful of people in life until found out way of doing what can expect dr barrack cleared throat thats beside question said dont think that because reject spook stuff im setting up finality for science have to day just little weak squirt of science in world grant there may be force must almost say there must be force in world force universally present of still know nothing take case of electricity what did men know of electricity in day of gilbert practically nothing in early neolithic age doubt if men have ever noticed there be such thing a air grant that most thing be still unknown thing perhaps right under nose doesnt help case of sir eliphaz one little bit unknown thing a become known will join on to thing do know theyll complicate perhaps simplify idea wont contradict general idea theyll be thing in system wont get out of grip of argument mr hus have brought forward so far so far a concern immortality sir eliphaz be see entirely with mr hus fancy dream a fancy about a pretty a creaking board at bedtime a dream unattractive a mr hus have said when come to mr hus immortality then find with gentleman that too be dream le than dream le even than fancy play on word here be undying flame spirit of god in man in say in sir eliphaz in mrdad wasnt in other gentleman whose name didnt quite catch in well extraordinary that none of know of except mr hus how feel about dont know personally object to being made part of god one with mr hus without consent in way prefer to remain may be egotism be by nature egotistical creature agnostic youve got talking now may a well go through with be agnostic really man who accepts fully limitation of human intelligence who take world a find who take a find decline to go further there may be other universe dimension galore there may be fourth dimension for example if like fifth dimension sixth dimension number of other dimension dont concern live in universe in three dimension have more interest in other universe dimension than bug under wallpaper have in deep deep sea possibly there be bug under wallpaper with kind of reasoned consciousness of existence of deep deep sea half belief that when at last keatings powder get thither will go iif may have one more go at imagejust live under wallpaper be agnostic say have have eye pretty well open at universe since came into six thirty year ago not only have never seen heard of smelt touched ghost spirit sir eliphaz have never seen gleam sign of providence great god of world of yours of other minor modern god mr hus have taken up in heart of men have found malformation ossification clot fatty degeneration never god will excuse if speak plainly to gentleman gentleman whose name havent somehow got farr mr farr have brought down on called in be interested in question clear to that since exist there something in what be im convinced havent ganglion even to begin to understand decline wild guess of spookist providentialisti must put there im afraid sir eliphazor metaphor of mr hus fact dr barrack paused put faith in fact there lot in fact said mr dad who found much that be congenial in doctor downright style what do see about asked dr barrack struggle for existence about ask very plain simple question why try to get behind be made study watch put up like cockshy keep on trying to destroy do best to dodge blow got leg head be bloody unbowed reproduce kindas abundantly a circumstance permiti stamp upon universe a much a possible if be right if do right thing have decently good luck will hold out until waning instinct dispose to rest breed influence be mark of rightness what else be there may call struggle what like god if like god for be anthropomorphic idea call process why not evolution said mr hus prefer process word evolution rather begs moral question cheap word shon evolution seems to suggest just simple automatic unfolding process be complex have ups downsas mr hus understands be more like will than automaton will feeling about isnt indifferent to a mr hus suggests us isnt subordinate to a sir eliphaz must have believe playing part of providence just for comfort happiness of be hammer of be anvil of be spark of be beaten stuff survives process doesnt confide in why must learn what can about make what be called practical use of for be what will in process requires mr dad stirred by word practical made noise of assent not very confident noise loan rather than gift be where seems to mr hus go wrong altogether doe not submit to reality set up something called spirit in man god in heart to judge want to judge universe by standard of human intelligence at present stage of development thats where fall out with be not fixed standard man go on developing evolving thing offend sense of justice in mr hus be enduring criterion of justice human sense of justice have developed out of something different will develop again into something different like everything else in have be produced by process will be modified by process thing again say be not beautiful there also must condemn nothing change like sense of beauty band of art student can start new movement cubist vorticist what not change sense of beauty if seeing thing a beautiful conduces to survival will see a beautiful sooner later rest assured daresay hyena admire otherin rutting season anyhow so be with mercy with everything creature have own standard after man be beyond man who may find mercy folly who may delight in thing pain feeble spirit have to obey process in own place own time be how see thing be stark truth of universe looked at plainly hard lip of mr dad repeated noiselessly plainly hard felt very uncertain for moment doctor sat with forearm resting on table a if have done then resumed gather that talk here to day arose out of discussion about education youd hardly believe said mr dad dr barrack next remark checked mr dad growing approval seems perfectly logical to one of thing can never understand about schoolmaster politician suchlike way seem to take for granted can educate not bring in religion socialism belief what be education teaching young people to talk read write calculate in order that may be told how stand in world what think world generally be up to part expect to play in game well how can do at same time leave out what be game be what youngster want to know answering be education either be going to say what think game be plainly straightforwardly else be going to make motion a though be educating when be really doing nothing of kind in case stupid one will grow up with head in muddle be led by old catchword anywhere according to luck clever one will grow up with idea that life be sort of empty swindle most educated people in country believe be sham swindle flounder about never get up against reality amazing how people can lose grip on realityhow most people have way patient come along to tell lieseven about stomach ache idea of anything being direct reasonable have gone clean out of head think can fool about fact when im properly fooled will then humbug stomach into not achingsomehow now gospel be thisface fact take world a be take a be fundamental fact have to face be that process take account of desire fear moral idea anything of sort put up try over if dont stand test knock down end may not be right a test by little human standard be right by atom star then what must proper education be dr barrack paused tell what world be tell rule trick of game mankind have learnt tell be yourselves be yourselves up to hilt be good being anything essential self because dr barrack spoke like one who quote sacred formula there be inheritance of acquired characteristic essential self essential heredity be on trial put everything of into process if process want will accept if doesnt will go under cant help iteither way may be bit of marble be left in statue may be bit of marble be thrown away cant help be dr barrack have sat back raised voice at last word lifted hand a if to smite table so good thing be professional training let hand fall slowly a remembered that mr hus be patient mr hus did not speak for moment be thinking so deeply that seemed to be unobservant of cessation of doctor discourse then awoke to silence with start differ among yourselves so much a may think said at last argue to one end however wide apart starting point may be argue that men may lead fragmentary life reflected further submissive life not submissive said dr barrack in kind of footnote say sir eliphaz that universe be in charge of providence wise amiable that guide world to end can not understand desirable end did know incomprehensible that life whole universe be starting point for developing series of immortal life from conclude that part human being have to play in scheme be part of trustful child need only not pester higher power need only do few simple congenial duty to be surely preserved rewarded carried on there be much in simple faith said sir eliphaz sneer though may view be grimmer one dr barrack say that process be utterly beyond knowledge control can not alter appease make of of vessel of honour of others vessel of dishonour have scrawled race across black emptiness of space may wipe out again such be quality of fate can follow light instinct in end in practical matter teaching march with teaching of sir eliphaz bow to thing be gladly trustfullywith certain old world courtesy grimlyin modern style for moment mr hus sat with compressed lip a though listened to pain within then said dont dont submit rebelnot in own strength by own impulse rebel by spirit of god in rebel not merely to make weak gesture of defiance against black disorder cruelty of space time for mastery be rebel of pridei be full of pride of god in heart be servant of rebellious adventurous god who may yet bring order into cruel frightful chaos in seem to be driven hither thither like leaf before wind god who in spite of appearance may yet rule over at last mould to will what world will be whispered mr farr unable to restrain yet half ashamed of sneer what world be farr what cunning watchful world doe serve even so insecure have become that opportunity may yet turn frightful face upon very moment a snatch see how differ from see that spirit of life of teachingof teachingfor weakness slip failure be fight against dark being of universe who seek to crush who brood over now even a talk to be fight against disorder refusal of very submission have made repudiation altogether of same voluntary death in life moistened lip resumed end substance of real education be to teach men woman of battle of god to teach of beginning of life upon lonely little planet amidst endless star how beginning have unfolded to show how man have arisen through long age from amidst beast nature of struggle god wage through to draw men together out of into one common life effort with nature of god struggle be essence of dispute be struggle with hope of victory with assurance have argued sir eliphaz that be unreal struggle sham fight indeed thing be perfectly adjusted for final happiness when have reminded little of unmasked horror about have shifted ground of compensation into anotherinto incredibleworld sir eliphaz sounded dissent musically then waved long hand a mr hus paused regarded go on said go on now come to dr barrack modern fatalism hold universe be uncontrollableanyhow incomprehensible for good illwe can be no more than strenuous self must say be answer must lose in something altogether greaterin god there be curious likeness doctor curious difference in view mine think see world very much a see see coldly like man before sunrise paused there be light upon asserted with noticeable flatness in voice there be light light became silent for while seemed a if light spoke of have gone from a if shadow have engulfed when spoke again be with evident effort turned to dr barrack think said that there be will in process of yours will take thing somewhere somewhere definitely greater better onward hold that there be will at except in through if there be will at hold that even maxim be be paradox for can not be until have lost ourselves in god have talked to sir eliphaz to since came in of boundless disorder evil of nature let talk to now of boundless misery arise from disorderliness of men must continue age after age until men be united in spirit in truth destroyed through own incoherence whether men will be lost saved know there have be time when be sure that god must triumph in dark shadow have fallen upon spirit consider posture of men affair now consider where stand to day because have not yet begun to look deeply frankly into reality because a put take life a find because be heedless of history realize in truth be part in one great adventure in space time for four year now world have be marching deeper deeper into tragedy life seemed so safe grows insecure more more insecure six million soldier six million young men have be killed on battlefield alone three time a many have be crippled mutilated a many again who be not soldier have be destroyed have be only beginning of disaster have come upon race human relationship have be strained road ship harvest destroyed behind red swift tragedy of warfare come gaunt desolating face of universal famine now behind famine that inevitable follower of famine pestilence gentleman who have played so useful part in supplying munition of war who have reason in day well spent energy well used to see transitory brightness upon sombre thing may tell that lack faith when say can see nothing to redeem waste destruction of last four year still greater waste spiritless disorder poverty disease ahead of will tell that world have learnt lesson must learn in other way that will set up world league of nation now put end to war on will set up world league of nation what foundation have made in last four year ruin be there common idea common understanding yet in mind of men be still taking world a find be being unmitigated self more than ever below few who scramble for profit now be more more wolfish multitude scrambling for bread there be common idea in men mind upon can build how can men be united except by common idea school have failed world what common thought be there in world loud bawling of base newspaper posturing of politician can see chaos coming again over east of europe now bit by bit western europe crumbles drop into confusion art science reasoned thought creative effort such thing have ceased altogether in russia may have ceased there perhaps for century die now in germany university of west be bloodless drained of youth that war seemed at first so like dawn of greater age have ceased to matter in face of greater disaster french british american be beating back german from paris can beat back to distance will not present counterthrust diminish fail a others have done side may first drop exhausted now will hardly change supreme fact supreme fact be exhaustionexhaustion mental a well a material failure to grasp comprehend cessation even of attempt to grasp comprehend slackening of sort of effort whats good of such despair said mr dad despair what be good of lying about hope success in midst of failure gathering disaster what be good of saying that mankind winsautomaticallyagainst spirit of evil when mankind be visibly losing point after point be visibly losing heart what be good of pretending that there be order benevolence sort of splendid incomprehensible process in festering waste windy desolation of tremendous thing there be reason anywhere there be creation anywhere except undying fire spirit of god in heart of men may fail may fail seems to to fail paused dr barrack cleared throat dont want to seem obdurate said dr barrack want to respect deep feeling one must respect deep feeling for life of cant put much meaning into phrase spirit of god in heart of men rather against habit to worry patient be so interestingthis be exceptional occasion must like to ask mr hussfranklyis there anything very much more to than phrase there be answer word said mr dad joost word if mr hus have ever spent three month of war time running big engineering factory mind be sceptical mind dr barrack went on after staring moment to see if mr dad meant to finish sentence want thing can feel handle be agnostic by nature habit profession doubting thomas born bred well take about universe mr hus be very much of agnostic too more so doubt more than do doubt whether there be trace of plan purpose in what call process call windy desolation see chaos still waiting for creator then set up against that undying fire of spirit of god be lit in only waiting to be lighted in sort of insurgent apprentice creator well doctor frowned meditated on word want more of practical outcome of fire admit certain poetry in idea be plain practical man give something to know fire by to recognize again when see wont ask why undying wont quibble about what doe undying fire mean in actual thing daily life in way be mixed up with teaching history in school faint note of derision made glance at face to right that doesnt strike a being so queer a seems to strike mr farr interest there be cause for think there be several link mr hus hasnt shown several vital point still have to explain undying fire be something be burning in mr hus gather from pretty broad hint ought think to be burning in meand gentleman be something make forget little personal difference make forget brings into line againstwhat thats first pointagainst what dont see force value of line up think struggle against one by nature necessity that polish one in struggle sharpen edge think that out of struggle for existence come better thing better may not be better thing by standard now by standard of process be sometimes mill of process may seem overpoweringly grim high pitiless be question of scale mr hus doe not believe in struggle want to take men mind teach so that will not struggle against other live work together for what be second pointfor what there be rationality in idea of everlasting struggle making incessantly for betterment such idea doe at rate give direction take somewhere there be rationality in declaring be still fighting fighting more than ever while in effect be arranging to stop that struggle carry life onif canif can be paradox of mr hus when there be competition at home war abroad when cat bird have come to satisfactory understanding when spirit of human god rule even in jungle sea then where will be heading time will be still unfolding man will have halted if have ceased to compete individually will have halted mr hus look at a if thought wronged in saying well then must answer question what will human god be leading against what will be living for let tell first what spirit of god struggle against said mr hus will not dispute that process of yours have made good thing good thing in man have made a well a evil have made indifferently in usin of usit have made will to seize upon chance born good separate from chance born evil spirit of god rise out of process a if be part of process except for good evil be inextricably mixed good thing flower into evil thing evil thing wholly partially redeem by good consequence good evil have meaning only for process be indifferent make destroys favour torment on own account preserve nothing continues nothing be just careless for have made opportunity life be opportunity unless do now ourselves seize hold upon life process while be in process becoming uncontrollable again will presently sweep altogether away in back of mind doctor be belief in happy ending just a much a in mind of sir eliphaz see deeper because be not blinded by health think that beyond man come sort of splendid super man healthy delusion there be nothing beyond man unless men will that something will be will be wiped out a carelessly a have be made something else will come a disconnected aimless something necessarily better necessarily worse something different to be wiped out in turn unless spirit of god move in can rouse to seize universe for be nature of process process be just chaos man be opportunity passing opportunity for order in waste people write talk a if great war be now wrecking world be dramatic consecutive thing talk of a purge a great lesson a phase in history mark end of war division so might be be so will be so asked little time ago to look straightly at reality of animal life of life in general a know think did little persuade to own sense of willowness of assumption that there be natural happiness poor beast creature have to suffer ask now to look a straightly at thing that men have done endured in war be plain that have shown extraordinary fertility ingenuity in invention have used amazing capacity for sacrifice courage be argue equally plain that pain agony have undergone have taught race little nothing that device have be mainly for own destruction only lesson only betterment can come out of war will come if men inspired by divine courage say such thing must end perceive saying that on other hand do perceive great amount of human energy ability have be devoted be still being devoted to thing lead straight to futility extinction most desolating thing about war be stupidity cruelty of streak of perversion have run through against meagreness of intelligence made war against absolute inability of good force in life to arrest end ask to balance intelligence devotion have gone to enterprise a offensive use of poison gas consider ingenuity elaboration of that different sort of shell used beautifully finished device to delay release of poison so a to catch men unawares after gas mask be removed one method much in favour with german now involves use of two sort of gas have gas now not very deadly so subtle that penetrates gas mask produce nausea retching man be overcome by dread of being sick so that will clog mask suffocate snatch off protection in ungovernable physical panic then second gas of coarser more deadly type come into play that breathes in fully breath catch realizes what have done be too late death have by throat pass through horrible discomfort torment to end cough stagger writhe upon ground be deadly sick die heaving panting with staring eye so be men be being killed now be one of multitude of method disgusting undignified monstrous intelligent technically admirable can not deny doctor barrack that ingenious mixture be one of last fruit of process to process have at last brought men from hoeing herding of neolithic day now tell how be onward progress of mankind to anything anywhere secured by fine flower of process intellectual energy industrial energy be used up without stint to make horror possible multitude of brave young men be spoilt killed be there selection in along such line can imagine men life universe getting anywhere at why do do such thing do out of complete organized impulse to evil if took series of research invention led at last to use of poison gas must find be work of multitude of mainly amiable fairly virtuous kindly meaning men one be doing bit a mr dad must say one to use phrase doctor be being utilizing gift be in in accordance with drift of world about one sir eliphaz be modestly taking world a found be living in uninformed world with common understanding collective plan world ignorant of true history with conception of future into horror drifted for want of world education out of horror lesson will be learnt will can arise for same reason man life ignorantly in own circumstance from hand to mouth from day to day swayed first of by catchword then by let take instance of way in human ability energy if be left to without co ordination without common basis of purpose without god will run into cul de sac of mere horribleness let remind little of what submarine be what signifies in country think of submarine a instrument of murder think of a something ingeniously contrived at rate not tormenting destroying hand guide will not recall to story fill newspaper of men drowning in night of crowded boatload of sailor passenger shelled sunken of men forced to clamber out of sea upon destroying u boat robbed of lifebelts in order that when submerged must be more surely drowned want to think of submarine in there be kind of crazy belief that killing however cruel have kind of justification in survival of killer make that excuse for instance for destruction of native tasmanians who be shot whenever be seen killed by poisoned meat left in path marvel of submarine be that also torture kill own crew be miracle of short sighted ingenuity for common unprofitable reasonless destruction of german enemy be almost quintessential example of elaborate futility horror into partial idea about life combative competitive idea of life thrust mankind take poor german boy with ordinary sort of intelligence ordinary human disposition to kindliness gallantry who becomes finally sailor in one of craft consider case what do to will find in sample of what be doing for mankind a child be ingenuous teachable plastic be also egotistical greedy suspicious be easily led easily frightened like making thing if know how to make be capable of affection capable of resentment be sheet of white paper upon anything may be written parent teach companion school do teach anything of great history of mankind do teach of blood brotherhood with men do tell anything of discovery of exploration of human effort achievement teach that belongs to blonde wonderful race only race matter on planet such distinct race ever existed be lie for damning of men teacher incite to suspicion hatred contempt of other race fill mind with fear hostility everything german tell be good splendid everything not german be dangerous wicked take poor actor of emperor at potsdam glorify until shine upon lad mind like star boy grows up mental cripple capacity for devotion self sacrifice be run into mould of fanatical loyalty for kaiser hatred for foreign thing come war youngster be only too eager to give where be most needed be told that submarine war be sure way of striking enemy of country conclusive blow to be in submarine be to be at spear point dare scarcely hope that will be accepted for vital service to prince might aspire be fortunate be train for submarine know how far gentleman remember youth schoolmaster perhaps remembers more of early adolescence than other men because be being continually reminded of be time of very fine emotion boundless ambition newly awakened eager sense of beauty youngster see a hero fighting for half divine kaiser for dear germany against cold evil barbarian who resist must destroy pass through drill training go down into submarine for first time clamber down narrow hatchway be little cold wonderful marvellous machine how can such nest of invention ingenuity beautiful metal work wonderful craftsmanship be anything right mind be full of dream of proud enemy battleship smitten heeling over into water while watch handiwork with stern pride restrained exultation sense of germany vindicated be how mind have be made for be sort of mind have be made be being made in boy over world because there be common plan in world because person in making of boy just a person in making of submarine have be done bit followed own impulse interest without regard to whole regardless of plan purpose in human affair ignorant of spirit of god who must unify lead to common use for gift energy let go on with story of youngster come day when realizes reality of work be doing for kind stand by one of gun of submarine in attack upon wretched ocean tramp realizes that war wage be heroic attack on pride predominance mere murdering of traffic see little ship shelled wretched men killed wounded tyrant of sea sailor men like see boat smashed to piece mostly such sinking be done at dawn sundown under level light display world of black line black silhouette asway with slow heaving falling of coldly shining water little black thing realizes incredulously that struggle disappear amidst wreckage be head of men brother to for hundred of thousand of men who have come into war expecting bright romantic tremendous experience first killing must have be hideous disillusionment for none so much a for men of submarine that sense of being right fine that carry men into battle carry most of through world must have vanished completely at first vision of reality man must have asked what be doing in night must have lain awake stared at question in horrible doubt scold too much at german submarine crew in country most of in place must be impelled to go on a go on work do have be reached step by step logically inevitably because world have be content to drift along on false premise haphazard assumption about nationality race order of thing thing have happened because technical education of men have be better than historical social education once men have lost touch with failed to apprehend idea of single human community idea be substance of true history essential teaching of god be towards such organized abomination a that driftnecessarily people in country who be just a incoherent in mind just a likely to drift into kindred cul de sac of conduct must have u boat men torturedto show superiority of own moral standard indeed men be tortured bear yet little longer with boy of mine in u boat ive tried to suggest to with conscience scaredat moment when submarine have made kill moment be rare for most of time u boat be under water hunted thing surface swarm with hostile craft sea plane observation balloon be seeking time u boat come even near to surface may be spotted by sea plane destruction may fall upon even when be submerged below limit of visibility in turbid north sea water noise of engine will betray to listening apparatus happy guess with depth charge may end career want to think of daily life of youngster under condition want to see exactly where wrong idea not wrong idea ruling in world about be driving method of detection by listening apparatus improves steadily nowadays destroyer will follow up u boat sometimes for sixty seventy hour following sound a hound follows scent of quarry at last if u boat can not shake off pursuer must come to surface fight surrender be strangest game of blind man that ever human being played u boat double turn listening also for sound of pursuer at surface be coming nearer be getting fainter unless helpful mud bank be available for to lie up in silence for time u boat must keep moving using up electrical force so ultimately must come to surface to recharge battery a far a possible crew of u boat be kept in ignorance of chase in progress get hint from anxiety irritation of commander from haste variety of order something be going onthey know quite whatsomething may end disagreeably if pursuer try depth charge then know for certain from concussion that hand of death be feeling for in darkness always dread of depth charge must haunt imagination of u boat sailor without notice at hour may come thud concussion to warn that destroying power be on track fragile ship jump quiver from end to end men be thrown about happens to youngster curse damned english if think over what else can expect to curse little nearer rivet will start actual leakage begin letting in pressure of several atmosphere yet little nearer water will come pressing in through crack breach at score of point air will be compressed in lung long death struggle of u boat will begin after hour of hopeless suffering will suffocate drown like rat in flooded tunnel think of life of endless apprehension in confined space below water air be almost always stuffy sometimes be poisonous sort of evil chance may occur in crowded tinful of machinery to release oppressive gas evil odour whiff of chlorine for instance may warn crew of flooded accumulator at first sting of chlorine u boat must come up at risk nothing can be kept dry surface of apparatus furniture sweat continually except where machinery radiates certain heat clammy chill pervades whole contrivance have ever seen thick blubber of whale only by mean of enormous layer of non conductor can whale keep body warm in spite of water about u boat can not afford layer of blubber be at temperature of dark under water life of cold fear suffocation headache nausea be not sustained by hot nourishing food there be blazing galley fire for cook of u boat u boat roll very easily be of course heavier lighter than water in float if by chance touch bottom in willow water bound about like rubber ball on pavement inside sailor be thrown about dashed against machinery be quality of everyday life in u boat retained below surface now think what emergence involves up come until periscope can scrutinize sky nearer sea nothing in sight thank god rise out of water of sailor get breath of fresh air not for there be room time for of to come out fortunate one who get to hatch may even have luck of sunshine to come to surface on calm open sea away from traffic at be secret hope of u boat sailor suppose now there be something in sight then u boat must come up with infinite discretion examine quarry look innocent craft liner trawler cargo boat be innocence certain how doe u boat man know that hasnt gun what new contrivance of hunter may not hide behind harmless looking mask until have put ship down u boat sailor never know what ugly surprise may not have in store for when approach vessel must need be ignorant of what counter attack creep upon from unseen other side a consequence men be in terror of ship hail be wonder then if behaviour be hasty hysterical if curse insult wretched people be proposing to drown if fire upon unexpectedly do strange abominable thing u boat man be fine captain on quarter deck be man who life life of intense physical hardship extreme fear who face overwhelming risk in order to commit a inglorious crime a man can commit be man already in hell german do what can to keep up spirit of crew english captain who spent fortnight upon one a prisoner who be recently released by way of switzerland say that when have sunk merchant ship played victory music on gramophone imagine that bleak festival inevitable end of u boat sailor unless be lucky enough to get captured be death very horrible slow death indeed sooner later be bound to come never return from first voyage there be brief spree ashore if do then out go again perhaps return second time perhaps not may even have made score of voyage sooner later be caught average life of u boat be le than five voyagesout home of crew of original u boat began u boat campaign very few men survive to day when young hopeful left home in germany to join u boat service left for certain death learns that slowly from conversation of mate men be so scarce now for vile work once germany have got man will use to end that end be given particular of fate of one u boat be told by two prisoner who died at other day particular boat be got by mine tore hole in aft be too disabled to come to surface began to sink tail down now immediate effect of hole in u boat be of course to bring air pressure within to same level a pressure of water outside for ten yard of depth mean addition of fourteen pound to square inch ear blood vessel be suddenly subjected to enormous pressure there be at once violent pain in ear weight on chest cotton wool have to be stuffed into ear nostril to save ear drum then boat be no longer on even keel men stand slip about on side of thing clamber up floor out of way of slowly rising water for water doe not come rushing in to drown speedily can not do because there be escape for air water creep in steadily stealthily a u boat go deeper deeper be process of slow crushing submergence have cruel deliberation of story by edgar allan poe may last for hour time come when light go out rising water stop apparatus for keeping up supply of oxygen absorbing carbonic acid suffocation begin think of what must happen in mind of doomed men crowded together amidst machinery in particular case prisoner described several of men drowned deliberately in rising water inside boat in case where boat be recovered full of dead men have put head under water inside boat people say u boat men carry poison against such mischance a dont must be too tempting when becomes evident that u boat can never recover surface there be usually attempt to escape by hatch hatch can be opened when at last pressure inside be equal to of water without water of course rush in sink u boat to bottom like stone men who be nearest to hatch have chance of escaping with rush of air to surface there be of course violent struggle to get nearest to hatch be what happened in case of particular u boat from prisoner came forward hatch be opened patrol boat cruising above saw water thrown up by air burst then head of men struggling on surface most of men be screaming with pain of went under before must be picked up except two two died in day so died because coming suddenly up to ordinary atmosphere out of compressed air of sinking submarine have burst tissue of lung be choked with blood think of poor creature dying in hospital be worn out by fit of coughing hmorrhage there must have be moment of exhausted quiet before end when youngster lay stared at bleak wall of ward thought when asked have be doing what have done have world done for have made murderer have tortured wasted meant well by whether thought at about making of submarine numberless ingenuity device patience devotion have gone to make grim trap in have be caught at last can not guess probably took a matter of course so be that german youngster who dreamt dream who have ambition who wished to serve do brave honourable thing died so five thousand men at least have died english of a well a german in lost submarine beneath water of narrow sea there be story true story be more striking than fate of most men woman in world be in essence different be not whole life of time in vein of story be not story of youth hope possibility misled marched step by step into world misconceived thrust into evil driven down to ugliness death only more vivid rendering of what be now common fate of great multitude be there one of who be not in fashion aboard submarine doing evil driving towards evil end be business in men engage how many of have likeness to freighted ship serve good of mankind think of lying cornering crowding outbidding professional etiquette robs common man unfair advantage smugly accepted what man among can say do be service holding effort be much better than long interlude below surface when come up to struggle for own hand torpedoing competitor wrecking antagonist how be with submarine sailor stare in twilight at drowning men day stare at world drowning in poverty ignorance world awash in sea of hunger disease misery have be given leisure freedom intelligence what have done to prevent thing tell world be submarine one of be something of u boat man fool who squeal in paper for cruelty to u boat men realize own part in world might live in sunshine freedom security live cramped cold in bitter danger because be at war with fellow men there doctor have answer to first part of question asked what spirit of god in man be against be against mental confusion ignorance thrust life into frightful cul de sac that god in heart urge to fight be cry out in heart to save from blind alley of selfishness darkness cruelty pain in race must die be cry for high road be salvation be commanding organized unity of mankind lassitude have be earlier apparent in manner of mr hus have vanished be talking now with more energy eye be bright there be flush in cheek voice be low speech be clear longer broken by painful pause question have double edge continued asked not only what be that spirit of god in fight against what be fight for whither doe high road lead have told what think life of man be felted corrupting mass of tragic experience let tell now little if pain at side will still permit life upon earth under leadership of spirit of god captain might be will take that men be still a be that world be individually same will suppose miraculous change in human nature will suppose that event in past have run along different channel so that there have be much more thinking much more exchange of thought far better teaching want simply world better taught so wherever flame of god can be lit have be lit everyone will suppose educated by educated to be explicit mean knowledge understanding of history yes mr farrsalvation by history everyone about earth will suppose have be taught not merely to read write calculate have be given can be told simply plainly of past history of earth of place in space time true history of mankind will not suppose that there be greater knowledge of thing than men actually posse to day instead of being confusedly stored in many mind many book many language have be sorted out set out plainly so that can be easily used have be kept back from one mistold to one moreover will suppose that instead of myriad of tongue dialect men can read same book talk together in same speech may say be difficult supposition be not impossible supposition quite few resolute men must set mankind definitely towards such state of affair so that must reach in dozen generation so think what difference there must be from condition in world in world so lit opened by education most of violent dissension trouble mankind must be impossible instead of men community behaving like fever patient in delirium striking at nurse oversetting food medicine inflicting injury on one must be alive to fact of common origin common offspringfor at last in descendant life must meet againand common destiny in more open fresher air fire be god will burn more brightly for most of who fail to know god fail through want of knowledge many more men woman will be happily devoted to common work of mankind evil be in of will be more plainly seen more easily restrained doubt if man be altogether evil in dark world good in men be handicapped sacrifice be mocked bad example finish what weak aimless teaching have begun be world where folly hate can bawl sanity out of hearing only determination of schoolmaster teacher can hope to change that how can hope to change by anything teaching can not realize what teaching mean when ask to suppose world instructed educated in place of old traditional world of unguided passion greed meanness mean bestiality world taught by men instead of world neglected by hireling ask to imagine miraculous change in human nature ask only to suppose that mind have utmost enlightenment of be capable instead of being darkened overcast everyone be to have best chance of being best self everyone be to be living in light of acutest self examination clearest mutual criticism naturally will be living under infinitely saner more helpful institution state of thing will not indeed mitigate natural vanity natural self love will not rob greedy man of greed fool of folly eccentric of abnormality lustful of lust will rob of excuse hiding place will light within cast light round about will turn evil to likeness of disease of in clear moment will be ready to be cured will hesitate to transmit be world such of schoolmaster teacher among a have undying fire of god already lit in heart do now labour generation by generation against defeat sometimes against hope to bring about be present work god have for a do bring about then prospect open out before mankind to splendour in present world men live to be having life lose in world that be seeking to make will give to god of mankind so will live indeed will a matter of course change institution method so that men may be used to best effect in common work of mankind will take little planet have be torn into shred of possession make again one garden most perplexing thing about men at present time be lack of understanding of vast possibility of power happiness that science be offering then why not teach science cried mr farr provided only that will unite effort solve problem of material science in vain until have solved social political problem when be solved mechanical technical difficulty be trivial be occult secret be plain demonstrable thing to day that world must give ample food ample leisure to human being if only by world wide teaching spirit of unity must be made to prevail over impulse to dissension not only that must then be possible to raise common health increase common fund of happiness immeasurably look plainly at world a be most human being when be not dying untimely be suffering more le from avoidable disorder be ill be convalescent be suffering from crippled by preventable taint in blood be stunted weakened by needlessly bad food supply spiritless feeble through bad housing bad clothing dull occupation insecurity anxiety few enjoy for very

that live in state of general infection ill health bad temper ill nourished ill housed morally horrible when light be ready to shine upon health splendour be within grasp that that must so attain must be prelude to still greater attainment apart from above sweeping away of poverty filthiness misery of life must follow on intelligent use of such power such quality a men posse now there must be tremendous increase in happiness due to contentment of belonging to one common comprehensible whole of knowing that one played part worthy part in immortal universal task merest handful of people can look with content upon tenor of life to day few teacher be perhaps aware that serve god rightly few scientific investigator few doctor bridge builder maker of machinery few food grower sailor like can

nature spews people into being there be light to guide step yet there be work to be done by everyone plain reason for work happiness in doing of know if of realize that systematic organization of human intelligence upon work of research must mean for race people talk of wonder scientific work have given in past two hundred year wonder of for most part be too disordered foolish to avail fully what scientific research have produced so far must be a yet only smallest earnest of what scientific research can presently give mankind knowledge make to day different from world of queen elizabeth have be work of few score thousand men mostly poorish men working with limited material restricted time in world discouraged misunderstood many hundred of thousand of men with gift must have be of

at beginning of achievement presently will take body life mould to will that will take gladness beauty for a girl will pick flower twine in hair have said doctor barrack that when industrial competition end among men change in race will be at end said that unthinkingly for when collective will grows plain there will be blind thrusting into life blind battle to keep in life like battle of crowd crushed into cul de sac more quality serve great end of race will be cherished increased sort of men woman have quality least will be made to understand necessary restraint of limitation said that when men ceased to compete must stand still rather be true that when men cease internecine war then then alone can race sweep forward race will grow in power beauty swiftly in generation will grow not only human race world will man make garden for ruling not only kind life live banishing cruel from life making others merciful tame beneath hand fly mosquito thorn poison fungus in blood murrain upon beast will utterly end will rob atom of energy depth of space of secret will break prison in space will step from star to star a now step from stone to stone across stream until stand in

weak weary man talk talk then desolating sense of reality blow like destroying gust through mind little lamp of hope go out be a if great adversary sat over world mocking in phrase use act do sighed deeply have answered question doctor asked speak of god said dr barrack speak of a god be really what men understand by god seems to a said to begin with be just personification of good will in why bring in god god be word have become associated with sort of black cruel thing set one thinking of priesthood orthodoxy persecution why do not call upward onward power humanity why do not call spirit of men then might be possible for agnostic like to feel sort of agreement because have already shown be not humanity be not spirit of men humanity spirit of men made poison gas submarine spirit of man be jealous aggressive partizan humanity have greed competition in grain spirit of man be fear hatred secrecy conspiracy quite a much a much more than be making order spirit in fire call god be lit know not how a if came from outside use phrase said mr hus that come ready to mind will meet so far a to say that know that be metaphorical inexact spirit come into lifeit be more like person than thing so call be not feature not aspect of thing selection among thing seizes upon brings out confirms be generous in natural impulse of mind condemns cruelty evil will not pretend to explain what can not explain may be that god be a yet only foreshadowed in life may reason doctor barrack that fire in heart that call god be a much outcome of process a other thing in life can not argue against what be telling now be not what believe so much a what feel to seems that creative desire burn in be thing different in nature from blind process of matter be force running contrariwise to power of confusion do know once be lit in man be like consuming fire once be lit in man then mind be alightthenceforth rule conscience with compelling power summons to live residue of day working fighting for unity release triumph of mankind may be mean still cowardly vile still will know for what be ancient phrase live marvellously within heart know that redeemer liveth stopped abruptly dr barrack be unprepared with reply shook head obstinately time worn phrase be hateful to soul smacked to of hypocrisy of bidding for favour with obsolete discredited influence through such leak be superstition come soaking back into laboriously bailed out mind of men yet mr hus be difficult controversialist to grapple said doctor provisionally fate came to relief of dr barrack little conference at sea view
