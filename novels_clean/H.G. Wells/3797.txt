be because curate clock be slow partly be due to commercial obstinacy of shoemaker who must try on pair after have declared time be up bought final pair however gave wrong address for return of old one only ceased to feel like nietzschean over man when saw train running out of station even then did not lose head occurred to almost at once that in event of prompt pursuit there must be great advantage in not taking train from clayton indeed to have done so must have be error from only luck have saved a be have already be very indiscreet in inquiry about shaphambury for once on scent clerk must not fail to remember now chance be against coming into case did not go into station therefore at made demonstration of having missed train walked quietly past down road crossed iron footbridge

nearer bungalow be very still now if walked softly to from open window from something seen overheard might get clue to guide must advance circuitously creeping upon must walk straight to door be bright enough for to recognize clearly at distance of many pace difficulty to mind lay in that if involved other people by question might at last confront betrayer with others close about ready to snatch weapon seize hand besides what name might bear here boom sound crept upon sens then again came turned impatiently a one turn upon impertinence beheld great ironclad not four mile out steaming fast across dappled silver from funnel spark intensely red poured out into night a turned came hot flash of gun firing seaward answering red flash streaming smoke in line between sea sky so remembered remember staring at itin state of stupid arrest be irrelevance what have thing to do with with shuddering hiss rocket from headland beyond village leapt up burst hot gold against glare sound of third fourth gun reached window of dark bungalow one after leapt out square of ruddy brightness flared flickered became steadily bright dark head appeared looking seaward door opened sent out brief lane of yellow to mingle be lost in comet brightness that brought back to business in hand boom boom when looked again at great ironclad little torchlike spurt of flame wavered behind funnel must hear throb clangor of straining engine became aware of voice of people calling to one in village white robed hooded figure man in bathing wrap absurdly suggestive of arab in burnous came out from one of nearer bungalow stood clear still shadowless in glare put hand to shade seaward eye shouted to people within people withinmy people finger tightened on revolver what be war nonsense to must go round among

word german said shes caught one disputed that there followed little indistinct babble of argument went on slowly in circuit have marked out watching people a went shouted together with such common intensity of direction that halted looked seaward saw tall fountain flung by shot have just missed great warship second rose still nearer third fourth then great uprush of dust whirling cloud leapt out of headland whence rocket have come spread with slow deliberation right left hard on enormous crash man with full voice leapt cried hit let see of course have to go round beyond bungalow then come up towards group from behind high pitched woman voice called honeymooner honeymooner come out see something gleamed in shadow of nearer bungalow man voice answered from within what said did not catch suddenly heard nettie calling very distinctly weve be bathing man who have first come out shouted dont hear gun theyre fightingnot five mile from shore eh answered bungalow window opened out there did not hear reply because of faint rustle of own movement clearly people be too much occupied by battle to look in direction so walked now straight toward darkness held nettie black desire of heart look cried one pointed skyward glanced up behold sky be streaked with bright green trail radiated from point halfway between western horizon zenith within shining cloud of meteor streaming movement have begun so that seemed to be pouring westwardly back toward east with crackling sound a though whole heaven be stippled over with phantom pistol shot seemed to then a if meteor be coming to help descending with thousand pistol like curtain to fend off unmeaning foolishness of sea boom went gun on big ironclad boom gun of pursuing cruiser flashed in reply to glance up at streaky stirring light

green curtain be black one earth thing ceased to be book second green vapor chapter first change seemed to awaken out of refreshing sleep did not awaken with start opened eye lay very comfortably looking at line of extraordinarily scarlet poppy glowed against glowing sky be sky of magnificent sunrise archipelago of gold beached purple island floated in sea of golden green poppy too swan necked bud blazing corolla translucent stout seed vessel stoutly upheld have luminous quality seemed wrought only from more solid kind of light stared unwonderingly at thing for time then there rose upon consciousness intermingling with bristling golden green head of growing barley remote faint question where might be drifted vanished again in mind everything be very still everything be a still a death felt very light full of sense of physical well being perceived be lying on side in little trampled space in weedy flowering barley field be in inexplicable way saturated with light beauty sat up remained for long time filled with delight charm of delicate little convolvulus twined among barley stem pimpernel laced ground below then question returned what be place how have come to be sleeping here must not remember perplexed that somehow body felt strange to be unfamiliari must not tell howand barley beautiful weed slowly developing glory of dawn behind thing partook of same unfamiliarity felt a though be thing in very luminous painted window a though dawn broke through felt be part of exquisite picture painted in light joy faint breeze bent rustled barley head jogged mind forward who

small very bright inaccessible like thing watched through microscope clayton swathinglea returned to mind slum darkness dureresque minute in rich dark color pleasing through went towards destiny sat hand on knee recalling that queer passionate career have ended with futile shot into growing darkness of end thought of shot awoke emotion again there be something in now something absurd that made smile pityingly poor little angry miserable creature poor little angry miserable world sighed for pity not only pity for myself for hot heart tormented brain straining striving thing of hope pain who have found peace at last beneath pouring mist suffocation of comet because certainly that world be over done be so weak unhappy be now so strong so serene for felt sure be dead one living must have perfect assurance of good strong confident peace have made end of fever called living be dead be right felt inconsistency then must be barley field of godthe still silent barley field of god full of

to indeed everything be very still bird sang surely be alone in world bird sang yes distant sound of life have ceased lowing of cattle barking of dog something be like fear beatified came into heart be all right knew to be alone stood up met hot summons of rising sun hurrying towards a be with glad tidings over spike of barley blinded made step foot struck something hard looked down to discover revolver blue black thing like dead snake at foot for moment puzzled then clean forgot about wonder of quiet took possession of soul dawn bird singing how beautiful be world how beautiful how still walked slowly through barley towards line of elder bush wayfaring tree bramble made hedge of field noted a passed along dead shrew mouse a seemed to among halm then still toad be surprised that did not leap aside from footfall stooped picked up body be limp like life made struggle brightness of eye be veiled did not move in hand seems to now that stood holding that lifeless little creature for

quivering even a watched started into life spread fluttered into air watched fly turn way turn until suddenly seemed to vanish now life be returning to thing on side of with slow stretching bending with twitterings with little start stir came slowly stepping very carefully because of drugged feebly awakening thing through barley to hedge be very glorious hedge so that held eye flowed along interlaced like splendid music be rich with lupin honeysuckle campion ragged robin bed straw hop wild clematis twined hung among branch along ditch border starry stitchwort lifted childish face chorused in line mass never have seen symphony of note like flower tendril leaf suddenly in depth heard chirrup whirr of startled wing nothing be dead everything have changed to beauty stood for time with clean happy eye looking at intricate delicacy before marveling how richly god have made world tweedle tweezle lark have shot stillness with shining thread of song one lark then presently invisibly in air making out of blue quiet woven cloth of gold earth recreatedonly by reiteration of such phrase may hope to give intense freshness of dawn for time be altogether taken up with
