rampound pilby there be professor timbre philosopher there be four smaller though quite good people who must run about very satisfactorily among others at least thought must run about very satisfactorily amongst others not imagining evil of cousin captain douglas good company in shonts filled lady laxton with pleasant realization of progressive success at same time one must confess that felt certain diffidence in heart of heart knew have not made party have happened to how might go on happening to did not know be beyond control hoped very earnestly that everything must pas off well

of pencil a wet a must in order to ensure sufficiently emphatic fourteenth cross on score sheet of doomed thomas most of other thirteen mark be done with such hard breathing emphasis that print of went more than halfway through little blue edged book arrival of week end guest impressed bealby at first merely a blessed influence withdrew four men servant into unknown world on other side of green baize door then learnt that also involved appearance of five new person two valet three maid for whom place have to be laid in steward room otherwise lady laxtons social arrangement have more influence upon mind of bealby than private affair of emperor of china there be something going on up there beyond even curiosity heard of be distant coming going of vehicle slight talk to be inattentive while coachman groom be having drink in pantryuntil maid valet appeared seemed to to appear suddenly out of nothing like slug after rain black rather shiny sitting about inactively quietly consuming small matter disliked regarded without affection respect who cared indicated feeling towards a soon a be out of steward room by gesture of hand nose venerable only by reason of antiquity have thing more urgent to think about than strange valet maid thomas have laid hand on jeered at inflicted shameful indignity on wanted to kill thomas in frightful manner if possible unobtrusively if have be little japanese boy must have be entirely honourable desire must have be bushido sort of thing in gardener stepson however isundesirable thomas on other hand having remarked red light of revenge in bealbys eye being secretly afraid felt that honour be concerned in not relaxing persecution called kicker when did not answer to name called snorter bleater snook finally tweaked ear then saw fit to assume that bealby be deaf that ear tweaking be only available method of address led on to convention of sign language whereby idea be communicated to bealby by mean of painful frequently quite ingeniously symbolical freedom with various part of person also thomas affected to discover uncleanliness in bealbys head succeeded after many difficulty in putting into sinkful of lukewarm water meanwhile young bealby devoted such scanty time a must give to reflection to debating whether be better to attack thomas suddenly with carving knife throw lighted lamp large pantry inkpot of pewter might be effective in way thought doubted whether in event of charge have sufficient stopping power be also curiously attracted by long two pronged toasting fork hung at side of pantry fireplace have reach over dark thought ill concealed emotion mr mergleson prevailed large yet speedy speedy yet exact parroting order making plump gesture performing duty seeing that duty be performed matter came to climax late on saturday night at end of trying day just before mr mergleson went round to lock up turn out light thomas came into pantry close behind bealby who greatly belated through own inefficiency be carrying tray of glass from steward room applied ungentle hand to neck ruffled up back hair in smart painful manner at same time thomas remarked burrrrh bealby stood still for moment then put down tray on table making peculiar sound a did so resorted very rapidly to toasting fork got prong into thomas chin at first prod how swift be change of human soul at moment of thrust young bealby be primordial savage so soon a saw incredible piercing of thomas chinfor care that bealby have taken might just a well have be thomas eyehe moved swiftly through age became simple christian child abandoned violence fled fork hung for moment from visage of thomas like twisted beard of brass then rattled on ground thomas clapped hand to chin discovered blood little never found right word perhaps be just a well instead started in pursuit of bealby bealbyin sudden horror of own actand thomas fled headlong into passage made straight for service stair went up into higher world have little time to think thomas with red smeared chin appeared in pursuit thomas avenger thomas really roused bealby shot through green baize door pursuing footman pulled up only just in time not to follow only just in time have instinctive instant anxious fear of great danger heard something sound a though young of very large animal have squeaked feebly have glimpse of something black whiteand large then something glass thing smashed steadied green baize door be wobbling on brass hinge controlled panting breath listened low rich voice wasejaculating be not bealbys voice be voice of substantial person being quietly deeply angry be ejaculation restrained in tone not in quality of ripe well stored mindno boy thin stuff then very softly thomas pushed open doorjust widely enough to see a instantly let fall back into place very gently yet with alert rapidity turned about stole down service stair superior officer appeared in passage below mr mergleson cried saymr mergleson whats up said mr mergleson he gone who bealby home almost hopefully where up there think ran against somebody mr mergleson scrutinized subordinate face for second then listened intently men listened intently have to fetch out of said mr mergleson suddenly preparing for brisk activity thomas bent lower over banister lord chancellor whispered with white lip sideways gesture of head what about im said mergleson arrested by something in manner of thomas thomas whisper became so fine that mr mergleson drew nearer to catch put up hand to ear thomas repeated last remark he just through thereon landingcursing swearingorrible thingsmore like mad turkey than human being wheres bealby must almost ave run into im said thomas after consideration nowwhere be thomas pantomimed infinite perplexity mr mergleson reflected decided upon line came up service staircase lifted chin with air of meek officiousness went through green door there be one now on landing there be nothing remarkable on landing except broken tumbler half way up grand staircase stood lord chancellor under one arm great jurist carried soda water syphon grasped decanter of whisky in hand turned sharply at sound of green baize door bent upon mr mergleson most terrible eyebrow that ever surely adorned legal visage be very red in face savage looking be said with threatening gesture of decanter voice betrayed noble indignation be who slapped behind slapped behind lord slapped behind dont speakplainly isuch libbuty lord idiot ask plain question with almost inconceivable alacrity mr mergleson rushed up three step leapt forward caught syphon a slipped from lordship arm caught at price overset clasping in hand struck lordship first with syphon on left shin then butted with face be still earnestly respectful in knee lordship leg be driven sideways so that be no longer beneath centre of gravity with monosyllabic remark of topographical nature lordship collapsed upon mr mergleson decanter flew out of grasp smashed presently with emphasis upon landing below syphon escaping from wreckage of mr mergleson drawn doubt by natural affinity rolled noisily from step to step in pursuit of decanter be curious little procession that hurried down great staircase of shonts night first whisky like winged harbinger with pedestrian syphon in pursuit then great lawyer gripping great butler by tail of coat punching furiously then mr mergleson trying wildly to be respectfuleven in disaster first lord chancellor dived over mr mergleson grappling a passed then mr mergleson attempting explanation be pulled backwards over lord chancellor then again lord chancellor be for giddy vindictive moment uppermost second rotation reached landing bang there be deafening report chapter ii week end at shonts week end visit be

mind before train started turned over hibbert journal read in with large tolerance dimly on outskirt of consciousness very fair young man hovered a trifling annoyance a something pink hot rustling sheet of discordant shade of pink a something got in way of leg whistled softly trivial cheerful air just to show how little cared presently very soon vague trouble must pas out of consciousness altogether lord chancellor be mere amateur of philosophy activity in direction be part of public reputation lectured on religion sthetics be fluent hegelian spent holiday be understood in absoluteat rate in germany must sometimes break into philosophy at dinner table particularly over desert be more luminously incomprehensible while still apparently sober than almost anyone article in hibbert

beast say said voice coming out of world of relativity coughing cough of who break silence arent going to shonts be lord chancellor returned slowly to earth just seen label said very fair young man seeim going to shonts lord chancellor remained outwardly serene reflected for moment then fell into snare be more fatal to great lawyer judge perhaps than to other class of men snare of crushing repartee one have come into head nowa beauty then will meet there said in suavest manner wellrather must be great pity said lord chancellor with effective blandness using kind of wry smile that employed to make thing humorous must be great pity dont think to anticipate pleasure having smiled retort well home with head little on one side resumed with large leisurely movement reading of hibbert journal got there said very fair young man belatedly looking boiled to turn after period of restlessness settled down to impatient perusal of black white there whole blessed week end of course young man remarked presently without looking up from paper apparently pursuing obscure meditation vague uneasiness crept into lord chancellor mind a continued to appear to peruse out of what train of thought must such remark arise weakness for crushing retort have little betrayed be however only when found upon platform of chelsome a everyone know be station for shonts discovered mr mr rampound pilby upon platform looking extraordinarily like national monument custodian that lord chancellor began to realize that be in grip of fate that service be doing party by week ending with laxtons be likely to be not simply joyless disagreeable well anyhow have mactaggart must always work in own room by end of dinner lord chancellor be almost at end of large clumsy endurance kept eyebrow furled only by most strenuous relaxation of muscle within be sea of silent blasphemy sort of little thing have accumulated exercised unusual temperance with port old brandy host pressed upon feeling that dared not relax lest rage have way with cigar be quite intelligent at rate smoked listened with faintly perceptible disdain to conversation of other men at rate mr rampound pilby be out of room talk have arisen out of duologue have preceded departure of lady duologue of timbre about apparition reality of future life sir peter laxton released from eye of wife be at liberty to say did not believe in stuff be just thought transference fancy sort of thing declaration did not arrest flow of feeble instance experience into such talk invariably degenerate lordship remained carelessly attentive eyebrow unfurled drooping cigar upward at acute angle contributed anecdote content now then to express compactly by brief sentence of pure hegelianmuch a mahometan might spit why come to that say shonts be haunted said sir peter suppose must have ghost here in time if chose to take on rare place for ghost too very fair young man of train have got name now be captain douglas when be not blushing too brightly be rather good looking be distant cousin of lady laxtons impressed lord chancellor a unabashed engaged people in conversation with cheerful familiarity excluded only lord chancellor even at lord chancellor looked ever again pricked up ear at mention of ghost afterwards when lord chancellor came to think thing over seemed to that have caught curious glance of captain bright little brown eye what sort of ghost sir peter chain eh nothing of sort seems dont know much about wasnt sufficiently interested sort of spook bang about doe mischief whats name plundergeist poltergeist lord chancellor supplied carelessly in pause run hand over hair in dark tap shoulder nonsense dont tell servant sort of thing dont believe in easily explainedwhat with panelling secret passage priest hole priest hole douglas be excited where hid perfect rabbit warren there one going out from drawing room alcove quite good room in way knowa note of wrath crept into sir peter voicethey didnt treat fairly about priest hole ought to have have sketch plan of priest hole when chap be given possession of place ought to be given possession well dont know where half of be thats not possession else might refurnish do up bit guess theyre pretty musty captain douglas spoke with eye on lord chancellor sure there isnt murdered priest in place sir peter asked nothing of sort said sir peter dont believe in priest hole half of em never have priest in pretty tidy rot expectcome to bottom of conversation did not get away from ghost secret passage until men went to drawing room if seemed likely to do so captain douglas pulled back seemed to delight in silly particular sillier be more be delighted lord chancellor be little preoccupied by one of irrational suspicion will sometimes afflict most intelligent of men why did douglas want to know particular about shonts ghost why now then did glance with odd expression at one facea glance half appealing half amused amused be strange fancy lord chancellor must almost have sworn that young man be laughing at at dinner have have that feeling one have at time of being talked about have glanced along table to discover captain rather plain woman idiot timbre wife probably be with head together looking up at quite definitely manifestly pleased by something douglas be telling what be douglas have said in train something like threat exact word have slipped lord chancellor memory lord chancellor preoccupation be just sufficient to make little unwary drifted into grappling distance of mr rampound pilby voice caught like lasso drew in well how be lord moggeridge now asked what on earth be one to say to impertinence be always like spoke to man of calibre of lord bacon a though be speaking to schoolboy home for holiday have invincible air of knowing through everybody gave rather confidence to work than charm to manner do still go on with philosophy said shouted lord chancellor losing self control for moment waving eyebrow about madly go off with for vacation ah lord moggeridge how envy great lawyer long vacation inever get vacation always poor author be pursued by creation sometimes typescript sometimes proof not that really complain of proof confess to weakness for proof sometimes ala criticism such undiscerning criticism lord chancellor began to think very swiftly of tremendous lie must enable to escape at once without incivility from lady laxtons drawing room then perceived that mr rampound pilby be asking be that captain douglas brother who in love with actress woman lord chancellor made answer what thought be great silly idiot how must know think must be onethe one who have to leave portsmouth in disgrace because of ragging scandal did nothing there say organize practical joke of be quite subtle practical joke he cousin of hostess that perhaps account for presence lord chancellor comment betrayed drift of thought hed better not try that sort of thing on here said abominateclowning drawing room did not last very long even lady laxton must not miss manifest gloom of principal guest after good night barley water lemonade on great landing sir peter led lord moggeridge by armhe hated being led by arminto small still spacious apartment be called study lord chancellor be now very thirsty be not used to abstinence of sort sir peter way of suggesting drink roused fury of resentment in that refused tersely conclusively there be nobody else in study captain douglas who seemed to hesitate upon verge of familiar address lord woodenhouse who be thirsty too held vast tumbler of whisky soda with tinkle of ice in on knee in way annoying to parched man lord chancellor helped to cigar assumed middle of fireplace with air of contentment must feel self control running out of heel of boot sir peter after quite unsuccessful invasion of own hearthrugthe lord chancellor stood like rocksecured big arm chair stuck foot out towards distinguished guest resumed talk that have be holding with lord woodenhouse about firearm mergleson have a usual be too attentive to master glass fine edge be off sir peter deference always have carried firearm said always will used properly be great protection even in country how be to know who youre going to run up againstanywhen might shoot hit something said douglas properly used saidproperly used whipping out revolver shooting at man thats not properly used almost a bad a pointing at himwhich be pretty certain to make fly straight at if he got ounce of pluck said properly used mean properly used lord chancellor tried to think about article on infinity while appearing to listen to fool talk despised revolver armed with such eyebrow a be natural for to despise revolver now ive got nice little barker upstairs said sir peter id almost welcome burglar just to try if shoot burglar said lord woodenhouse abruptly with gust of ill temper be frequent at shonts towards bedtime when he not attacking murder sir peter held up offensively pacifying hand know that said neednt tell that raised voice little to increase already excessive accentuation said properly used yawn took lord chancellor unawares caught dexterously with hand then saw douglas hastily pull at little blond moustache to conceal smilegrinning ape what be there to smile at man have be smiling evening up to something now let tell said sir peter let tell proper way to use revolver whip out instantly let fly at ground must never let anyone see revolver ever before hear itsee let fly at ground first off concussion stuns doesnt stun expect dont see there arefive shot left master of situation think sir peter ill bid good night said lord chancellor allowing eye to rest for one covetous moment on decanter struggling with devil of pride sir peter made gesture of extreme friendliness from chair expressive of lord chancellor freedom to do whatever pleased at shonts may perhaps tell little story happened once in morocco eye wont keep open longer said captain douglas suddenly with whirl of knuckle into socket stood up lord woodenhouse stood up too see said sir peter standing also sticking to subject hearer be when be younger than be now must understand wasnt married just mooching about bit between business pleasure under such circumstance one go into part of foreign town where one wouldnt go if one be older wiser captain douglas left sir peter woodenhouse to emerged on landing selected one of lighted candlestick upon table lord whispered grimaced in soliloquy then perceived lord chancellor regarding with suspicion disfavour from ascending staircase attempted ease for first time since train incident addressed lord moggeridge gather lorddont believe in ghost said sir said lord chancellor dont wont trouble to night wont trouble of fine old house anyhow said captain douglas lord chancellor disdained to reply went on way upstairs when lord chancellor sat down before thoughtful fire in fine old panelled room assigned to perceived that be too disturbed to sleep be going to be infernal week end worst week end have ever have mr rampound pilby maddened timbre who be pragmatistwhich stand in same relation to hegelian that small dog doe to large catexasperated loathed laxton detested rampound pilby fearedas far a be capable of fearing anythingcaptain douglas there be refuge soul in house to whom must turn for consolation protection from others slinker bond must talk only of affair of party lord chancellor being lord chancellor have long since lost interest in affair of party woodenhouse must talk of nothing woman be astonishingly negligible there be practically pretty woman there ought always to be pretty young woman for lord chancellor pretty young woman who can at least seem to listen be atrociously thirsty room be supplied only with waterstuff use to clean teethand nothing else good thinking about decided that best thing must do to compose before turning in must be to sit down at writing table write few sheet of hegelianabout that infinity article in hibbert there be indeed better consolation for troubled mind than hegelian exercise lift aboveeverything took off coat sat down to beautiful amusement have scarcely written page before thirst became torment kept thinking of great tumbler woodenhouse have heldsparkling golden cooland stimulating what wanted be good stiff whisky cigar one of laxtons cigar only good thing in entertainment so far then philosophy even a student have be worker of teutonic typenever abstemious thought of ringing demanding comfort then occurred to that be little late to ring for thing why not fetch from study opened door looked out upon great staircase be fine piece of work staircase low broad dignified there seemed to be nobody about light be still on listened for little while then put on coat went with soft swiftness be still quite dignified downstairs to study study redolent of sir peter made modest collection lord moggeridge came nearer to satisfaction a emerged from study night at shonts than at other moment during ill advised week end in pocket be four thoroughly good cigar in one hand held cut glass decanter of whisky in other capacious tumbler under arm with confidence in unlimited portative power of arm that nothing must shake have tucked syphon soul rested upon edge of tranquillity like bird have escaped fowler be already composing next sentence about new variety of infinity then something struck from behind impelled forward couple of pace be something hairy something in nature thought afterwards of worn broom also there be two other thing softer little higher on side then be made that noise like young of large animal dropped glass in hasty attempt to save syphon what in name of heaven cried found alone captain douglas thought leapt to mind indeed be not captain douglas be bealby bealby in panic flight from thomas how be bealby to know that large richly laden man be lord chancellor of england never before have bealby seen anyone in evening dress except butler so supposed be just larger finer kind of butler that kept larger finer kind of butler blocking path of escape bealby have taken in situation with rapidity of hunted animal massive form blocked door to left in playground of village school bealby have be preminent for dodging moved a quickly a lizard little hand head poised with skill of practised butter came against mighty back then bealby have dodged into study seemed to lord moggeridge staggering over broken glass circling about defensively that fearful indignity must come only from captain douglas foolery blup blup sham poltergeist imbecile said a much believing that young man possibly confederate be within hearing said a muchhotly went on to remark of unphilosophical tendency about captain douglas generally about army officer practical joking laxtons hospitality shonts thomas will remember heard nothing came of answer not word of apology at last in great dudgeon

open corner of parcel just little way tin can said in stage whisper enlarged opening blade of grass said professor tried to regard humorously even if have ceased to be decent can still be frank think

night soand anyhow walk thither for tea a william have now returnedhe be sitting on turf afar off smoking nasty looking short clay pipethey rose up departed captain douglas miss philip for reason did not go off exactly with others strayed apart straying away more more into kind of solitude first four married people then two lover disappeared over crest of down for time except for distant sentinel caravan seemed absolutely deserted then clump of bramble against wall of old chalk pit became agitated small rueful disillusioned white smeared little bealby crept back into visible universe again heart be very heavy time have come to go did not want to go have loved caravan have adored madeleine must go must go beautifullytouchingly must wash up before went must make everything tidy must leave behind sense of irreparable loss with mournful precision set about undertaking if mergleson must have seen mergleson must have be amazed made everything look wonderfully tidy then in place where have sat lying on rug found favourite book small volume of swinburne poem very beautifully bound captain douglas have given to bealby handled with kind of reverence so luxurious be so unlike book in bealbys world so altogether of quality strange force prompted for time hesitated then decision came with rush selected page drew stump of pencil from pocket wetted very wet breathing hard began to write traditional message farewell remember art bealby to made original addition washt up before went then remembered that so far a caravan went be not art bealby at renewed wetness of pencil drew black line athwart name of art bealby until be quite unreadable then across again pressing still deeper so that subsequent page re echoed wrote singular word ed rightful earl shonts then be ashamed largely obliterated by still more forcible stroke finally above plainly nakedly wrote dick mal travers put down book with sigh stood up everything be beautifully in order must not do something yet there came to idea of wreathing entire camping place with bough of yew must look lovelyand significant set to work at first toiled zealously be tough to get soon hand be painful cast about for easier way saw beneath hind wheel of caravan great green boughsone particularly splendid long branch seemed to that must be possible to withdraw branch from great heap of stick stone stayed up hind wheel of caravan seemed to that be so be mistaken be idea set to work to do be rather more difficult to manage than have supposed there be unexpected ramification wider resistance indeed thing seemed rooted

at little gentle task of reparation task foolish perhaps not too ably conceived at rate morally gracious william have thought in world satisfaction of appetite that consensus of mankind have definitely relegated to lower category heaven have relegated to lower region of frame came now slinking towards vestige of caravanners picnic one skilled in interpretation of human physiognomy must have failed to read significance of tongue tip drifted over thin oblique lip came so softly towards encampment that bealby did not note partly william thought of remnant of food chiefly be intent to

in eye spot of pink in cheek with expression of lowest cunning reconnoitred bealby bealby be busy about something at back end of caravan tugging at something with swift stealthy movement of entirely graceless sort william got up into front of caravan just for moment hesitated before going in craned neck to look round side at unconscious bealby wrinkled vast nose into unpleasant grimace thena crouching figure of appetitehe crept inside here be laid hand in drawer halted listening what be that suddenly caravan swayed stumbled fear crept into craven soul caravan lurched be moving hind wheel

caravan lady thing round to hotel with characteristic eagerness professor bowles led way so be professor bowles who first saw release of caravan barked one short sharp bark whup cried very quickly whatstheboydoing then quite different style of noise with mouth open whahoop then set off running very fast down towards caravan waving arm shouting a ran yaaps idiot yaaps others be le promptly active down slope saw bealby little struggling active bealby tugging away at yew branch until caravan swayed with effort thenthen there be movement a though thing tossed head reared smash a heap of

in pursuit like wind mr bowles after gasping moment set off after lord face round resolute mr geedge followed at more dignified pace making only really sound suggestion be offered on occasion hue stop cried mr geedge for world like great prototype at balkan conference then like large languid pair of scissors began to run mr geedge after indefinite moment decided to see humour of followed after lord in fluttering rush emitting careful little musical giggle a ran giggle that have learnt long ago from beloved schoolfellow captain douglas miss philip be way behind others situation have already developed considerably before grasped what be happening then obeying instinct of soldier captain came charging to support others miss madeleine philip after wasted gesture realized that nobody be looking at sat down quietly on turf until paralyzing state of affair must cease caravan remained centre of interest without indecent haste complete pause pursued way down road towards tranquil village below except for rumbling of wheel occasional concussion made very little sound once twice there be faint sound of breaking crockery from interior once phantom of angry yell be there be effect of discovered personality about thing vehicle have hitherto be content to play background part yellow patch amidst scenery be now revealing individuality be purposeful touched with suggestion of playfulness at once kindly human have thoughtful instant phase of quick decision yet never once did altogether lose certain mellow dignity there be nothing servile about never for moment for example did betray blind obedience to gravitation be rather a if gravitation be going hand in hand came out into road butted into bank swept round meditated for full second then shaft foremost headed downhill going quietly faster faster swaying from bank to bank shaft went before like arm held out have qualityas if be favourite elephant running to beloved master from whom have be over long separated slightly intoxicated altogether happy yellow guinea pig making for coveted food at considerable distance followed professor bowles miracle of compact energy running so fast that seemed only to touch ground at very rare interval then dispersedly in order according to nature others there be fortunately very little on road there be perambulator containing twin whose little girl guardian be so fortunate a to be high up on bank gathering blackberry ditcher ditching hawker lost in thought cart drawn by poor little black screw of pony loaded with cheap flawed crockery be so popular among poor dog asleep in middle of village street amidst choice of object caravan displayed whimsical humanity reduced child in perambulator to tear passed might have reduced to sort of red currant jelly lurched heavily towards ditcher spared chased hawker up bank whipped off wheel from cart of crockery after interval of astonishment fell like vast objurgation then directed course with grim intentness towards dog just missed dog woke up not moment too soon fled with yelp of dismay then caravan careered on dozen yard further lost energy andthe only really undignified thing in whole careerstood on head in wide wet ditch did with just slightest lapse into emphasis there be a if gave gruntand perhaps there be faintest suggestion of william in gruntand then became quite still for time caravan seemed finished done step hung from upper end like tongue of tired dog except for few minute noise a though be scratching inside be a inanimate a death up hill road twin be weeping hawker ditcher be saying

hasty efficient unsympathetic with lower class williams be ill regulated temperament consummate as began professor bowles when william heard professor bowles say incontinently smote in face when professor bowles be smitten in face grappled instantly very bravely resolutely with william for moment struggled fearfully seemed to be endowed instantaneously with innumerable leg then suddenly fell through door of caravan into interior limb seemed to whirl for wonderful instant then be swallowed up smash be tremendous must not have thought there be nearly so much in caravan still left to get broken healing silence at length smothered noise of still inadequate adjustment within village population in state of scared delight appeared at score of point converged upon catastrophe sound of renewed dissension between william professor inside rearing yellow bulk promised further interest added element of mystery to manifest disaster a bealby still grasping great branch of yew watched event sense of human futility invaded youthful mind for first time realized gulf between intention result have meant so well perceived must be impossible to explain thought of even attempting to explain thing to professor bowles be repellent to looked about with round despairful eye selected direction seemed to promise maximum of concealment with minimum of conversational possibility in direction without needle delay set off eager to turn over entirely fresh page in destiny a soon a possible to get away idea possessed being from crest of down sweet voice floated after retreating form

over from private theatrical have be patched up affair altogether before retired to bed that night lady laxton have given way to accumulated tension wept there be reason why to wind up day sir peter must have stayed in room for hour saying what thought of lord moggeridge felt knew quite well enough what thought of lord moggeridge on occasion always used number of word that did best to believe a delicately brought up woman be unfamiliar to ear so on monday a soon a guest have gone went to bed again stayed there trying a good woman must to prevent thinking of what neighbour must be thinkingand whole affair by studying new very circumstantial pamphlet by bishop fowle on social evil turning over moving illustration of recent antivivisection literature re reading account in morning paper of colliery disaster in north of england to such woman a lady laxton brought up in atmosphere of refinement be almost colourless living life troubled only by small social conflict minor violence of sir peter blameless to point of complete uneventfulness secure comfortable to point of tedium there be something amounting to fascination in wickedness suffering of more normally situated people there be real attraction solace in thought of pain stress a access to other account of vice suffering be restricted kept closely in touch with more explicit literature of various movement for human moralization that distinguish age responded eagerly generously to such painful catastrophe a enliven counterfoil of cheque book witnessed to gratitude for vicarious sensation figured to herself in day dream a calm white shining intervention checking reproving amusement of undesirable nature earning tearful blessing of mangled by product of industrial enterprise there be curious craving for entire reality in feminine composition there be time when in spite of feast of particular wished must come just little nearer to heady dreadfulness of life than simply writing cheque against must have liked to have actually seen votary of evil blench repent before contribution to have unstrapped revived pitied doomed chloroformed victim of so called scientist to have participated in stretcher hospital humanity made marvellous by enlistment under red cross badge sir peter ideal of womanhood be higher than language must not let soil refinement with vision of pain evil in world sort of woman want up

disaster felt must come to might not go to meet so realize how deeply stirred how brightened uplifted to learn from mr merglesons halting statement perhaps probably that almost certainly painful

youve come little boysuffocating can hardly bear suffocating cried mr beaulieu plummer where be in confused manner told asked number of question lady laxton found very tiresome how did know boy be in secret passage of course knew be likely must do if didnt know mightnt have run away how must when be in secret passage why not first scour countryside by time must be smothered starved dead parted with mutual loss of esteem mr beaulieu plummer looking very serious indeed ran a fast a must straight to village telegraph office to be more exact walked until thought out of sight of lady laxton then took to heel ran sat for time in parlour post office spoiling telegraph form composing telegram to sir peter laxton lord cranberry got off at last then drawn by irresistible fascination went back to park watched from afar sign of fresh activity on part of lady laxton saw men coming from direction of stable with large rake with dragged ornamental water then man with pick axe appeared against skyline crossed roof in direction of clock tower bound upon unknown probably highly destructive mission then saw lady laxton going off to garden be going to console mr darling in trouble did through nearly hour half on whole seemed well to mr beaulieu plummer so must be occupied be striking five when telegraph boy on bicycle came up from village with telegram from sir peter laxton stop proceeding

extraordinarily liberal overtime scale after taking step spirit of lady laxton quailed went sat in own room quivered quivered clenched delicate fist must go through with come what might must go on with excavation night if necessary at same time began little to regret that have not taken earlier step to demonstrate improbability of bealby having simply run away set to work to repair omission wrote off to superintendent of police in neighbouring town to nearest police magistrate then on off chance to various of week end guest including captain douglas if be true that have organized annoyance of lord chancellor though still rejected that view did now begin to regard a permissible hypothesis then might also know something about mystery of boy disappearance letter wrote wrote with greater fatigue haste than predecessor more illegibly sir peter arrived long after dark cut across corner of park to save time fell into one of trench mr darling have opened added greatly to clat with came into hall lady laxton withstood for five minute then returned abruptly to bedroom locked in leaving control of operation in hand if he not in house said sir peter be thunderin foolery if he in house he dead if he dead hell smell in bit thenll be time to look for somethin to go upon instead of blind hacking place about wonder theyre threatenin proceeding upon captain douglas lady laxtons letter be destined to have very distracting effect because a came to think over a came to put partly illegible allusion to secret passage missing boy side by side with memory of lord moggeridges

want to win do well at beastly silly elderly childish game paused on verge of ungentlemanly language if thing worth doing at said professor after pause for reflection worth doing well then isnt worth doing at a hole give gameif dont mind captain hot mood be so rapid that already be acutely ashamed of o certainly if wish said professor with gesture professor indicated altered situation to

speculated on probable flight of bealby have be last seen going south by east way lay sea boy fugitive go naturally for sea tried to throw into fugitive mind work out just exactly course bealby must take to sea for time found absorbing occupation bealby probably have money very little money therefore must have to beg steal wouldnt go to workhouse because wouldnt know about workhouse respectable poor people never know anything about workhouse chance be must be too honest too timid to steal hed beg hed beg at front door because of dog thing hed probably go along high road hed be more likely to beg from house than from passer by because door be at first glance le formidable than pedestrian more accustomed to being addressed hed try isolated cottage rather than village street door isolated wayside cottage be so much more confidential hed ask for foodnot money seemed pretty sound now road on mapinto be bound to fall along must go begging other in fine weather hed sleep out hed goten twelve fourteenthirteen thirteen mile day so now ought to be about here to nighthere to morrow at same pacehere suppose got lift hed only get slow lift if got one at wouldnt make much difference in calculation so if to morrow one started went on to cross road marked inn just about twenty six mile must be by scale beat round one ought to get something in way of tidings of mr bealby be there reason why bealby shouldnt go on south by east seaward none now there remained nothing to do to explain clearly to madeleine why didnt come down why didnt come down when one got bealby what must one do with wring truth out of himhalf by threat half by persuasion suppose after hadnt connexion with upsetting of lord moggeridge have hadnt have have have when one have truth whisk boy right up to london confront lord chancellor with fact suppose wouldnt be confronted with fact be touchy old sinner for time captain douglas balked at difficulty then suddenly there came into head tall figure long moustache of kindly popular figure adopted uncle lord chickney suppose took boy straight to uncle chickney told whole story even lord chancellor must scarcely refuse ten minute to general lord chickney clearer plan of captain douglas grew more anxious became to put before madeleineclearly convincingly because first have to catch boy presently a captain douglas fretted at continued eclipse of madeleine thumb went into waistcoat pocket found piece of paper drew out looked at be little piece of stiff note paper cut into shape of curved v rather after fashion of soaring bird must have be there for month looked at care wrinkled brow relaxed glanced over shoulder at house then held little scrap high over head let go descended with slanting flight curving round to left then came about swept down to ground to right now why did go like a if changed mind tried again same result suppose curvature of wing be little greater must make more acute le acute angle did not know try felt in pocket for piece of paper found lady laxtons letter produced stout pair of nail scissors in sheath from waistcoat pocket selected good clear sheet set to cut out improved v a did so eye be on v number one on ground must be interesting to see if thing turned about to left again if in fact must go on zig zagging ought felt to do so to test that one ought to release from higher point so a to give longer flight stand on chair not in front of whole rotten hotel there be beastly looking man in green apron coming out of housethe sort of man who look at might come up watch fellow be equal to anything of sort captain douglas replaced scissors scrap in pocket leaned back with affectation of boredom got up lit cigarettesort of thing man in green apron must think rightand strolled off towards clump of beech tree beyond be bush depression there perhaps one might be free from observation just try thing for bit point about angle be curious one made one feel one ignorance not to know that
