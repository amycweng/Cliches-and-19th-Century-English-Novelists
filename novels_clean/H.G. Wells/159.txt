collision with derelict when about latitude s longitude w on january fifth be eleven month four day aftermy uncle edward prendick private gentleman who certainly went aboard lady vain at callao who have be considered drowned be picked up in latitude s longitude w in small open boat of name be illegible be supposed to have belonged to missing schooner ipecacuanha gave strange account of that be supposed demented subsequently alleged that mind be blank from moment of escape from lady vain case be discussed among psychologist at time a curious instance of lapse of memory consequent upon physical mental stress following narrative be found among paper by undersigned nephew heir unaccompanied by definite request for publication only island known to exist in region in uncle be picked up be noble isle small volcanic islet uninhabited be visited in by h m s scorpion party of sailor then landed found nothing living thereon except certain curious white moth hog rabbit rather peculiar rat so that narrative be without confirmation in most essential particular with understood there seems harm in putting strange story before public in accordance a believe with uncle intention there be at least much in behalf uncle passed out of human knowledge about latitude s longitude e reappeared in same part of ocean after space of eleven month in way must have lived during interval seems that schooner called ipecacuanha with drunken captain john davy did start from africa with puma certain other animal aboard in january that vessel be well known at several port in south pacific that

short broad clumsy with crooked back hairy neck head sunk between shoulder be dressed in dark blue serge have peculiarly thick coarse black hair heard unseen dog growl furiously forthwith ducked backcoming into contact with hand put out to fend off from turned with animal swiftness in indefinable way black face thus flashed upon shocked profoundly be singularly deformed one facial part projected forming something dimly suggestive of muzzle huge half open mouth showed a big white teeth a have ever seen in human mouth eye be blood shot at edge with scarcely rim of white round hazel pupil there be curious glow of excitement in face confound said montgomery why devil dont get out of way black faced man started aside without word went on up companion staring at instinctively a did so montgomery stayed at foot for moment have business here know said in deliberate tone place be forward black faced man cowered theywont have forward spoke slowly with queer hoarse quality in voice wont have forward said montgomery in menacing voice tell to go be on brink of saying something further then looked up at suddenly followed up ladder have paused half way through hatchway looking back still astonished beyond measure at grotesque ugliness of black faced creature have never beheld repulsive extraordinary face before yetif contradiction be crediblei experienced at same time odd feeling that in way have already encountered exactly feature gesture now amazed afterwards occurred to that probably have seen a be lifted aboard yet scarcely satisfied suspicion of previous acquaintance yet how one must have set eye on so singular face yet have forgotten precise occasion passed imagination montgomery movement to follow released attention turned looked about at flush deck of little schooner be already half prepared by sound have heard for what saw certainly never beheld deck so dirty be littered with scrap of carrot shred of green stuff indescribable filth fastened by chain to mainmast be number of grisly staghound who now began leaping barking at by mizzen huge puma be cramped in little iron cage far too small even to give turning room farther under starboard bulwark be big hutch containing number of rabbit solitary llama be squeezed in mere box of cage forward dog be muzzled by leather strap only human being on deck be gaunt silent sailor at wheel patched dirty spanker be tense before wind up aloft little ship seemed carrying sail have sky be clear sun midway down western sky long wave capped by breeze with froth be running with went past steersman to taffrail saw water come foaming under stern bubble go dancing vanishing in wake turned surveyed unsavoury length of ship be ocean menagerie said look like said montgomery what be beast for merchandise curio doe captain think be going to sell somewhere in south sea look like doesnt said montgomery turned towards wake again suddenly heard yelp volley of furious blasphemy from companion hatchway deformed man with black face came up hurriedly be immediately followed by heavy red haired man in white cap at sight of former staghound who have tired of barking at by time became furiously excited howling leaping against chain black hesitated before gave red haired man time to come up with deliver tremendous blow between shoulder blade poor devil went down like felled ox rolled in dirt among furiously excited dog be lucky for that be muzzled red haired man gave yawp of exultation stood staggering a seemed to in serious danger of going backwards down companion hatchway forward upon victim so soon a second man have appeared montgomery have started forward steady on there cried in tone of remonstrance couple of sailor appeared on forecastle black faced man howling in singular voice rolled about under foot of dog one attempted to help brute did best to worry butting muzzle at there be quick dance of lithe grey figured body over clumsy prostrate figure sailor forward shouted a though be admirable sport montgomery gave angry exclamation went striding down deck followed black faced man scrambled up staggered forward going leaning over bulwark by main shroud where remained panting glaring over shoulder at dog red haired man laughed satisfied laugh look here captain said montgomery with lisp little accentuated gripping elbow of red haired man wont do stood behind montgomery captain came half round regarded with dull solemn eye of drunken man wha wont do said added after looking sleepily into montgomery face for minute blasted sawbones with sudden movement shook arm free after two ineffectual attempt stuck freckled fist into side pocket man passenger said montgomery id advise to keep hand off go to hell said captain loudly suddenly turned staggered towards side do what like on own ship said think montgomery might have left then seeing brute be drunk only turned shade paler followed captain to bulwark look here captain said that man of mine be not to be ill treated have be hazed ever since came aboard for minute alcoholic fume kept captain speechless blasted sawbones be considered necessary must see that montgomery have one of slow pertinacious temper will warm day after day to white heat never again cool to forgiveness saw too that quarrel have be time growing man drunk said perhaps officiously youll do good montgomery gave ugly twist to dropping lip he always drunk do think that excuse assaulting passenger ship began captain waving hand unsteadily towards cage be clean ship look at now be certainly anything clean crew continued captain clean respectable crew agreed to take beast wish id never set eye on infernal island what devilwant beast for on island like then man of yoursunderstood be man he lunatic hadnt business aft do think whole damned ship belongs to sailor began to haze poor devil a soon a came aboard thats just what ishes devil ugly devil men cant stand cant stand none of cant stand montgomery turned away leave man alone anyhow said nodding head a spoke captain meant to quarrel now raised voice if come end of ship again ill cut inside out tell cut out blasted inside who be to tell im to do tell im captain of shipcaptain owner im law here tell youthe law prophet bargained to take man attendant to from arica bring back animal never bargained to carry mad devil silly sawbones well never mind what called montgomery saw latter take step forward interposed he drunk said captain began abuse even fouler than last shut up said turning on sharply for have seen danger in montgomery white face with brought downpour on however be glad to avert what be uncommonly near scuffle even at price of captain drunken ill will think have ever heard quite so much vile language come in continuous stream from man lip before though have frequented eccentric company enough found of hard to endure though be mild tempered man certainly when told captain to shut up have forgotten that be merely bit of human flotsam cut off from resource with fare unpaid mere casual dependant on bounty speculative enterprise of ship reminded of with considerable vigour at rate prevented fight iv at schooner rail that night land be sighted after sundown schooner hove to montgomery intimated be destination be too far to see detail seemed to then simply low lying patch of dim blue in uncertain blue grey sea almost vertical streak of smoke went up from into sky captain be not on deck when be sighted after have vented wrath on have staggered below understand went to sleep on floor of own cabin mate practically assumed command be gaunt taciturn individual have seen at wheel apparently be in evil temper with montgomery took not slightest notice of of dined with in sulky silence after few ineffectual effort on part to talk struck too that men regarded companion animal in singularly unfriendly manner found montgomery very reticent about purpose with creature about destination though be sensible of growing curiosity a to did not press remained talking on quarter deck until sky be thick with star except for occasional sound in yellow lit forecastle movement of animal now then night be very still puma lay crouched together watching with shining eye black heap in corner of cage montgomery produced cigar talked to of london in tone of half painful reminiscence asking kind of question about change have taken place spoke like man who have loved life there have be suddenly irrevocably cut off from gossiped a well a must of that time strangeness of be shaping in mind a talked peered at odd pallid face in dim light of binnacle lantern behind then looked out at darkling sea where in dimness little island be hidden man seemed to have come out of immensity merely to save life to morrow must drop over side vanish again out of existence even have be under commonplace circumstance must have made trifle thoughtful in first place be singularity of educated man living on unknown little island coupled with extraordinary nature of luggage found repeating captain question what did want with beast why too have pretended be not when have remarked about at first then again in personal attendant there be bizarre quality have impressed profoundly circumstance threw haze of mystery round man laid hold of imagination hampered tongue towards midnight talk of london died away stood side by side leaning over bulwark staring dreamily over silent starlit sea pursuing own thought be atmosphere for sentiment began upon gratitude if may say said after time have saved life chance answered just chance prefer to make thanks to accessible agent thank one have need have knowledge injected fed much a might have collected specimen be bored wanted something to do if id be jaded day hadnt liked face wellits curious question where must have be now damped mood little at rate began chance tell interrupted a everything be in man life only ass wont see why be here now outcast from civilisation instead of being happy man enjoying pleasure of london simply because eleven year agoi lost head for ten minute on foggy night stopped yes said thats relapsed into silence presently laughed there something in starlight loosens one tongue im as yet somehow must like to tell tell may rely upon keeping to myselfif thats be on point of beginning then shook head doubtfully dont said be same to after be better to keep secret there nothing gained little relief if respect confidence if dontwell grunted undecidedly felt have at disadvantage have caught in mood of indiscretion to tell truth be not curious to learn what might have driven young medical student out of london have imagination shrugged shoulder turned away over taffrail leant silent black figure watching star be montgomery strange attendant looked over shoulder quickly with movement then looked away again may seem little thing to perhaps came like sudden blow to only light near be lantern at wheel creature face be turned for one brief instant out of dimness of stern towards illumination saw that eye glanced at shone with pale green light did not know then that reddish luminosity at least be not uncommon in human eye thing came to a stark inhumanity black figure with eye of fire struck down through adult thought feeling for moment forgotten horror of childhood came back to mind then effect passed a have come uncouth black figure of man figure of particular import hung over taffrail against starlight found montgomery be speaking to im thinking of turning in then said if youve have enough of answered incongruously went below wished good night at door of cabin that night have very unpleasant dream waning moon rose late light struck ghostly white beam across cabin made ominous shape on planking by bunk then staghound woke began howling baying so that dreamt fitfully scarcely slept until approach of dawn v man who have nowhere to go in early morning be second morning after recovery believe fourth after be picked up awoke through avenue of tumultuous dreamsdreams of gun howling mobsand became sensible of hoarse shouting above rubbed eye lay listening to noise doubtful for little while of whereabouts then came sudden pattering of bare foot sound of heavy object being thrown about violent creaking rattling of chain heard swish of water a ship be suddenly brought round foamy yellow green wave flew across little round window left streaming jumped into clothes went on deck a came up ladder saw against flushed skyfor sun be just risingthe broad back red hair of captain over shoulder puma spinning from tackle rigged on to mizzen spanker boom poor brute seemed horribly scared crouched in bottom of little cage overboard with em bawled captain overboard with em well have clean ship soon of whole bilin of em stood in way so have perforce to tap shoulder to come on deck came round with start staggered back few pace to stare at needed expert eye to tell that man be still drunk hullo said stupidly then with light coming into eye why mistermister prendick said prendick be damned said shut upthats name mister shut up be good answering brute certainly did not expect next move held out hand to gangway by montgomery stood talking to massive grey haired man in dirty blue flannel who have apparently just come aboard way mister blasted up way roared captain montgomery companion turned a spoke what do mean said that way mister blasted shut upthats what mean overboard mister shut upand sharp be cleaning ship outcleaning whole blessed ship out overboard go stared at dumfounded then occurred to that be exactly thing wanted lost prospect of journey a sole passenger with quarrelsome sot be not one to mourn over turned towards montgomery cant have said montgomery companion concisely cant have said aghast have squarest most resolute face ever set eye upon look here began turning to captain overboard said captain ship aint for beast cannibal worse than beast more overboard go mister shut up if cant have go overboard anyhow gowith friend ive done with blessed island for evermore amen ive have enough of montgomery appealed distorted lower lip nodded head hopelessly at grey haired man beside to indicate powerlessness to help ill see to presently said captain then began curious three cornered altercation alternately appealed to one of three menfirst to grey haired man to let land then to drunken captain to keep aboard even bawled entreaty to sailor montgomery said never word only shook head youre going overboard tell be captain refrain law be damned im king here at last must confess voice suddenly broke in middle of vigorous threat felt gust of hysterical petulance went aft stared dismally at nothing meanwhile sailor progressed rapidly with task of unshipping package caged animal large launch with two standing lug lay under lee of schooner into strange assortment of good be swung did not then see hand from island be receiving package for hull of launch be hidden from by side of schooner montgomery companion took slightest notice of busied in assisting directing four five sailor who be unloading good captain went forward interfering rather than assisting be alternately despairful desperate once twice a stood waiting there for thing to accomplish must not resist impulse to laugh at miserable quandary felt wretcheder for lack of breakfast hunger lack of blood corpuscle take manhood from man perceived pretty clearly have not stamen to resist what captain chose to do to expel to force upon montgomery companion so waited passively upon fate work of transferring montgomery possession to launch went on a if did not exist presently that work be finished then came struggle be hauled resisting weakly enough to gangway even then noticed oddness of brown face of men who be with montgomery in launch launch be now fully laden be shoved off hastily broadening gap of green water appeared under pushed back with strength to avoid falling headlong hand in launch shouted derisively heard montgomery curse at then captain mate one of seaman helping ran aft towards stern dingey of lady vain have be towing behind be half full of water have oar be quite unvictualled refused to go aboard flung full length on deck in end swung into by rope for have stern ladder then cut adrift drifted slowly from schooner in kind of stupor watched hand take to rigging slowly surely came round to wind sail fluttered then bellied out a wind came into stared at weather beaten side heeling steeply towards then passed out of range of view did not turn head to follow at first must scarcely believe what have happened crouched in bottom of dingey stunned staring blankly at vacant oily sea then realised be in little hell of mine again now half swamped looking back over gunwale saw schooner standing away from with red haired captain mocking at over taffrail turning towards island saw launch growing smaller a approached beach abruptly cruelty of desertion became clear to have mean of reaching land unless must chance to drift there be still weak must remember from exposure in boat be empty very faint must have have more heart a be suddenly began to sob weep a have never done since be little child tear ran down face in passion of despair struck with fist at water in bottom of boat kicked savagely at gunwale prayed aloud for god to let die vi evil looking boatman islander seeing be really adrift took pity on drifted very slowly to eastward approaching island slantingly presently saw with hysterical relief launch come round return towards be heavily laden must make out a drew nearer montgomery white haired broad shouldered companion sitting cramped up with dog several packing case in stern sheet individual stared fixedly at without moving speaking black faced cripple be glaring at a fixedly in bow near puma there be three other men besidesthree strange brutish looking fellow at whom staghound be snarling savagely montgomery who be steering brought boat by rising caught fastened painter to tiller to tow for there be room aboard have recovered from hysterical phase by time answered hail a approached bravely enough told dingey be nearly swamped reached piggin be jerked back a rope tightened between boat for time be busy baling be not until have got water under for water in dingey have be shipped boat be perfectly sound that have leisure to look at people in launch again white haired man found be still regarding steadfastly with expression a now fancied of perplexity when eye met looked down at staghound sat between knee be powerfully built man a have said with fine forehead rather heavy feature eye have that odd drooping of skin above lid often come with advancing year fall of heavy mouth at corner gave expression of pugnacious resolution talked to montgomery in tone too low for to hear from eye travelled to three men strange crew be saw only face yet there be something in facesi knew not whatthat gave queer spasm of disgust looked steadily at impression did not pas though failed to see what have occasioned seemed to then to be brown men limb be oddly swathed in thin dirty white stuff down even to finger foot have never seen men so wrapped up before woman so only in east wore turban too thereunder peered out elfin face at mefaces with protruding lower jaw bright eye have lank black hair almost like horsehair seemed a sat to exceed in stature race of men have seen white haired man who knew be good six foot in height sat head below one of three found afterwards really none be taller than body be abnormally long thigh part of leg short curiously twisted at rate be amazingly ugly gang over head of under forward lug peered black face of man whose eye be luminous in dark a stared at met gaze then first one then turned away from direct stare looked at in odd furtive manner occurred to that be perhaps annoying turned attention to island be approaching be low covered with thick vegetationchiefly kind of palm be new to from one point thin white thread of vapour rose slantingly to immense height then frayed out like down feather be now within embrace of broad bay flanked on hand by low promontory beach be of dull grey sand sloped steeply up to ridge perhaps sixty seventy foot above sea level irregularly set with tree undergrowth half way up be square enclosure of greyish stone found subsequently be built partly of coral partly of pumiceous lava two thatched roof peeped from within enclosure man stood awaiting at water edge fancied while be still far off saw other very grotesque looking creature scuttle into bush upon slope saw nothing of a drew nearer man be of moderate size with black negroid face have large almost lipless mouth extraordinary lank arm long thin foot bow leg stood with heavy face thrust forward staring at be dressed like montgomery white haired companion in jacket trouser of blue serge a came still nearer individual began to run to fro on beach making most grotesque movement at word of command from montgomery four men in launch sprang up with singularly awkward gesture struck lug montgomery steered round into narrow little dock excavated in beach then man on beach hastened towards dock a call be really mere ditch just long enough at phase of tide to take longboat heard bow ground in sand staved dingey off rudder of big boat with piggin freeing painter landed three muffled men with clumsiest movement scrambled out upon sand forthwith set to landing cargo assisted by man on beach be struck especially by curious movement of leg of three swathed bandaged boatmennot stiff be distorted in odd way almost a if be jointed in wrong place dog be still snarling strained at chain after men a white haired man landed with three big fellow spoke to one in odd guttural tone man who have waited for on beach began chattering to excitedlya foreign language a fanciedas laid hand on bale piled near stern somewhere have heard voice before must not think where white haired man stood holding in tumult of six dog bawling order over din montgomery having unshipped rudder landed likewise set to work at unloading be too faint what with long fast sun beating down on bare head to offer assistance presently white haired man seemed to recollect presence came up to look said a though have scarcely breakfasted little eye be brilliant black under heavy brow must apologise for now be guest must make comfortablethough be uninvited know looked keenly into face montgomery say be educated man mr prendick say know something of science may ask what that signifies told have spent year at royal college of science have done research in biology under huxley raised eyebrow slightly at that alters case little mr prendick said with trifle more respect in manner a happens be biologist here be biological stationof sort eye rested on men in white who be busily hauling puma on roller towards walled yard montgomery at least added then when will be able to get away cant say be off track to anywhere see ship once in twelve month so left abruptly went up beach past group think entered enclosure other two men be with montgomery erecting pile of smaller package on low wheeled truck llama be still on launch with rabbit hutch staghound be still lashed to thwart pile of thing completed three men laid hold of truck began shoving ton weight so upon after puma presently montgomery left coming back to held out hand im glad said for own part that captain be silly as hed have made thing lively for be said that saved again that depends youll find island infernally rum place promise id watch going carefully if be hesitated seemed to alter mind about what be on lip wish youd help with rabbit said procedure with rabbit be singular waded in with helped lug one of hutch ashore sooner be that done than opened door of tilting thing on one end turned living content out on ground fell in struggling heap one on top of other clapped hand forthwith went off with hopping run of theirs fifteen twenty of must think up beach increase multiply friend said montgomery replenish island hitherto weve have certain lack of meat here a watched disappearing white haired man returned with brandy flask biscuit something to go on with prendick said in far more familiar tone than before made ado set to work on biscuit at once while white haired man helped montgomery to release about score more of rabbit three big hutch however went up to house with puma brandy did not touch for have be abstainer from birth vii locked door reader will perhaps understand at first everything be so strange about position be outcome of such unexpected adventure have discernment of relative strangeness of that thing followed llama up beach be overtaken by montgomery who asked not to enter stone enclosure noticed then that puma in cage pile of package have be placed outside entrance to quadrangle turned saw that launch have now be unloaded run out again be being beached white haired man be walking towards addressed montgomery now come problem of uninvited guest what be to do with know something of science said montgomery im itching to get to work againwith new stuff said white haired man nodding towards enclosure eye grew brighter daresay be said montgomery in anything cordial tone cant send over there cant spare time to build new shanty certainly cant take into confidence just yet im in hand said have idea of what meant by over there ive be thinking of same thing montgomery answered there room with outer door thats said elder man promptly looking at montgomery three of went towards enclosure im sorry to make mystery mr prendick youll remember youre uninvited little establishment here contains secret so be kind of blue beard chamber in fact nothing very dreadful really to sane man just now a dont know decidedly said must be fool to take offence at want of confidence twisted heavy mouth into faint smilehe be one of saturnine people who smile with corner of mouth downand bowed acknowledgment of complaisance main entrance to enclosure be passed be heavy wooden gate framed in iron locked with cargo of launch piled outside at corner came to small doorway have not previously observed white haired man produced bundle of key from pocket of greasy blue jacket opened door entered key elaborate locking up of place even while be still under eye struck a peculiar followed found in small apartment plainly not uncomfortably furnished with inner door be slightly ajar opening into paved courtyard inner door montgomery at once closed hammock be slung across darker corner of room small unglazed window defended by iron bar looked out towards sea white haired man told be to be apartment inner door for fear of accident said must lock on other side be limit inward called attention to convenient deck chair before window to array of old book chiefly found surgical work edition of latin greek classic language can not read with comfort on shelf near hammock left room by outer door a if to avoid opening inner one again usually have meal in here said montgomery then a if in doubt went out after other moreau heard call for moment think noticed then a handled book on shelf came up in consciousness where have heard name of moreau before sat down before window took out biscuit still remained to ate with excellent appetite moreau through window saw one of unaccountable men in white lugging packing case along beach presently window frame hid then heard key inserted turned in lock behind after little while heard through locked door noise of staghound have now be brought up from beach be not barking sniffing growling in curious fashion must hear rapid patter of foot montgomery voice soothing be very much impressed by elaborate secrecy of two men regarding content of place for time be thinking of of unaccountable familiarity of name of moreau so odd be human memory must not then recall well known name in proper connection from thought went to indefinable queerness of deformed man on beach never saw such gait such odd motion a pulled at box recalled that none of men have spoken to though most of have found looking at at one time in peculiarly furtive manner quite unlike frank stare of unsophisticated savage indeed have seemed remarkably taciturn when did speak endowed with very uncanny voice what be wrong with then recalled eye of montgomery ungainly attendant just a be thinking of came in be now dressed in white carried little tray with coffee boiled vegetable thereon must hardly repress shuddering recoil a came bending amiably placed tray before on table then astonishment paralysed under stringy black lock saw ear jumped upon suddenly close to face man have pointed ear covered with fine brown fur breakfast sair said stared at face without attempting to answer turned went towards door regarding oddly over shoulder followed out with eye a did so by odd trick of unconscious cerebration there came surging into head phrase moreau hollowswas moreau ah sent memory back ten year moreau horror phrase drifted loose in mind for moment then saw in red lettering on little buff coloured pamphlet to read made one shiver creep then remembered distinctly about that long forgotten pamphlet came back with startling vividness to mind have be mere lad then moreau be suppose about fiftya prominent masterful physiologist well known in scientific circle for extraordinary imagination brutal directness in discussion be same moreau have published very astonishing fact in connection with transfusion of blood in addition be known to be doing valuable work on morbid growth then suddenly career be closed have to leave england journalist obtained access to laboratory in capacity of laboratory assistant with deliberate intention of making sensational exposure by help of shocking accident if be accident gruesome pamphlet became notorious on day of publication wretched dog flayed otherwise mutilated escaped from moreaus house be in silly season prominent editor cousin of temporary laboratory assistant appealed to conscience of nation be not first time conscience have turned against method of research doctor be simply howled out of country may be that deserved to be still think that tepid support of fellow investigator desertion by great body of scientific worker be shameful thing yet of experiment by journalist account be wantonly cruel might perhaps have purchased social peace by abandoning investigation apparently preferred latter a most men must who have once fallen under overmastering spell of research be unmarried have indeed nothing own interest to consider felt convinced that must be same man everything pointed to dawned upon to what end puma other animalswhich have now be brought with other luggage into enclosure behind housewere destined curious faint odour halitus of something familiar odour have be in background of consciousness hitherto suddenly came forward into forefront of thought be antiseptic odour of dissecting room heard puma growling through wall one of dog yelped a though have be struck yet surely especially to scientific man there be nothing so horrible in vivisection a to account for secrecy by odd leap in thought pointed ear luminous eye of montgomery attendant came back again before with sharpest definition stared before out at green sea frothing under freshening breeze let other strange memory of last few day chase one through mind what must mean locked enclosure on lonely island notorious vivisector crippled distorted men viii cry of puma montgomery interrupted tangle of mystification suspicion about one oclock grotesque attendant followed with tray bearing bread herb other eatable flask of whiskey jug of water three glass knife glanced askance at strange creature found watching with queer restless eye montgomery said must lunch with that moreau be too preoccupied with work to come moreau said know name devil do said what as be to mention to might have thought anyhow will give inkling of ourmysteries whiskey thanks im abstainer wish id be use locking door after steed be stolen be that infernal stuff led to coming herethat foggy night thought in luck at time when moreau offered to get off queer montgomery said suddenly a outer door closed why have man pointed ear damn said over first mouthful of food stared at for moment then repeated pointed ear little point to said a calmly a possible with catch in breath fine black fur at edge helped to whiskey water with great deliberation be under impressionthat hair covered ear saw a stooped by to put coffee sent to on table eye shine in dark by time montgomery have recovered from surprise of question always thought said deliberately with certain accentuation of flavouring of lisp that there be something matter with ear from way covered what be like be persuaded from manner that ignorance be pretence still must hardly tell man thought liar pointed said rather small furrydistinctly furry whole man be one of strangest being ever set eye on sharp hoarse cry of animal pain came from enclosure behind depth volume testified to puma saw montgomery wince yes said where did pick up creature san francisco he ugly brute admit half witted know cant remember where came from im used to know be how doe strike he unnatural said there something about himdont think fanciful give nasty little sensation tightening of muscle when come near touchof diabolical in fact montgomery have stopped eating while told rum said cant see resumed meal have idea of said masticated crew of schooner must have felt same made dead set at poor devil saw captain suddenly puma howled again time more painfully montgomery swore under breath have mind to attack about men on beach then poor brute within gave vent to series of short sharp cry men on beach said what race be excellent fellow arent said absentmindedly knitting brow a animal yelled out sharply said more there be outcry worse than former looked at with dull grey eye then took more whiskey tried to draw into discussion about alcohol professing to have saved life with seemed anxious to lay stress on fact that owed life to answered distractedly presently meal came to end misshapen monster with pointed ear cleared remains away montgomery left alone in room again time have be in state of ill concealed irritation at noise of vivisected puma have spoken of odd want of nerve left to obvious application found that cry be singularly irritating grew in depth intensity a afternoon wore on be painful at first constant resurgence at last altogether upset balance flung aside crib of horace have be reading began to clench fist to bite lip to pace room presently got to stopping ear with finger emotional appeal of yell grew upon steadily grew at last to exquisite expression of suffering must stand in confined room no longer stepped out of door into slumberous heat of late afternoon walking past main entrancelocked again noticedturned corner of wall cry sounded even louder out of door be a if pain in world have found voice yet have known such pain be in next room have be dumb believei have thought sincei must have stood well enough be when suffering find voice set nerve quivering that pity come troubling in spite of brilliant sunlight green fan of tree waving in soothing sea breeze world be confusion blurred with drifting black red phantasm until be out of earshot of house in chequered wall ix thing in forest strode through undergrowth clothed ridge behind house scarcely heeding whither went passed on through shadow of thick cluster of straight stemmed tree beyond so presently found way on other side of ridge descending towards streamlet ran through narrow valley paused listened distance have come intervening mass of thicket deadened sound might be coming from enclosure air be still then with rustle rabbit emerged went scampering up slope before hesitated sat down in edge of shade place be pleasant one rivulet be hidden by luxuriant vegetation of bank save at one point where caught triangular patch of glittering water on farther side saw through bluish haze tangle of tree creeper above again luminous blue of sky here there splash of white crimson marked blooming of trailing epiphyte let eye wander over scene for while then began to turn over in mind again strange peculiarity of montgomery man be too hot to think elaborately presently fell into tranquil state midway between dozing waking from be aroused after not how long by rustling amidst greenery on other side of stream for moment must see nothing waving summit of fern reed then suddenly upon bank of stream appeared somethingat first must not distinguish what be bowed round head to water began to drink then saw be man going on four like beast be clothed in bluish cloth be of copper coloured hue with black hair seemed that grotesque ugliness be invariable character of islander must hear suck of water at lip a drank leant forward to see better piece of lava detached by hand went pattering down slope looked up guiltily eye met mine forthwith scrambled to foot stood wiping clumsy hand across mouth regarding leg be scarcely length of body so staring one out of countenance remained for perhaps space of minute then stopping to look back once twice slunk off among bush to right of heard swish of frond grow faint in distance die away long after have disappeared remained sitting up staring in direction of retreat drowsy tranquillity have gone be startled by noise behind turning suddenly saw flapping white tail of rabbit vanishing up slope jumped to foot apparition of grotesque half bestial creature have suddenly populated stillness of afternoon for looked around rather nervously regretted be unarmed then thought that man have just seen have be clothed in bluish cloth have not be naked a savage must have be tried to persuade from fact that be after probably peaceful character that dull ferocity of countenance belied yet be greatly disturbed at apparition walked to left along slope turning head about peering way that among straight stem of tree why must man go on four drink with lip presently heard animal wailing again taking to be puma turned about walked in direction diametrically opposite to sound led down to stream across stepped pushed way up through undergrowth beyond be startled by great patch of vivid scarlet on ground going up to found to be peculiar fungus branched corrugated like foliaceous lichen deliquescing into slime at touch then in shadow of luxuriant fern came upon unpleasant thingthe dead body of rabbit covered with shining fly still warm with head torn off stopped aghast at sight of scattered blood here at least be one visitor to island disposed of there be trace of other violence about looked a though have be suddenly snatched up killed a stared at little furry body came difficulty of how thing have be done vague dread have be in mind since have seen inhuman face of man at stream grew distincter a stood there began to realise hardihood of expedition among unknown people thicket about became altered to imagination shadow became something more than shadowbecame ambush rustle became threat invisible thing seemed watching resolved to go back to enclosure on beach suddenly turned away thrust violently possibly even frantically through bush anxious to get clear space about again stopped just in time to prevent emerging upon open space be kind of glade in forest made by fall seedling be already starting up to struggle for vacant space beyond dense growth of stem twining vine splash of fungus flower closed in again before squatting together upon fungoid ruin of huge fallen tree still unaware of approach be three grotesque human figure one be evidently female other two be men be naked save for swathing of scarlet cloth about middle skin be of dull pinkish drab colour such a have seen in savage before have fat heavy chinless face retreating forehead scant bristly hair upon head never saw such bestial looking creature be talking at least one of men be talking to other two three have be too closely interested to heed rustling of approach swayed head shoulder from side to side speaker word came thick sloppy though must hear distinctly must not distinguish what said seemed to to be reciting complicated gibberish presently articulation became shriller spreading hand rose to foot at that others began to gibber in unison also rising to foot spreading hand swaying body in rhythm with chant noticed then abnormal shortness of leg lank clumsy foot three began slowly to circle round raising stamping foot waving arm kind of tune crept into rhythmic recitation refrainaloola balloola sounded like eye began to sparkle ugly face to brighten with expression of strange pleasure saliva dripped from lipless mouth suddenly a watched grotesque unaccountable gesture perceived clearly for first time what be that have offended what have given two inconsistent conflicting impression of utter strangeness yet of strangest familiarity three creature engaged in mysterious rite be human in shape yet human being with strangest air about of familiar animal of creature despite human form rag of clothing rough humanity of bodily form have woven into itinto movement into expression of countenance into whole presencesome now irresistible suggestion of hog swinish taint unmistakable mark of beast stood overcome by amazing realisation then most horrible questioning came rushing into mind began leaping in air first one then other whooping grunting then one slipped for moment be on foursto recover indeed forthwith that transitory gleam of true animalism of monster be enough turned a noiselessly a possible becoming now then rigid with fear of being discovered a branch cracked leaf rustled pushed back into bush be long before grew bolder dared to move freely only idea for moment be to get away from foul being scarcely noticed that have emerged upon faint pathway amidst tree then suddenly traversing little glade saw with unpleasant start two clumsy leg among tree walking with noiseless footstep parallel with course perhaps thirty yard away from head upper part of body be hidden by tangle of creeper stopped abruptly hoping creature did not see foot stopped a did so nervous be that controlled impulse to headlong flight with utmost difficulty then looking hard distinguished through interlacing network head body of brute have seen drinking moved head there be emerald flash in eye a glanced at from shadow of tree half luminous colour vanished a turned head again be motionless for moment then with noiseless tread began running through green confusion in moment have vanished behind bush must not see felt that have stopped be watching again what on earth be heman beast what did want with have weapon not even stick flight must be madness at rate thing whatever be lacked courage to attack setting teeth hard walked straight towards be anxious not to show fear that seemed chilling backbone pushed through tangle of tall white flowered bush saw twenty pace beyond looking over shoulder at hesitating advanced step two looking steadfastly into eye who be said tried to meet gaze said suddenly turning went bounding away from through undergrowth then turned stared at again eye shone brightly out of dusk under tree heart be in mouth felt only chance be bluff walked steadily towards turned again vanished into dusk once more thought caught glint of eye be for first time realised how lateness of hour might affect sun have set minute since swift dusk of tropic be already fading out of eastern sky pioneer moth fluttered silently by head unless must spend night among unknown danger of mysterious forest must hasten back to enclosure thought of return to pain haunted refuge be extremely disagreeable still more so be idea of being overtaken in open by darkness darkness might conceal gave one more look into blue shadow that have swallowed up odd creature then retraced way down slope towards stream going a judged in direction from have come walked eagerly mind confused with many thing presently found in level place among scattered tree colourless clearness come after sunset flush be darkling blue sky above grew momentarily deeper little star one by one pierced attenuated light interspaces of tree gap in further vegetation have be hazy blue in daylight grew black mysterious pushed on colour vanished from world tree top rose against luminous blue sky in inky silhouette below outline melted into one formless blackness presently tree grew thinner shrubby undergrowth more abundant then there be desolate space covered with white sand then expanse of tangled bush did not remember crossing sand opening before began to be tormented by faint rustling upon right hand thought at first be fancy for whenever stopped there be silence save for evening breeze in tree top then when turned to hurry on again there be echo to footstep turned away from thicket keeping to more open ground endeavouring by sudden turn now then to surprise something in act of creeping upon saw nothing nevertheless sense of presence grew steadily increased pace after time came to slight ridge crossed turned sharply regarding steadfastly from further side came out black clear cut against darkling sky presently shapeless lump heaved up momentarily against sky line vanished again felt assured now that tawny faced antagonist be stalking once more coupled with be unpleasant realisation have lost way for time hurried on hopelessly perplexed pursued by stealthy approach whatever be thing lacked courage to attack be waiting to take at disadvantage kept studiously to open at time must turn listen presently have half persuaded that pursuer have abandoned chase be mere creation of disordered imagination then heard sound of sea quickened footstep almost into run immediately there be stumble in rear turned suddenly stared at uncertain tree behind one black shadow seemed to leap into listened rigid heard nothing creep of blood in ear thought that nerve be unstrung that imagination be tricking turned resolutely towards sound of sea again in minute so tree grew thinner emerged upon bare low headland running out into sombre water night be calm clear reflection of growing multitude of star shivered in tranquil heaving of sea way out wash upon irregular band of reef shone with pallid light of own westward saw zodiacal light mingling with yellow brilliance of evening star coast fell away from to east westward be hidden by shoulder of cape then recalled fact that moreaus beach lay to west twig snapped behind there be rustle turned stood facing dark tree must see nothingor else must see too much dark form in dimness have ominous quality peculiar suggestion of alert watchfulness so stood for perhaps minute then with eye to tree still turned westward to cross headland a moved one among lurking shadow moved to follow heart beat quickly presently broad sweep of bay to westward became visible halted again noiseless shadow halted dozen yard from little point of light shone on further bend of curve grey sweep of sandy beach lay faint under starlight perhaps two mile away be little point of light to get to beach must have to go through tree where shadow lurked down bushy slope must see thing rather more distinctly now be animal for stood erect at opened mouth to speak found hoarse phlegm choked voice tried again shouted who be there there be answer advanced step thing did not move only gathered together foot struck stone gave idea without taking eye off black form before stooped picked up lump of rock at motion thing turned abruptly a dog might have done slunk obliquely into further darkness then recalled schoolboy expedient against big dog twisted rock into handkerchief gave turn round wrist heard movement further off among shadow a if thing be in retreat then suddenly tense excitement gave way broke into profuse perspiration fell trembling with adversary routed weapon in hand be time before must summon resolution to go down through tree bush upon flank of headland to beach at last did at run a emerged from thicket upon sand heard other body come crashing after at completely lost head with fear began running along sand forthwith there came swift patter of soft foot in pursuit gave wild cry redoubled pace dim black thing about three four time size of rabbit went running hopping up from beach towards bush a passed so long a live will remember terror of chase ran near water edge heard now then splash of foot gained upon far away hopelessly far be yellow light night about be black still splash splash came pursuing foot nearer nearer felt breath going for be quite out of training whooped a drew felt pain like knife at side perceived thing must come up with long before reached enclosure desperate sobbing for breath wheeled round upon struck at a came up to mestruck with strength stone came out of sling of handkerchief a did so a turned thing have be running on four rose to foot missile fell fair on left temple skull rang loud animal man blundered into thrust back with hand went staggering past to fall headlong upon sand with face in water there lay still must not bring to approach black heap left there with water rippling round under still star giving wide berth pursued way towards yellow glow of house presently with positive effect of relief came pitiful moaning of puma sound have originally driven out to explore mysterious island at though be faint horribly fatigued gathered together strength began running again towards light thought voice calling x cry of man a drew near house saw that light shone from open door of room then heard coming from out of darkness at side of orange oblong of light voice of montgomery shouting prendick continued running presently heard again replied by feeble hullo in moment have staggered up to where have be said holding at arm length so that light from door fell on face have be so busy that forgot until about hour ago led into room sat down in deck chair for awhile be blinded by light did not think must start to explore island of ours without telling said then be afraidbutwhathullo last remaining strength slipped from head fell forward on chest think found certain satisfaction in giving brandy for god sake said fasten door youve be meeting of curiosity eh said locked door turned to again asked question gave more brandy water pressed to eat be in state of collapse said something vague about forgetting to warn asked briefly when left house what have seen answered a briefly in fragmentary sentence tell what mean said in state bordering on hysteric nothing so very dreadful said think have have about enough for one day puma suddenly gave sharp yell of pain at that swore under breath im damned said if place be not a bad a gower street with cat montgomery said what be that thing came after be beast be man if dont sleep to night said youll be off head to morrow stood up in front of be that thing came after asked looked squarely in eye twisted mouth askew eye have seemed animated minute before went dull from account said im thinking be bogle felt gust of intense irritation passed a quickly a came flung into chair again pressed hand on forehead puma began once more montgomery came round behind put hand on shoulder look here prendick said have business to let drift out into silly island of ours not so bad a feel man nerve be worked to rag let give something will make sleep thatwill keep on for hour yet must simply get to sleep wont answer for did not reply bowed forward covered face with hand presently returned with small measure containing dark liquid gave took unresistingly helped into hammock when awoke be broad day for little while lay flat staring at roof above rafter observed be made out of timber of ship then turned head saw meal prepared for on table perceived be hungry prepared to clamber out of hammock very politely anticipating intention twisted round deposited upon four on floor got up sat down before food have heavy feeling in head only vaguest memory at first of thing have happened over night morning breeze blew very pleasantly through unglazed window food contributed to sense of animal comfort experienced presently door behind methe door inward towards yard of enclosureopened turned saw montgomery face right said im frightfully busy shut door afterwards discovered that forgot to re lock then recalled expression of face previous night with memory of have experienced reconstructed before even a fear came back to came cry from within time be not cry of puma put down mouthful hesitated upon lip listened silence save for whisper of morning breeze began to think ear have deceived after long pause resumed meal with ear still vigilant presently heard something else very faint low sat a if frozen in attitude though be faint low moved more profoundly than have hitherto heard of abomination behind wall there be mistake time in quality of dim broken sound doubt at of source for be groaning broken by sob gasp of anguish be brute time be human being in torment a realised rose in three step have crossed room seized handle of door into yard flung open before prendick man stop cried montgomery intervening startled deerhound yelped snarled there be blood saw in sinkbrown scarletand smelt peculiar smell of carbolic acid then through open doorway beyond in dim light of shadow saw something bound painfully upon framework scarred red bandaged then blotting out appeared face of old moreau white terrible in moment have gripped by shoulder with hand be smeared red have twisted off foot flung headlong back into own room lifted a though be little child fell at full length upon floor door slammed shut out passionate intensity of face then heard key turn in lock montgomery voice in expostulation ruin work of lifetime heard moreau say doe not understand said montgomery other thing be inaudible cant spare time yet said moreau rest did not hear picked up stood trembling mind chaos of most horrible misgiving must be possible thought that thing a vivisection of men be carried on here question shot like lightning across tumultuous sky suddenly clouded horror of mind condensed into vivid realisation of own danger xi hunting of man came before mind with unreasonable hope of escape that outer door of room be still open to be convinced now absolutely assured that moreau have be vivisecting human being time since have heard name have be trying to link in mind in way grotesque animalism of islander with abomination now thought saw memory of work on transfusion of blood recurred to creature have seen be victim of hideous experiment sickening scoundrel have merely intended to keep back to fool with display of confidence presently to fall upon with fate more horrible than deathwith torture after torture most hideous degradation be possible to conceiveto send off lost soul beast to rest of comus rout looked round for weapon nothing then with inspiration turned over deck chair put foot on side of tore away side rail happened that nail came away with wood projecting gave touch of danger to otherwise petty weapon heard step outside incontinently flung open door found montgomery within yard of meant to lock outer door raised nailed stick of mine cut at face sprang back hesitated moment then turned fled round corner of house prendick man heard astonished cry dont be silly as man minute thought must have have locked in a ready a hospital rabbit for fate emerged behind corner for heard shout prendick then began to run after shouting thing a ran time running blindly went northeastward in direction at right angle to previous expedition once a went running headlong up beach glanced over shoulder saw attendant with ran furiously up slope over then turning eastward along rocky valley fringed on side with jungle ran for perhaps mile altogether chest straining heart beating in ear then hearing nothing of montgomery man feeling upon verge of exhaustion doubled sharply back towards beach a judged lay down in shelter of canebrake there remained for long time too fearful to move indeed too fearful even to plan course of action wild scene about lay sleeping silently under sun only sound near be thin hum of small gnat have discovered presently became aware of drowsy breathing sound soughing of sea upon beach after about hour heard montgomery shouting name far away to north set thinking of plan of action a interpreted then island be inhabited only by two vivisectors animalised victim of doubt must press into service against if need arose knew moreau montgomery carried revolver save for feeble bar of deal spiked with small nail merest mockery of mace be unarmed so lay still there until began to think of food drink at thought real hopelessness of position came home to knew way of getting anything to eat be too ignorant of botany to discover resort of root fruit might lie about have mean of trapping few rabbit upon island grew blanker more turned prospect over at last in desperation of position mind turned to animal men have encountered tried to find hope in what remembered of in turn recalled one have seen tried to draw augury of assistance from memory then suddenly heard staghound bay at realised new danger took little time to think must have caught then snatching up nailed stick rushed headlong from hiding place towards sound of sea remember growth of thorny plant with spine stabbed like pen knife emerged bleeding with torn clothes upon lip of long creek opening northward went straight into water without minute hesitation wading up creek presently finding kneedeep in little stream scrambled out at last on westward bank with heart beating loudly in ear crept into tangle of fern to await issue heard dog there be only one draw nearer yelp when came to thorn then heard more presently began to think have escaped minute passed silence lengthened out at last after hour of security courage began to return to by time be no longer very much terrified very miserable have a be passed limit of terror despair felt now that life be practically lost that persuasion made capable of daring anything have even certain wish to encounter moreau face to face a have waded into water remembered that if be too hard pressed at least one path of escape from torment still lay open to methey must not very well prevent drowning have mind to drown then odd wish to see whole adventure out queer impersonal spectacular interest in restrained stretched limb sore painful from prick of spiny plant stared around at tree so suddenly that seemed to jump out of green tracery about eye lit upon black face watching saw that be simian creature who have met launch upon beach be clinging to oblique stem of palm tree gripped stick stood up facing began chattering be must distinguish at first suddenly dropped from tree in moment be holding frond apart staring curiously at did not feel same repugnance towards creature have experienced in encounter with other beast men said in boat be man thenat least a much of man a montgomery attendantfor must talk yes said came in boat from ship oh said bright restless eye travelled over to hand to stick carried to foot to tattered place in coat cut scratch have received from thorn seemed puzzled at something eye came back to hand held own hand out counted digit slowly one two three four fiveeigh did not grasp meaning then afterwards be to find that great proportion of beast people have malformed hand lacking sometimes even three digit guessing be in way greeting did same thing by way of reply grinned with immense satisfaction then swift roving glance went round again made swift movementand vanished fern frond have stood between came swishing together pushed out of brake after be astonished to find swinging cheerfully by one lank arm from rope of creeper looped down from foliage overhead back be to hullo said came down with twisting jump stood facing say said where can get something to eat eat said eat man food now eye went back to swing of rope at hut where be hut oh im new know at that swung round set off at quick walk motion be curiously rapid come along said went with to see adventure out guessed hut be rough shelter where more of beast people lived might perhaps find friendly find handle in mind to take hold of did not know how far have forgotten human heritage ape like companion trotted along by side with hand hanging down jaw thrust forward wondered what memory might have in how long have be on island said how long asked after having question repeated held up three finger creature be little better than idiot tried to make out what meant by seems bored after question two suddenly left side went leaping at fruit that hung from tree pulled down handful of prickly husk went on eating content noted with satisfaction for here at least be hint for feeding tried with other question chattering prompt response be a often a not quite at cross purpose with question few be appropriate others quite parrot like be so intent upon peculiarity scarcely noticed path followed presently came to tree charred brown so to bare place covered with yellow white incrustation across drifting smoke pungent in whiff to nose eye went drifting on right over shoulder of bare rock saw level blue of sea path coiled down abruptly into narrow ravine between two tumbled knotty mass of blackish scoria into plunged be extremely dark passage after blinding sunlight reflected from sulphurous ground wall grew steep approached other blotch of green crimson drifted across eye conductor stopped suddenly home said stood in floor of chasm be at first absolutely dark to heard strange noise thrust knuckle of left hand into eye became aware of disagreeable odor like of monkey cage ill cleaned beyond rock opened again upon gradual slope of sunlit greenery on hand light smote down through narrow way into central gloom xii sayers of law then something cold touched hand started violently saw close to dim pinkish thing looking more like flayed child than anything else in world creature have exactly mild repulsive feature of sloth same low forehead slow gesture a first shock of change of light passed saw about more distinctly little sloth like creature be standing staring at conductor have vanished place be narrow passage between high wall of lava crack in knotted rock on side interwoven heap of sea mat palm fan reed leaning against rock formed rough impenetrably dark den winding way up ravine between be scarcely three yard wide be disfigured by lump of decaying fruit pulp other refuse accounted for disagreeable stench of place little pink sloth creature be still blinking at when ape man reappeared at aperture of nearest of den beckoned in a did so slouching monster wriggled out of one of place further up strange street stood up in featureless silhouette against bright green beyond staring at hesitated having mind to bolt way have come then determined to go through with adventure gripped nailed stick about middle crawled into little evil smelling lean to after conductor be semi circular space shaped like half of bee hive against rocky wall formed inner side of be pile of variegated fruit cocoa nut among others rough vessel of lava wood stood about floor one on rough stool there be fire in darkest corner of hut sat shapeless mass of darkness grunted hey a came in ape man stood in dim light of doorway held out split cocoa nut to a crawled into other corner squatted down took began gnawing a serenely a possible in spite of certain trepidation nearly intolerable closeness of den little pink sloth creature stood in aperture of hut something else with drab face bright eye came staring over shoulder hey came out of lump of mystery opposite be man be man gabbled conductor man man five man like shut up said voice from dark grunted gnawed cocoa nut amid impressive stillness peered hard into blackness must distinguish nothing be man voice repeated come to live with be thick voice with something in ita kind of whistling overtonethat struck a peculiar english accent be strangely good ape man looked at a though expected something perceived pause be interrogative come to live with said be man must learn law began to distinguish now deeper blackness in black vague outline of hunched up figure then noticed opening of place be darkened by two more black head hand tightened on stick thing in dark repeated in louder tone say word have missed last remark not to go on four be law repeated in kind of sing song be puzzled say word said ape man repeating figure in doorway echoed with threat in tone of voice realised that have to repeat idiotic formula then began insanest ceremony voice in dark began intoning mad litany line by line rest to repeat a did so swayed from side to side in oddest way beat hand upon knee followed example must have imagined be already dead in world dark hut grotesque dim figure just flecked here there by glimmer of light of swaying in unison chanting not to go on four be law be not men not to suck up drink be law be not men not to eat fish flesh be law be not men not to claw bark of tree be law be not men not to chase other men be law be not men so from prohibition of act of folly on to prohibition of what thought then be maddest most impossible most indecent thing one must well imagine kind of rhythmic fervour fell on of gabbled swayed faster faster repeating amazing law superficially contagion of brute be upon deep down within laughter disgust struggled together ran through long list of prohibition then chant swung round to new formula be house of pain be hand make be hand wound be hand heals so on for long series mostly quite incomprehensible gibberish to about whoever might be must have fancied be dream never before have heard chanting in dream be lightning flash sang be deep salt sea horrible fancy came into head that moreau after animalising men have infected dwarfed brain with kind of deification of however be too keenly aware of white teeth strong claw about to stop chanting on account be star in sky at last that song ended saw ape man face shining with perspiration eye being now accustomed to darkness saw more distinctly figure in corner from voice came be size of man seemed covered with dull grey hair almost like skye terrier what be be imagine surrounded by most horrible cripple maniac be possible to conceive may understand little of feeling with grotesque caricature of humanity about be five man five man five manlike said ape man held out hand grey creature in corner leant forward not to run on four be law be not men said put out strangely distorted talon gripped finger thing be almost like hoof of deer produced into claw must have yelled with surprise pain face came forward peered at nail came forward into light of opening of hut saw with quivering disgust that be like face of man beast mere shock of grey hair with three shadowy over archings to mark eye mouth have little nail said grisly creature in hairy beard be well threw hand down instinctively gripped stick eat root herb be will said ape man be sayer of law said grey figure here come that be new to learn law sit in darkness say law be even so said one of beast in doorway evil be punishment of who break law none escape none escape said beast folk glancing furtively at one none none said ape mannone escape see did little thing wrong thing once jabbered jabbered stopped talking none must understand be burnt branded in hand be great be good none escape said grey creature in corner none escape said beast people looking askance at one for one want be bad said grey sayer of law what will want know will know want to follow thing move to watch slink wait spring to kill bite bite deep rich sucking blood be bad not to chase other men be law be not men not to eat flesh fish be law be not men none escape said dappled brute standing in doorway for one want be bad said grey sayer of law want to go tearing with teeth hand into root of thing snuffing into earth be bad none escape said men in door go clawing tree go scratching at graf of dead go fighting with forehead foot claw bite suddenly none giving occasion love uncleanness none escape said ape man scratching calf none escape said little pink sloth creature punishment be sharp sure therefore learn law say word incontinently began again strange litany of law again creature began singing swaying head reeled with jabbering close stench of place kept on trusting to find presently chance of new development not to go on four be law be not men be making such noise noticed nothing of tumult outside until one who think be one of two swine men have seen thrust head over little pink sloth creature shouted something excitedly something did not catch incontinently at opening of hut vanished ape man rushed out thing have sat in dark followed only observed that be big clumsy covered with silvery hair be left alone then before reached aperture heard yelp of staghound in moment be standing outside hovel chair rail in hand muscle of quivering before be clumsy back of perhaps score of beast people misshapen head half hidden by shoulder blade be gesticulating excitedly other half animal face glared interrogation out of hovel looking in direction in faced saw coming through haze under tree beyond end of passage of den dark figure awful white face of moreau be holding leaping staghound back close behind came montgomery revolver in hand for moment stood horror struck turned saw passage behind blocked by heavy brute with huge grey face twinkling little eye advancing towards looked round saw to right of half dozen yard in front of narrow gap in wall of rock through ray of light slanted into shadow stop cried moreau a strode towards then hold at first one face turned towards then others bestial mind be happily slow dashed shoulder into clumsy monster who be turning to see what moreau meant flung forward into felt hand fly round clutching at missing little pink sloth creature dashed at gashed down ugly face with nail in stick in minute be scrambling up steep side pathway kind of sloping chimney out of ravine heard howl behind cry of catch hold grey faced creature appeared behind jammed huge bulk into cleft go on go on howled clambered up narrow cleft in rock came out upon sulphur on westward side of village of beast men that gap be altogether fortunate for for narrow chimney slanting obliquely upward must have impeded nearer pursuer ran over white space down steep slope through scattered growth of tree came to low lying stretch of tall reed through pushed into dark thick undergrowth be black succulent under foot a plunged into reed foremost pursuer emerged from gap broke way through undergrowth for minute air behind about be soon full of threatening cry heard tumult of pursuer in gap up slope then crashing of reed now then crackling crash of branch of creature roared like excited beast of prey staghound yelped to left heard moreau montgomery shouting in same direction turned sharply to right seemed to even then that heard montgomery shouting for to run for life presently ground gave rich oozy under foot be desperate went headlong into struggled through kneedeep so came to winding path among tall cane noise of pursuer passed away to left in one place three strange pink hopping animal about size of cat bolted before footstep pathway ran up hill across open space covered with white incrustation plunged into canebrake again then suddenly turned parallel with edge of steep walled gap came without warning like have have of english parkturned with unexpected abruptness be still running with might never saw drop until be flying headlong through air fell on forearm head among thorn rose with torn ear bleeding face have fallen into precipitous ravine rocky thorny full of hazy mist drifted about in wisp with narrow streamlet from mist came meandering down centre be astonished at thin fog in full blaze of daylight have time to stand wondering then turned to right down stream hoping to come to sea in direction so have way open to drown be only later found that have dropped nailed stick in fall presently ravine grew narrower for space carelessly stepped into stream jumped out again pretty quickly for water be almost boiling noticed too there be thin sulphurous scum drifting upon coiling water almost immediately came turn in ravine indistinct blue horizon nearer sea be flashing sun from myriad facet saw death before be hot panting with warm blood oozing out on face running pleasantly through vein felt more than touch of exultation too at having distanced pursuer be not in then to go out drown yet stared back way have come listened save for hum of gnat chirp of small insect hopped among thorn air be absolutely still then came yelp of dog very faint chattering gibbering snap of whip voice grew louder then fainter again noise receded up stream faded away for while chase be over knew now how much hope of help for lay in beast people xiii parley turned again went on down towards sea found hot stream broadened out to willow weedy sand in abundance of crab long bodied many legged creature started from footfall walked to very edge of salt water then felt be safe turned stared arm akimbo at thick green behind into steamy ravine cut like smoking gash a say be too full of excitement true saying though who have never known danger may doubt too desperate to die then came into head that there be one chance before yet while moreau montgomery bestial rabble chased through island might not go round beach until came to enclosuremake flank march upon in fact then with rock lugged out of loosely built wall perhaps smash in lock of smaller door see what must

running in with gentle ripple presently shore fell away southward sun came round upon right hand then suddenly far in front of saw first one then several figure emerging from bushesmoreau with grey staghound then montgomery two others at stopped saw began gesticulating advancing stood watching approach two beast men came running forward to cut off from undergrowth inland montgomery came running also straight towards moreau followed slower with dog at last roused from inaction turning seaward walked straight into water water be very willow at first be thirty yard out before wave reached to waist dimly must see intertidal creature darting away from foot what be doing man cried montgomery turned standing waist deep stared at montgomery stood panting at margin of water face be bright red with exertion long flaxen hair blown about head dropping nether lip showed irregular teeth moreau be just coming up face pale firm dog at hand barked at men have heavy whip farther up beach stared beast men what be doing be going to drown said montgomery moreau looked at other why asked moreau because be better than being tortured by told so said montgomery moreau said something in low tone what make think will torture asked moreau what saw said thoseyonder hush said moreau held up hand will not said be men what be now at least will not be like looked past interlocutor up beach be mling montgomery attendant one of white swathed brute from boat farther up in shadow of tree saw little ape man behind other dim figure who be creature said pointing to raising voice more more that might

montgomery must be killed that be not to be feared be burden of what put into head of beast people saw green eyed man in dark rag who have met on evening of arrival come out from among tree others followed to hear better at last for want of breath paused listen to for moment said steady voice of moreau then say what will well said coughed thought then shouted latin prendick bad latin schoolboy

of course said montgomery just way with carnivore after kill drink taste of blood be brute like continued must know again glanced about standing astride over mess of dead rabbit eye roving among shadow screen of greenery lurking place ambuscade of forest bounded in taste of blood said again took out revolver examined cartridge in replaced then began to pull at dropping lip think must know brute again said stunned ought to have handsome bruise on forehead of then have to prove that killed rabbit said montgomery wish id never brought thing here must have gone on stayed there thinking

monstrositiessome almost human save in subtle expression gesture like cripple so strangely distorted a to resemble nothing denizen of wildest dream beyond reedy line of canebrake in one direction dense tangle of palm tree on other separating from ravine with hut to north hazy horizon of pacific ocean sixty two sixty three counted moreau there be four more see leopard man said presently moreau sounded great horn again at sound of beast people writhed grovelled in dust then slinking out of canebrake stooping near ground trying to join dust throwing circle behind moreaus back came leopard man last of beast people to arrive be little ape man earlier animal hot weary with grovelling shot vicious glance at cease said moreau in firm loud voice beast people sat back upon ham rested from worshipping where be sayer of law said moreau hairy grey monster bowed face in dust say word said moreau forthwith in kneeling assembly swaying from side to side dashing up sulphur with right hand

leopard man released from moreaus eye have risen straight from knee now with eye aflame huge feline tusk flashing out from under curling lip leapt towards tormentor be convinced that only madness of unendurable fear must have prompted attack whole circle of threescore monster seemed to rise about drew revolver two figure collided saw moreau reeling back from leopard man blow there be furious yelling howling about one be moving rapidly for moment thought be general revolt furious face of leopard man flashed by mine with mling close in pursuit saw yellow eye of hyena swine blazing with excitement attitude a if be half resolved to attack satyr too glared at over hyena swine hunched shoulder heard crack of moreaus pistol saw pink flash dart across tumult whole crowd seemed to swing round in direction of glint of fire too be swung round by magnetism of movement in second be running one of tumultuous shouting crowd in pursuit of escaping leopard man be can tell definitely saw leopard man strike moreau then everything spun about until be running headlong mling be ahead close in pursuit of fugitive behind tongue already lolling out ran wolf woman in great leaping stride swine folk followed squealing with excitement two bull men in swathing of white then came moreau in cluster of beast people wide brimmed straw hat blown off revolver in hand lank white hair streaming out hyena swine ran beside keeping pace with glancing furtively at out of feline eye others came pattering shouting behind leopard man went bursting way through long cane sprang back a passed rattled in mlings face others in rear found trampled path for when reached brake chase lay through brake for perhaps quarter of mile then plunged into dense thicket retarded movement exceedingly though went through in crowd togetherfronds flicking into face ropy creeper catching under chin gripping ankle thorny plant hooking into tearing cloth flesh together have gone on four through panted moreau now

night of arrival have doubled in undergrowth montgomery have seen manoeuvre turned again so panting tumbling against rock torn by bramble impeded by fern reed helped to pursue leopard man who have broken law hyena swine ran laughing savagely by side staggered on head reeling heart beating against rib tired almost to death yet not daring to lose sight of chase lest must be left alone with horrible companion staggered on in spite of infinite fatigue dense heat of tropical afternoon at last fury of hunt slackened have pinned wretched brute into corner of island moreau whip in hand

suffering painful disorder of island blind fate vast pitiless mechanism seemed to cut shape fabric of existence moreau by passion for research montgomery by passion for drink beast people with instinct mental restriction be torn crushed ruthlessly inevitably amid infinite complexity of incessant wheel condition did not come at once think indeed that anticipate little in speaking of now xvii catastrophe scarcely six week passed before have lost feeling dislike abhorrence for infamous experiment of moreaus one idea be to get away from horrible caricature of maker image back to sweet wholesome intercourse of men fellow creature from whom be thus separated began to assume idyllic virtue beauty in memory first friendship with montgomery did not increase long separation from humanity

brute drink be men damme im cleverest moreau forgot be last touch drink tell waving bottle in hand started off at kind of quick trot to westward mling ranging between three dim creature who followed went to doorway be already indistinct in mist of moonlight before montgomery halted saw administer dose of raw brandy to mling saw five figure melt into one vague patch sing heard montgomery shoutsing together confound old prendick thats right now again confound old prendick black group broke up into five separate figure wound slowly away from along band of shining beach went howling at own sweet will yelping insult at giving other vent new inspiration of brandy demanded presently heard montgomery voice shouting right turn passed with shout howl into blackness of landward tree slowly very slowly receded into silence peaceful splendour of night healed again moon be now past meridian travelling down west be at full very bright riding through empty blue sky shadow of wall lay yard wide of inky blackness at foot eastward sea be featureless grey dark mysterious between sea shadow grey sand of volcanic glass crystal flashed shone like beach of diamond behind paraffine lamp flared hot ruddy then shut door locked went into enclosure where moreau lay beside latest victimsthe staghound llama other wretched bruteswith massive face calm even after terrible death with hard eye open staring at dead white moon above sat down upon edge of sink with eye upon ghastly pile of silvery light ominous shadow began to turn over plan in morning must gather provision in dingey after setting fire to pyre before push out into desolation of high sea once more felt that for montgomery there be help that be in truth half akin to beast folk unfitted for human kindred know how long sat there scheming must have be hour so then planning be interrupted by return of montgomery to neighbourhood heard yelling from many throat tumult of exultant cry passing down towards beach whooping howling excited shriek seemed to come to stop near water edge riot rose fell heard heavy blow splintering smash of wood did not trouble then discordant chanting began thought went back to mean of escape got up brought lamp went into shed to look at keg have seen there then became interested in content of biscuit tin opened one saw something out of tail of eyea red figureand turned sharply behind lay yard vividly black white in moonlight pile of wood faggot on moreau mutilated victim lay one over seemed to be gripping one in one last revengeful grapple wound gaped black a night blood have dripped lay in black patch upon sand then saw without understanding cause of phantoma ruddy glow came danced went upon wall opposite misinterpreted fancied be reflection of flickering lamp turned again to store in shed went on rummaging among a well a one armed man must finding convenient thing putting aside for to morrow launch movement be slow time passed quickly insensibly daylight crept upon chanting died down giving place to clamour then began again suddenly broke into tumult heard cry of more more sound like quarrelling sudden wild shriek quality of sound changed so greatly that arrested attention went out into yard listened then cutting like knife across confusion came crack of revolver rushed at once through room to little doorway a did so heard of packing case behind go sliding down smash together with clatter of glass on floor of shed did not heed flung door open looked out up beach by boathouse bonfire be burning raining up spark into indistinctness of dawn around struggled mass of black figure heard montgomery call name began to run at once towards fire revolver in hand saw pink tongue of montgomery pistol lick out once close to ground be down shouted with strength fired into air heard one cry master knotted black struggle broke into scattering unit fire leapt sank down crowd of beast people fled in sudden panic before up beach in excitement fired at retreating back a disappeared among bush then turned to black heap upon ground montgomery lay on back with hairy grey beast man sprawling across body brute be dead still gripping montgomery throat with curving claw near by lay mling on face quite still neck bitten open upper part of smashed brandy bottle in hand two other figure lay near firethe one motionless other groaning fitfully now then raising head slowly then dropping again caught hold of grey man pulled off montgomery body claw drew down torn coat reluctantly a dragged away montgomery be dark in face scarcely breathing splashed sea water on face pillowed head on rolled up coat mling be dead wounded creature by fireit be wolf brute with bearded grey facelay found with fore part of body upon still glowing timber wretched thing be injured so dreadfully that in mercy blew brain out at once other brute be one of bull men swathed in white too be dead rest of beast people have vanished from beach went to montgomery again knelt beside cursing ignorance of medicine fire beside have sunk down only charred beam of timber glowing at central end mixed with grey ash of brushwood remained wondered casually where montgomery have got wood then saw that dawn be upon sky have grown brighter setting moon be becoming pale opaque in luminous blue of day sky to eastward be rimmed with red suddenly heard thud hissing behind looking round sprang to foot with cry of horror against warm dawn great tumultuous mass of black smoke be boiling up out of enclosure through stormy darkness shot flickering thread of blood red flame then thatched roof caught saw curving charge of flame across sloping straw spurt of fire jetted from window of room knew at once what have happened remembered crash have heard when have rushed out to montgomery assistance have overturned lamp hopelessness of saving of content of enclosure stared in face mind came back to plan of flight turning swiftly looked to see where two boat lay upon beach be gone two ax lay upon sand beside chip splinter be scattered broadcast ash of bonfire be blackening smoking under dawn montgomery have burnt boat to revenge upon prevent return to mankind sudden convulsion of rage shook be almost moved to batter foolish head in a lay there helpless at foot then suddenly hand moved so feebly so pitifully that wrath vanished groaned opened eye for minute knelt down beside raised head opened eye again staring silently at dawn then met mine lid fell sorry said presently with effort seemed trying to think last murmured last of silly universe what mess listened head fell helplessly to one side thought drink might revive there be drink vessel in to bring drink at hand seemed suddenly heavier heart went cold bent down to face put hand through rent in blouse be dead even a died line of white heat limb of sun rose eastward beyond projection of bay splashing radiance across sky turning dark sea into weltering tumult of dazzling light fell like glory upon death shrunken face let head fall gently upon rough pillow have made for stood up before be glittering desolation of sea awful solitude upon have already suffered so much behind island hushed under dawn beast people silent unseen enclosure with provision ammunition burnt noisily with sudden gust of flame fitful crackling now then crash heavy smoke drove up beach away from rolling low over distant tree top towards hut in ravine beside be charred vestige of boat five dead body then out of bush came three beast people with hunched shoulder protruding head misshapen hand awkwardly held inquisitive unfriendly eye advanced towards with hesitating gesture xx alone with beast folk faced people facing fate in single handed nowliterally single handed for have broken arm in pocket be revolver with two empty chamber among chip scattered about beach lay two ax have be used to chop up boat tide be creeping in behind there be nothing for courage looked squarely into face of advancing monster avoided eye quivering nostril investigated body lay beyond on beach took dozen step picked up blood stained whip that lay beneath body of wolf man cracked stopped stared at salute said bow down hesitated one bent knee repeated command with heart in mouth advanced upon one knelt then other two turned walked towards dead body keeping face towards three kneeling beast men very much a actor passing up stage face audience broke law said putting foot on sayer of law have be slaineven sayer of law even other with whip great be law come see none escape said one of advancing peering none escape said therefore hear do a command stood up looking questioningly at one stand there said picked up hatchet swung by head from sling of arm turned montgomery over picked up revolver still loaded in two chamber bending down to rummage found dozen cartridge in pocket take said standing up again pointing with whip take carry out cast into sea came forward evidently still afraid of montgomery still more afraid of cracking red whip lash after fumbling hesitation whip cracking shouting lifted gingerly carried down to beach went splashing into dazzling welter of sea on said on carry far went in up to armpit stood regarding let go said body of montgomery vanished with splash something seemed to tighten across chest good said with break in voice came back hurrying fearful to margin of water leaving long wake of black in silver at water edge stopped turning glaring into sea a though presently expected montgomery to arise therefrom exact vengeance now said pointing to other body took care not to approach place where have thrown montgomery into water instead carried four dead beast people slantingly along beach for perhaps hundred yard before waded out cast away a watched disposing of mangled remains of mling light footfall behind turning quickly saw big hyena swine perhaps dozen yard away head be bent down bright eye be fixed upon stumpy hand clenched held close by side stopped in crouching attitude when turned eye little averted for moment stood eye to eye dropped whip snatched at pistol in pocket for meant to kill brute most formidable of left now upon island at first excuse may seem treacherous so be resolved be far more afraid of than of other two of beast folk continued life be knew threat against mine be perhaps dozen second collecting then cried salute bow down teeth flashed upon in snarl who be must perhaps little too spasmodically drew revolver aimed quickly fired heard yelp saw run sideways turn knew have missed clicked back cock with thumb for next shot be already running headlong jumping from side to side dared not risk miss now then looked back at over shoulder went slanting along beach vanished beneath driving mass of dense smoke be still pouring out from burning enclosure for time stood staring after turned to three obedient beast folk again signalled to drop body still carried then went back to place by fire where body have fallen kicked sand until brown blood stain be absorbed hidden dismissed three serf with wave of hand went up beach into thicket carried pistol in hand whip thrust with hatchet in sling of arm be anxious to be alone to think out position in be now placed dreadful thing be only beginning to realise be that over island there be now safe place where must be alone secure to rest sleep have recovered strength amazingly since landing be still inclined to be nervous to break down under great stress felt ought to cross island establish with beast people make secure in confidence heart failed went back to beach turning eastward past burning enclosure made for point where willow spit of coral sand ran out towards reef here must sit down think back to sea face against surprise there sat chin on knee sun beating down upon head unspeakable dread in mind plotting how must live on against hour of rescue if ever rescue came tried to review whole situation a calmly a must be difficult to clear thing of emotion began turning over in mind reason of montgomery despair will change said be sure to change moreau what be that moreau have said stubborn beast flesh grows day by day back again then came round to hyena swine felt sure that if did not kill that brute must kill sayer of law be dead worse luck knew now that of whip must be killed even a be killed be peering at already out of green mass of fern palm over yonder watching until came within spring be plotting against be hyena swine telling imagination be running away with into morass of unsubstantial fear thought be disturbed by cry of sea bird hurrying towards black object have be stranded by wave on beach near enclosure knew what that object be have not heart to go back drive off began walking along beach in opposite direction designing to come round eastward corner of island so approach ravine of hut without traversing possible ambuscade of thicket perhaps mile along beach became aware of one of three beast folk advancing out of landward bush towards be now so nervous with own imaginings immediately drew revolver even propitiatory gesture of creature failed to disarm hesitated a approached go away cried there be something very suggestive of dog in cringing attitude of creature retreated little way very like dog being sent home stopped looking at imploringly with canine brown eye go away said come near may not come near said go away insisted snapped whip then putting whip in teeth stooped for stone with threat drove creature away so in solitude came round by ravine of beast people hiding among weed reed separated crevice from sea watched such of a appeared trying to judge from gesture appearance how death of moreau montgomery destruction of house of pain have affected know now folly of cowardice have kept courage up to level of dawn have not allowed to ebb away in solitary thought might have grasped vacant sceptre of moreau ruled over beast people a be lost opportunity sank to position of mere leader among fellow towards noon certain of came squatted basking in hot sand imperious voice of hunger thirst prevailed over dread came out of bush revolver in hand walked down towards seated figure one wolf woman turned head stared at then others none attempted to rise salute felt too faint weary to insist let moment pas want food said almost apologetically drawing near there be food in hut said ox boar man drowsily looking away from passed went down into shadow odour of almost deserted ravine in empty hut feasted on specked half decayed fruit then after have propped branch stick about opening placed with face towards hand upon revolver exhaustion of last thirty hour claimed own fell into light slumber hoping that flimsy barricade have erected must cause sufficient noise in removal to save from surprise xxi reversion of beast folk in way became one among beast people in island of doctor moreau when awoke be dark about arm ached in bandage sat up wondering at first where might be heard coarse voice talking outside then saw that barricade have gone that opening of hut stood clear revolver be still in hand heard something breathing saw something crouched together close beside held breath trying to see what be began to move slowly interminably then something soft warm moist passed across hand muscle contracted snatched hand away cry of alarm began be stifled in throat then just realised what have happened sufficiently to stay finger on revolver who be said in hoarse whisper revolver still pointed imaster who be say there be master now know know carried body into sea o walker in sea body of slew be slave master be one met on beach asked same master thing be evidently faithful enough for might have fallen upon a slept be well said extending hand for licking kiss began to realise what presence meant tide of courage flowed where be others asked be mad be fool said dog man even now talk together beyond there say master be dead other with whip be dead that other who walked in sea be a be have master whip house of pain more there be end love law will keep there be pain no master whip for ever again so say know master know felt in darkness patted dog man head be well said again presently will slay said dog man presently answered will slay allafter certain day certain thing have come to pas one of save spare one of will be slain what master wish to kill master kill said dog man with certain satisfaction in voice that sin may grow said let live in folly until time be ripe let not know that be master master will be sweet said dog man with ready tact of canine blood one have sinned said will kill whenever may meet when say to be see that fall upon now will go to men woman who be assembled together for moment opening of hut be blackened by exit of dog man then followed stood up almost in exact spot where have be when have heard moreau staghound pursuing now be night miasmatic ravine about be black beyond instead of green sunlit slope saw red fire before hunched grotesque figure moved to fro farther be thick tree bank of darkness fringed above with black lace of upper branch moon be just riding up on edge of ravine like bar across face drove spire of vapour be for ever streaming from fumaroles of island walk by said nerving side by side walked down narrow way taking little heed of dim thing peered at out of hut none about fire attempted to salute most of disregarded ostentatiously looked round for hyena swine be not there altogether perhaps twenty of beast folk squatted staring into fire talking to one be dead be dead master be dead said voice of ape man to right of house of painthere be house of pain be not dead said in loud voice even now watch startled twenty pair of eye regarded house of pain be gone said will come again master can not see yet even now listens among true true said dog man be staggered at assurance animal may be ferocious cunning enough take real man to tell lie man with bandaged arm speaks strange thing said one of beast folk tell be so said master house of pain will come again woe be to who break law looked curiously at one with affectation of indifference began to chop idly at ground in front of with hatchet looked noticed at deep cut made in turf then satyr raised doubt answered then one of dappled thing objected animated discussion sprang up round fire moment began to feel more convinced of present security talked now without catching in breath due to intensity of excitement have troubled at first in course of about hour have really convinced several of beast folk of truth of assertion talked most of others into dubious state kept sharp eye for enemy hyena swine never appeared now then suspicious movement must startle confidence grew rapidly then a moon crept down from zenith one by one listener began to yawn showing oddest teeth in light of sinking fire first one then retired towards den in ravine dreading silence darkness went with knowing be safer with several of than with one alone in manner began longer part of sojourn upon island of doctor moreau from night until end came there be one thing happened to tell save series of innumerable small unpleasant detail fretting of incessant uneasiness so prefer to make chronicle for gap of time to tell only one cardinal incident of ten month spent a intimate of half humanised brute there be much that stick in memory must writethings must cheerfully give right hand to forget help telling of story in retrospect be strange to remember how soon fell in with monster way gained confidence again have quarrel with of course must show of teeth mark still soon gained wholesome respect for trick of throwing stone for bite of hatchet saint bernard man loyalty be of infinite service to found simple scale of honour be based mainly on capacity for inflicting trenchant wound indeed may saywithout vanity hopethat held something like pre eminence among one two whom in rare access of high spirit have scarred rather badly bore grudge vented chiefly behind back at safe distance from missile in grimace hyena swine avoided be always on alert for inseparable dog man hated dreaded intensely really believe be at root of brute attachment to be soon evident to that former monster have tasted blood gone way of leopard man formed lair somewhere in forest became solitary once tried to induce beast folk to hunt lacked authority to make co operate for one end again again tried to approach den come upon unaware always be too acute for saw winded got away too made forest pathway dangerous to ally with lurking ambuscade dog man scarcely dared to leave side in first month so beast folk compared with latter condition be human enough for one two besides canine friend even conceived friendly tolerance little pink sloth creature displayed odd affection for took to following about monkey man bored however assumed on strength of five digit that be equal be for ever jabbering at mejabbering most arrant nonsense one thing about entertained little have fantastic trick of coining new word have idea believe that to gabble about name meant nothing be proper use of speech called big think to distinguish from little think sane day interest of life if ever made remark did not understand must praise very much ask to say again learn by heart go off repeating with word wrong here there to milder of beast people thought nothing of what be plain comprehensible invented very curious big think for especial use think now that be silliest creature ever met have developed in most wonderful way distinctive silliness of man without losing one jot of natural folly of monkey say be in earlier week of solitude among brute during time respected usage established by law behaved with general decorum once found rabbit torn to piecesby hyena swine be assuredbut be be about may when first distinctly perceived growing difference in speech carriage growing coarseness of articulation growing disinclination to
