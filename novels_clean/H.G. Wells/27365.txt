chessman bead weapon box of eye two skull of tiger one human several moth eaten stuffed monkey one holding lamp old fashioned cabinet flyblown ostrich egg so fishing tackle extraordinarily dirty empty glass fish tank there be also at moment story begin mass of crystal worked into shape of egg brilliantly polished at two people who stood outside window be looking one of tall thin clergyman other black bearded young man of dusky complexion unobtrusive costume dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation seemed anxious for companion to purchase article while be there mr cave came into shop beard still wagging with bread butter of tea when saw men object of regard countenance fell glanced guiltily over shoulder softly shut door be little old man with pale face peculiar watery blue eye hair be dirty grey wore shabby blue frock coat ancient silk hat carpet slipper very much down at heel remained watching two men a talked clergyman went deep into trouser pocket examined handful of money showed teeth in agreeable smile mr cave seemed still more depressed when came into shop clergyman without ceremony asked price of crystal egg mr cave glanced nervously towards door leading into parlour said five pound clergyman protested that price be high to companion a well a to mr cave be indeed very much more than mr cave have intended to ask when have stocked article attempt at bargaining ensued mr cave stepped to shop door held open five pound be price said a though wished to save trouble of unprofitable discussion a did so upper portion of woman face appeared above blind in glass upper panel of door leading into parlour stared curiously at two customer five pound be price said mr cave with quiver in voice swarthy young man have so far remained spectator watching cave keenly now spoke give five pound said clergyman glanced at to see if be in earnest when looked at mr cave again saw that latter face be white be lot of money said clergyman diving into pocket began counting resource have little more than thirty shilling appealed to companion with whom seemed to be on term of considerable intimacy gave mr cave opportunity of collecting thought began to explain in agitated manner that crystal be not a matter of fact entirely free for sale two customer be naturally surprised at inquired why have not thought of before began to bargain mr cave became confused stuck to story that crystal be not in market afternoon that probable purchaser of have already appeared two treating a attempt to raise price still further made a if must leave shop at point parlour door opened owner of dark fringe little eye appeared be coarse featured corpulent woman younger very much larger than mr cave walked heavily face be flushed that crystal be for sale said five pound be good enough price for ca think what be about cave not to take gentleman offer mr cave greatly perturbed by irruption looked angrily at over rim of spectacle without excessive assurance asserted right to manage business in own way altercation began two customer watched scene with interest amusement occasionally assisting mr cave with suggestion mr cave hard driven persisted in confused impossible story of enquiry for crystal that morning agitation became painful stuck to point with extraordinary persistence be young oriental who ended curious controversy proposed that must call again in course of two day so a to give alleged enquirer fair chance then must insist said clergyman five pound mr cave took on to apologise for husband explaining that be sometimes little odd a two customer left couple prepared for free discussion of incident in bearing mr cave talked to husband with singular directness poor little man quivering with emotion muddled between story maintaining on one hand that have customer in view on other asserting that crystal be honestly worth ten guinea why did ask five pound said wife do let manage business own way said mr cave mr cave have living with step daughter step son at supper night transaction be re discussed none of have high opinion of mr cave business method action seemed culminating folly be opinion be refused that crystal before said step son loose limbed lout of eighteen five pound said step daughter argumentative young woman of six twenty mr cave answer be wretched must only mumble weak assertion that knew own business best drove from half eaten supper into shop to close for night ear aflame tear of vexation behind spectacle why have left crystal in window so long folly of be trouble closest in mind for time must see way of evading sale after supper step daughter step son smartened up went out wife retired upstairs to reflect upon business aspect of crystal over little sugar lemon so forth in hot water mr cave went into shop stayed there until late ostensibly to make ornamental rockery for goldfish case really for private purpose will be better explained later next day mr cave found that crystal have be removed from window be lying behind second hand book on angling replaced in conspicuous position did not argue further about a nervous headache disinclined from debate mr cave be always disinclined day passed disagreeably mr cave be if anything more absent minded than usual uncommonly irritable withal in afternoon when wife be taking customary sleep removed crystal from window again next day mr cave have to deliver consignment of dog fish at one of hospital school where be needed for dissection in absence mr cave mind reverted to topic of crystal method of expenditure suitable to windfall of five pound have already devised very agreeable expedient among others dress of green silk for herself trip to richmond when jangling of front door bell summoned into shop customer be examination coach who came to complain of non delivery of certain frog asked for previous day mr cave did not approve of particular branch of mr cave business gentleman who have called in somewhat aggressive mood retired after brief exchange of word entirely civil so far a be concerned mr cave eye then naturally turned to window for sight of crystal be assurance of five pound of dream what be surprise to find gone went to place behind locker on counter where have discovered day before be not there immediately began eager search about shop when mr cave returned from business with dog fish about quarter to two in afternoon found shop in confusion wife extremely exasperated on knee behind counter routing among taxidermic material face came up hot angry over counter a jangling bell announced return forthwith accused of hiding hid what asked mr cave crystal at mr cave apparently much surprised rushed to window be here said great heaven what have become of just then mr cave step son re entered shop from inner room have come home minute so before mr cave be blaspheming freely be apprenticed to second hand furniture dealer down road have meal at home be naturally annoyed to find dinner ready when heard of loss of crystal forgot meal anger be diverted from mother to step father first idea of course be that have hidden mr cave stoutly denied knowledge of fate freely offering bedabbled affidavit in matter at last be worked up to point of accusing first wife then step son of having taken with view to private sale so began exceedingly acrimonious emotional discussion ended for mr cave in peculiar nervous condition midway between hysteric amuck caused step son to be hour late at furniture establishment in afternoon mr cave took refuge from wife emotion in shop in evening matter be resumed with le passion in judicial spirit under presidency of step daughter supper passed unhappily culminated in painful scene mr cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation went out banging front door violently rest of family having discussed with freedom absence warranted hunted house from garret to cellar hoping to light upon crystal next day two customer called again be received by mr cave almost in tear transpired that one must imagine that have stood from cave at various time in married pilgrimage also gave garbled account of disappearance clergyman oriental laughed silently at one said be very extraordinary a mr cave seemed disposed to give complete history of life made to leave shop thereupon mr cave still clinging to hope asked for clergyman address so that if must get anything out of cave might communicate address be duly given apparently be afterwards mislaid mr cave can remember nothing about in evening of day cave seem to have exhausted emotion mr cave who have be out in afternoon supped in gloomy isolation contrasted pleasantly with impassioned controversy of previous day for time matter be very badly strained in cave household crystal customer reappeared now without mincing matter must admit that mr cave be liar knew perfectly well where crystal be be in room of mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator at st catherine hospital westbourne street stood on sideboard partially covered by black velvet cloth beside decanter of american whisky be from mr wace indeed that particular upon narrative be based be derived cave have taken off thing to hospital hidden in dog fish sack there have pressed young investigator to keep for mr wace be little dubious at first relationship to cave be peculiar have taste for singular character have more than once invited old man to smoke drink in room to unfold rather amusing view of life in general of wife in particular mr wace have encountered mr cave too on occasion when mr cave be not at home to attend to knew constant interference to cave be subjected having weighed story judicially decided to give crystal refuge mr cave promised to explain reason for remarkable affection for crystal more fully on later occasion spoke distinctly of seeing vision therein called on mr wace same evening told complicated story crystal said have come into possession with other oddment at forced sale of curiosity dealer effect not knowing what value might be have ticketed at ten shilling have hung upon hand at price for month be thinking of reducing figure when made singular discovery at time health be very bad must be borne in mind that throughout experience physical condition be one of ebb be in considerable distress by reason of negligence positive ill treatment even received from wife step child wife be vain extravagant unfeeling have growing taste for private drinking step daughter be mean over reaching step son have conceived violent dislike for lost chance of showing requirement of business pressed heavily upon mr wace doe not think that be altogether free from occasional intemperance have begun life in comfortable position be man of fair education suffered for week at stretch from melancholia insomnia afraid to disturb family must slip quietly from wife side when thought became intolerable wander about house about three o'clock one morning late in august chance directed into shop dirty little place be impenetrably black except in one spot where perceived unusual glow of light approaching discovered to be crystal egg be standing on corner of counter towards window thin ray smote through crack in shutter impinged upon object seemed a be to fill entire interior occurred to mr cave that be not in accordance with law of optic a have known in younger day must understand ray being refracted by crystal coming to focus in interior diffusion jarred with physical conception approached crystal nearly peering into round with transient revival of scientific curiosity that in youth have determined choice of calling be surprised to find light not steady writhing within substance of egg a though object be hollow sphere of luminous vapour in moving about to get different point of view suddenly found that have come between ray that crystal none le remained luminous greatly astonished lifted out of light ray carried to darkest part of shop remained bright for four five minute when slowly faded went out placed in thin streak of daylight luminousness be almost immediately restored so far at least mr wace be able to verify remarkable story of mr cave have repeatedly held crystal in ray of light have to be of le diameter than one millimetre in perfect darkness such a must be produced by velvet wrapping crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent must seem however that luminousness be of exceptional sort not equally visible to eye for mr harbinger whose name will be familiar to scientific reader in connection with pasteur institute be quite unable to see light mr wace own capacity for appreciation be out of comparison inferior to of mr cave even with mr cave power varied very considerably vision be most vivid during state of extreme weakness fatigue now from outset light in crystal exercised curious fascination upon mr cave say more for loneliness of soul than volume of pathetic writing must do that told human being of curious observation seems to have be living in such atmosphere of petty spite to admit existence of pleasure must have be to risk loss of found that a dawn advanced amount of diffused light increased crystal became to appearance non luminous for time be unable to see anything in except at night time in dark corner of shop use of old velvet cloth used a background for collection of mineral occurred to by doubling putting over head hand be able to get sight of luminous movement within crystal even in daytime be very cautious lest must be thus discovered by wife practised occupation only in afternoon while be asleep upstairs then circumspectly in hollow under counter one day turning crystal about in hand saw something came went like flash gave impression that object have for moment opened to view of wide spacious strange country turning about did just a light faded see same vision again now must be tedious unnecessary to state phase of mr cave discovery from point suffice that effect be crystal being peered into at angle of about degree from direction of illuminating ray gave clear consistent picture of wide peculiar countryside be not dream like at produced definite impression of reality better light more real solid seemed be moving picture be to say certain object moved in slowly in orderly manner like real thing according a direction of lighting vision changed picture changed also must indeed have be like looking through oval glass at view turning glass about to get at different aspect mr cave statement mr wace assures be extremely circumstantial entirely free from of emotional quality taint hallucinatory impression must be remembered that effort of mr wace to see similar clarity in faint opalescence of crystal be wholly unsuccessful try a must difference in intensity of impression received by two men be very great be quite conceivable that what be view to mr cave be mere blurred nebulosity to mr view a mr cave described be invariably of extensive plain seemed always to be looking at from considerable height a if from tower mast to east to west plain be bounded at remote distance by vast reddish cliff reminded of have seen in picture what picture be mr wace be unable to ascertain cliff passed north south must tell point of compass by star be visible of night receding in almost illimitable perspective fading into mist of distance before met be nearer eastern set of cliff on occasion of first vision sun be rising over black against sunlight pale against shadow appeared multitude of soaring form mr cave regarded a bird vast range of building spread below seemed to be looking down upon a approached blurred refracted edge of picture became indistinct there be also tree curious in shape in colouring deep mossy green exquisite grey beside wide shining canal something great brilliantly coloured flew across picture first time mr cave saw picture saw only in flash hand shook head moved vision came went grew foggy indistinct at first have greatest difficulty in finding picture again once direction of be lost next clear vision came about week after first interval having yielded nothing tantalising glimpse useful experience showed view down length of valley view be different have curious persuasion subsequent observation abundantly confirmed that be regarding strange world from exactly same spot although be looking in different direction long facade of great building whose roof have looked down upon before be now receding in perspective recognised roof in front of facade be terrace of massive proportion extraordinary length down middle of terrace at certain interval stood huge very graceful mast bearing small shiny object reflected setting sun import of small object did not occur to mr cave until time after a be describing scene to mr wace terrace overhung thicket of most luxuriant graceful vegetation beyond be wide grassy lawn on certain broad creature in form like beetle enormously larger reposed beyond again be richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone beyond lined with dense red weed passing up valley exactly parallel with distant cliff be broad mirror like expanse of water air seemed full of squadron of great bird manoeuvring in stately curve across river be multitude of splendid building richly coloured glittering with metallic tracery facet among forest of moss like lichenous tree suddenly something flapped repeatedly across vision like fluttering of jewelled fan beating of wing face rather upper part of face with very large eye came a be close to own a if on other side of crystal mr cave be so startled so impressed by absolute reality of eye that drew head back from crystal to look behind have become so absorbed in watching that be quite surprised to find in cool darkness of little shop with familiar odour of methyl mustiness decay a blinked about glowing crystal faded went out such be first general impression of mr cave story be curiously direct circumstantial from outset when valley first flashed momentarily on sens imagination be strangely affected a began to appreciate detail of scene saw wonder rose to point of passion went about business listless distraught thinking only of time when must be able to return to watching then few week after first sight of valley came two customer stress excitement of offer narrow escape of crystal from sale a have already told now while thing be mr cave secret remained mere wonder thing to creep to covertly peep at a child might peep upon forbidden garden mr wace have for young scientific investigator particularly lucid consecutive habit of mind directly crystal story came to have satisfied by seeing phosphorescence with own eye that there really be certain evidence for mr cave statement proceeded to develop matter systematically mr cave be only too eager to come feast eye on wonderland saw came night from half past eight until past ten sometimes in mr wace absence during day on sunday afternoon also came from outset mr wace made copious note be due to scientific method that relation between direction from initiating ray entered crystal orientation of picture be proved by covering crystal in box perforated only with small aperture to admit exciting ray by substituting black holland for buff blind greatly improved condition of observation so in little while be able to survey valley in direction desired so having cleared way may give brief account of visionary world within crystal thing be in case seen by mr cave method of working be invariably for to watch crystal report what saw while mr wace who a science student have learnt trick of writing in dark wrote brief note of report when crystal faded be put into box in proper position electric light turned on mr wace asked question suggested observation to clear up difficult point nothing indeed must have be le visionary more matter of fact attention of mr cave have be speedily directed to bird like creature have seen so abundantly present in of earlier vision first impression be soon corrected considered for time that might represent diurnal specie of bat then thought grotesquely enough that might be cherub head be round curiously human be eye of one of have so startled on second observation have broad silvery wing not feathered glistening almost a brilliantly a new killed fish with same subtle play of colour wing be not built on plan of bird wing bat mr wace learned supported by curved rib radiating from body sort of butterfly wing with curved rib seems best to express appearance body be small fitted with two bunch of prehensile organ like long tentacle immediately under mouth incredible a appeared to mr wace persuasion at last became irresistible that be creature owned great quasi human building magnificent garden made broad valley so splendid mr cave perceived that building with other peculiarity have door that great circular window opened freely gave creature egress entrance must alight upon tentacle fold wing to smallness almost rod like hop into interior among be multitude of smaller winged creature like great dragon fly moth flying beetle across greensward brilliantly coloured gigantic ground beetle crawled lazily to fro moreover on causeway terrace large headed creature similar to greater winged fly wingless be visible hopping busily upon hand like tangle of tentacle allusion have already be made to glittering object upon mast stood upon terrace of nearer building dawned upon mr cave after regarding one of mast very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that glittering object there be crystal exactly like into peered still more careful scrutiny convinced that one in vista of nearly twenty carried similar object occasionally one of large flying creature must flutter up to one folding wing coiling number of tentacle about mast must regard crystal fixedly for space sometimes for a long a fifteen minute series of observation made at suggestion of mr wace convinced watcher so far a visionary world be concerned crystal into peered actually stood at summit of endmost mast on terrace that on one occasion at least one of inhabitant of other world have looked into mr cave face while be making observation so much for essential fact of very singular story unless dismiss a ingenious fabrication of mr wace have to believe one of two thing mr cave crystal be in two world at once that while be carried about in one remained stationary in other seems altogether absurd else that have peculiar relation of sympathy with exactly similar crystal in other world so what be seen in interior of one in world be under suitable condition visible to observer in corresponding crystal in other world vice versa at present indeed know of way in two crystal must so come en rapport nowadays know enough to understand that thing be not altogether impossible view of crystal a en rapport be supposition occurred to mr wace to at least seems extremely plausible where be other world on also alert intelligence of mr wace speedily threw light after sunset sky darkened rapidly there be very brief twilight interval indeed star shone out be recognisably same a see arranged in same constellation mr cave recognised bear pleiades aldebaran sirius so that other world must be somewhere in solar system at utmost only few hundred of million of mile from own following up clue mr wace learned that midnight sky be darker blue even than midwinter sky that sun seemed little smaller there be two small moon like moon smaller quite differently marked one of moved so rapidly that motion be clearly visible a one regarded moon be never high in sky vanished a rose be time revolved be eclipsed because be so near primary planet answer quite completely although mr cave did not know to what must be condition of thing on mar indeed seems exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into crystal mr cave did actually see planet mar inhabitant if be case then evening star shone so brilliantly in sky of distant vision be neither more le than own familiar earth for time martian if be martian seem to have known of mr cave inspection once twice one must come to peer go away very shortly to other mast a though vision be unsatisfactory during time mr cave be able to watch proceeding of winged people without being disturbed by attention although report be necessarily vague fragmentary be nevertheless very suggestive imagine impression of humanity martian observer must get who after difficult process of preparation with considerable fatigue to eye be able to peer at london from steeple of st martin church for stretch at longest of four minute at time mr cave be unable to ascertain if winged martian be same a martian who hopped about causeway terrace if latter must put on wing at will several time saw certain clumsy biped dimly suggestive of ape white partially translucent feeding among certain of lichenous tree once of fled before one of hopping round headed martian latter caught one in tentacle then picture faded suddenly left mr cave most tantalisingly in dark on occasion vast thing mr cave thought at first be gigantic insect appeared advancing along causeway beside canal with extraordinary rapidity a drew nearer mr cave perceived that be mechanism of shining metal of extraordinary complexity then when looked again have passed out of sight after time mr wace aspired to attract attention of martian next time that strange eye of one of appeared close to crystal mr cave cried out sprang away immediately turned on light began to gesticulate in manner suggestive of signalling when at last mr cave examined crystal again martian have departed thus far observation have progressed in early november then mr cave feeling that suspicion of family about crystal be allayed began to take to fro with in order that a occasion arose in daytime night might comfort with what be fast becoming most real thing in existence in december mr wace work in connection with forthcoming examination became heavy sitting be reluctantly suspended for week for ten eleven day be not quite sure saw nothing of cave then grew anxious to resume investigation stress of seasonal labour being abated went down to seven dial at corner noticed shutter before bird fancier window then at cobbler mr cave shop be closed rapped door be opened by step son in black at once called mr cave who be mr wace must not observe in cheap ample widow weed of most imposing pattern without very great surprise mr wace learnt that cave be dead already buried be in tear voice be little thick have just returned from highgate mind seemed occupied with own prospect honourable detail of obsequies mr wace be at last able to learn particular of cave death have be found dead in shop in early morning day after last visit to mr wace crystal have be clasped in stone cold hand face be smiling said mr cave velvet cloth from mineral lay on floor at foot must have be dead five six hour when be found came a great shock to wace began to reproach bitterly for having neglected plain symptom of old man ill health chief thought be of crystal approached that topic in gingerly manner because knew mr cave peculiarity be dumbfoundered to learn that be sold mr cave first impulse directly cave body have be taken upstairs have be to write to mad clergyman who have offered five pound for crystal informing of recovery after violent hunt in daughter joined be convinced of loss of address a be without mean required to mourn bury cave in elaborate style dignity of old seven dial inhabitant demand have appealed to friendly fellow tradesman in great portland street have very kindly taken over portion of stock at valuation valuation be own crystal egg be included in one of lot mr wace after few suitable consolatory observation little off handedly proffered perhaps hurried at once to great portland street there learned that crystal egg have already be sold to tall dark man in grey there material fact in curious to at least very suggestive story come abruptly to end great portland street dealer did not know who tall dark man in grey be have observed with sufficient attention to describe minutely did not even know way person have gone after leaving shop for time mr wace remained in shop trying dealer patience with hopeless question venting own exasperation at last realising abruptly that whole thing have passed out of hand have vanished like vision of night returned to own room little astonished to find note have made still tangible visible upon untidy table annoyance disappointment be naturally very great made second call equally ineffectual upon great portland street dealer resorted to advertisement in such periodical a be likely to come into hand of bric brac collector also wrote letter to daily chronicle nature periodical suspecting hoax asked to reconsider action before printed be advised that strange story unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence might imperil reputation a investigator moreover call of proper work be urgent so after month so save for occasional reminder to certain dealer have reluctantly to abandon quest for crystal egg from day to remains undiscovered occasionally however tell can quite believe have burst of zeal in abandon more urgent occupation resume search whether not will remain lost for ever with material origin of be thing equally speculative at present time if present purchaser be collector one must have expected enquiry of mr wace to have reached through dealer have be able to discover mr cave clergyman oriental other than rev james parker young prince of bosso kuni in java be obliged to for certain particular object of prince be simply curiosity extravagance be so eager to buy because cave be so oddly reluctant to sell be just a possible that buyer in second instance be simply casual purchaser not collector at crystal egg for know may at present moment be within mile of decorating drawing room serving a paper weight remarkable function unknown indeed be partly with idea of such possibility have thrown narrative into form will give chance of being read by ordinary consumer of fiction own idea in matter be practically identical with of mr wace believe crystal on mast in mar crystal egg of mr cave to be in physical at present quite inexplicable way en rapport believe further that terrestrial crystal must have be possibly at remote date sent hither from planet in order to give martian near view of affair possibly fellow to crystal in other mast be also on globe theory of hallucination suffices for fact star star be on first day of new year that announcement be made almost simultaneously from three observatory that motion of planet neptune outermost of planet wheel about sun have become very erratic ogilvy have already called attention to suspected retardation in velocity in december such piece of news be scarcely calculated to interest world greater portion of whose inhabitant be unaware of existence of planet neptune outside astronomical profession did subsequent discovery of faint remote speck of light in region of perturbed planet cause very great excitement scientific people however found intelligence remarkable enough even before became known that new body be rapidly growing larger brighter that motion be quite different from orderly progress of planet that deflection of neptune satellite be becoming now of unprecedented kind few people without training in science can realise huge

be black by day bird began to stir thing have gone into hiding for fear of movement crept out after time taller branch flamed out at touch of sunset high overhead rook who be wiser than men went cawing home to squatting place among elm looking down thing be clearer darker eudena thought of going back to squatting place let down way then fear of terror of woodshade came again while hesitated

yesterday thin spire of smoke swaying in morning breeze far away by river be cluster of alder where have hidden at sight of that fear of uya returned crept into thicket of bracken out of rabbit scuttled lay awhile to watch squatting place men be mostly out of sight saving wau flint chopper at felt safer be away hunting food doubt of woman too be down in stream stooping intent seeking mussel crayfish water snail at sight of occupation eudena felt hungry rose ran through fern designing to join a went heard voice among bracken calling softly stopped then suddenly heard rustle behind turning saw ugh lomi rising out of fern there be streak of brown blood dirt on face eye be fierce white stone of uya white fire stone none uya dared to touch be in hand in stride be beside gripped arm swung about thrust before towards wood uya said waved arm about heard cry looked back saw woman standing up two wading out of stream then came nearer howling old woman with beard who watched fire on knoll be waving arm wau man who have be chipping flint be getting to foot little child too be hurrying shouting come said ugh lomi dragged by arm still did not understand uya have called death word said ugh lomi glanced back at screaming curve of figure understood wau woman child be coming towards scattered array of buff shock headed figure howling leaping cry over knoll two youth hurried down among fern to right came man heading off from wood ugh lomi left arm two began running side by side leaping bracken stepping clear wide eudena knowing fleetness fleetness of ugh lomi laughed aloud at unequal chase be exceptionally straight limbed couple for day soon cleared open drew near wood of chestnut tree again afraid now because be alone slackened pace already not excessive suddenly eudena cried swerved aside pointing looking up through tree stem ugh lomi saw foot leg of men running towards eudena be already running off at tangent a too turned to follow heard voice of uya coming through tree roaring out rage at then terror came in heart not terror that numbs terror make one silent swift be cut off now on two side be in sort of corner of pursuit on right hand near by came men swift heavy with bearded uya antler in hand leading on left scattered a one scatter corn yellow dash among fern grass ran wau woman even little child from willow have joined chase two party converged upon off went with eudena ahead knew there be mercy for there be hunting so sweet to ancient men a hunting of men once fierce passion of chase be lit feeble beginning of humanity in be thrown to wind uya in night have marked ugh lomi with death word ugh lomi be day quarry appointed feast ran straight be only chance taking ground came in way spread of stinging nettle open glade clump of grass out of hyaena fled snarling then wood again long stretch of shady leaf mould moss under green trunk then stiff slope tree clad long vista of tree glade succulent green area of black mud wide open space again then clump of lacerating bramble with beast track through behind chase trailed out scattered with uya ever at heel eudena kept first place running light with breath easy for ugh lomi carried fire stone in hand told on pace not at first after time footstep behind suddenly grew remote glancing over shoulder a crossed open space eudena saw that ugh lomi be many yard behind uya close upon with antler already raised in air to strike down wau others be just emerging from shadow of wood seeing ugh lomi in peril eudena ran sideways looking back threw up arm cried aloud just a antler flew young ugh lomi expecting understanding cry ducked head so that missile merely struck scalp lightly making trivial wound flew over turned forthwith quartzite fire stone in hand hurled straight at uya body a ran loose from throw uya shouted must not dodge took under rib heavy flat reeled went down without cry ugh lomi caught up antler one tine of be tipped with own blood came running on again with red trickle just coming out of hair uya rolled over twice lay moment before got up then did not run fast colour of face be changed wau overtook then others coughed laboured in breath kept on at last two fugitive gained bank of river where stream ran deep narrow still have fifty yard in hand of wau foremost pursuer man who made smiting stone carried one large flint shape of oyster double size chipped to chisel edge in hand sprang down steep bank into stream rushed through water swam deep current in two three stroke came out wading again dripping refreshed to clamber up farther bank be undermined with willow growing thickly therefrom so that needed clambering while eudena be still among silvery branch ugh lomi still in water for antler have encumbered wau came up against sky on opposite bank smiting stone thrown cunningly took side of eudena knee struggled to top fell heard pursuer shout to one ugh lomi climbing to moving jerkily to mar wau aim felt second smiting stone graze ear heard water splash below then be ugh lomi stripling proved to have come to man estate for running on found eudena fell behind limping at that turned cry savagely with face terrible with sudden wrath trickling blood ran swiftly past back to bank whirling antler round head eudena kept on running stoutly still though must need limp at step pain be already sharp so wau rising over edge clutching straight willow branch saw ugh lomi towering over gigantic against blue saw whole body swing round grip of hand upon antler edge of antler came sweeping through air saw more water under osier whirled eddied went crimson six foot down stream uya following stopped knee high across stream man who be swimming turned about other men who trailed after be none of very mighty men for uya be more cunning than strong brooking sturdy rival slackened momentarily at sight of ugh lomi standing there above willow bloody terrible between halting girl with huge antler waving in hand seemed a though have gone into water youth come out of man full grown knew what there be behind broad stretch of grass then thicket in eudena must hide be clear in mind though thinking power be too feeble to see what must happen thereafter uya stood knee deep undecided unarmed heavy mouth hung open showing canine teeth panted heavily side be flushed bruised under hair other man beside carried sharpened stick rest of hunter came up one by one to top of bank hairy long armed men clutching flint stick two ran off along bank down stream then clambered to water where wau have come to surface struggling weakly before must reach went under again two others threatened ugh lomi from bank answered back shout vague insult gesture then uya who have be hesitating roared with rage whirling fist plunged into water follower splashed after ugh lomi glanced over shoulder found eudena already vanished into thicket must perhaps have waited for uya uya preferred to spar in water below until others be beside human tactic in day in serious fighting be tactic of pack prey turned at bay gathered around rushed ugh lomi felt rush coming hurling antler at uya turned about fled when halted to look back from shadow of thicket found only three of pursuer have followed across river be going back again uya with bleeding mouth be on farther side of stream again lower down holding hand to side others be in river dragging something to shore for time at least chase be intermitted ugh lomi stood watching for space snarled at sight of uya then turned plunged into thicket in minute eudena came hastening to join went on hand in hand dimly perceived pain suffered from cut bruised knee chose easier way went on day mile after mile through wood thicket until at last came to chalkland open grass with rare wood of beech birch growing near water saw wealden mountain nearer group of horse grazing together went circumspectly keeping always near thicket cover for be strange region even way be strange steadily ground rose until chestnut forest spread wide blue below thames marsh shone silvery high far saw men for in day men be still only just come into part of world be moving slowly along river way towards evening came on river again now ran in gorge between high cliff of white chalk sometimes overhung down cliff be scrub of birch there be many bird there high up cliff be little shelf by tree whereon clambered to pas night have have scarcely food be not time of year for berry have time to go aside to snare waylay tramped in hungry weary silence gnawing at twig leaf over surface of cliff be multitude of snail in bush be freshly laid egg of little bird then ugh lomi threw at killed squirrel in beech tree so at last fed well ugh lomi watched during night chin on knee heard young fox cry hard by noise of mammoth down gorge hyaena yelling laughing far away be chilly dared not light fire whenever dozed spirit went abroad straightway met with spirit of uya fought always ugh lomi be paralysed so that must not smite run then must awake suddenly eudena too dreamt evil thing of uya so that awoke with fear of in heart by light of dawn saw woolly rhinoceros go blundering down valley during day caressed one be glad of sunshine eudena leg be so stiff sat on ledge day ugh lomi found great flint sticking out of cliff face greater than have seen dragged to ledge began chipping so a to be armed against uya when came again at one laughed heartily eudena laughed threw about in derision have hole in stuck finger through be very funny indeed then peeped at one through afterwards ugh lomi got stick thrusting by chance at foolish flint stick went in stuck there have rammed in too tightly to withdraw be still stranger scarcely funny terrible almost for time ugh lomi did not greatly care to touch thing be a if flint have bit held with teeth then got familiar with odd combination swung about perceived that stick with heavy stone on end struck better blow than anything knew went to fro swinging striking with later tired of threw aside in afternoon went up over brow of white cliff lay watching by rabbit warren until rabbit came out to play there be men thereabouts rabbit be heedless threw smiting stone have made got kill night made fire from flint spark bracken frond talked caressed by in sleep uya spirit came again suddenly while ugh lomi be trying to fight vainly foolish flint on stick came into hand struck uya with behold killed afterwards came other dream of uya for spirit take lot of killing have to be killed again then after that stone must not keep on stick awoke tired rather gloomy be sulky forenoon in spite of eudena kindliness instead of hunting sat chipping sharp edge to singular flint looking strangely at then bound perforated flint on to stick with strip of rabbit skin afterwards walked up down ledge striking with muttering to thinking of uya felt very fine heavy in hand several day more than there be counting in day five day may be six did ugh lomi eudena stay on shelf in gorge of river lost fear of men fire burnt redly of night be very merry together there be food day sweet water enemy eudena knee be well in couple of day for ancient savage have quick healing flesh indeed be very happy on one of day ugh lomi dropped chunk of flint over cliff saw fall go bounding across river bank into river after laughing thinking over little tried smashed bush of hazel in most interesting way spent morning dropping stone from ledge in afternoon discovered new interesting pastime be also possible from cliffbrow next day have forgotten delight at least seemed have forgotten uya came in dream to spoil paradise three night came fighting ugh lomi in morning after dream ugh lomi must walk up down threatening swinging axe at last came night after ugh lomi brained otter have feasted uya went too far ugh lomi awoke scowling under heavy brow took axe extending hand towards eudena bade wait for upon ledge then clambered down white declivity glanced up once from foot of flourished axe without looking back again went striding along river bank until overhanging cliff at bend hid two day night did eudena sit alone by fire on ledge waiting in night beast howled over cliff down valley on cliff over against hunched hyaena prowled black against sky evil thing came near save fear once far away heard roaring of lion following horse a came northward over grass land with spring time waited waiting be pain third day ugh lomi came back up river plume of raven be in hair first axe be red stained have long dark hair upon carried necklace have marked favourite of uya in hand walked in soft place giving heed to trail save raw cut below jaw there be not wound upon uya cried ugh lomi exultant eudena saw be well put necklace on eudena ate drank together after eating began to rehearse whole story from beginning when uya have cast eye on eudena uya ugh lomi fighting in forest have be chased by bear eking out scanty word with abundant pantomime springing to foot whirling stone axe round when came to fighting last fight be mighty one stamping shouting once blow at fire sent torrent of spark up into night eudena sat red in light of fire gloating on face flushed eye shining necklace uya have made about neck be splendid time star look down on looked down on ancestor who have be dead now fifty thousand year ii cave bear in day when eudena ugh lomi fled from people of uya towards fir clad mountain of weald across forest of sweet chestnut grass clad chalkland hid at last in gorge of river between chalk cliff men be few squatting place far between nearest men to be of tribe full day journey down river up mountain there be none man be indeed newcomer to part of world in ancient time coming slowly along river generation after generation from one squatting place to from south westward animal held land hippopotamus rhinoceros of river valley horse of grass plain deer swine of wood grey ape in branch cattle of upland feared little let alone mammoth in mountain elephant came through land in summer time out of south for why must fear with rough chipped flint that have not learnt to haft threw ill poor spear of sharpened wood a weapon have against hoof horn tooth claw andoo huge cave bear who lived in cave up gorge have never even seen man in wise respectable life until midway through one night a be prowling down gorge along cliff edge saw glare of eudena fire upon ledge eudena red shining ugh lomi with gigantic shadow mocking upon white cliff going to fro shaking mane of hair waving axe of stone first axe of stone while chanted of killing of uya cave bear be far up gorge saw thing slanting way far off be so surprised stood quite still upon edge sniffing novel odour of burning bracken wondering whether dawn be coming up in wrong place be lord of rock cave be cave bear a slighter brother grizzly be lord of thick wood below a dappled lion lion of day be dappled be lord of thorn thicket reed bed open plain be greatest of meat eater knew fear none preyed on none gave battle only rhinoceros be beyond strength even mammoth shunned country invasion perplexed noticed new beast be shaped like monkey sparsely hairy like young pig monkey young pig said cave bear might not be so bad that red thing that jump black thing jumping with yonder never in life have seen such thing before came slowly along brow of cliff towards stopping thrice to sniff peer reek of fire grew stronger couple of hyaena also be so intent upon thing below andoo coming soft easy be close upon before knew of of started guiltily went lurching off coming round in wheel hundred yard off began yelling calling name to revenge for start have have ya have cried who ca grub own burrow who eats root like pig ya have for even in day hyaena manner be just a offensive a be now who answer hyaena growled andoo peering through midnight dimness at then going to look at cliff edge there be ugh lomi still telling story fire getting low scent of burning hot strong andoo stood on edge of chalk cliff for time shifting vast weight from foot to foot swaying head to fro with mouth open ear erect twitching nostril of big black muzzle sniffing be very curious be cave bear more curious than of bear live now flickering fire incomprehensible movement of man let alone intrusion into indisputable province stirred with sense of strange new happening have be after red deer fawn night for cave bear be miscellaneous hunter quite turned from enterprise ya have yelled hyaena behind ya have have peering through starlight andoo saw there be now three four going to fro against grey hillside will hang about now night until kill said andoo filth of world mainly to annoy resolved to watch red flicker in gorge until dawn came to drive hyaena scum home after time vanished heard voice like party of cockney beanfeasters away in beechwood then came slinking near again andoo yawned went on along cliff followed then stopped went back be splendid night beset with shining constellation same star not same constellation know for since day star have have time to move into new place far away across open space beyond where heavy shouldered lean bodied hyaena blundered howled be beechwood mountain slope rose beyond dim mystery until snow capped summit came out white cold clear touched by first ray of yet unseen moon be vast silence save when yell of hyaena flung vanishing discordance across peace when from down hill trumpeting of new come elephant came faintly on faint breeze below now red flicker have dwindled be steady shone deeper red ugh lomi have finished story be preparing to sleep eudena sat listened to strange voice of unknown beast watched dark eastern sky growing deeply luminous at advent of moon down below river talked to thing unseen went to fro after time bear went away in hour be back again then a if struck by thought turned went up gorge night passed ugh lomi slept on waning moon rose lit gaunt white cliff overhead with light be pale vague gorge remained in deeper shadow seemed darker then by imperceptible degree day came stealing in wake of moonlight eudena eye wandered to cliff brow overhead once then again time line be sharp clear against sky yet have dim perception of something lurking there red of fire grew deeper deeper grey scale spread upon vertical column of smoke became more more visible up down gorge thing have be unseen grew clear in colourless illumination may have dozed suddenly started up from squatting position erect alert scrutinising cliff up down made faintest sound ugh lomi too light sleeping like animal be instantly awake caught up axe came noiselessly to side light be still dim world now in black dark grey one sickly star still lingered overhead ledge be on be little grassy space six foot wide perhaps twenty foot long sloping outwardly with handful of st john wort growing near edge below soft white rock fell away in steep slope of nearly fifty foot to thick bush of hazel fringed river down river slope increased until way off thin grass held own right up to crest of cliff overhead forty fifty foot of rock bulged into great mass characteristic of chalk at end of ledge gully precipitous groove of discoloured rock slashed face of cliff gave footing to scrubby growth by eudena ugh lomi went up down stood a noiseless a startled deer with sense expectant for minute heard nothing then came faint rattling of dust down gully creaking of twig ugh lomi gripped axe went to edge of ledge for bulge of chalk overhead have hidden upper part of gully forthwith with sudden contraction of heart saw cave bear half way down from brow making gingerly backward step with flat hind foot hind quarter be towards ugh lomi clawed at rock bush so that seemed flattened against cliff looked none le for from shining snout to stumpy tail be lion half length of two tall men looked over shoulder huge mouth be open with exertion of holding up great carcase tongue lay out got footing came down slowly yard nearer bear said ugh lomi looking round with face white eudena with terror in eye be pointing down cliff ugh lomi mouth fell open for down below with big fore foot against rock stood big brown grey bulk bear be not so big a andoo be big enough for then suddenly ugh lomi gave cry catching up handful of litter of fern lay scattered on ledge thrust into pallid ash of fire brother fire cried brother fire eudena starting into activity did likewise brother fire help help brother fire brother fire be still red in heart turned to grey a scattered brother fire screamed whispered passed there be nothing ash then ugh lomi danced with anger struck ash with fist eudena began to hammer firestone against flint eye of be turning ever again towards gully by andoo be climbing down brother fire suddenly huge furry hind quarter of bear came into view beneath bulge of chalk have hidden be still clambering gingerly down nearly vertical surface head be yet out of sight must hear talking to pig monkey said cave bear ought to be good eudena struck spark blew at twinkled brighter then went out at cast down flint firestone stared blankly then sprang to foot scrambled yard so up cliff above ledge how hung on even for moment know for chalk be vertical without grip for monkey in couple of second have slid back to ledge again with bleeding hand ugh lomi be making frantic rush about ledge now must go to edge now to gully did not know what to do must not think bear looked smaller than mate much if rushed down on together one might live ugh said cave bear ugh lomi turned again saw little eye peering under bulge of chalk eudena cowering at end of ledge began to scream like gripped rabbit at sort of madness came upon ugh lomi with mighty cry caught up axe ran towards andoo monster gave grunt of surprise in moment ugh lomi be clinging to bush right underneath bear in be hanging to back half buried in fur with one fist clutched in hair under jaw bear be too astonished at fantastic attack to do more than cling passive then axe first of ax rang on skull bear head twisted from side to side began petulant scolding growl axe bit within inch of left eye hot blood blinded that side at that brute roared with surprise anger teeth gnashed six inch from ugh lomi face then axe clubbed close came down heavily on corner of jaw next blow blinded right side called forth roar time of pain eudena saw huge flat foot slipping sliding suddenly bear gave clumsy leap sideways a if for ledge then everything vanished hazel smashed roar of pain tumult of shout growl came up from far below eudena screamed ran to edge peered over for moment man bear be heap together ugh lomi uppermost then have sprung clear be scaling gully again with bear rolling striking at one among hazel have left axe below three knob ended streak of carmine be shooting down thigh up cried in moment eudena be leading way to top of cliff in minute be at crest heart pumping noisily with andoo wife far safe below andoo be sitting on haunch paw at work trying with quick exasperated movement to wipe blindness out of eye bear stood on four little way off ruffled in appearance growling angrily ugh lomi flung flat on grass lay panting bleeding with face on arm for second eudena regarded bear then came sat beside looking at presently put forth hand timidly touched made guttural sound be name turned over raised on arm face be pale like face of one who be afraid looked at steadfastly for moment then suddenly laughed waugh said exultantly waugh said simple expressive conversation then ugh lomi came knelt beside on hand knee peered over brow examined gorge breath be steady now blood on leg have ceased to flow though scratch bear have made be open wide squatted up sat staring at footmark of great bear a came to gully be a wide a head twice a long then jumped up went along cliff face until ledge be visible here sat down for time thinking while eudena watched presently saw bear have gone at last ugh lomi rose a one whose mind be made up returned towards gully eudena keeping close by together clambered to ledge took firestone flint then ugh lomi went down to foot of cliff very cautiously found axe returned to cliff a quietly a must set off at brisk walk ledge be home no longer with such caller in neighbourhood ugh lomi carried axe eudena firestone so simple be palaeolithic removal went up stream although might lead to very lair of cave bear because there be other way to go down stream be tribe have not ugh lomi killed uya wau by stream have to keep because of drinking so marched through beech tree with gorge deepening until river flowed frothing rapid five hundred foot below of changeful thing in world of change course of river in deep valley change least be river wey river know to day marched over very spot where nowadays stand little guildford godalming first human being to come into land once grey ape chattered vanished along cliff edge vast even ran spoor of great cave bear then spoor of bear fell away from cliff showing ugh lomi thought that came from place to left keeping to cliff edge presently came to end found looking down on great semi circular space caused by collapse of cliff have smashed right across gorge banking up stream water back in pool overflowed in rapid slip have happened long ago be grassed over face of cliff stood about semicircle be still almost fresh looking white a on day when rock must have broken slid down starkly exposed black under foot of cliff be mouth of several cave a stood there looking at space disinclined to skirt because thought bear lair lay somewhere on left in direction must need take saw suddenly first one bear then two coming up grass slope to right going across amphitheatre towards cave andoo be first dropped little on fore foot mien be despondent bear came shuffling behind eudena ugh lomi stepped back from cliff until must just see bear over verge then ugh lomi stopped eudena pulled arm turned with forbidding gesture hand dropped ugh lomi stood watching bear with axe in hand until have vanished into cave growled softly shook axe at bear receding quarter then to eudena terror instead of creeping off with lay flat down crawled forward into position that must just see cave be bear did a calmly a if have be rabbit be watching lay still like barked log sun dappled in shadow of tree be thinking eudena have learnt even when little girl that when ugh lomi became still like jaw bone on fist novel thing presently began to happen be hour before thinking be over be noon when two little savage have found way to cliff brow overhung bear cave long afternoon fought desperately with great boulder of chalk trundling with nothing unaided sturdy muscle from gully where have hung like loose tooth towards cliff top be full two yard about stood a high a eudena waist be obtuse angled toothed with flint when sun set be poised three inch from edge above cave of great cave bear in cave conversation languished during afternoon bear snoozed sulkily in corner for be fond of pig monkey andoo be busy licking side of paw smearing face to cool smart inflammation of wound afterwards went sat just within mouth of cave blinking out at afternoon sun with uninjured eye thinking never be so startled in life said at last be most extraordinary beast attacking like said bear out of darkness behind feebler sort of beast never saw ca think what world be coming to scraggy weedy leg wonder how keep warm in winter very likely said bear suppose be sort of monkey gone wrong be change said bear pause advantage have be merely accidental said andoo thing will happen at time ca understand why let go said bear that matter have be discussed before settled so andoo being bear of experience remained silent for space then resumed upon different aspect of matter have sort of claw long claw that seemed to have first on one paw then on other just one claw be very odd thing bright thing too seemed to have like glare come in sky in daytime only jump about be really worth seeing be thing with root too like grass when be windy doe bite asked bear if bite ca be plant know said be curious anyhow wonder if be good eating said bear look said andoo with appetite for cave bear like polar bear be incurable carnivore root honey for two bear fell into meditation for space then andoo resumed simple attention to eye sunlight up green slope before cave mouth grew warmer in tone warmer until be ruddy amber curious sort of thing day said cave bear lot too much of think quite unsuitable for hunting dazzle always ca smell nearly so well by day bear did not answer there came measured crunching sound out of darkness have turned up bone andoo yawned well said strolled to cave mouth stood with head projecting surveying amphitheatre found have to turn head completely round to see object on right hand side doubt that eye must be all right to morrow yawned again there be tap overhead big mass of chalk flew out from cliff face dropped yard in front of nose starred into dozen unequal fragment startled extremely when have recovered little from shock went sniffed curiously at representative piece of fallen projectile have distinctive flavour oddly reminiscent of two drab animal of ledge sat up pawed larger lump walked round several time trying to find man about somewhere when night have come went off down river gorge to see if must cut off of ledge occupant ledge be empty there be sign of red thing a be rather hungry did not loiter long that night pushed on to pick up red deer fawn forgot about drab animal found fawn doe be close by made ugly fight for young andoo have to leave fawn a blood be up stuck to attack at last got in blow of paw on nose so got hold of more meat le delicacy bear following have share next afternoon curiously enough very fellow of first white rock fell smashed precisely according to precedent aim of third fell night after however be better hit andoo unspeculative skull with crack echoed up cliff white fragment went dancing to point of compass bear coming after sniffing curiously at found lying in odd sort of attitude with head wet out of shape be young bear inexperienced having sniffed about for time licked little so forth decided to leave until odd mood have passed went on hunting alone looked up fawn of red doe have killed two night ago found be lonely hunting without andoo returned caveward before dawn sky be grey overcast tree up gorge be black unfamiliar into ursine mind came dim sense of strange dreary happening lifted up voice called andoo by name side of gorge re echoed a approached cave saw in half light heard couple of jackal scuttle off immediately after hyaena howled dozen clumsy bulk went lumbering up slope stopped yelled derision lord of rock cave ya have came down wind dismal feeling in bear mind became suddenly acute shuffled across amphitheatre ya have said hyaena retreating have cave bear be not lying quite in same attitude because hyaena have be busy in one place rib showed white dotted over turf about lay smashed fragment of three great lump of chalk air be full of scent of death bear stopped dead even now that great wonderful andoo be killed be beyond believing then heard far overhead sound queer sound little like shout of hyaena fuller lower in pitch looked up little dawn blinded eye seeing little nostril quivering there on cliff edge far above against bright pink of dawn be two little shaggy round dark thing head of eudena ugh lomi a shouted derision at though must not see very distinctly must hear dimly began to apprehend novel feeling a of imminent strange evil came into heart began to examine smashed fragment of chalk that lay about andoo for space stood still looking about making low continuous sound be almost moan then went back incredulously to andoo to make one last effort to rouse iii first horseman in day before ugh lomi there be little trouble between horse men lived apart men in river swamp thicket horse on wide grassy upland between chestnut pine sometimes pony must come straying into clogging marsh to make flint hacked meal sometimes tribe must find one kill of lion drive off jackal feast heartily while sun be high horse of old time be clumsy at fetlock dun coloured with rough tail big head came spring time north westward into country after swallow before hippopotamus a grass on wide downland stretch grew long came only in small body thus far herd stallion two three mare foal so having own stretch of country went again when chestnut tree be yellow wolf came down wealden mountain be custom to graze right out in open going into cover only in heat of day avoided long stretch of thorn beechwood preferring isolated group of tree void of ambuscade so that be hard to come upon be never fighter heel teeth be for one in clear country once be started no living thing came near though perhaps elephant might have done so have felt need in day man seemed harmless thing enough whisper of prophetic intelligence told specie of terrible slavery be to come of whip spur bearing rein clumsy load slippery street insufficient food knacker yard be to replace wide grass land freedom of earth down in wey marsh ugh lomi eudena have never seen horse closely now saw day a two of raided out from lair on ledge in gorge raiding together in search of food have returned to ledge after killing of andoo for of bear be not afraid bear have become afraid of when winded went aside two went together everywhere for since have left tribe eudena be not so much ugh lomi woman a mate learnt to hunt even a much be a woman must be indeed marvellous woman must lie for hour watching beast planning catch in shock head of must stay beside with bright eye upon offering irritating suggestion a still a man wonderful woman at top of cliff be open grassy lawn then beechwood going through beechwood one came to edge of rolling grassy expanse in sight of horse here on edge of wood bracken be rabbit burrow here among frond eudena ugh lomi must lie with throwing stone ready until little people came out to nibble play in sunset while eudena must sit silent figure of watchfulness regarding burrow ugh lomi eye be ever away across greensward at wonderful grazing stranger in dim way appreciated grace supple nimbleness a sun declined in evening time heat of day passed must become active must start chasing one neighing dodging shaking mane coming round in great curve sometimes so close that pounding of turf sounded like hurried thunder looked so fine that ugh lomi wanted to join in badly sometimes one must roll over on turf kicking four hoof heavenward seemed formidable be certainly much le alluring dim imaginings ran through ugh lomi mind a watched by virtue of two rabbit lived longer sleeping brain be clearer bolder for be way in day came near horse dreamt fought smiting stone against hoof then horse changed to men at least to men with horse head awoke in cold sweat of terror yet next day in morning a horse be grazing one of mare whinnied saw ugh lomi coming up wind stopped eating watched ugh lomi be not coming towards strolling obliquely across open looking at anything in world horse have stuck three fern frond into mat of hair giving remarkable appearance walked very slowly what be up now said master horse who be capable inexperienced look more like first half of animal than anything else in world said fore leg hind be only one of pink monkey thing said eldest mare be sort of river monkey be quite common on plain ugh lomi continued oblique advance eldest mare be struck with want of motive in proceeding fool said eldest mare in quick conclusive way have resumed grazing master horse second mare followed suit look be nearer said foal with stripe one of younger foal made uneasy movement ugh lomi squatted down sat regarding horse fixedly in little while be satisfied that meant flight hostility began to consider next procedure did not feel anxious to kill have axe with spirit of sport be upon how must one kill one of creature great beautiful creature eudena watching with fearful admiration from cover of bracken saw presently go on four so proceed again horse preferred biped to quadruped master horse threw up head gave word to move ugh lomi thought be off for good after minute gallop came round in wide curve stood winding then a rise in ground hid tailed out master horse leading approached spirally be a ignorant of possibility of horse a be of at stage must seem funked knew kind of stalking must make red deer buffalo charge if be persisted in at rate eudena saw jump up come walking towards with fern plume held in hand stood up grinned to show that whole thing be immense lark that what have done be just what have planned to do from very beginning so incident ended be very thoughtful day next day foolish drab creature with leonine mane instead of going about grazing hunting be made for be prowling round horse again eldest mare be for silent contempt suppose want to learn something from said let next day be at again master horse decided meant absolutely nothing a matter of fact ugh lomi first of men to feel that curious spell of horse bind even to day meant great deal admired unreservedly there be rudiment of snob in be afraid wanted to be near beautifully curved animal then there be vague conception of kill if only must let come near drew line found at fifty yard if came nearer than that moved off with dignity suppose be way have blinded andoo made think of leaping on back of one of though eudena after time came out in open too did unobtrusive stalking thing stopped there then one memorable day new idea came to ugh horse look down level doe not look up animal look up have too much common sense be only that fantastic creature man must waste wit skyward ugh lomi made philosophical deduction perceived thing be so so spent weary day in beech stood in open while eudena stalked usually horse went into shade in heat of afternoon day sky be overcast must not in spite of eudena solicitude be two day after ugh lomi have desire day be blazing hot multiplying fly asserted horse stopped grazing before midday came into shadow below stood in couple nose to tail flapping master horse by virtue of heel came closest to tree suddenly there be rustle creak thud then sharp chipped flint bit on cheek master horse stumbled came on one knee rose to foot be off like wind air be full of whirl of limb prance of hoof snort of alarm ugh lomi be pitched foot in air came down again up again stomach be hit violently then knee got grip of something between found clutching with knee foot hand careering violently with extraordinary oscillation through air axe gone heaven know whither hold tight said mother instinct did be aware of lot of coarse hair in face of between teeth of green turf streaming past in front of eye saw shoulder of master horse vast sleek with muscle flowing swiftly under skin perceived that arm be round neck that violent jerking experienced have sort of rhythm then be in midst of wild rush of tree stem then there be frond of bracken about then more open turf then stream of pebble rushing past little pebble flying sideways athwart stream from blow of swift hoof ugh lomi began to feel frightfully sick giddy be not stuff to leave go simply because be uncomfortable dared not leave grip tried to make more comfortable released hug on neck gripping mane instead slipped knee forward pushing back came into sitting position where quarter broaden be nervous work managed at last be fairly seated astride breathless indeed uncertain with frightful pounding of body at rate relieved slowly fragment of ugh lomi mind got into order again pace seemed to terrific kind of exultation be beginning to oust first frantic terror air rushed by sweet wonderful rhythm of hoof changed broke up returned into again be on turf now wide glade beech tree hundred yard away on side succulent band of green starred with pink blossom shot with silver water here there meandered down middle far off be glimpse of blue valley far away exultation grew be man first taste of pace then came wide space dappled with flying fallow deer scattering way then couple of jackal mistaking ugh lomi for lion came hurrying after when saw be not lion still came on out of curiosity on galloped horse with one idea of escape after jackal with pricked ear quickly barked remark kill said first jackal be horse being killed said second gave howl of following horse answered to a horse answer nowadays to spur on rushed little tornado through quiet day putting up startled bird sending dozen unexpected thing darting to cover raising myriad of indignant dung fly smashing little blossom flowering complacently back into parental turf tree again then splash splash across torrent then hare shot out of tuft of grass under very hoof of master horse jackal left incontinently so presently broke into open again wide expanse of turfy hillside very grassy down fall northward nowadays from epsom stand first hot bolt of master horse be long since over be falling into measured trot ugh lomi albeit bruised exceedingly quite uncertain of future be in state of glorious enjoyment now came new development pace broke again master horse came round on short curve stopped dead ugh lomi became alert wished have flint throwing flint have carried in thong about waist be like axe heaven know where master horse turned head ugh lomi became aware of eye teeth whipped leg into position of security hit at cheek with fist then head went down somewhere out of existence apparently back be sitting on flew up into dome ugh lomi became thing of instinct again strictly prehensile held by knee foot head seemed sliding towards turf finger be twisted into shock of mane rough hair of horse saved gradient be on lowered again then whup said ugh lomi astonished slant be other way up ugh lomi be thousand generation nearer primordial than man monkey must have held on better lion have be training horse for countless generation against tactic of rolling rearing back kicked like master buck jumped rather neatly in five minute ugh lomi lived lifetime if came off horse must kill felt assured then master horse decided to stick to old tactic again suddenly went off at gallop headed down slope taking steep place at rush swerving to right to left a rode down wide expanse of valley sank out of sight behind approaching skirmisher of oak hawthorn skirted sudden hollow with pool of spring rank weed silver bush ground grew softer grass taller on right hand side left came scattered bush of may still splashed with belated blossom presently bush thickened until lashed passing rider little flash gout of blood came out on horse man then way opened again then came wonderful adventure sudden squeal of unreasonable anger rose bush squeal of creature bitterly wronged crashing after appeared big grey blue shape be yaaa big horned rhinoceros in one of fit of fury of charging full tilt after manner of kind have be startled at feeding someone did not matter who be to be ripped trampled therefore be bearing down on from left with wicked little eye red great horn down tail like jury mast behind for minute ugh lomi be minded to slip off dodge then behold staccato of hoof grew swifter rhinoceros stumpy hurrying little leg seemed to slide out at back corner of ugh lomi eye in two minute be through bush of may out in open going fast for space must hear ponderous pace in pursuit receding behind then be just a if yaaa have not lost temper a if yaaa have never existed pace never faltered on rode on ugh lomi be now exultation to exult in day be to insult have big nose said trying to crane back see remote speck of pursuer why carry smiting stone in fist ended with frantic whoop that whoop be unfortunate for coming close to ear of horse being quite unexpected startled stallion extremely shied violently ugh lomi suddenly found uncomfortable again be hanging on to horse found by one arm one knee rest of ride be honourable unpleasant view be chiefly of blue sky be combined with most unpleasant physical sensation finally bush of thorn lashed let go hit ground with cheek shoulder then after complicated extraordinarily rapid movement hit again with end of backbone saw splash spark of light colour ground seemed bouncing about just like horse have done then found be sitting on turf six yard beyond bush in front of be space of grass growing greener greener number of human being in distance horse be going round at smart gallop quite long way off to right human being be on opposite side of river still in water be running away a hard a must go advent of monster took to piece be not sort of novelty cared for for minute ugh lomi sat regarding in purely spectacular spirit bend of river knoll among reed royal fern thin stream of smoke going up to heaven be perfectly familiar to be squatting place of son of uya of uya from whom have fled with eudena whom have waylaid in chestnut wood killed with first axe rose to foot still dazed from fall a did so scattering fugitive turned regarded pointed to receding horse chattered walked slowly towards staring forgot horse forgot own bruise in growing interest of encounter there be fewer of than there have be supposed others must have hid heap of fern for night fire be not so high by flint heap must have sat wau then remembered have killed wau suddenly brought back to familiar scene gorge bear eudena seemed thing remote thing dreamt of stopped at bank stood regarding tribe mathematical ability be of slightest be certain there be fewer men might be away there be fewer woman child gave shout of home coming quarrel have be with uya wau not with others child of uya cried answered with name little fearfully because of strange way have come for space spoke together then old woman lifted shrill voice answered lord be lion ugh lomi did not understand that saying answered again several together uya come again come a lion lord be lion come at night slays whom will none other may slay ugh lomi none other may slay still ugh lomi did not understand lord be lion speaks more to men ugh lomi stood regarding have have dream knew that though have killed uya uya still existed now told uya be lion shrivelled old woman mistress of fire minder suddenly turned spoke softly to next to be very old woman indeed have be first of uya wife have let live beyond age to be seemly woman must be permitted to live have be cunning from first cunning to please uya to get food now be great in counsel spoke softly ugh lomi watched shrivelled form across river with curious distaste then called aloud come over to ugh lomi girl suddenly lifted up voice come over to ugh lomi said began cry come over to ugh lomi be strange how manner changed after old woman called stood quite still watching be pleasant to be called girl who have called first be pretty one made think of eudena come over to ugh lomi cried voice of shrivelled old woman rose above at sound of voice hesitation returned stood on river bank ugh lomi ugh thinker with thought slowly taking shape presently one then paused to see what must do be minded to go back be minded not to suddenly fear caution got upper hand without answering turned walked back towards distant thorn tree way have come forthwith whole tribe started cry to again very eagerly hesitated turned then went on then turned again then once again regarding with troubled eye a called last time took two pace back before fear stopped saw stop once more suddenly shake head vanish among hawthorn tree then woman child lifted up voice together called to in one last vain effort far down river reed be stirring in breeze where convenient for new sort of feeding old lion who have taken to man eating have made lair old woman turned face way pointed to hawthorn thicket uya screamed there go thine enemy there go thine enemy uya why do devour nightly have tried to snare there go thine enemy uya lion who preyed upon tribe be taking siesta cry went unheard that day have dined on one of plumper girl mood be comfortable placidity really did not understand that be uya that ugh lomi be enemy so be that ugh lomi rode horse heard first of uya lion who have taken place of uya master be eating up tribe a hurried back to gorge mind be no longer full of horse of thought that uya be still alive to slay be slain over over again saw shrunken band of woman child cry that uya be lion uya be lion presently fearing twilight might come upon ugh lomi began running iv uya lion old lion be in luck tribe have certain pride in ruler be satisfaction got out of came very night that ugh lomi killed uya cunning so be named uya be old woman fire minder who first named uya shower have lowered fire to glow made night dark a conversed together peered at one in darkness wondered fearfully what uya must do to in dream now that be dead heard mounting reverberation of lion roar close at hand then everything be still held breath so almost only sound be patter of rain hiss of raindrop in ash then after interminable time crash shriek of fear growling sprang to foot shouting screaming running way that brand must not burn in minute victim be being dragged away through fern be irk brother of wau so lion came fern be still wet from rain next night came took click with red hair sufficed for two night then in dark between moon came three night night after night that though have good fire be old lion with stumpy teeth very silent very cool knew of fire before be not first of mankind have ministered to old age third night came between outer fire inner leapt flint heap pulled down irm son of irk who have seemed like to be leader be dreadful night because lit great flare of fern ran screaming lion missed hold of irm by glare of fire saw irm struggle up run little way towards then lion in two bound have down again be last of irm so fear came delight of spring passed out of life already there be five gone out of tribe four night added three more to number food seeking became spiritless none knew who might go next day woman toiled even favourite woman gathering litter stick for night fire hunter hunted ill in warm spring time hunger came again a though be still winter tribe might have moved have have leader have leader none knew where to go that lion must not follow so old lion waxed fat thanked heaven for kindly race of men two of child youth died while moon be still new then be shrivelled old fire minder first bethought in dream of eudena ugh lomi of way uya have be slain have lived in fear of uya day now lived in fear of lion that ugh lomi must kill uya for good ugh lomi whom have seen born be impossible be uya still seeking enemy then came strange return of ugh lomi wonderful animal seen galloping far across river that suddenly changed into two animal horse man following portent vision of ugh lomi on farther bank of river yes be plain to uya be punishing because have not hunted down ugh lomi eudena men came straggling back to chance of night while sun be still golden in sky be received with story of ugh lomi went across river with showed spoor hesitating on farther bank sis tracker knew foot for ugh lomi uya need ugh lomi cried old woman standing on left of bend gesticulating figure of flaring bronze in sunset cry be strange sound flitting to fro on borderland of speech be sense carried lion need come night after night seeking eudena ugh lomi when can not find eudena ugh lomi grows angry kill hunt eudena ugh lomi eudena whom pursued ugh lomi for whom gave death word hunt eudena ugh lomi turned to distant reed bed a sometimes have turned to uya in life be not so lord cried a if in answer tall reed bowed before breath of wind far into twilight sound of hacking be heard from squatting place be men sharpening ashen spear against hunting of morrow in night early before moon rose lion came took girl of sis tracker in morning before sun have risen tracker lad wau hau who now chipped flint one eye bo snail eater two red haired men cat skin snake men be left alive of son of uya taking ash spear smiting stone with throwing stone in beast paw bag started forth upon trail of ugh lomi through hawthorn thicket where rhinoceros brother be feeding up bare downland towards beechwood night fire burnt high fierce a waxing moon set lion left crouching woman child in peace next day while sun be still high hunter returned save one eye who lay dead with smashed skull at foot of ledge when ugh lomi came back that evening from stalking horse found vulture already busy over with hunter brought eudena bruised wounded alive have be strange order of shrivelled old woman that be to be brought alive be kill for be for uya lion hand be tied with thong a though have be man came weary drooping hair over eye matted with blood walked about ever again snail eater whose name have given must laugh strike with ashen spear after have struck with spear must look over shoulder like one who have done over bold deed others too looked over shoulder ever again be in hurry save eudena when old woman saw coming cried aloud with joy made eudena cross river with hand tied although current be strong when slipped old woman screamed first with joy then for fear might be drowned when have dragged eudena to shore must not stand for time albeit beat sore so let sit with foot touching water eye staring before face set might do say tribe came down to squatting place even curly little haha who a yet must scarcely toddle stood staring at eudena old woman a now must stare at strange wounded beast captor old woman tore off necklace of uya be about eudena neck put on have be first to wear then tore at eudena hair took spear from sis beat with might when have vented warmth of heart on girl looked closely into face eudena eye be closed feature be set lay so still that for moment old woman feared be dead then nostril quivered at that old woman slapped face laughed gave spear to sis again went little way off from began to talk jeer at after manner old woman have more word than in tribe talk be terrible thing to hear sometimes screamed moaned incoherently sometimes shape of guttural cry be mere phantom of thought conveyed to eudena nevertheless much of thing be yet to come of lion of torment must do ugh lomi have have ugh lomi be slain suddenly eudena eye opened sat up again look met old woman fair level said slowly like one trying to remember did not see ugh lomi slain did not see ugh lomi slain tell cried old woman tell killed tell how ugh lomi be slain looked woman child there looked from man to man none answered stood shame faced tell said old woman men looked at one eudena face suddenly lit tell said tell mighty men tell killing of ugh lomi old woman rose struck sharply across mouth must not find ugh lomi said tracker slowly who hunt two kill none then eudena heart leapt kept face hard be a well for old woman looked at sharply with murder in eye then old woman turned tongue upon men because have feared to go on after ugh lomi dreaded one now uya be slain scolded a one scold child scowled at began to accuse one until suddenly sis tracker raised voice bade hold peace so when sun be setting took eudena went though heart sank within along trail old lion have made in reed men went together at one place be group of alder here hastily bound where lion might find when came abroad in twilight having done so hurried back until be near squatting place then stopped sis stopped first looked back again at alder must see head even from squatting place little black shock under limb of larger tree be a well woman child stood watching upon crest of mound old woman stood screamed for lion to take whom sought counselled on torment might do eudena be very weary now stunned by beating fatigue sorrow only fear of thing be still to come upheld sun be broad blood red between stem of distant chestnut west be on fire evening breeze have died to warm tranquillity air be full of midge swarm fish in river hard by must leap at time now again cockchafer must drone through air out of corner of eye eudena must see part of squatting knoll little figure standing staring at very little sound very clear must hear beating of firestone dark near to still be reed fringed thicket of lair presently firestone ceased looked for sun found have gone overhead growing brighter be waxing moon looked towards thicket of lair seeking shape in reed then suddenly began to wriggle wriggle weeping calling upon ugh lomi ugh lomi be far away when saw head moving with struggle shouted together on knoll desisted be still then came bat star be like ugh lomi crept out of blue hiding place in west called to softly because feared lion through coming of twilight thicket be still so dark crept upon eudena moon grew bright shadow of thing have fled up hillside vanished with evening came back to short black dark shape in thicket of reed alder where lion lay gathered faint stir began there nothing came out therefrom through gathering of darkness looked at squatting place saw fire glowing smoky red men woman going to fro other way over river white mist be rising then far away came whimpering of young fox yell of hyaena there be long gap of aching waiting after long time animal splashed in water seemed to cross river at ford beyond lair what animal be must not see from distant drinking pool must hear sound of splashing noise of elephant so still be night earth be now colourless arrangement of white reflection impenetrable shadow under blue sky silvery moon be already spotted with filigree crest of chestnut wood over shadowy eastward hill star be multiplying knoll fire be bright red now black figure stood waiting against be waiting for scream surely must be soon night suddenly seemed full of movement held breath thing be passing one two three subtly sneaking shadow jackal then long waiting again then asserting a real at once over sound mind have imagined came stir in thicket then vigorous movement there be snap reed crashed heavily once twice thrice then everything be still save measured swishing heard low tremulous growl then everything be still again stillness lengthened must never end held breath bit lip to stop screaming then something scuttled through undergrowth scream be involuntary did not hear answering yell from mound immediately thicket woke up to vigorous movement again saw grass stem waving in light of setting moon alder swaying struggled violently last struggle nothing came towards dozen monster seemed rushing about in little place for couple of minute then again came silence moon sank behind distant chestnut night be dark then odd sound sobbing panting grew faster fainter yet silence then dim sound grunting of animal everything be still again far away eastward elephant trumpeted from wood came snarling yelping died away in long interval moon shone out again between stem of tree on ridge sending two great bar of light bar of darkness across reedy waste then came steady rustling splash reed swayed wider wider apart at last broke open cleft from root to crest end have come looked to see thing have come out of reed for moment seemed certainly great head jaw expected then dwindled changed be dark low thing remained silent be not lion became still everything became still peered be like gigantic frog two limb slanting body head moved about searching shadow rustle moved clumsily with sort of hopping a moved gave low groan blood rushing through vein be suddenly joy ugh lomi whispered thing stopped answered softly with pain in voice peering into alder moved again came out of shadow beyond reed into moonlight body be covered with dark smear saw be dragging leg that gripped axe first axe in one hand in moment have struggled into position of four have staggered over to lion said in strange mingling of exultation anguish wau have slain lion with own hand even a slew great bear moved to emphasise word suddenly broke off with faint cry for space did not move let free whispered eudena answered word pulled up from crawling attitude by mean of alder stem hacked at thong with sharp edge of axe heard sob at blow cut away thong about chest arm then hand dropped chest struck against shoulder slipped down beside lay still rest of release be easy very hastily freed made one step from tree head be spinning last conscious movement be towards reeled dropped hand fell upon thigh be soft wet gave way under pressure cried out at touch writhed lay still again presently dark dog like shape came very softly through reed then stopped dead stood sniffing hesitated at last turned slunk back into shadow long be time remained there motionless with light of setting moon shining on limb very slowly a slowly a setting of moon did shadow of reed towards mound flow over presently leg be hidden ugh lomi be bust of silver shadow crept to neck crept over face so at last darkness of night swallowed up shadow became full of instinctive stirring there be patter of foot faint snarling sound of blow there be little sleep night for woman child at squatting place until heard eudena scream men be weary sat dozing when eudena screamed felt assured of safety hurried to get nearest place to fire old woman laughed at scream laughed again because si little friend of eudena whimpered directly dawn came be alert looking towards alder must see that eudena have be taken must not help feeling glad to think that uya be appeased across mind of men thought of ugh lomi fell like shadow must understand revenge for world be old in revenge did not think of rescue suddenly hyaena fled out of thicket came galloping across reed space muzzle paw be dark stained at sight men shouted clutched at throwing stone ran

fashioned nonsense phonograph be good enough for of course said hypnotist of course surveyed table for next choice know said helping to dark blue confection promised well in day business be scarcely thought of daresay if one have told that in two hundred year time class of men must be entirely occupied in impressing thing upon memory effacing unpleasant idea controlling overcoming instinctive undesirable impulse so forth by mean of hypnotism must have refused to believe thing possible few people knew that order made during mesmeric trance even order to forget order to desire must be given

of city in evening came to deserted village with house that seemed so small odd to found golden in glory of sunset desolate still went from one deserted house to marvelling at quaint simplicity debating must choose at last in sunlit corner of room have lost outer wall came upon wild flower little flower of blue that weeder of food company have overlooked that house decided upon did not remain in long that night because be resolved to feast upon nature moreover house became very gaunt shadowy after sunlight have faded out of sky so after have rested little time went to crest of hill again to see with own eye silence of heaven set with star about old poet have have so many thing to tell be wonderful sight denton talked like star when went down hill at last sky be pale with dawn slept little in morning when woke thrush be singing in tree so young people of twenty second century began exile that morning be very busy exploring resource of new home in be going to live simple life did not explore very fast very far because went everywhere hand in hand found beginning of furniture beyond village be store of winter fodder for sheep of food company denton dragged great armful to house to make bed in several of house be old fungus eaten chair table rough barbaric clumsy furniture seemed to made of wood repeated many of thing have said on previous day towards evening found

fashion lived week for week day be cloudless night night of starry glory be invaded little more by crescent moon yet something of first splendour of coming faded faded imperceptibly day after day denton eloquence became fitful lacked fresh topic of inspiration fatigue of long march from london told in certain stiffness of limb suffered from slight unaccountable cold moreover denton became aware of unoccupied time in one place among carelessly heaped lumber of old time found rust eaten spade with made fitful attack on razed grass grown garden though have nothing to plant sow returned to elizabeth with sweat streaming face after hour of such work there be giant in day said not understanding what wont training will do walk that day led along hill until must see city shimmering far away in valley wonder how thing be going on there said then came change in weather come out see cloud cried behold be sombre purple in north east streaming up to ragged edge at zenith a went up hill hurrying streamer blotted out sunset suddenly wind set beech tree swaying whispering elizabeth shivered then far away lightning flashed flashed like sword be drawn suddenly distant thunder marched about sky even a stood astonished pattering upon came first headlong raindrop of storm in instant last streak of sunset be hidden by falling curtain of hail lightning flashed again voice of thunder roared louder about world scowled dark strange seizing hand child of city ran down hill to home in infinite astonishment ere reached elizabeth be weeping with dismay darkling ground about be white brittle active with pelting hail then began strange terrible night for for first time in civilised life be in absolute darkness be wet cold shivering about hissed hail through long neglected ceiling of derelict home came noisy spout of water formed pool rivulet on creaking floor a gust of storm struck worn out building groaned shuddered now mass of plaster from wall must slide smash now loosened tile must rattle down roof crash into empty greenhouse below elizabeth shuddered be still denton wrapped gay flimsy city cloak about so crouched in darkness ever thunder broke louder nearer ever more lurid flashed lightning jerking into momentary gaunt clearness steaming dripping room in sheltered never before have be in open air save when sun be shining time have be spent in warm airy way hall room of latter day city be to night a if be in other world disordered chaos of stress tumult almost beyond hoping that must ever see city way again storm seemed to last interminably until at last dozed between thunderclap then very swiftly fell ceased a last patter of rain died away heard unfamiliar sound what be cried elizabeth came again be barking of dog drove down desert lane passed through window whitening wall before throwing upon shadow of window frame of tree in black silhouette shone light of waxing moon just a pale dawn be drawing thing about into sight fitful barking of dog came near again stopped listened after pause heard quick pattering of foot seeking round house short half smothered bark then again everything be still ssh whispered elizabeth pointed to door of room denton went half way towards door stood listening came back with face of affected unconcern must be sheep dog of food company said will do harm sat down again beside what night have be said to hide how keenly be listening like dog answered elizabeth after long silence dog never hurt one said denton in old day in nineteenth century everybody have dog there be romance heard once dog killed man not sort of dog said denton confidently of romance be exaggerated suddenly half bark pattering up staircase sound of panting denton sprang to foot drew sword out of damp straw upon have be lying then in doorway appeared gaunt sheep dog halted there behind stared for instant man brute faced other hesitating then denton being ignorant of dog made sharp step forward go away said with clumsy motion of sword dog started growled denton stopped sharply good dog said growling jerked into bark good dog said second dog growled barked third out of sight down staircase took up barking also outside others gave tongue large number seemed to denton be annoying said denton without taking eye off brute before of course shepherd wo come out of city for hour yet naturally dog quite make out ca hear shouted elizabeth stood up came to denton tried again barking still drowned voice sound have curious effect upon blood odd disused emotion began to stir face changed a shouted tried again barking seemed to mock one dog danced pace forward bristling suddenly turned uttering certain word in dialect of underways word incomprehensible to elizabeth made for dog there be sudden cessation of barking growl snapping elizabeth saw snarling head of foremost dog white teeth retracted ear flash of thrust blade brute leapt into air be flung back then denton with shout be driving dog before sword flashed above head with sudden new freedom of gesture then vanished down staircase made six step to follow on landing there be blood stopped hearing tumult of dog denton shout pas out of house ran to window nine wolfish sheep dog be scattering one writhed before porch denton tasting strange delight of combat that slumber still in blood of even most civilised man be shouting running across garden space then saw something that for moment did not see dog circled round way came again have in open in instant divined situation must have called to for moment felt sick helpless then obeying strange impulse gathered up white skirt ran downstairs in hall be rusting spade be seized ran out came none too soon one dog rolled before well nigh slashed in half second have by thigh third gripped collar behind fourth have blade of sword between teeth tasting own blood parried leap of fifth with left arm might have be first century instead of twenty second so far a be concerned gentleness of eighteen year of city life vanished before primordial need spade smote hard sure cleft dog skull crouching for spring yelped with dismay at unexpected antagonist rushed aside two wasted precious moment on binding of feminine skirt collar of denton cloak tore parted a staggered back that dog too felt spade ceased to trouble sheathed sword in brute at thigh to wall cried elizabeth in three second fight be at end young people stood side by side while remnant of five dog with ear tail of disaster fled shamefully from stricken field for moment stood panting victorious then elizabeth dropping spade covered face sank to ground in paroxysm of weeping denton looked about thrust point of sword into ground so that be at hand stooped to comfort at last more tumultuous emotion subsided must talk again leant upon wall sat upon so that must keep eye open for returning dog two at rate be up on hillside keeping up vexatious barking be tear stained not very wretched now because for hour have be repeating that be brave have saved life new fear be growing in mind be dog of food company said there will be trouble be afraid so very likely will prosecute for trespass pause in old time said sort of thing happened day after day last night said must not live through such night looked at face be pale for want of sleep drawn haggard came to sudden resolution must go back said looked at dead dog shivered can not stay here said must go back repeated glancing over shoulder to see if enemy kept distance have be happy for time world be too civilised ours be age of city more of will kill what be to do how can live

be bright why did not tell before asked time have be here looked at for moment smiled then smile vanished thought ought to come from said did like to ask for money besides at first thought must be rather fine there be pause have be fine said glanced once more over shoulder until began yes said first day first three day looked for space into one face then denton slid down from wall took hand to generation said life of time see plainly now in city be life to be born to live in other fashion coming here be dream be awakening be pleasant dream said in beginning for long space neither spoke if must reach city before shepherd come here must start said denton must get food out of house eat a go denton glanced about again giving dead dog wide berth walked across garden space into house together found wallet with food descended blood stained stair again in hall elizabeth stopped one minute said there be something here led way into room in one little blue flower be blooming stooped to

stared at without sympathy for second be reflecting how excellent be that there be more bindons to carry on line of pathos felt quite optimistic then turned to telephone ordered up prescription from central pharmacy be interrupted by voice behind by god cried bindon will have yet physician stared over shoulder at bindon expression then altered prescription so soon a painful interview be over bindon gave way to rage settled that medical man be not only unsympathetic brute wanting in first beginning of gentleman also highly incompetent went off to four other practitioner in succession with view to establishment of intuition to guard against surprise kept that little prescription in pocket with began by expressing grave doubt of first doctor intelligence honesty professional knowledge then stated symptom suppressing only few more material fact in case be always subsequently elicited by doctor in spite of welcome depreciation of practitioner none of eminent specialist must give bindon hope of eluding anguish helplessness that loomed now close upon to last of unburthened mind of accumulated disgust with medical science after century century exclaimed hotly can hing except admit helplessness say beave ' what do do doubt be hard on said doctor must have taken precaution how be to know be place to run after said medical man picking thread of cotton from purple sleeve why

subtle able important voluptuous cynical complex bindon possibly howling not one faithful simple creature in world to howl in sympathy not one faithful simple soul be there shepherd to pipe to have such faithful simple creature vanished from harsh urgent earth wondered whether horrid vulgar crowd perpetually went about city must possibly know what thought of if did felt sure must try to earn better opinion surely world went from bad to worse be becoming impossible for bindons perhaps day be quite sure that one thing have needed in life be sympathy for time regretted that left sonnet

expression of feeling now after that be easier to explain what came about said mr fotheringay proceeded to lengthy involved narrative of strange experience beginning with affair of lamp in long dragon complicated by persistent allusion to winch a went on transient pride mr maydig consternation have caused passed away became very ordinary mr fotheringay of everyday intercourse again mr maydig listened intently tobacco jar in hand bearing changed also with course of narrative presently while mr fotheringay be dealing with miracle of third egg minister interrupted with fluttering extended

overawed scared began to jerk limb about interject astonishment be what troubled most proceeded mr fotheringay be be most mijitly in want of advice for of course be at san francisco wherever san francisco may be of course be awkward for of a will see mr maydig see how can understand what have happened daresay be scared exasperated something tremendous trying to get at daresay keep on starting off to come here send back by miracle few hour when think of of course be thing wo be able to understand be bound to annoy of course if take ticket time will cost lot of money done best must for of course be difficult for to put in place thought afterwards that clothes might have got scorched know if hades be be supposed to be before shifted in case suppose 'd have locked up in san francisco of course willed new suit of clothes on directly thought of see be already in deuce of tangle mr maydig looked serious see be in tangle yes be difficult position how be to end became diffuse inconclusive however will leave winch for little discus larger question think be case of black art anything of sort think there be taint of criminality about at mr fotheringay none unless be suppressing material fact be miracle pure miracle miracle if may say so of very highest class began to pace hearthrug gesticulate while mr fotheringay sat with arm on table head on arm looking worried see how be to manage about winch said gift of working miracle apparently very powerful gift said mr maydig will find way about winch never fear dear sir be most important man man of most astonishing possibility a evidence for example in other way thing may do yes have thought of thing two said mr fotheringay of thing came bit twisty saw that fish at first wrong sort of bowl wrong sort of fish thought 'd ask someone

so incredible a may seem in study of little house behind congregational chapel on evening of sunday nov mr fotheringay egged on inspired by mr maydig began to work miracle reader attention be specially definitely called to date will object probably have already objected that certain point in story be improbable that if thing of sort already described have indeed occurred must have be in paper year ago detail immediately following will find particularly hard to accept because among other thing involve conclusion that reader in question must have be killed in violent unprecedented manner more than year ago now miracle be nothing if not improbable a matter of fact reader be killed in violent unprecedented manner year ago in subsequent course of story will become perfectly clear credible a right minded reasonable reader will admit be not place for end of story being little beyond hither side of middle at first miracle worked by mr fotheringay be timid little miracle little thing with cup parlour fitment a feeble a miracle of theosophist feeble a be be received with awe by collaborator must have preferred to settle winch business out of hand mr maydig must not let after
