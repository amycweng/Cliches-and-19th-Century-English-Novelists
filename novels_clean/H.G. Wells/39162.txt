careless of date thing came upon with effect of abrupt surprise just a petal be expanding so hopefully finis thing be at end kipps did not fully appreciate that end be indeed really truly end until be back in emporium after end be over end began practically in middle of last class when freckled girl broached topic of termination developed question of just how be going on after class ended hoped must stick to certain resolution of self improvement have breathed said quite honestly that owed to to develop possibility expressed firm resolve dwelt on difficulty have book instructed how to get

for anything of sort explained that be going to north wale for summer information received without immediate regret at interval expressed intention of going on with wood carving when summer be over once added if considered extremely delicate not to press for completion of if after talk there be interval of languid wood carving watching miss walshingham then presently there came bustle of packing great ceremony of hand shaking round by miss collis maiden lady of ripe year then kipps found outside class room on landing with two friend seemed to have only just learnt that be last class of there came little pause freckled girl suddenly went back into class room left kipps miss walshingham alone together for first time kipps be instantly breathless looked at face with glance mingled sympathy

irresistibly suggestive of ownership suggestion of broadly gesticulating shadow be born squatting on foot grew took possession of road reunited at last with shadow of infinite a lamp after lamp be passed kipps saw by flickering light of one of that be in little fenchurch street then came round corner sharply into dark court stopped at door of particularly ramshackle looking little house held up between two larger one like drunken man between policeman cyclist propped machine carefully against window produced key blew down sharply lock bit tricky said devoted for moment to task of opening door mechanical catastrophe ensued door be open 'd better wait here bit while get lamp remarked to kipps very likely be filled vanished into blackness of passage thank god for match said kipps have impression of passage in transitory pink flare bicyclist disappearing into further room kipps be so much interested by thing for time forgot injury altogether interval kipps be dazzled by pink shaded kerosene lamp go in said red haired man will bring in bike for moment kipps be alone in lamp lit room took in rather vaguely shabby ensemble of little apartment round table covered with torn red glass stained cover on lamp stood mottled looking glass over fireplace reflecting disused gas bracket extinct fire number of dusty postcard memoranda stuck round glass dusty crowded paper rack on mantel with number of cabinet photograph table littered with paper cigarette ash syphon of soda water then cyclist reappeared kipps saw blue shaved rather animated face bright reddish brown eye for first

possession of room free to make more precise examination of content sec particularly remarked photograph adorned apartment be chiefly photograph of lady in one case in tights kipps thought bit one represented bicyclist in costume of remote epoch did not take kipps long to infer that others be probably actress that host be actor presence of half of large coloured playbill seemed to confirm note framed in oxford frame be little too large for presently demeaned to read dear mr chitterlow ran brief course if after will send play spoke of will endeavour to read followed by stylish absolutely illegible signature across be written in pencil what price harry now in shadow by window be rough rather able sketch of bicyclist in chalk on brown paper calling particular attention to curvature of forward line of hull calf jaunty carriage of nose labelled unmistakably chitterlow kipps thought rather take off paper on table by syphon be in manuscript kipps observed manuscript of particularly convulsive blottesque sort running obliquely across page presently heard metallic clamour a if of series of irreparable breakage with lock of front door discharged function then chitterlow reappeared little out of breath a if from running with starry labelled bottle in large freckled hand sit down old chap said sit down have to go out for after be solitary bottle left however be right now be here sit on chair there be sheet of play on that be one with broken arm think glass be clean anyhow wash out with squizz of syphon shy in fireplace here will do lend here a spoke mr chitterlow produced corkscrew from table drawer attached overcame good old methusaleh cork in style bartender might envy washed out two tumbler in simple effectual manner poured couple of inch of ancient fluid into kipps took tumbler said thenks in off hand way after momentary hesitation whether must say here be to not put to lip without ceremony for space fire in throat occupied attention to exclusion of other matter then discovered mr chitterlow with intensely bulldog pipe alight seated on opposite side of empty fireplace pouring out second dose of whiskey after said mr chitterlow with eye on bottle little smile wandering to hide amidst larger feature accident might have be worse wanted someone to talk to bit did want to go to pub leastways not folkestone pub because a matter of fact 'd promised mr chitterlow who be away not to for various reason though of course if 'd wanted to be just that sort must have same here be be curious how one run up against people out bicycling be said kipps feeling that time have come for to say something here be sitting talking like old friend hour ago did know existed leastways did know other existed might have passed in street perhaps might have passed how be to tell put to test must have behaved a decently a have behaved only happened otherwise be be not smoking said have cigarette kipps made confused reply took form of not minding if did drank sip of old methusaleh in confusion be able to follow subsequent course of sip for quite long way be a though old gentleman be brandishing burning torch through vitals lighting here lighting there until at last whole being be in glow chitterlow produced tobacco pouch cigarette paper with interesting parenthesis be little difficult to follow about lady named kitty something other who have taught art when be a yet only what might call nice boy made kipps cigarette with consideration won kipps gratitude suggested that after might find little soda water improvement with whiskey people like way said chitterlow then with voluminous emphasis emboldened by weakened state of enemy kipps promptly swallowed rest of have glass at once hospitably replenished began to feel be of firmer consistency than commonly believed turned mind to what chitterlow be saying with resolve to play larger part in conversation than have hitherto done also smoked through nose quite successfully art have only very recently acquired meanwhile chitterlow explained that be playwright tongue of kipps be unloosened to respond that knew chap rather one of fellow knew chap at least to be perfectly correct fellow brother did who have written play in response to chitterlow enquiry must not recall title of play where have appeared name of manager who produced though thought title be something about love ransom something like that made five 'undred pound by though said kipps know that be nothing said chitterlow with air of experience be extremely convincing nothing may seem big sum to can assure be just what one get day there be amount of money ny amount in good play dessay said kipps drinking amount of money chitterlow began series of illustrative instance be clearly person of quite unequalled gift for monologue be a though conversational dam have burst upon kipps in little while be drifting along upon copious rapid of talk about sort of theatrical thing by one who know about quite incapable of anticipating whither rapid meant to carry presently somehow have got to anecdote about well known theatrical manager little teddy bletherskite artful old chump magnificent behemoth petted to death know fair sickened by society woman chitterlow described various personal encounter with personage always with modest self depreciation gave kipps very amusing imitation of old chump in state of intoxication then took two more stiff dos of old methusaleh in rapid succession kipps reduced hither end of cigarette to pulp a sat dessaying quite believing chitterlow in sagest manner admiring easy way in be getting on with very novel entertaining personage have cigarette made for then chitterlow assuming by insensible degree more more of manner of rich successful playwright being interviewed by young admirer set to answer question sometimes kipps asked sometimes chitterlow about particular method of career undertook self imposed task with great earnestness vigour treating matter indeed with such fulness at time seemed lost altogether under thicket of parenthesis footnote episode that branched budded from stem always emerged again usually by way of illustration to own degressions practically be mass of material for biography of man who have be everywhere done everything including hon thomas norgate be record in particular have acted with great distinction profit dated various anecdote when be getting thirty forty fifty dollar week throughout america entire civilised world a talked on on in full rich satisfying voice have a old methusaleh indisputably most drunken old reprobate of whiskey busied throughout kipps lighting lamp after lamp until entire framework of little draper be illuminated glowing like public building on festival behold chitterlow kipps with room in sat be transfigured chitterlow became in very truth that ripe full man of infinite experience humour genius fellow of shakespeare ibsen maeterlinck three name placed together quite modestly far above own longer ambiguously dressed in sort of yachting costume with cycling knickerbockers elegantly if unconventionally attired room ceased to be small shabby room in folkestone slum grew larger more richly furnished fly blown photograph be curious old picture rubbish on wall most rare costly bric brac indisputable paraffin lamp soft splendid light certain youthful heat to many mind might have weakened old methusaleh starry claim to ripe antiquity vanished in glamour two burnt hole claimant darn in table cloth became more than pleasing contradiction natural in house of genius a for kipps kipps be bright young man of promise distinguished by recent quick courageous proceeding not too definitely insisted upon have be rewarded by admission to sanctum confidence for common prosperous for society woman even be notoriously sighing in vain want boy 'd simply play old harry with work know chap outside bank clerk university fellow think life that sort of thing believe believe then boom boom boom boom right in middle of most entertaining digression on flat who join touring company under impression that be actor kipps much amused at flatness a exposed by chitterlow lor ' said kipps like one who awakens be not eleven must be said chitterlow be nearly ten when got that whiskey be early yet same must be going said kipps stood up even now maybe fact be 'ad idea 'ouse door shuts at 'arf past ten know ought to 'ave thought before well if must go tell what will come too why there be leg old man clean forgot ca go through street like will sew up tear meanwhile have whiskey ought to be getting on now protested kipps feebly then chitterlow be showing how to kneel on chair in order that rent trouser leg must be attainable old methusaleh on third round be busy repairing temporary eclipse of kipps arterial glow then suddenly chitterlow be seized with laughter have to leave off sewing to tell kipps that scene must make bad bit of business in farcical comedy then began to sketch out farcical comedy led to digression about farcical comedy of have written ripping opening scene must take ten minute to read have something in have never be done on stage before be yet perfectly legitimate namely man with live beetle down back of neck trying to seem at ease in roomful of people wo lock out said in singularly reassuring tone began to read act what explained to be not because have written simply because knew be so on account of exceptional experience of stage what kipps also quite clearly saw to be one of best opening scene have ever be written when be over kipps who rarely swore be inspired to say scene be damned fine about six time over whereupon a if by way of recognition chitterlow took simply enormous portion of inspiring antediluvian declaring at same time that have rarely met finer intelligence than kipps stronger there might be that must say with certainty a yet seeing how little after have seen of other finer never that be shame such gallant discriminating intelligence must be nightly locked up locked out at ten well ten thirty then that have mind to recommend old somebody other apparently editor of london daily paper to put on kipps forthwith a dramatic critic in place of current incapable think have ever made up anything for print said kipps ever 'd have thundering good try though if ever got chance must have written window ticket often enough made 'em up everything be different 'd come to fresher for not having done before way picked up point in scene boy be fair treat tell 'd knock william archer into fit not so literary of course 'd be believe in literary critic more than in literary playwright play be literature be just point miss play be play wo hamper anyhow be wasted down here tell just a be before took to acting be hanged if must like opinion on first two act of tragedy be on to have told about that must take more than hour to read sec then so far a must subsequently remember kipps have then must seem that suddenly regardless of tragedy insisted that reelly must be getting on from point memory became irregular certain thing have remained quite clearly a be matter of common knowledge intoxicated people forget what happens to follows that be not intoxicated chitterlow came with partly to see home partly for freshener before turning in kipps recalled afterwards very distinctly how in little fenchurch street discovered that must not walk straight also chitterlow needle thread in still unmended trouser leg be making annoying little noise on pavement behind tried to pick up needle suddenly by surprise somehow tripped fell then chitterlow laughing uproariously helped up be bicycle time old boy said chitterlow appeared to at time a being quite extraordinarily good joke indeed punched other about on strength of for time after kipps certainly pretended to be quite desperately drunk unable to walk chitterlow entered into pretence supported after kipps remembered being struck with extremely laughable absurdity of going down hill to tontine street in order to go up hill again to emporium trying to get idea into chitterlow head being unable to do so on account of own merriment chitterlow evident intoxication next memory after be of exterior of emporium shut darkened a be frowning at with stripe of yellow green chilly way in shalford glittered in moonlight printed with particular vividness on mind appeared to kipps that establishment be closed to for evermore gilded letter in spite of appearance spelt finis for exile from folkestone must never do wood carving never see miss walshingham again not that have ever hoped to see again be knife be final have stayed out have got drunk there have be that row about manchester window dressing only three day ago in retrospect be quite sure that be perfectly sober then at bottom extremely unhappy kept brave face on matter nevertheless declared stoutly did care if be locked out whereupon chitterlow slapped on back very hard told be bit of right assured that when have be clerk in sheffield before took to acting have be locked out sometimes for six night running what be result said chitterlow must go back to place now 'd be glad to have glad to have repeated then added be to say if remember be very likely kipps asked little weakly what be to do keep out said chitterlow ca knock 'em up now must give right away 'd better try sneak in in morning with cat will do will probably get in right in morning if nobody give away then for time perhaps a result of slap in back kipps felt decidedly queer acting on chitterlow advice went for bit of freshener upon lea after time threw off temporary queerness found chitterlow patting on shoulder telling that 'd be right now in minute better for be wind having dropped night being now really very beautiful moonlight night indeed before kipps to spend a liked with only very little tendency to spin round now again to mar splendour set out to walk whole length of lea to sandgate lift back a walked chitterlow spoke first of moonlight transfiguring sea then of moonlight transfiguring face so at last came to topic of love upon that dwelt great while with wealth of experience illustrative anecdote seemed remarkably pungent material to kipps forgot lost miss walshingham outraged employer again became a be desperado by reflection chitterlow have have adventure quite astonishing variety of adventure in direction be man with past really opulent past certainly seemed to like to look back see amidst opulence made consecutive history gave kipps vivid momentary picture of relation entanglement one moment be in flight only too worthily in flight before husband of malay woman in cape town at next be having passionate complication with daughter of clergyman in york then passed to remarkable grouping at seaford say ca love two woman at once said chitterlow tell gesticulated raised ample voice be rot rot know said kipps why when be in small with bessie hopper company there be three laughed decided to add not counting bessie be set out to reveal life a be lived in touring company quite amazing jungle of interwoven affair appeared to be mere amorous winepress for crushing of heart people say sort of thing nuisance interferes with work tell be work must go on without must do have temperament if if have temperament must want to act if have bif be right said kipps see that chitterlow proceeded to close criticism of certain historical indiscretion of mr clement scott respecting moral of stage speaking in confidence not a one who address public admitted regretfully general truth of comment proceeded to examine various typical instance have almost forced upon personally with especial regard to contrast between own character towards woman of hon thomas norgate with whom appeared have once be on term of great intimacy kipps listened with emotion to extraordinary recollection be wonderful to be incredibly credible of course tumultuous passionate course be way life ran except in high class establishment such thing happened in novel in play only have be fool enough not to understand happened share in conversation be now indeed no more than faint writing in margin chitterlow be talking quite continuously expanded magnificent voice into huge guffaw drew together into confidential intensity became drawlingly reminiscent be frank frank with effect of revelation reticent also with effect of revelation stupendously gesticulating moonlit black figure wallowing in preaching adventure flesh to kipps yet withal shot with something of sentiment with sort of sentimental refinement very coarsely egotistically done time have have even before be a old a kipps have have innumerable time well said with sudden transition have sown wild

without much fear of contradiction be very finest completely untrained contralto voice in world to hear properly said chitterlow want big hall became rather vague jerked head about to indicate when how have entered matrimony be seemed away with people be clear that chitterlow did not get on with people very well must seem failed to appreciate playwright regarding a unremunerative pursuit whereas a kipps knew wealth beyond dream of avarice must presently accrue only patience persistence be needful went off at tangent to hospitality kipps must come down home with must wander about night with bottle of right sort pining at home for can sleep on sofa wo be worried by broken spring anyhow for took 'em out two three week ago see what even put in for be point know about took particular notice of when be with bessie hopper three month be over england north wale isle of man never struck sofa in digging anywhere have broken spring not once time added almost absently happens like at time descended slant road towards harbour street went on past pavilion hotel sec came into presence of old methusaleh again that worthy under chitterlow direction at once resumed illumination of kipps interior with conscientious thoroughness distinguished chitterlow took tall portion to with air of asbestos lit bulldog pipe again lapsed for space into meditation from kipps roused by remarking that expected acter 'as lot of ups down like now then at chitterlow seemed to bestir ra ther said sometimes be own fault sometimes be usually be if be one thing be if be manager wife be bar bragging tell

exhaustive summary of high toned modern criticism a if be repeating lesson while thinking of something else seemed to rouse a passed lip by including name of ibsen became interested in telling kipps who be indeed open to information about quite novel name exactly where thought ibsen fell short point where happened that ibsen be defective just where chanced that chitterlow be strong of course have desire to place in way on equality with ibsen still fact remained that own experience in england america colony be altogether more extensive than ibsen must have have ibsen have probably never seen one decent bar scrap in life that of course be not ibsen fault own merit there thing be genius knew be supposed to be able to do anything to do without anything still be now inclined to doubt that have play in hand might perhaps not please william archer whose opinion after did not value a valued kipps opinion thought be at rate a well constructed a anything ibsen ever did so with infinite deviousness chitterlow came at last to play decided must not read to kipps tell about be simpler because much of be still unwritten began to explain plot be complicated plot about nobleman who have seen everything done everything knew practically that chitterlow knew about woman be to say about woman suchlike matter warmed excited chitterlow presently stood up to act situation must not be explained be extremely vivid situation kipps applauded situation vehemently tha be dam ' fine said new dramatic critic quite familiar with part now striking table with fist almost upsetting third portion in second series of old methusaleh tha dam ' fine chit'low see said chitterlow with last vestige of incidental gloom disappearing good old boy thought 'd see be just sort of thing literary critic ca see however be only beginning replenished kipps proceeded with exposition in little while be no longer necessary to give over advertised ibsen purely conventional precedence have hitherto have kipps chitterlow be friend must speak frankly openly of thing not usually admitted 'ow said kipps little irrelevantly speaking over brim of replenishment what read jus now be dam ' fine nothing ca alter that perceived sort of faint buzzing vibration about thing be very nice pleasant with little care have difficulty whatever in putting glass back on table then perceived chitterlow be going on with scenario then that old methusaleh have almost entirely left bottle be glad there be so little more methusaleh to drink because must prevent getting drunk knew that be not now drunk knew that have have enough be one of who always know when have have enough tried to interrupt chitterlow to tell must not get suitable opening doubted whether chitterlow might not be one of people who did not know when have have enough discovered that disapproved of chitterlow highly seemed to that chitterlow went on on like river for time be inexplicably quite unjustly cross with chitterlow wanted to say to got gift of gab only got so far a to say gift then chitterlow thanked said be better than archer day so eyed chitterlow with baleful eye until dawned upon that most extraordinary thing be taking place chitterlow kept mentioning someone named kipps presently began to perplex kipps very greatly dimly decidedly perceived be wrong look 'ere said suddenly what kipps chap kipps be telling about what chap kipps be telling about told kipps struggled with difficulty in silence for space then reiterated firmly what chap kipps chap in play man who kiss girl never kissed girl said kipps leastwise subsided for space must not remember whether have kissed ann not knew have meant to then suddenly in tone of great sadness addressing hearth said name kipps eh said chitterlow kipps said kipps smiling little cynically what about be tapped breastbone with middle finger to indicate essential self leant forward very gravely towards chitterlow look 'ere chit'low said have business putting name into play must do thing like 'd lose crib right away have little argument so far a kipps must remember chitterlow entered upon general explanation of how got name have for most part got out of newspaper be still believed lying about even made to look for while be doing so kipps went on with argument addressing more particularly to photograph of girl in tights said that at first costume have not commended to now perceived have extremely sensible face told must like buggins if met must see be just that sort must admit sensible people must admit that using name in play be wrong must for example have law of became confidential explained that be already in sufficient trouble for stopping out night without having name put in play be certain to be in deuce of row deuce of row why have done why have gone at

incompatibility lying about course of true love in particular case have felt without understanding incongruity between announcement have failed to make circle of idea of aunt uncle be rather than want of specific intention have silenced perception that when travelled from folkestone to new romney travelled from atmosphere where engagement to helen be sane excellent to atmosphere where be only to be regarded with incredulous suspicion coupled associated with jar be sense of altered behaviour of sid pornick evident shock to ancient alliance caused by fact of enrichment touch of hostility in will

looked over shoulder to catch view of chitterlow retreating aspect did not compel complete confidence turned to lover said in tone of quiet authority must tell about chitterlow now explanation began school play came almost a relief to kipps in flusterment of going in must almost forget for time laocoon struggle to explain in interval did best to keep forgetting helen with gentle insistence resumed explanation of chitterlow a returned towards folkestone chitterlow be confoundedly difficult to explain must hardly imagine there be almost motherly anxiety in helen manner blended with resolution of schoolmistress to get to bottom of affair kipps ' ear be soon quite brightly red have seen one of play e tole about one on stage no 'as 'ad on stage yet be coming promise said in conclusion wo do anything without consulting of course kipps promised oo went on way in silence one ca know everybody said helen in general of course said kipps in sort of way be that helped to money

people in train omnibus how for example man have passed change to conductor common man looked have lifted hat stamped kipps so deeply with hat raising habit that must uncover if found in same railway ticket office with lady have to stand ceremoniously until difficulty of change drove to apologetic provisional oblique resumption of headgear robbing thing of air of personal application threw about abundant talk about two child called twin jewel quite frequently about gift temperament ambition need of opportunity needed opportunity must say a other people needed air in conversation with kipps always assumed seemed to assume that be to join home in london helen foreshadowed be surprised one day to gather that be not to be case must do said helen with decision want to make circle of own wo be bit lonely down here asked kipps there be waces mr prebble mr bindon botting lot of people know helen dismissed possibility young walshingham share in educational syndicate be smaller shone out when went to london on art craft expedition then rising man of affair showed kipps how to buy more theatrical weekly for consumption in train how to buy what to buy in way of cigarette with gold tip

helen conversation conversation with kipps be never of grossly sentimental sort there be shyness of speech in matter with of new adumbration be at least a interesting not so directly disagreeable a clear cut intimation of personal defect that for time have so greatly chastened kipps ' delight in presence future presented with almost perfect frankness a joint campaign of mr walshingham twin jewel upon great world with kipps in capacity of baggage supply must still be dreadfully poor of course amazed kipps said nothing until brudderkins began to succeed if be clever lucky might do great deal

of sang froid sec world a coote presented be in part endorsement in part amplification in part rectification of world of kipps world derived from old couple in new romney have be developed in emporium world in fact of common british life there be same subtle sense of social graduation have moved mr kipps to prohibit intercourse with labourer child same dread of anything common have kept personal quality of mr shalford establishment so high now certain disagreeable doubt about kipps own position be removed stood with coote inside sphere of gentleman assured within sphere of gentleman there be distinction of rank indeed none of class there be big people modest refined gentlemanly little people like coote who may even dabble in profession counterless trade there be lord magnificence there be

clear of crowd for space coote said nothing then remarked abruptly quite angrily for think be awful cheek kipps made reply whole thing be interesting little object lesson in distance stuck in front of kipps mind for long time have particularly vivid face of pierce with expression between astonishment anger felt a though have struck pierce in face under circumstance gave pierce power to reply did not attend very much to duet even forgot at end of one of to say how perfectly lovely be sec must not imagine that national ideal of gentleman a coote developed be matter of deportment selectness mere isolation from debasing association there be serious side deeper aspect of true true gentleman true gentleman doe not wear heart on sleeve be polished surface above deep for example be deeply religious a coote be a mr walshingham be outside wall of church never appears except perhaps now then in pause in profound look in sudden avoidance in little while kipps also have pause profound look sudden avoidance that final refinement of spirituality impressionistic piety true gentleman be patriotic also when one saw coote lifting hat to national anthem then perhaps one got glimpse of what patriotic emotion what worship polish of gentleman may hide singing out deep note against host of midian in st stylite choir then indeed plumbed spiritual side christian dost thou heed on holy ground

merest shooting box said architect got to six beat steadily from bedroom to bedroom word nursery played across imaginative sky mentioned a remotest possibility then six being reluctantly conceded ann came forward to table sat down delivered of one of prepared condition cold water said laid on to room any'ow be idea long since acquired from sid yes said kipps on hearthrug cold water laid on to bedroom have settled on that be first intimation to architect that have to deal with couple of exceptional originality a have spent previous afternoon in finding three large house in builder intended to combine into original copyright design of own naturally struggled against novel requirement enlarged on extreme expensiveness of plumbing on extreme expensiveness of everything not already arranged for in scheme only when ann declared 'd a soon not have house a not have requirement kipps blenching while have said did mind what thing cost so long a got what wanted did allow kindred originality of own to appear beneath acquired professionalism of method dismissed previous talk with paragraphic cough of course said if mind being unconventional explained that have be thinking of queen anne style of architecture ann directly heard name shook head at kipps in aside so far a exterior went for own part said liked to have exterior of house in style not priggishly in style mixed with one style uppermost gable dormer casement of queen anne style with little rough cast sham timbering here there perhaps bit of overhang diversified house made interesting advantage of what called queen anne style be that have such variety of feature still if be prepared to be unconventional must be done number of house be now built in unconventional style be often very pretty in unconventional style one frequently have what perhaps might call internal feature for example old english oak staircase gallery white rough cast green paint be good deal favoured in house of type indicated that excursus on style be finished by momentary use of cough reopened notebook have closed to wave about in moment of descriptive enthusiasm while expatiating on unbridled wealth of external feature associated with queen anne six bedroom said moistening pencil one with barred window suitable for nursery if required kipps endorsed huskily reluctantly there followed most interesting discussion upon house building in kipps played minor part passed from bedroom to kitchen scullery there ann displayed intelligent exactingness won expressed admiration of architect be particularly novel upon position of coal cellar ann held to be altogether too low in ordinary house necessitating much heavy carrying dismissed a impracticable idea of having coal cellar kitchen at top of house because must involve carrying coal through house therewith much subsequent cleaning for time dealt with conception of coal cellar on ground floor with light staircase running up outside to exterior shoot might be made feature said architect little doubtfully jotting down note of must be apt to get black know thence passed to alternative of service lift then by inspiration of architect to possibility of gas heating kipps did complicated verbal fugue on theme gas heating heat air with variable aspirate became very red be lost to discussion altogether for time though lip kept silently on subsequently architect wrote to say that found in notebook very full explicit direction for bow window to room for bedroom for water supply lift height of stair absence of twist therein for well ventilated kitchen twenty foot square with two dresser large box window seat for scullery outhouse office nothing about drawing room dining room library study approximate cost awaited further instruction presumed there must be breakfast room dining room drawing room study for mr kipps at least be conception young couple discussed matter long ardently ann be distinctly restrictive in direction see what want drawin room dinin ' kitchen for if be going to let in summer well good be not going to let consequently want so many room then there be 'all what use be 'all only make work study kipps have be humming stroking moustache since have read architect letter think 'd like little bit of study not big one of course one with desk book shelf like there be in hughenden 'd like that be only after have talked to architect again seen

architect drew three set of plan on transparent bluish sort of paper smelt abominably painted very nicely brick red ginger arsenic green leaden sort of blue brought over to show young people first set be very simple with practically external feature plain style said be looked big sort of house nevertheless second have such extra a conservatory bow window of various sort one rough cast gable one
