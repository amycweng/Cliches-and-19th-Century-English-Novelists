bishop to greet gathering daylight became little clamour misty sea of sound in individuality appeared disappeared for time distant cuckoo be very perceptible like landmark looming up over fog like cuckoo in pastoral symphony bishop tried not to heed sound be by very nature insistent sound lay disregarding acutely presently pulled coverlet over ear little later sat up in bed again in slight detail marked strange novel detachment from world of upbringing hallucination of disillusionment have spread from church faith to whole animate creation knew that be voice of feathered songster that be joyous chorus greeting day knew that wakeful bishop ought to bless happy creature join with by reciting ken morning hymn made effort be more than half habit to repeat repeated with scowling face

have heard such vain repetition struggled against dark mood of criticism prayeth best who loveth best no did not love bird be useless to pretend one may say about other bird cuckoo be low detestable cad of bird then bishop began to be particularly tormented by bird made short insistent wheezing sound at regular interval of perhaps twenty second if bird must have whooping cough that thought be sort of whoop must have even if have whooping cough must not pity hung in interval waiting for return of wheeze then that blackbird reasserted have rich boastful note seemed proud of noisy reiteration of simple self assertion for obscure reason phrase oleographic sound drifted into bishop thought bird produced peculiar irrational impression that have recently made considerable sum of money by shrewd industrialism be thought grimly genuine princhester blackbird wickedly uncharitable reference to diocese ran unchallenged through bishop mind others le wicked followed once during summer holiday in florence lady ella have subscribed to association for protection of song bird recalled now with mild wonder seemed to that perhaps after be a well to let fruit grower italian deal with singing bird in own way perhaps after have wisdom passed hand over face world after be not made entirely for singing bird there be such thing a proportion singing bird may become luxury indulgence excess did bird eat fruit in paradise perhaps there worked for collective musical effect have sort of conductor in place of hullabaloo decided to walk about room for time then remake bed sunrise found bishop with head shoulder out of window trying to see blackbird just wanted to look at be persuaded be quite exceptional blackbird again came that oppressive sense of futility of contemporary church time came in most grotesque form for hanging half out of casement be suddenly reminded of st francis of assisi how at rebuke wheeling swallow stilled cry be so different then be only after have passed four similar night with intervening day of lassitude afternoon siesta that bishop realized that be in grip of insomnia did not go at once to doctor told trouble to one met received much tentative

be not numbered handed over to whippham when proved a usual broken reed bishop have brilliant idea of referring young man to canon bliss of pringle who have special knowledge quite beyond own in field knew from young man eye even a said that be not going to put off for more than day so immediate result of glancing over paper be however to enhance in bishop mind growing disposition to minimize

of general tranquillity realized that be passing into new phase of life into new quality of thought told one of insomnia one of doubt betrayed only by increasing tendency towards vagueness symbolism

have also come to theological stage of development did however weigh possibility of too liberal opinion on be called social question on part of miss sharsper novelist decided that if lady be watched nothing so terrible must be said even in undertone a for mariposa dancer have nothing spanish bad french looked right be very likely must go out of way to startle anglican bishop simply need dance besides even if man doe get glimpse of little something be a if be woman of course if party must annoy bishop bishop must do duty by party there must be usual purple silver buckle wired back little party wo put out send man with change in making that promise mr garstein fellow reckoned without morbid sensibility of bishop disorganized nervous system unsuspected theological stirring beneath apparent worldliness of hoppart bent trouble began in drawing room after dinner out of deference to bishop abstinence men did not remain to smoke came in to find mariposa lady sunderbund smoking cigarette lady continued to do little defiantly have hoped to finish before bishop came up night be chilly cheerful wood fire cracking banging on fireplace emphasized ordinary heating mr garstein fellow who have not expected so prompt appearance of men have arranged chair in semicircle for little womanly gossip before must intervene found party with exception of lord gatling who have drifted just little too noticeably with miss barnsetter into window sitting round with conscious air be perhaps just trifle too apparent of being good mr bent plunged boldly into general conversation be reading anything now mr garstein fellow asked be interested party be standing at side of fireplace bit lip looked at cornice meditated with girlish expression yes said be reading again did think must be for time said hoppart read nothing paper bought from dozen to twenty day be wearing off said bishop first thing began to read again said mr garstein fellow be not saying for sake bishop be bible went to bible said bent a if be surprised have heard that before said ridgeway kelso in slightly explosive manner of sort of people who usually read bible mr kelso protested hostess with raised eyebrow be thinking of bent anyhow there be be great wave of seriousness sudden turning to religion religious thing know if come way bishop have have row of penitent yet may be coming said hoppart turned sideways to face bishop think must be coming if if be for old entangled difficulty know if will mind saying to bishop returned frank glance 'd like to know above thing said if mr garstein fellow will permit be business to know want to know said lady sunderbund speaking from low chair on other side of fireplace there be vibration in voice sudden gleam of enthusiasm in face why must people talk se'iously sometimes well take own case said hoppart in last few week have be reading not only in bible in father have read most of athanasius most of eusebius will confess gibbon find old wonder come back why be pinned to to amount of creed be pinned to why for instance must insist on trinity yes said eton boy explosively flushed darkly to find have spoken here be time when men ask for god said hoppart give three cried bent rather cheaply confess find way encumbered by alexandrian elaboration hoppart completed need be whispered lady sunderbund very softly well said bishop leant back in armchair knitted brow at fire think said that men coming to god think very much of nature of god nevertheless spoke slowly patted arm of chair nevertheless church insists that certain vitally important truth have to be conveyed certain mortal error be best guarded against by symbol admit be symbol so church have always called hoppart showed by little movement grimace that thought bishop quibbled in sense of word bishop hastened to explain creed be symbolical be clear seek to express ineffable thing by at least extended use of familiar word suppose be agreed nowadays that when speak of father of son mean something only in very remote exalted way parallel with with biological fatherhood sonship lady sunderbund nodded eagerly yes said oh yes held up expectant face for more utmost word most elaborately phrased creed can at best be better than shadow of something unseen thrown upon screen of experience raised rather weary eye to hoppart a if must know what else needed explanation be gratified by lady sunderbund approval affected not to see hear be bent who spoke spoke in most casual way made thing seem most incidental of observation what puzzle said be why early christian identified spermaticos logo of stoic with second not with third person of trinity to bishop rising artlessly to bait replied ah indeed be unfortunate aspect of whole affair then irish catholic came down on how bishop awakened in night after dispute have be told already in opening section of story to night of discomfort now return after comprehensive digression awoke from nightmare of eye triangle to bottomless remorse perplexity for first time fully measured vast distance have travelled from belief attitude of early training since coming to princhester travelled rather slipped fallen down long slope of doubt that clear inky dimness come before dawn found white face at window looking out upon great terrace park after bout of mental distress sleeplessness bishop must sometimes wake in morning not so much exhausted a in state of thin mental bodily activity be more particularly so if night have produced anything in nature of purpose so be on occasion day be clear before at least must be cleared by sending three telegram man must go back to princhester so leave perfectly free to go to brighton pomfrey in london secure friendly dispensation to smoke again seemed only alternative to serious mental breakdown must take bag stay night in london smoke sleep well return next morning dunk valet butler found already bathed ready for cup of tea bradshaw at half past seven went on dressing although good train for london did not start until mr garstein fellow be by nature principle late riser breakfast room showed small promise yet of repast though table be set bright with silver fresh flower wood fire popped spurted to greet encourage march sunshine standing in doorway led to promise daffodil crocus of mr garstein fellow garden stood lady sunderbund almost with effect of waiting greeted bishop very cheerfully doubted immediate appearance of one else led in most natural manner into new already very pleasant shrubbery in indefinable special way bishop

longed for said did very pretty best to convey what be have be troubling 'iligion bad be worrying for year life be oh just ornament game so wea'isome so wea'isome unless be 'iligious must get 'iligious bishop nodded head gravely undebetand pressed understand too well attempt to get hold keep hold knew must cried went on with impulsive rapidity o'thodoxy have always 'ipelled always have felt confronted by most insurmountable difficulty yet whenever have gone away from christianity have gone away from christianity to theosophist christian scientist have felt be only st'aying fu'tha then suddenly when be speaking last night have felt knew be so wonderful to hear k'eed be only symbol symbol be proper name for said bishop be for century be called creed yes so what really meant be something quite different from what did mean bishop felt that sentence also be only symbol nodded encouragingly gravely warily there be point be there be thousand thousand thousand of educated people like who be dying to get through old fashioned symbol to true faith lay behind that knew lay behind did know if have read light under altar be vicar of wombash in diocese said bishop with restraint be wonde'ful stuff said lady sunderbund be spi'tually cold be intellectually wonde'ful want that with spi'tuality want so badly if one became daring bit under lip flashed spirit at if said paused must think aloud said bishop yes said nodding rapidly became breathless to hear must certainly be astonishing end to chasters difficulty if bishop went over to heretic bishop reflected dear lady wo disguise began in fact see how must for year have be growing more more discontented with of most fundamental formula be be very largely shapeless discontent hitherto think have said word to single

broached casket of reserve be only too glad of listener talked a if be intimate loving friend so seemed to of be be wonderful release from long painful solitude to certain type be never quite clear what have happened to until tell so now bishop punctuated very prettily by lady sunderbund began to measure for first time extent of departure from old innate conviction of otteringham rectory said that be strange to find doubt coming so late in life perhaps be only in recent year that faith have be put to really severe test have be sheltered unchallenged fearful be lady sunderbund interjected princhester have be critical trying change light under altar case have ploughed deeply be curious that doubt always seemed to have double strand there be moral objection based on church practical futility intellectual strand subordinated to traced that futility largely to unconvincing formula yet know said bishop find ca go with chasters beat at church treat a though be wrong feel like son growing up who find mother be quite so clear spoken quite so energetic a seemed to be once be right feel sure have never doubted fundamental goodness yes said lady sunderbund very eagerly yes yet there be futility know dear lady know what to do one feel on one hand here be cloud of witness great men sainted men subtle men figure permanently historical before whom one can hing bow down in utmost humility here be great instrument organization what must world be without witness of church on other hand here be mass out of hand hostile industrial leader equally hostile there be failure to

quite significant quite adequate in asia minor egypt among men essentially oriental fifteen hundred year ago now expressed just what came to now by gesture echoed gesture probably be not alone among brother went on then what be one to do with hand acted sense of difficulty one may be precipitate said there be kind of loyalty discipline requires one to keep rank until one course of action be perfectly clear one owes so much to so many one have to consider how one may affect oh people one have never seen be lugging thing now into speech so far have be scarcely above threshold of conscious thought went on to discus entire position of disbelieving cleric discovered fine point if there be something else alternative religion church to one must go whole case must be different to go from church to nothingness be to go from falsehood to truth be to go from truth rather badly expressed rather conservatively hidden by protection truth in antiquated costume to blackest lie in world took point very brightly one must hold fast to 'iligion said looked earnestly at gripped fiercely pink thumb out with beautiful hand held up be exactly too be gripping while on outside midianites of denial be prowling for clinging soul within camp be assailed by meticulous orthodoxy be only too eager to cast forth bishop dwelt for time upon curious fierceness orthodoxy must sometimes display nowadays atheism can be civil can be generous be orthodoxy that trail scurrilous fringe who be that young man with strong irish accent who contradicted so suddenly asked dark young man noisy young man be mist

indeed new topic will eva do think have new 'iligion t'ua betta be revolutionary idea to be still fending off from when gap in shrub brought within sight of house of mr garstein fellow on portico waving handkerchief cry break fast wish must talk for houas said lady sunderbund have be glad of talk said bishop very glad lifted soft abundant skirt trotted briskly across still dewy lawn towards house door bishop followed gravely slowly with hand behind back unusually peaceful expression upon face be thinking how rare precious thing be to find intelligent friendship in woman more particularly when be dazzlingly charming pretty be strange be really first woman friend if a hoped became friend lady sunderbund entered breakfast room in gusty abundance like botticelli primavera kissed mr garstein fellow good morning exhaled glowing happiness be wondyful panted be most wondyful mr hidgeway kelso dee bishop love be little sausage like may take th'ee have be up dee bishop appeared in sunlit doorway bishop felt more contentment in london train than have felt for many week have taken two decisive relieving step one be that have stated case to human being that very charming sympathetic human being be no longer prey to current of secret concealed thought running counter to appearance of outward life other be that be now within hour so of brighton pomfrey cigarette must lunch on train get to london about two take taxi at once to wise old doctor catch over coffee in charitable understanding mood perhaps be smoking cigarette publicly honourably altogether satisfyingly before three so far a brighton pomfrey door program be fulfilled without hitch day be fine have taxi opened noted with patriotic satisfaction a rattled through street glare of recruiting poster on vacant piece of wall increasing number of men in khaki in street at door have disappointment dr brighton pomfrey be away at front of place have gone for week must bishop like to see dr dale bishop hesitated have never set eye on dr dale indeed have never heard of dr dale seeing old friend brighton pomfrey being gently tactfully told to do exactly what be longing to do be one thing facing strange doctor going slowly elaborately through whole story of illness vow breakdown perhaps having reaction time tested sort of stripping sounding done be quite be within ace of turning away if have turned away whole subsequent life must have be different be very slightest thing in world tipped beam be thought that after inconvenience unpleasantness there might be in interview there be at end of very reasonable prospect of restored legitimate cigarette chapter fifth first vision dr dale exceeded bishop worst apprehension be lean lank dark young man with long black hair irregular rather prolonged feature chin be right over to left looked constantly at bishop face with distinctly sceptical grey eye must not have looked harder if have be photographer portrait painter voice be harsh bishop be particularly sensitive to voice began by understanding far too much of bishop illness insisted on various familiarity with bishop heart tongue eye knee ruffled bishop soul brighton pomfrey talked of neurasthenia asked that be diagnosis said bishop neurasthenia said young man a though despised word bishop went on buttoning up coat of course want to break vow about drinking smoking said young man with very faintest suggestion of derision in voice not if can possibly be avoided bishop asserted without loss be of practical efficiency added for have much to do think that be possible to keep vow said young man bishop must have sworn at think can manage that right bishop sat at table resting arm upon awaiting next development of unsatisfactory interview be on verge of asking a unpleasantly a possible when brighton pomfrey must return young man stood upon brighton pomfrey hearth rug be evidently contemplating dissertation of course said a though discussed problem with must have sort of comfort must get out of state one way bishop nodded assent have faint hope of young man idea of comfort dr dale reflected then went off away from question of comfort altogether see trouble in such case a be peculiarly difficult to trace to source because come just upon border line of bodily mental thing may take drug alter regimen disturbs thought may take idea disturbs health be easy enough to say a do that idea have physical substratum be almost a easy to say with christian scientist that bodily state be amenable to idea truth doe think follow border between opposite opinion very exactly on side ca for instance tell to go home pray against uncertainty despair because be just uncertainty despair rob of power of efficient prayer did not seem to expect anything from bishop see that because case brings one suddenly right up against frontier of metaphysics why doctor must necessarily pull up short at why one must go on into metaphysics psychology if such extension be necessary for understanding of case at rate if will permit in consultation go on said bishop holding on to promise of comfort best thing be to thrash out case in own way then come to what be practical what be really matter here matter with be be disorganization of test of reality be one of group of state hitherto confused neurasthenia comprehensive phrase well be one of neurasthenia here confess begin to talk of work be doing work still to be published finished first then published go off from idea living being life in state not differing essentially from state of hallucination concerning thing about truth essential truth be hidden always of course there must be measure of truth in working illusion working measure of truth creature must smash up end beyond discretion of fire pitfall lie wide margin of error about may be deceived for year so long a doe matter doe matter know if make clear follow said bishop little wearily follow phenomenon noumenon so on so on kant so forth pragmatism yes with sigh completed dr dale in voice suggested mockery see grow into way of life settle down among habit convention say 'this be right 'that be always so ' get more more settled into life a whole more more confident unless something happens to shake out of sphere of illusion may be violent contradictory fact accident may be subtle change in one health nerve make feel doubtful change of habit a believe subtle quickening of critical faculty then suddenly come feeling a though be lost in strange world a though have never really seen world before paused bishop be reluctantly interested that doe describe something of mental side admitted never believe in concealing own thought from intelligent patient said dr dale with quiet offensiveness that sort of thing belongs to dark age of 'pothecary art will tell exactly guess supposition about at base of be slight subtle kidney trouble due suggest to going to princhester drinking local water be excellent water boast of by established test a matter of fact many of best drinking water have sort of unspecified quality burton water for example be radioactive by beetham standard up to ninth degree be by way theory about case be that produced change in blood that quickened sensibility critical faculty just at time when good many bother of course know what be can so to speak see mark over came into life bishop nodded be uprooted moved from house to house failed to get curled up safe feeling one have in real home in of if saw fireplace general decoration of new palace admitted bishop have practically control that confirms said dr dale insomnia followed increased feeling of physical strangeness by increasing bodily disturbance suspect intellectual disturbance paused there be said bishop be no longer at home anywhere be no longer at home in diocese in palace in body in conviction then came war quite apart from everything else mind of whole world be suffering profoundly from shock of war much more than be generally admitted one thing did that probably did not observe doing drank rather more at meal smoked lot more be natural proper response to shock ah said bishop brightened up be remarked by tolstoy think that few intellectual men must really tolerate world a be if be not for smoking drinking even novelist have moment of lucidity certainly thing soothe restlessness in men mind deaden sceptical sensibility just at time when be getting most dislodged gave up sooner go back to better said bishop brightly quite see must say said dr dale said dr dale be just where treatment of case differs from treatment of spoke name reluctantly a if disliked mere sound of dr brighton pomfrey hitherto of course said bishop have be in hand said dr dale must certainly set about trying to restore old sphere of illusion old familiar sensation idea confidence must in fact turn back must restore habit must order rest must send off to holiday resort fresh in fact familiar in character high land north italy switzerland for example must forbid newspaper order to botanize prescribe tranquillizing reading trollope novel life of gladstone work of mr c benson memoir so on 'd go somewhere where there be good anglican chaplain 'd take of service 'd wash out effect of princhester water with contrexeville afterwards put on salutaris perrier know whether must have inclined to such treatment before war began only paused think dr dale face betrayed sudden sombre passion wo do now said in voice of quiet intensity wo do now remained darkly silent for so long that at last bishop spoke then what asked do suggest suppose try to go back said dr dale suppose go on go through where to reality know be doubtful know be dangerous went on be convinced that now can no longer keep men mind soul in feathered nest sphere of illusion behind veil there be god darkness why must not go on bishop be profoundly perplexed heard speaking must be unworthy of cloth be saying dr dale completed sentence to go back let explain little more said what mean by 'going on ' think that loosening of tie of association bind man to everyday life everyday self be in nine case out of ten loosening of tie bind to everyday sanity one common form of detachment be form have in case of people who be found wandering unaware of name unaware of place of residence lost altogether from have not only lost sense of identity with circumstance of life have faded out of mind like idle story in book have be read put aside have looked into hundred of such case think that loss of identity be necessary thing be just side of general weakening of grip upon reality kind of anaemia of brain so that interest fade fails there be reason why must forget story because believe if brain be strong enough to hold if brain be tired weak then so soon a lose faith in record mind be glad to let go when see lost identity people be always first impression tired brain have let go bishop felt extremely like letting go how doe apply to case come to said dr dale holding up long large hand what if treat case of yours in new way what if give not narcotic stimulant tonic what if so touch blood that increase sense of physical detachment while at same time feeding up sens to new more vivid apprehension of thing about looked at patient hesitation added 'd lose that craving feeling that fancy at present be just need of smoke world might grow trifle transparent 'd keep real instead of drugging back to old contentment 'd drug on to new said bishop just one word more said dr dale hear why must do be easy successful to rest drug people back to old state of mind when world be changing be spinning round in wildest tornado of change that have ever be in now where can send for rest where can send to get out of sight hearing of catastrophe of course old brighton pomfrey must go on sending people away for rest nice little soothing change if day of judgment be coming in sky earth be opening sea be giving up dead 'd send to seaside such thing a must shake faith in channel crossing idea be that be not only right for to go through with that be only thing to do if go right on right through with doubt intimation paused may die like madman said wo die like tame rabbit bishop sat reflecting what fascinated attracted be ending of craving uneasiness restlessness have distressed life for over four year what deterred be personality of gaunt young man with long grey face excited manner shock of black hair wanted that tonic with grave misgiving if think tonic be wiser course began 'd give if be father said dr dale have got everything for added

did not want to go without promised comfort presently dale have given little phial be holding up to window small medicine glass into be pouring very carefully twenty drop of precious fluid take only said when feel must be most golden of liquid said bishop peering at when want more will make more later of course will be possible to write prescription now add water so becomes opalescent how

possible departure from orthodoxy have be something that chasters have phrased a restatement of christ be new idea idea have come with immense effect of severance novelty that god must be other than

incidental exchange at club talked to one at first did not want to talk to one remained mentally practically active with still intensely vivid sense god true god stood watching waiting for to follow to follow meant slipping right out of world have ever known to thrust foot right over edge of cliff must scarcely have demanded more from bishop store of resolution stood on very verge chief secretion of mind be shadowy experiment so in explanation of why did not follow insensibly extreme vividness of sense of god nearness decreased still retained persuasion of reality of immediate listener waiting of need of satisfying on third day found mind still further changed no longer felt that god be in pall mall st james park whither resorted to walk muse felt now that god be somewhere about horizon

gone very red in face stiffened in guelphic manner whenever scrope be mentioned so rich harvest of spiritual life have remained untilled for month likeman have brought round seemed arguable that scrope owed explanation to likeman before came to open breach with establishment found likeman perceptibly older more shrivelled on account of war still a sweet lucid subtle a ever voice sounded more than ever like kind old woman sat buried in cushion for nowadays must save scrap of vitality for time contented with drawing out visitor story of course one doe not talk to likeman of vision intuition be disturbed find getting out of touch be bishop tone occasionally likeman nodded slowly a physician might do at recital of familiar symptom yes said have be through most of little different in inessential how clear be leave stupid old trinity a left long ago said old likeman with lean hand feeling clawing at arm of chair old man raised hand dropped go away from straight a line did take wing

agnostic be agnostic creed be expression of ourselves attitude relationship to unknown triune god be just form of need disposition have always assumed that took that for granted who have ever really seen heard felt god god be of sens of mind be of soul be realistic be materialistic voice expostulated bishop of princhester reflected vision of god be far off among memory now difficult to recall said at last believe there be god that be a real person a be not theological god set out before world personification said likeman in eighteenth century used to draw beautiful female figure a science mathematics young men have loved science freedom a pygmalion loved galatea have so if will have visible person for deity let keep up spirituality spirituality seems a thin a mist do really believe anything everything said likeman emphatically sitting up with transitory vigour everything two have ever professed together believe that creed of church do express can possibly be expressed in relationship of that made comprehensive gesture with twist of hand upon wrist to human soul believe that express a well a human mind can express where seem to be contradictory absurd be merely that mystery be paradoxical believe that story of fall of redemption be complete symbol that to add to to subtract from to alter be to diminish truth if seems incredible at point that then simply admit own mental defect believe in church scrope a embodied truth of religion divine instrument in human affair believe in security of tradition in complete entire soundness of teaching in essential authority divinity paused put head little on one side smiled sweetly now can say believe historical christ man jesus life may be metaphor why not yes believe bishop of princhester be staggered by complete acceptance see believe profess said remained for moment so rallying force vision if be vision put to be just single aspect of divinity said likeman make mistake in supposing heresy have truth in most heresy be only disproportionate apprehension of essential truth most heretic be men who have suddenly caught glimpse through veil of particular verity be dazzled by aspect rest have vanished be obsessed be obsessed clearly by discovery of militancy of god god son a hero want to go out to simple worship of one aspect want to go out to dissenter tent in wilderness instead of staying in great temple of age be that true for moment sounded true bishop of princhester sat frowning looking at very far away be vision now of golden captain who bade come then at thought bishop smiled great temple of age repeated do remember trouble have when little old queen be so pigheaded oh remember remember said likeman smiling with unshaken confidence why not for sixty year bishop in what call great temple of age be appointed bullied kept in place by pink irascible bit of dignity remember how at time did dare betray boiling indignation even to scarcely dared admit to myself paused doe matter at old likeman waved aside not at all confirmed waving again spoke of whole church of christ on earth went on thing victoria edward so on be temporary accident just a severance of anglican from roman communion greek orthodox communion be temporary accident will remark that wise men in age have be able to surmount difficulty of thing why because knew that in spite of split irregularity defacement

of god be a see now be be like trinity be like creed doe seem to be related to church then come question be going out for whither do go if do go out church remains alter doctrine not by changing word by shifting accent can under accentuate below threshold of consciousness can do where hell now eighty year ago warmed whole church be a atheist other put other day central heating of soul never mind that point now consider essential question question of breaking with church ask whither must go to become oddity dissenter negative self emasculated spirit that denies must just go out must just cease to serve religion must be must do anything church must go on everything else must go on only must be lost in outer wilderness then old likeman leant forward pointed bony finger stay in church modify

bishop likeman not decisive will weigh must weigh old man opened out fresh aspect of case argument be for delay for deliberation went on to wider set of consideration man who have held position of bishop for year be held no longer free man in matter of opinion have become official part of great edifice support faith of multitude of simple dependant believer have no right to indulge recklessly in intellectual moral integrity may understand how be flock to understand may get own soul clear what will happen to will just break away support astonish puzzle distress deprive of confidence convince of nothing intellectual egotism may be a grave sin said bishop likeman a physical selfishness assuming even that be absolutely right said bishop likeman be still rather in position of man who insists upon swedish exercise strengthening dietary on raft think have made out case for delay said hearer three month bishop of princhester conceded three month including sort of service because after even supposing be damnable to repeat prayer creed believe in administer sacrament think superstition nobody can be damned on other hand if express doubt be not yet perfectly digested experiment with soul of others bishop found much to ponder in old friend counsel be discursive many fronted whenever seemed to be penetrating defeating particular consideration under examination others in background have way of appearing invincible have strong persuasion that likeman be wrong unanswerable true god now be more than memory of very vividly realized idea be clear to bishop that be no longer churchman in generally accepted sense of word christian that be bound to come out of church sense of urgency have gone be matter demanding deliberation very great consideration for others took

bishop looked up saw lady ella expression lady ella be sitting up very stiffly listening not looking round vague horror passionate desire to prevent entry of lady sunderbund at cost seized upon bishop must felt be last overwhelming complication descended to base subterfuge lay back in chair slowly a though unfolded covered eye with hand then groaned aloud leave alone cried in voice of agony leave alone can see one can no more there be momentous silence then tumult of lady sunderbund receded chapter eighth new world night bishop have temperature of hundred half doctor pronounced to be in state of intense mental excitement aggravated by drug be doctor modern clear minded enough to admit that must not identify drug overruled one overruled bishop declaration that have done with church that must never mock god with episcopal ministration again that must proceed at once with resignation think of thing said doctor banish from mind until temperature be down to ninety eight then after rest may go into lady ella insisted upon keeping room be with difficulty that got to admit whippham whippham be exasperatingly in order need not trouble about anything now lord said everything will keep until be ready to attend to be well be through with easter bishop buncombe of eastern blowdesia be coming here anyhow there be canon bliss there be only two ordination candidate because of war will

doubtful about zeppelin thrice have be right over hunstanton already came in by easy landmark of wash will interest said eleanor who knew father better one warm still sunny afternoon bishop found looking out upon water of wash sat where highest pebble layer of beach reached up to little cliff of sandy earth perhaps foot high looked upon sand sea sky saw that be beautiful be little black gaitered object in scene of most exquisite delicate colour right left of stretched low grey salted shore pale bank of marly earth surmounted by green grey wiry grass held be half buried in fine blown sand above heaven made complete hemisphere of blue in series of remote cumulus cloud floated dissolved before spread long level of sand far away at utmost ebb be sea eleanor have gone to explore black rib of wrecked fishing boat lay at edge of willow lagoon be little pink footed figure very bright apparently transparent have reverted for time to shameless childishness have hidden stocking among reed of bank be running to fro from star fish to razor shell from cockle to weed shingle be pale drab purple close at hand to westward towards sand became brown purple be presently broken up into endless skerries of low flat weed covered boulder little intensely blue pool sea be band of sapphire became silver to west met silver shining sand in one delicate breathing edge of intensely white foam remote to west very small black clear against afternoon sky be cart about be score so of mussel gatherer little nearer on apparently empty stretch of shining wet sand multitude of gull be mysteriously busy two group of activity eleanor flitting translucent movement did set off emphasize immense soothing tranquillity for long time bishop sat passively receptive to healing beauty then little flow of thought began gathered in mind have come out to think over two letter that have brought with drew now rather reluctantly from pocket after long pause over envelope began to read reread likeman letter first likeman must not forgive dear scrope wrote explanation explains nothing sensational declaration of infidelity to mother church made under most damning distressing circumstance in presence of young tender mind entrusted to ministration in defiance of honourable engagement implied in confirmation service confirms worst apprehension of weakness of character have always felt touch of theatricality in temperament peculiar craving to be pseudo deeper pseudo simpler than need of personal excitement know that be never quite contented to believe in god at second hand wanted to be taken notice of personally except for few hint to have never breathed word of doubt to human being have always hoped that ripening come with year experience must give increasing strength against danger of emotionalism against strong deep quiet sense of exceptional personal importance bishop read thus far then sat reflecting be just have many weakness have egotism be justice of case old man bitterly disappointed be endeavouring to wound scrope asked whether be to blame for disappointment be more difficult question dismissed charge at last crumpled up letter in hand after moment hesitation flung away remained acutely sorry not so much for a for revelation of likeman letter made have have great affection for likeman suddenly be turned into wound second letter be from lady sunderbund be altogether more remarkable document lady sunderbund wrote on notepaper be evidently result of perverse research wrote letter far more coherent than speech without curious falling away of r that flavoured even gravest observation with unjust faint aroma of absurdity wrote with thin pen in rounded boyish handwriting italicized with slash of pen held letter in hand between knee considered now with expression brought eyebrow forward until almost met that tucked in corner of mouth dear bishop began keep thinking thinking thinking of wonderful service of wonderful wonderful

faith together will fade before whether will take lifetime hundred lifetime thousand lifetime norah smiled left sentence unfinished smiled back at to show understood then confessed further because did not want to seem merely sentimentally hopeful when be in cathedral norah just before service seemed to be very real seemed that perhaps kingdom of god be nearer than suppose that need faith courage of

not blind to sordid consequence same god have to be served first have to come to felt must not serve god longer a bishop in established church because did not believe that established church be serving god struggled against conviction struggled against largely for sake have to obey conviction have talked to about thing a much a must have done partly at least be due to fact that own mind have be changing reconsidering going forward going back in fluid state did seem fair to tell thing might presently find mistaken now begin to feel have really thought out thing that be definite enough to tell paused resumed number of thing have helped to change opinion in grew up in have grown up there be worry at princhester did let know much about there be there be something harsh cruel in

temporary dip into dinginess be there be plan at time seemed right reasonable plan for setting up chapel in very plain simple undenominational chapel for simple preaching of world kingdom of god there be one who seemed prepared to meet immediate demand for chapel be lady sunderbund asked clementina scrope be pulled up abruptly yes said seemed at first quite hopeful project 'd have hated said clementina with glance a if for assent at mother must have hated that anyhow have fallen through mind said clementina daphne echoed word see that there be necessity to import note of hostility to lady sunderbund into matter addressed rather more definitely to lady ella be woman of very extraordinary character highly emotional energetic generous to extraordinary extent daphne made little noise like comment faint acerbity in father voice responded anyhow make mistake if think that personality of lady sunderbund have very much to do with thing now quality may have brought out certain aspect of situation rather more sharply than might have be brought out under other circumstance if chapel enterprise have be suggested by quite different sort of person by man by committee in end think must have come to same conclusion leave lady sunderbund out chapel be impossible be just specialization have be trouble with religion be just tendency to make business of special sort of man in special sort of building on special day man building day belongs equally to god be conviction think that only possible existing sort of religion meeting be something after fashion of quaker meeting in there be professional religious man at not trace of sacrifice to ancient god room for professional religion man felt argument did little escape snatched be what want to make clear to god be not speciality

deteriorated towards personal issue phoebe broke awkwardness by jumping up coming to father dear daddy said kissed did understand properly said clementina in tone of one who explains away much that have never be spoken daddy said miriam with inspiration may play something to presently fire interjected lady ella disposing of idea want to know of faith have said daphne have remained seated at table be never to go to church again asked a if at loss scrope went back into little study felt shy awkward with daughter now felt must be difficult to get back to usualness with to night must be impossible to morrow must come down to breakfast a though talk have never occurred in rehearsal of deliverance during walk home have spoken much more plainly of sense of coming of god to rule world
