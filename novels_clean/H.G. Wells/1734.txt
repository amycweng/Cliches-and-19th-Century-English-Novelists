never wholehearted simple about sexual thing sir richmond resumed presently never think man be be too much plastered up thing too much creature of tortuous complicated evolution dr martineau under green umbrella nodded conceded agreement what will call dream of woman grew up in mind a grew up a something independent of much more important than reality of woman came only very slowly into relation with girl on dymchurch beach be one of first link ceased very speedily to be real joined woman of dreamland at last altogether became sort of legendary incarnation thought of dream woman not only a something beautiful a something exceedingly kind helpful girl woman met belonged to different creation sir richmond stopped abruptly rowed few long stroke dr martineau sought information suppose said there be sensuous element in dreaming certainly very strong one did dominate be very powerful undertow be there tendency in imaginative stuff to concentrate to group about single figure sort of thing that victorian must have called ideal not bit of said sir richmond with conviction there be always tremendous lot of variety in mind in fact thing liked least in real world be way be obsessed by idea of pairing off with one particular set final person liked to dream of blonde goddess in own venusberg one day next must be off over mountain with armed brunhild have little thought of

kept related gave dignity certainly be baby be very interesting very interesting from scientific point of view priori be not what one might have expected reasoning from idea that instinct natural imagination be adapted to biological end seeing that sex be essentially method of procreation one might reasonably expect convergence if not complete concentration upon idea of offspring be almost a if there be other end to be served be clear that nature have not worked impulse out to sight of end have not perhaps troubled to do so instinct of male for female be primarily for offspring not even in most intelligent farseeing type desire just point to glowing satisfaction illusion quite equally think desire of female for male ignores end nature have set about business in cheap sort of way be like pushful advertising tradesman be frank with just humbug into what want with very well in early stone age when poor dear thing never realized that mutual endearment meant trouble responsibility of parentage now shook head sideways twirled green umbrella like animated halo around large broad minded face sir richmond considered desire have never be chief incentive of relation with woman never so

boyhood youth early manhood be shocked ashamed at own disappointment thought mean base nevertheless orderly household into have placed life almost methodical connubialities broke off in mid sentence dr martineau shook head disapprovingly said be fair to wife be shockingly unfair have always realized that have done must to make thing up to heaven know what counter disappointment have concealed be good arguing about right wrong now be not apology for life be telling what happened not for to judge said dr martineau go on by marrying have got nothing that soul craved for have satisfied none most

beneath black smoke of hair now in slim form seen against sky often cared nothing for woman made love to cared for thing seemed to be hiding from sir richmond voice altered see what possible good can do to talk over thing began to row rowed perhaps score of stroke then stopped boat drove on with whisper of water at bow over outstretched oar blade what muddle mockery whole thing be cried what

justifies effort restores energy be hidden in woman access of sex said dr martineau be phase be how be made said sir richmond brief silence fell upon dr martineau persisted be how be made be getting to something in be insist mood of how be made distinctive indicative mood sir richmond went on almost a if soliloquized must go through again there be time when love of woman seems only real thing in world to always remains most real thing know how far may be normal man how far may not be so to speak abnormally male to life have very little personal significance value power until have woman a

in water shadowed face smiling quietly under sunshade with little faint streak of sunlight reflected from ripple dancing quivering across be one of people who seem always to be happy to radiate happiness by ordinary standard said sir richmond be thoroughly bad lot have about a much morality in narrower sense of word a monkey yet stand out in mind a one of most honest woman have ever met be certainly one of kindest part of effect of honesty may have be due to open brow candid blue eye smiling frankness of manner be really honest drifted here a be doing now pulled at sweet rush crushed in hand add remembered brightness to afternoon honest friendly of woman have known woman who be here with came nearest to being friend know what call virtue in woman be tremendous handicap to real friendliness with man until get to age when virtue fidelity be no longer urgent practical concern good woman by very definition of feminine goodness be truly over vast extent of being be reserved suppresses vast amount of being hold back denies hide on other hand there be frankness honesty in openly bad woman arising out of admitted fact that be bad that hide treasure from have peculiarly precious delicious secret to keep poverty to conceal intellectually seem to be more manly vigorous because be a people say unsexed many old woman thoroughly respectable old woman have same quality because have gone out of personal sex business have found have never said doctor known what call openly bad woman at least at intimately sir richmond looked with quick curiosity at companion have avoided attract repel for said doctor for friendliness woman must be modest habit of thought be old fashioned suppose mere suggestion about woman that there be barrier reservation that in fashion might more than meet half way facial expression completed sentence now wonder whispered sir richmond hesitated for moment before carried great research into explorer country be afraid of woman said with smile to mitigate impertinence respect element of fear well be afraid of then put that way if like anyhow let go with have never let go lose something lose reality of insight there be thoughtful interval having found so excellent friend said doctor why did ever part from sir richmond seemed indisposed to answer dr martineau face remained slantingly interrogative have found effective counterattack meant to press be jealous of sir richmond admitted must stand side of section after meditative silence doctor became briskly professional again care for wife said care very much for wife be a say great obligation be man to respect obligation grasp that then tell of woman who have come gone about too be perfectly frank there remains someone else sir richmond stared at physician well said laughed did pretend to have made autobiography anything more than sketch there be special person current person have dilated on present situation admit from little thing have dropped from must say there be child said sir richmond after brief pause be good guess not older than three two year half lady who be guess young be separated at rate ca go to leaf at loose end because for time for two three year at least have ceased to be how will put emotional wanderer begin to respect psychoanalysis hence overwhelming sense of necessity of feminine companionship for weary men guess be very jolly companion to be with amusing restful interesting h be said sir richmond think be fair description when care be when be in good form be at present hazarded doctor exploded mine of long pent exasperation be clumsiest hand at keeping well have ever known health be woman primary duty be incapable of most elementary precaution be maddeningly receptive to infection at present moment when be ill when be in urgent need of help happiness have let that wretched child get measles wo let go near because have got something disfiguring something nobody else must ever have think of having called carbuncle carbuncle be very painful said dr martineau doubt be said sir richmond doubt be voice grew bitter spoke with deliberation perfectly aimless useless illness a painful a can be spoke a if slammed door viciously indeed have slammed door doctor realized that for present there be more self dissection to be got from sir richmond for time sir richmond have be keeping boat close up to foaming weir to left of lock by occasional stroke now with general air of departure swung boat round began to row down stream towards bridge radiant hotel time have tea said section after tea dr martineau left sir richmond in chair upon lawn brooding darkly apparently over crime of carbuncle doctor went to room ostensibly to write couple of letter put on dinner jacket really to make few note of afternoon conversation meditate over impression while be fresh room proffered comfortable armchair into sank number of very discrepant thing be busy in mind have experienced disconcerting personal attack there be whirl of active resentment in confusion apologetics of rake tried presently common type stripped of intellectual dressing third manufacturer from midland north have such undertow of 'affairs physiological uneasiness imaginative laxity temptation of trip to london weakness masquerading a psychological necessity lady of carbuncle seems to have got rather hold upon have kept in order for three four year doctor scrutinized own remark with judicious expression be not being fair ruffled even if be true a said that third manufacturer from midland be in much same case a be that doe not dismiss case make more important one much more important make type case with exceptional quality of being expressive almost too selfexpressive sir richmond doe after make out sort of case for valid case doctor sat deep in chair frowning judicially with finger of one hand apposed to finger of other make bristle because life idea challenge way of living if eliminate personal element pulled sheet of note paper towards began to jot down note with silver cased pencil soon discontinued writing sat tapping pencil case on table amazing selfishness of attitude think once not once have judged woman except a contributor to energy peace of mind except in case of wife for habit of respect be formed before idea developed that think explains what be phrase about unfortunate young woman with carbuncle 'totally useless unnecessary illness ' be now have man right by standard to use woman a man have used by standard doctor frowned nodded head slowly with corner of mouth drawn in for year now intellectual reverie have be playing increasing part in good doctor life be writing book of writing very deliberately laboriously psychology of new age much more be dreaming thinking about book publication be to mark epoch in human thought human affair generally create considerable flutter of astonishment in doctor own little world be to bring home to people various aspect of one very startling proposition that human society have arrived at phase when complete restatement of fundamental idea have become urgently necessary phase when slow inadequate partial adjustment to two century of changing condition have to give place to rapid reconstruction of new fundamental idea be fact of great value in drama of secret dream that directive force towards fundamentally reconstructed world must be pen of unassuming harley street physician hitherto not suspected of great excess of enterprise written portion of book be already in highly polished state combined limitless freedom of proposal with smooth urbanity of manner tacit denial that thought of one intelligent being must possibly be shocking to upon doctor be very insistent conduct held must never be sufficiently discreet thought must never be sufficiently free a citizen one have to treat law institution a thing a rigidly right a natural law that social well being demand a scientific man in one stated thought in public discussion case be altogether different there be offence in possible hypothesis in contemplation of possibility just a when one played game one be bound to play in unquestioning obedience to law spirit of game if one be not playing that game then there be reason why one must not contemplate completest reversal of method alteration abandonment of rule correctness of conduct doctor held be imperative concomitant of really free thinking revolutionary speculation be one of thing must be divorced absolutely from revolutionary conduct be to neglect of obvious principle a doctor considered that general muddle in contemporary marital affair be very largely due left divorce law revision to exposed adulterer marriage reform to hot adolescent craving spinster driven by fury within to assertion that established nothing to practical demonstration that only left everybody thoroughly uncomfortable far better to leave matter to calm patient men in easy chair weighing typical case impartially ready to condone indisposed to envy in return for restraint on part of eager adventurous calm patient man be prepared in thought to fly high go far without giving guarantee of course that might not ultimately return to comfortable point of inaction from started in sir richmond dr martineau found most interesting encouraging confirmation of fundamental idea of psychology of new age immediate need of new criterion of conduct altogether here be man whose life be evidently ruled by standard be at once very high very generous be overworking to pitch of extreme distress apparently be doing for end be essentially unselfish manifestly there be many thing that ordinary industrial political magnate must do sir richmond must not dream of doing number of thing man must not feel called upon to do that must regard a imperative duty mixed up with so much fine intention fine conduct be disreputable streak of intrigue extraordinary claim that such misconduct be necessary to continued vigour of action to energy of thought be not necessary said dr martineau considered for time yet certainly be not man of action admit make few decision chapter of psychology of new age dealing with woman be still undrafted have already greatly exercised doctor mind found now that case of sir richmond have stirred imagination sat with hand apposed head on one side expression of great intellectual contentment on face while emancipated idea gave sort of gala performance in mind good doctor did not dislike woman have always guarded very carefully against misogyny be very strongly disposed to regard a much le necessary in existing scheme of thing than be generally assumed woman conceded have laid foundation of social life through contrivance sacrifice patience fierce lonely patriarchal family herd of male woman off spring have grown into clan tribe woven tissue of related family constitute human comity have be woven by subtle persistent protection of son daughter by mother against intolerant jealous possessive old man be thing of remote past little be left of ancient struggle now few infantile dream nightmare greater human community human society be made for good being made have taken over ancient task of woman one by one until now in modern form cherished more sedulously than did educated housed comforted clothed served nursed leaving wife privileged honoured protected for sake of task no longer did of burthen no longer bore progress have trivialized woman said doctor made note of word for later consideration woman have trivialized civilization doctor tried have retained effect of being central still make social atmosphere raise men instinctive hope of help direction except doctor stipulated for few highly developed modern type most men found sense of achieving necessary condition for sustained exertion there be direction in more spends said doctor just spends spends excitingly competitively for own pride glory drive energy of men over weir of gain what be to do with creature whispered doctor apart from procreative necessity be woman unavoidable evil doctor untrammelled thought began to climb high spin nose dive loop loop nowadays took proper care of young have need for high birth rate quite small proportion of woman with gift in direction must supply offspring that world wanted given power of determining sex that science be slowly winning today why must have so many woman about drastic elimination of creature must be quite practicable fantastic world to vulgar imagination doubt to calmly reasonable mind by mean fantastic be where case of sir richmond became so interesting be really true that companionship of woman be necessary to energetic creative type be fact that drive of life towards action a distinguished from contemplation arose out of sex needed to be refreshed by reiteration of motive be plausible proposition marched with doctor idea of natural selection of condition of survival have made what be be in tune with freudian analysis sex not only renewal of life in specie noted doctor silver pencil sex may be also renewal of energy in individual after musing crossed out sex wrote above sexual love be practically what claim dr martineau said in case want completest revision of standard of sexual obligation want new system of restriction imperative altogether be fixed idea of doctor that woman be quite incapable of producing idea in same way that men do believed that with suitable encouragement must be induced to respond quite generously to such idea suppose therefore really educated imagination of woman suppose turned indubitable capacity for service towards social political creativeness not in order to make rival of men in field moral actual helper man of sort want mistress mother said doctor want sort of woman who care more for work honour than doe for child home clothes personal pride be there such woman can there be such woman work need to be very fine to deserve help admitting fineness alternative seems to be to teach sex to get along without other neutralized world separated world how must jostle in street early christian have tried already thing be impossible very well then have to make woman more responsible again in new capacity have to educate far more seriously a source of energy a guardian helper of men have to suppress far more rigorously a tempter dissipaters instead of mothering baby have to mother race vision of woman made responsible floated before eye be that man working better since got hold of if not why not again jane smith be charged with neglecting lover to common danger inspector said man be in pitiful state morally quite uncombed infested with vulgar showy idea doctor laughed telescoped pencil stood up section became evident after dinner that sir richmond also have be thinking over afternoon conversation dr martineau sat in wide armed cane chair on lawn with wickerwork table bearing coffee cup little glass between few other diner chatted whispered about similar table not too close to talker to disturb dining room behind have cleared table depressed illumination moon in first quarter hung above sunset sank after twilight shone brighter brighter among western tree presently have gone leaving sky to increasing multitude of star maidenhead river wearing dusky blue drapery jewel of light have recovered magic sir richmond have stripped from in afternoon grave arch of bridge made complete circle by reflexion of water sustained a if by unifying justifying reason erratic flat flash streak glare of traffic fretted to fro overhead voice sang intermittently banjo tinkled remotely enough to be indistinct agreeable after sir richmond began abruptly search for sort of sexual modus vivendi be only mean to end one doe not want to live for sex only through sex main thing in life have always be work afternoon under maidenhead influence talked too much of sex babbled of thing one doe usually be very illuminating said doctor doubt temporary phase be defective bearing talk just now happen to be irritated darkness concealed faint smile on doctor face work be thing said sir richmond so long a one can keep one grip on said doctor after pause leaning back sending wreath of smoke up towards star dusted zenith what be idea of work mean how do see in relation to thing generally put in most general term put in most general term wonder if can put in general term for at be hard to put something one be always thinking about in general term to think of a whole now fuel suppose be father business interest pushed towards specialization in fuel wanted to have thoroughly scientific training in day when scientific training be le easy to get for boy than be today much more inspiring when got mind be framed so to speak in geology astronomical physic grew up to think on scale just a man who have be trained in history law grows to think on scale of roman empire know what pocket map of universe be map mean by judge sort of other general idea to planet be little ball of oxide nickel steel life sort of tarnish on surface minutest particle in tarnish who can nevertheless in unaccountable way take in idea of universe a one whole who begin to dream of taking control of be not bad statement of scientific point of view suppose have much same general idea of world on rather more psychological line think suppose said sir richmond of life a something be only just beginning to be aware of what be what might be exactly said doctor good went on eagerly be precisely how see be just particle in tarnish a call who be becoming dimly awake to what be to what have in common only very few of have got a far even a others here for example indicated rest of maidenhead by movement desire mutual flattery egotistical dream greedy solicitude fill up have begun to get out of suppose have doubted sir richmond have doctor have doubt lay back in chair with hand behind head smoke ascending vertically to heaven with greatest contentment began quoting getting out of one individuality conscious getting out of one individuality be one of most important interesting aspect of psychology of new age be now dawning a compared with previous age unconsciously of course true artist philosopher scientific investigator so far a art thought went have always got out of have forgotten personal interest become man thinking for whole race intimation of same thing have be at heart of most religion now people be beginning to get detachment without distinctively religious feeling distinctive aesthetic intellectual impulse a if be plain matter of fact plain matter of fact that be only incidentally ourselves that really one of be also whole specie be really indeed life part of integral part a sight be part of man with absolute separation from rest no more than separation of imagination whole so far a distinctive quality go know how take shape in mind sir richmond to idea of actually being life upon world special phase of dependent upon connected with other phase of being one of small growing number of people who apprehend want to live in spirit of be quite central be fundamental idea small growing minority constitute that part of life know will try to rule destiny new realization new psychology arising out of be fact of supreme importance in history of life be like appearance of self consciousness in creature have not hitherto have self consciousness so far a be concerned be true kingship of world necessarily who know be true kingi wonder how appeal to be stuff have thought out very slowly carefully written approved be very core of life yet when one come to say thing to someone else face to face be much more difficult to say than to write sir richmond noted how doctor chair creaked a rolled to fro with uneasiness of intimate utterance agree said sir richmond presently one doe think in fashion something in fashion what one call one work doe belong to something much bigger than something much bigger expanded something become doctor urged in so far a work take hold of sir richmond made answer to for little while of course trail certain egotism into work said must do otherwise have ceased to be purely egotism be no longer ' be be part ' one want to be honourable part think of man upon planet doctor pursued think of life rather a mind try over in million million of trial work out to same thing think in term of fuel said sir richmond be still debating doctor generalization suppose must be true to say that think of a mankind on planet with very considerable possibility with only limited amount of fuel at disposal to achieve yes agree that think in way have not thought much before of way in think about thing agree that be in way enterprise mankind attempt be limited by sum total of store of fuel upon planet be very much in mind besides that have nothing annual allowance of energy from sun thought that presently be to get unlimited energy from atom said doctor believe in a thing immediately practicable doubt getting supply of energy from atom be theoretical possibility just a flying be in time of daedalus probably there be actual attempt at sort of glider in ancient crete before get to actual utilization of atomic energy there will be ten thousand difficult corner to turn may have to wait three four thousand year for can not count on have in hand there may be impasse have surely be coal oil there be surplus of wood now only annual growth water power be income also doled out day by day can not anticipate coal oil be only capital be have for great important effort be gift to mankind to use to supreme end to waste in triviality coal be key to metallurgy oil to transit when be done will either have built up such fabric of apparatus knowledge social organization that will be able to manage without will have travelled long way down slope of waste towards extinction to day in getting in distribution in use waste enormouslyas sit here world be wasting fuel fantastically just a mentally educationally waste doctor interjected job be to stop what can of waste to do what can to organize first of sane fuel getting then sane fuel using that second proposition carry far into whole use be making of life first thing first said sir richmond if set about getting fuel sanely if do a deliberate co operative act of whole specie then follows that will look very closely into use be being made of when fuel getting be brought into one view a common interest then follows that fuel burning will be brought into one view at present be getting fuel in kind of scramble with general aim waste lose almost a much a get of what get waste be idiotic wo trouble said sir richmond with long discourse on way of getting fuel in country land a know be owned in patch stretch be determined in first place chiefly by agricultural necessity when be divided up among present owner nobody be thinking about mineral beneath lawyer settled long ago that landowner owned land right down to centre of earth so have superficial landlord a coal owner trying to work coal according to superficial division quite irrespective of lie of coal underneath man go for coal under own land in own fashion get three shaft where one must suffice none of in best possible place get coal coming out of point when must be far more convenient to bring out at mile away get boundary wall of coal between estate abandoned left in ground for ever coal owner sell coal in own pettifogging manner know of thing know too how trail coal over country spoiling a trail until at last get into silly coal scuttle beside silly wasteful airpoisoning fog creating fireplace stuff said sir richmond bringing hand down so smartly on table that startled coffee cup cried out upon tray be given to men to give power over metal to get knowledge with to get more power with oil story suppose be a bad oil story be worse there be sort of cant said sir richmond in fierce parenthesis that supply of oil be inexhaustible that can muddle about with oil anyhow optimism of knave imbecile want to be pulled up by sane consideration for moment kept silence a if in unspeakable commination here be with clearness of vision only gift not very clever with natural bad temper strong sexual bias doing what can to get broader handling of fuel question a common interest for mankind find up against lot of men subtle men sharp men obstinate men prejudiced men able to get round able to get over able to blockade clever men yes of ultimately damned oh utterly damned fool coal owner who think only of solicitor who think backwards politician who think like game of cat cradle not gleam of generosity not gleam what particularly be working for asked doctor want to get whole business of world fuel discussed reported upon a one affair so day may be handled a one affair in general interest world did say meant empire no world be one system now ca work in bit want to call in foreign representative from beginning advisory consultative with power thing interlock now internationally through labour finance sooner scrap nonsense about autonomous british empire complete in contra mundum better for world control be fifty year overdue hence disorder still be rather difficult proposition a thing be oh lord know be difficult cried sir richmond in tone of one who swears know that perhaps be impossible be only way to do therefore say let try to get done everybody say difficult difficult nobody lift finger to try only real difficulty be that everybody for one reason say that be difficult be against human nature granted decent thing be be socialism who care along line of comprehensive scientific control world have to go will retrogress will muddle rot agree said dr martineau so want report to admit distinctly want to go further than want to get beginning germ of world administration want to set up permanent world commission of scientific men economist with power just a considerable power a can give will be feeble power at best still sort of say in whole fuel supply of world say may grow at last to control right to collect report receive account for example to begin with then right to make recommendation see international part be not most difficult part of beastly owner beastly lawyer wo relinquish scrap of what call freedom of action labour men because be fairly big coal owner sit watch suspect too stupid to grasp what be driving at too incompetent to get out scheme of own want world control on scientific line even le than owner try to think that fuel production can carry unlimited wage bill owner try to think that can pay unlimited profit when say business be something more than scramble for profit wage be service common interest stare at sir richmond be at loss for image like committee in thief kitchen when someone have casually mentioned law will ever get permanent commission can be done if can stick out with whole committee against curious thing be that whole committee be against individual be sir richmond found difficult to express psychology of committee ought to interest be probably fair sample of way sort of thing be going nowadays be curious there be not man on committee who be quite comfortable within about particular individual end be there to serve be there get pursue own end bitterly obstinately admit be bitter obstinate because pursue against internal opposition

doctor earnestly doctor controlled strong desire to laugh suppose young lady began oh put in suffering right have doubt about suppose sir richmond went on now have told so much of affair may a well tell all be sort of comedy painful comedy of irrelevant affection doctor be prepared to be good listener fact must always listen to be only when people told theory that must interrupt with exactly young woman be person of considerable genius know if have seen in illustrated paper peculiar sort of humorous illustration usually with considerable amount of bite in over name of martin leeds extremely amusing stuff be that martin leeds met at beginning of career talk almost a well a draw amused immensely be not sort of man who waylays besieges woman girl be not pursuing type perceived that in odd way attracted be wise enough generous enough not to let thing develop h be said dr martineau never have to do with intellectually brilliant woman before see now that more imaginative force woman have more likely be to get into state of extreme self abandonment with male thing upon imagination begin to crystallize before came along 'd mixed chiefly with lot of young artist student doing nothing at except talk about thing be going to do suppose profited by contrast being older with hand full of affair perhaps something have happened that have made recoil towards sort of thing know

trouble to adjust to peculiarity of position must be cleverer other woman be cleverer other woman almost must be cleverer than be if be cleverer must be genius be must just be other woman perhaps must said sir richmond darkly desperately perhaps must perhaps must be better if be dr martineau raised eyebrow in furtive aside here see that be that in case fundamental incompatibility between one affection one wider conception of duty work come in can not change social institution in year lifetime can never change to suit individual case must be like suspending law of gravitation in order to move piano a thing be martin be good to help to be rival to duty feel that be hostile to duty definite antagonism have developed feel treat fuel everything to do with fuel a bore be attack quarrel on

there will be trouble about educating girl happens must have a good chance a anyone ah be worrying too frightfully at time if be boy must be easier need constant tact dexterity to fix thing up of have need attention sir richmond mused darkly dr martineau thought aloud incompetent delightful person with martin leeds sense of humour power of expression must be attractive to many people must probably do without if once parted sir richmond turned on eagerly think ought to part from on account on account might pain once thing be done want to part believe ought to part well then affection come in extraordinary tenderness of yours be afraid of what anyone might get hold of if let down have tithe of ordinary coolheaded calculation of average woman have duty to genius have got to take care of to doctor made reply nevertheless idea of parting have be very much in mind lately letting go free can put in way if like might not be fatal operation for of yet there be mood when parting be intolerable idea when one be invaded by flood of affection old habit of association dr martineau thought be that right word affection perhaps be have come out on towing path close by lock found threading way through little crowd of boating people looker on for time conversation be broken sir richmond resumed be where cease to be man on planet rest of be where idea of definite task fanatically followed to exclusion of minor consideration break down when work be good when be sure be right then may carry off thing with high hand work be always good be always sure blunder make muddle be fatigued then sacrificed affection come in a accuser then be that want to be reassured then be that miss martin leeds doe sir richmond snapped came long pause yet be extraordinarily difficult to think of parting from martin section in evening after dinner dr martineau sought rather unsuccessfully to go on with analysis of sir richmond sir richmond be evidently creature of mood regretted extent of confidence slight irrational irritation that felt at waiting for car affected attitude towards companion dr martineau tentatives be ill chosen at rate must not rise to conversational bait that doctor must devise doctor found more regrettable because seemed to that there be much to be worked upon in martin leeds affair be inclined to think that sir richmond be unduly obsessed by idea that have to stick together because of child because of look of thing so forth really might be struggling against very strong impulse indeed to break off affair seemed evident to doctor that jarred upon annoyed other extremely on whole separating people appealed to doctor mind more strongly than bringing together accordingly framed enquiry so a to make revelation of latent antipathy a easy a possible made several not very well devised beginning at fifth sir richmond be suddenly conclusive be use said ca fiddle about more with motif to day awkward silence followed on reflection sir richmond seemed to realize that sentence needed apology admit said that expedition have already be wonderfully good thing for confession have made look into sort of thing squarely be not used to talking about even thinking directly about what say afterwards find disconcerting to recall want to alter can feel wallowing into mess of modification qualification yes want rest anyhow there be nothing for dr martineau to say to that two gentleman smoked for time in slightly uncomfortable silence dr martineau cleared throat twice lit second cigar then agreed to admire bridge think well of maidenhead sir richmond communicated hopeful news about car be to arrive next morning before ten 'd just ring fellow up presently to make sure dr martineau retired early went rather thoughtfully to bed spate of sir richmond confidence be evident be over section sir richmond car arrived long before ten brought down by young man in state of scared alacrity sir richmond have done vigorous telephoning before turning in charmeuse set off in repaired chastened condition to town after leisurely breakfast two investigator into spring of human conduct be able to resume westward journey ran through scattered twyford with pleasant looking inn through commonplace urbanity of reading by newbury hungerford pretty bridge up long wooded slope to savernake forest where found road heavy dusty still in war time state so down steep hill to wide market street be marlborough lunched in marlborough went on in afternoon to silbury hill british pyramid largest artificial mound in europe left car by roadside clambered to top be very learned inconclusive about exact purpose of vast heap of chalk earth heap that men have made before temple at karnak be built babylon have name then returned to car ran round by winding road into wonder of avebury found clean little inn there kept by pleasant people garaged car in cowshed took two room for night that might better get atmosphere of ancient place wonderful indeed be vast circumvallation be already two thousand year old before dawn of british history great wall of earth with ditch most strangely on inner not on outer side within enclosure gigantic survivor of great circle of unhewn stone even a late a tudor day be almost complete whole village church pretty manor house have be built for most part out of ancient megalith great wall be sufficient to embrace with garden paddock four cross road meet at village centre there be drawing of avebury before thing arose there when be lonely wonder on plain for most part destruction be already done before mayflower sailed to southward stand cone of silbury hill shadow creep up down intervening meadow a season change around lonely place rise down now bare sheep pasture in broad undulation with wart like barrow here there from radiate creeping up to gain hold crest of hill abandoned trackways of forgotten world trackways green road of england road already disused when roman made highway past silbury hill to bath can still be traced for score of mile through land running to salisbury english channel eastward to crossing at strait westward to wale to ferry over severn southwestward into devon cornwall doctor sir richmond walked round wall surveyed shadow cast by silbury upon river flat strolled up down to northward to get general view of village have tea smoked round wall again in warm april sunset matter of conversation remained prehistoric be inclined to find fault with archaeological work have be done on place clumsy treasure hunting sir richmond said bore into silbury hill expect to find mummified chief something sensational of sort report nothing have sifted finely enough have thought subtly enough wall of earth ought to tell what people ate what clothes wore what wood used be sheep land then a be now cattle land be hill covered by forest know archaeologist know if do have told be just a bad believe know what trade came here along track so far a know have beast of burthen suppose one day someone be to find potsherd here from early knossos fragment of glass from pepi egypt place have stirred up imagination wrestled with ignorance a if thought that by talking might presently worry out picture of forgotten world without metal without beast of burthen without letter without sculpture have left trace yet with sense of astronomical fact clear enough to raise great gnomon of silbury with social system complex enough to give large orderly community to size of avebury witness traffic to green road testify doctor have not realized before boldness liveliness of companion mind sir richmond insisted that climate must have be moister milder in day covered downlands with wood a savernake be still covered beneath tree restored thicker richer soil people must have done enormous lot with wood use of stone here be freak be very strangeness of stone here that have made into sacred thing one thought too much of stone of stone age who must carve lump of quartzite when one must carve good oak beech most carvable wood especially when one sharpest chisel be flint be wood ought to look for said sir richmond wood fibre declared that people have tool of wood home of wood god perhaps record of wood peat bog here even few foot of clay might have pickled precious memoranda such luck now in glastonbury marsh one found life of early iron age half way to own time quite beautifully pickled though wrestled mightily with problem sir richmond doctor must throw gleam of light upon riddle why ditch be inside not outside great wall what be mind like in day said sir richmond that suppose be what interest vivid childish mind guess with not suspicion a yet that be man ruling planet anything of sort doctor pursed lip none delivered judicially if one be able to recall one childhood at age of about twelve thirteen when artistic impulse so often go into abeyance one begin to think in troubled monstrous way about god hell one might get something like mind of place thirteen put at already people think be religious intensely in personal way give death nightmare terror a for fading of artistic impulse have left not trace of painting drawing scratching of old stone people who came before adult with mind of thirteen year old child thirteen year old child with strength of adult one to slap tell not to after probably only thought of death now then never thought of fuel supposed there be end to so used up wood kept goat to nibble kill new undergrowth did people have goat know said doctor so little be known very like child must have be same unending day must have thought that world went on for ever just a knew like damned committee doe with fuel wasting away climate changing imperceptibly century by century king important men followed one here for century century have lost past have idea of future have forgotten how came into land when be child believed that father garden have be there for ever be very like trying to remember game one played when one be child be like coming on something that one built up with brick stone in forgotten part of garden life lived here said doctor have left trace in tradition in mental predisposition in still unanalyzed fundamental idea archaeology be very like remembering said sir richmond presently will remember lot more about will remember what be like to live in place long journey hither age by age out of south will remember sacrifice made crazy reason why made sowed corn in blood here have strange fancy about star brought with out of south where star be brighter what like be wooden god of ours remember must easily persuade have be here before stood on crest of ancient wall setting sun cast long shadow of athwart field of springing wheat perhaps will come here again doctor carried on sir richmond fancy after four thousand year so with different name fuller mind then suppose that ditch wo be riddle be now life did seem so complicated then sir richmond mused muddle be unconscious drifted from mood to mood forgot there be more sunshine then more laughter perhaps blacker despair despair like despair of child can weep to sleep be over be battle massacre ended that long afternoon here did wood catch fire exceptionally dry summer leaving black hill famine did strange men bring sickness measles perhaps black death be cattle pest did just waste wood dwindle away before new people came into land across southern sea ca remember sir richmond turned about must like to dig up bottom of ditch here foot by foot dry stuff sift very carefully then might begin to remember thing section in evening after pleasant supper took turn about wall with moon sinking over beyond silbury then went in sat by lamplight before brightly fussy wood fire smoked there be long interval of friendly silence in least want to go on talking about said sir richmond abruptly let rest then said doctor generously to day among ancient memory have taken out of wonderfully ca tell how good avebury have be for afternoon half consciousness have seemed to be tattooed creature wearing knife of stone healing touch of history for first time damned committee have mattered scarcely rap sir richmond stretched in chair blinked cheerfully at cigar smoke nevertheless said confessional business of yours have be excellent exercise have enabled to get outside to look at a case now can even see a remote case need bother about further so far a go think have done that there be to be done must say that quite yet said doctor think be subject for real psychoanalysis at be not overlaid sort of person when spread out there be not much indication of suppressed wish of anything masked buried of sort what get be quite open recognized discord of two set of motif doctor considered yes think be true libido be must say exceptionally free generally be doing what want to do overdoing in fact what want to do getting simply tired be theory started with be case of fatigue under irritating circumstance with very little mental complication concealment yes said doctor agree be not case for psychoanalysis strictly speaking at be in open conflict with upon moral social issue practically open problem be problem of conscious conduct a said of what renunciation have consciously to make sir richmond did not answer that pilgrimage of ours said presently have made for magnanimity day particularly have be good day when stood on old wall here in sunset seemed to be standing outside in immense still sphere of past future stood with foot upon stone age saw four thousand year away distress a very little incident in perspective away there in case be altogether different after three hour so of committee one concentrate into one little inflamed moment of personality there be past longer there be future there be only rankling dispute for three hour perhaps have be thinking of just what have to say just how have to say just how looked while said just how much be making understood how might be misunderstood how might be misrepresented challenged denied one draw in more more a one be used up at last one be reduced to little raw bleeding desperately fighting pin point of self one go back to one home unable to recover fighting over again night sometimes get up walk about room curse martineau how be one to get avebury frame of mind to westminster when westminster be a dead a avebury said doctor unhelpfully added after second milton knew of trouble without dust heat ' wrote great phrase dust choke said sir richmond took up copy of green road of england lay beside on table did not open held in hand said thing have have in mind to say evening think that will stir up motif more for time better to go on into west country cooling poor old brain in wide shadow of past can prescribe nothing better said dr martineau incidentally may be able to throw little more light on one two of minor entanglement want to think of said sir richmond let get right away from everything until skin have grown again chapter sixth encounter at stonehenge section next day in early afternoon after farewell walk over down round avebury went by way of devizes netheravon amesbury to stonehenge dr martineau have seen ancient monument before now with avebury fresh in mind found poorer thing than have remembered to be sir richmond be frankly disappointed after real greatness mystery of older place seemed poor little heap of stone did not even dominate landscape be way from crest of swelling down on stood be further dwarfed by colossal air ship hangar clustering office of air station that great war have called into existence upon slope to south west look sir richmond said a though old giantess have left discarded set of teeth on hillside far more impressive than stonehenge be barrow capped neighbouring crest sacred stone be fenced about visitor have to pay for admission at little kiosk by gate at side of road stood travel stained middle class automobile with miscellany of dusty luggage rug luncheon thing therein family automobile with father doubt at wheel sir richmond left own trim coupe at tail be impeded at entrance by difference of opinion between keeper of turnstile small resolute boy of perhaps five six who proposed to leave enclosure custodian thought that must be better if nurse mother came out with keep on looking at said small boy isunt anything want to go clean car wo see stonehenge day young man said custodian little piqued be only old beach said small boy with extreme conviction be rock like seaside there isunt sea man at turnstile mutely consulted doctor see that can get into harm here doctor advised small boy be released from archaeology strolled to family automobile produced en tout ca pocket handkerchief set to polish lamp with great assiduity two gentleman lingered at turnstile for moment so to watch proceeding modern child said sir richmond old stone be just old stone to motor car be god can hardly expect to understand at age said custodian jealous for honor of stonehenge reminds of martin little girl said sir richmond a dr martineau went on towards circle when encountered first dragon fly be greatly delighted 'oh dee ' lill ' a'eplane ' said a approached grey old stone became aware of certain agitation among voice authoritative bass voice be audible cry anthony nurse appeared remotely going in direction of aeroplane shed cry of master anthony came faintly on breeze extremely pretty young woman of five six twenty became visible standing on one of great prostrate stone in centre of place be black haired sun burnt individual stood with arm akimbo quite frankly amused at disappearance of master anthony offering sort of help for recovery on greensward before stood paterfamilias of family automobile be making trumpet with hand in order to repeat name of anthony with greater effect short lady in grey emerged from among encircling megalith one two other feminine personality produced effect of movement rather than of individuality a flitted among stone well said lady in grey with rising intonation of humorous conclusion be so distinctively american druid have got be hiding said automobilist in voice promised chastisement to hidden hearer be what be doing ought not to play trick like great boy who be almost six if be looking for small resolute boy of six said sir richmond addressing to lady on rock rather than to angry parent below be perfectly safe happy druid have got indeed have failed altogether to get betonehenge ' say 'be good ' so be gone back to clean lamp of car aa oo so be said papa winnie go tell price be gone back to car ought to have let out of enclosure excitement about master anthony collapsed rest of people in circle crystallized out into central space a two apparent sister apparent aunt nurse who be packed off at once to supervise lamp cleaning head of family found difficulty must seem in readjusting mind to comparative innocence of anthony sir richmond young lady on rock sought a if by common impulse to establish general conversation there be faint trace of excitement in manner a though there have be controversial passage between herself family gentleman be discussing age of old place said smiling in frankest friendliest way how old do think be father of anthony intervened also with shadow of controversy in manner be explaining to young lady that date from early bronze age before chronology existed insists on date nothing of bronze have ever be found here said sir richmond well when be early bronze age anyhow said young lady sir richmond sought recognizable datum bronze got to britain somewhere between time of moses solomon ah said young lady a who must say man at least talk sense ' stone be shaped said father of family be difficult to see how must have be done without something harder than stone see place said young lady on stone ca imagine how did up not one bit did up exclaimed father of family in tone of one accustomed to find gentle sport in intellectual frailty of womenkind be just bone of place hung thing round draped what thing asked sir richmond oh have thing all right skin perhaps mat of rush bast cloth fibre of sort wadded stuff stonehenge draped be really delightful idea said father of family enjoying be quite possible one said sir richmond may have used wicker young lady went on undismayed seemed to concede point wicker be likelier surely said father of family with expostulatory voice gesture of one who must recall erring wit to sanity be far more impressive standing out bare noble a doe in lonely splendour country may have be wooded then said sir richmond in case must have stood out doe stand out so very much even now came to through grove said young lady eagerly picking up idea probably beech said sir richmond may have pointed to midsummer sunrise said dr martineau unheeded be novel idea said father of family in reproving tone of one who never allows novel idea inside door if can prevent well said young lady guess there be sort of show here anyhow human being ever have show yet without trying to shut people out of in order to make come in guess be covered in right dark hunched old place in wood beech stem like pillar came to at night in procession beating drum scared half out of wit came in there went round inner circle with torch so be shown torch be put out priest did mystery until dawn broke be how worked even ca tell what show be vv said lady in grey who be standing now at dr martineau elbow something horrid said anthony younger sister to elder in stage whisper bluggy agreed anthony elder sister to younger in noiseless voice that certainly did not reach father squeal young lady who be addressed a vv be perhaps one two twenty dr martineau thought be not very good at feminine age have clear sun browned complexion with dark hair smiling lip feature be finely modelled with just added touch of breadth in brow softness in cheek bone faint flavour of amerindian one see at time in american woman voice be very soft pleasing voice spoke persuasively not assertively a so many american woman do determination to make dry bone of stonehenge live shamed doctor disappointment with place when have spoken dr martineau noted that looked at sir richmond a if expected at least to confirm vision sir richmond be evidently prepared to confirm with queer little twinge of infringed proprietorship doctor saw sir richmond step up on prostrate megalith stand beside better to appreciate point of view smiled down at now why do think came in there asked young lady be not very clear about direction did not know of roadway running to avon river of alleged race course to north have ever heard that stone be supposed to be of two different period of might possibly have be brought from very great distance section dr martineau father of family found imaginative reconstruction of stonehenge ritual quite so exciting a two principal father of family endured further particular with manifest impatience no longer able now that sir richmond be encouraging girl to keep in check with slightly derisive smile proper to sex then proclaimed in fine loud tenor be very imaginative be afraid to family time be pressing on turp must go o come phoebe a led little flock towards exit voice came floating back talking wanton nonsense professional archaeologist must laugh simply laugh passed out of world with faint intimation of dismay dr martineau realized that two talkative lady be not to be removed in family automobile with rest of party sir richmond younger lady went on very cheerfully to population agriculture housing general scenery of surrounding downland during later stone age shorter le attractive lady whose accent be distinctly american came now stood at doctor elbow seemed moved to play part of chorus to two

martineau ah great green bank there just coming into sight must be old sarum little ancient city faded away when salisbury lifted spire into world will stop here for little while then be that dr martineau be grim about stretching of leg section sudden prospect now opened out before sir richmond of talking about history suchlike topic with charming companion for perhaps two whole day instead of going on with tiresome shamefaced egotistical business of self examination be so attractive to that took immediate possession of mind to entire exclusion disregard of dr martineau possible objection to such modification of original programme when arrived in salisbury doctor did make slight effort to suggest different hotel from in two lady have engaged room on spur of moment in presence must produce sufficient reason for refusing accommodation old george have ready for be reduced to vague want to inflict must not get sir richmond aside for adequate expression of feeling about miss seyffert before four of be seated together at tea amidst mediaeval modernity of old george smoking room only then did begin to realize depth extent of engagement to sir richmond have committed be suggesting that run back to avebury to morrow said sir richmond lady be nearly missing thing took doctor breath away for moment must say nothing stared over tea cup dour faced objection formulated very slowly that dicky whispered whisper went unnoted sir richmond be talking of completeness of salisbury from very beginning have be cathedral city be essentially purely that church at best in full tide of mediaeval ascendancy have called into being be making extremely loose inaccurate generalization about building ruin age have left for posterity miss grammont be countering with equally unsatisfactory qualification age will leave ruin of hotel said sir richmond railway arch hotel bath aqueduct miss grammont compared rome of empire come nearest to a soon a tea be over dr martineau realized meant to walk round about salisbury foresaw that walk with utmost clearness in front keeping just little beyond range of intervention sir richmond must go with miss grammont miss seyffert must bring up rear if do muttered will be damned unusually strong expression for said asked miss seyffert have writing to do before post go said doctor brightly oh come see cathedral cried sir richmond with ill concealed dismay be if one may put in fashion not looking at miss seyffert in directest fashion when said be afraid said doctor mulishly impossible with unspoken addition of try for bit miss grammont stood up everybody stood up can go first to look for shop said there be thing want to buy belinda fountain pen little book can go together a far a while be shopping if must mind getting one two thing for became clear to dr martineau that sir richmond be to be let off belinda seemed abominably unjust be also clear to that must keep closely to own room might find miss seyffert drifting back alone to hotel eager to resume with well quiet time in room must not be disagreeable must think over note in reality thought over nothing little speech must presently make to sir richmond about unwarrantable absolutely unwarrantable alteration be being made without consent in common programme for long time sir richmond have met no one so interesting amusing a frank minded young woman from america young woman be how thought of did correspond to anything so prim restrained extensively reserved withheld a young lady though judged older than five twenty word girl with association of virginal ignorance invisible purdah trite idea newly discovered seemed even le appropriate for than word boy have air of having in obscure way graduated in life a if so far have lived several year of existence in distinctive conclusive manner with utmost mental profit particular tarnish injury must talk with a if talked with man like with zest man must give be evident that good thing have said at first came a natural expression of broad stream of alert thought be mere display specimen from one of jackdaw collection of bright thing so many clever woman waste wit in accumulating be not talking for effect at be talking because be tremendously interested in discovery of spectacle of history delighted to find person a possessed a be belinda having be conducted to shop two made way through bright evening sunlight to compact gracefulness of cathedral glimpse through wrought iron gate of delightful garden of spring flower alyssum aubrietia snow upon mountain daffodil narcissus like held for time then came out upon level grassy space surrounded by little ripe old house on cathedral stand stood for moment surveying be perfect little lady of cathedral said sir richmond why wonder did build memory ought to be better than mine said with half closed eye blinking up at sunlit spire sharp against blue have be away for so long over there forget altogether why did build have fallen in quite early with freak of speaking thinking a if be mankind be a if mind have be prepared for by own eager exploration in europe friend philosopher have said will not have that be really individual think be must talk to be very curious subtle thinker be just thought in mind of race say passing thought be what doe call man on planet taking control of life man woman have amended just a man on planet taking control of life have failed altogether to remember why ditch at avebury be on inside instead of outside of vallum so now miss grammont sir richmond found very great difficulty in recalling why have built salisbury cathedral built temple by habit tradition said sir richmond impulse be losing force looked up at spire then at with faintly quizzical expression have reply ready be beginning to feel power over matter be already very clever engineer what interested here be old religion more wanted to exercise display power over stone made into reed branch squirted up in spire pinnacle priest altar be just excuse do think people have ever feared worshipped in artist lark a did in stonehenge certainly remember that ever worshipped here said sir richmond be in love with idea spirit of gothic cathedral said be spirit of sky scraper be architecture in mood of flaming ambition freemason on building must hardly refrain from jeering at little priest have left down below there performing antiquated puerile mystery at altar be just excuse for doing sky scraper conceded early display of sky scraper spirit be doing best to make feel thoroughly at home be more at home here still than in new country of ours over atlantic seems to now that do begin to remember building cathedral other cathedral built in europe be fun of building made do h be said sky scraper still fun of building be thing envy most about america be still large enough mentally materially to build sort of thing over here site be frightfully crowded what do think be building now what do think be building over here what be building now believe have almost grown up believe be time began to build in earnest for good be building anything at new world show said be still only at foundation said sir richmond nothing show a yet wish must believe be foundation can doubt be scrapping old be too late in afternoon to go into cathedral so strolled to fro round about west end along path under tree towards river exchanging idea very frankly freely about thing have recently happened to world what thought ought to be doing in section after dinner four tourist sat late talked in corner of smoking room two lady have vanished hastily at first dinner gong reappeared at second mysteriously pleasantly changed from tweedy pedestrian to indoor company be quietly definitely dressed pretty alteration have happened to coiffure silver band deep red stone lit dusk of miss grammont hair necklace of same colouring kept peace between jolly sun burnt cheek soft untanned neck be evident recent uniform have included collar of great severity miss seyffert have revealed plump forearm proclaimed with clash of bangle dr martineau thought evening throat much too confidential conversation drifted from topic to topic have none of steady continuity of sir richmond duologue with miss grammont miss seyffert method be too discursive exclamatory broke thread appeared old george at salisbury be really old show miss seyffert laced entire evening with recognition of fact just look at old beam must cry suddenly to think be exactly where be before there be cabot in america miss grammont let companion pull talk about a chose after animation of afternoon sort of lazy contentment have taken possession of younger lady sat deep in basket chair spoke now then miss seyffert gave impression of france italy talked of cabman of naples beggar of amalfi apropos of beggar miss grammont from depth of chair threw out statement that italy be frightfully overpopulated in part of italy be like mite on cheese nobody seems to be living everyone be too busy keeping alive poor old woman carrying load big enough for mule said miss seyffert little child working like slave said miss grammont everybody begging even people at work by roadside who ought to be getting wage sufficient begging from foreigner be just sport in italy said sir richmond doe imply want agree that large part of italy be frightfully overpopulated whole world be think so martineau well yes for present social organization for social organization said sir richmond have doubt of said miss seyffert added amazingly be out for birth control time brief active pause ensued dr martineau in state of sudden distress attempted to drink out of cold empty coffee cup world swarm with cramped undeveloped life said sir richmond amount to nothing even represent happiness help to use up resource fuel surplus energy of world suppose have sort of liking for life miss grammont reflected doe that matter hing to carry life on be just vain repetition imperfect dreary blurred repetition of one common life that feel have be felt that do have be done better before because be crowded hurried underfed undereducated a for liking life need never have have chance how many people be there in world asked abruptly know twelve hundred fifteen hundred million perhaps in world 'd have two hundred fifty million let say at most must be quite enough for little planet for time at rate think so doctor know said dr martineau oddly enough have never thought about question before at least not from angle must pick out two hundred fifty million aristocrat began miss grammont native instinctive democracy need not be outraged said sir richmond two hundred fifty million must do 'd be able to develop fully of a thing be only minority can do that rest never get chance be what always say said miss seyffert new age said dr martineau new world may be coming to stage when population a much a fuel will be under world control if one thing why not other admit that movement of thought be away from haphazard towards control be for control time miss seyffert injected following up previous success admit doctor began broken sentence again with marked patience that movement of thought be away from haphazard towards control in thing generally be movement of event eternal problem of man said sir richmond can will prevail there came little pause miss grammont smiled enquiry at miss seyffert if be said belinda wish must imagine world said miss grammont rising of two hundred fifty million of fully developed human being with room to live breathe in need for war will live in palace will be healthy machine will wait on ca imagine perhaps will dream of dreaming self may be cleverer held out hand to sir richmond just for moment stood hand in hand appreciatively well said dr martineau a door closed behind two american be curious encounter that young woman have brain said sir richmond standing before fireplace there be doubt young woman meant dr martineau grunted like american type doctor pronounced judicially do sir richmond countered doctor thought for moment so be committed to project of visiting avebury said ought to see avebury said sir richmond h be said doctor ostentatiously amused by thought staring at fire birth control never did sir richmond smiled down on top of doctor head said nothing think said doctor paused will leave avebury expedition to can be back in early afternoon said sir richmond to give chance of seeing cathedral chapter house here be not one to miss then suppose will go on a please said sir richmond insincerely must confess that four people make car at rate seem tremendously overpopulated to tell truth find encounter so amusing a seem to do will not be sorry when have waved good bye to young lady resume interrupted conversation sir richmond considered something mulish in doctor averted face find miss grammont extremely interesting stimulating human being evidently doctor sighed stood up found delivering one of sentence have engendered during solitary meditation in room before dinner surprised by plainness of speech let be frank said regarding sir richmond squarely considering general situation of thing position care very greatly for part of accessory to what may easily develop a know very well into very serious flirtation absurd mischievous irrelevant flirtation may not like word may pretend be conversation ordinary intellectual conversation be not word simply be not word people eye one flirtation give affair proper name be merely that when think will not discus now good night forgive if put before rather bluntly particular point of view sir richmond found alone with eyebrow raised section after twenty four eventful hour two student of human motif found together again by fireplace in old george smoking room have resumed overnight conversation in state of considerable tension if find accommodation of car insufficient said sir richmond in tone of extreme reasonableness admit be can easily hire larger car in place like must not care if hired omnibus said dr martineau be not coming on if young woman be if consider scandalous really martineau really a one man to doe seem to to be bit pernickety of broad original thinker a be thought be one matter rash inconsiderate action quite above if spend day in near company of miss belinda seyffert will will be extremely rude to said sir richmond bit lower lip considered might drop belinda suggested turning to friend speaking in low confidential tone be quite manageable person quite must for example be left behind with luggage sent on by train know if realize how land lie in quarter need only word to miss grammont there be immediate reply for moment have wild hope that companion must agree then perceived that doctor silence meant only preparation of ultimatum object to miss grammont side of thing more than do to miss seyffert sir richmond said nothing may help to see affair from slightly different angle if tell that twice today miss seyffert have asked if be married man of course told be on second occasion sir richmond smiled again frankly said doctor adventure be altogether uncongenial to be sort of thing have never happened in life highway coupling think said sir richmond that be attaching rather too much what will say romantic flirtatious meaning to affair mind that after rather lavish confession must consider rather oversexed person be attitude rather unfair unjust indeed almost insulting to miss grammont after be young lady of very good social position indeed doe strike doe a undignified helpless human being manner suggest person of considerable self control knowing le of than do probably regard a almost a safe a maiden aunt say be twice age be party of four there be convention there be consideration be really dear martineau overdoing side of very pleasant little enlargement of interest be said dr martineau brought scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond face want to go on talking to miss grammont for day so sir richmond admitted then will prefer to leave party there be moment of silence be really very sorry to find in dilemma said sir richmond with note of genuine regret in voice be not dilemma said dr martineau with corresponding loss of asperity grant discover differ upon question of taste convenience before suggested trip have intended to spend little time with old friend sir kenelm latter at bournemouth nothing simpler than to go to now will be sorry same must have wished said doctor that lady have happened little later matter be settled nothing more of practical nature remained to be said gentleman wished to break off with harsh bare decision when new age be here said sir richmond then surely friendship between man woman will not be subjected to inconvenience present code must set about must travel about together a chose fundamental principle of new age said doctor will be honi soit qui mal y pense in matter with perhaps fay ce que vouldras a next injunction so long a other life be not affected in matter of personal behaviour world will probably be much more free individual much more open in conscience honour than have ever be before in matter of property economics public conduct will probably be just reverse then there will be much more collective control much more insistence legal insistence upon individual responsibility be not living in new age yet be living in patched up ruin of very old one if will forgive be living in patched up remains of life have already have complication young lady whose charm cleverness admit behaves a if new age be already here well that may be very dangerous mistake for for affair if go on for few day more may involve very serious consequence indeed with for one wish to be involved sir richmond upon hearthrug have curious feeling that be back in head master study at caxton dr martineau went on with lucidity sir richmond found rather trying to give impression of miss grammont position in life be said manifestly very expensively educated girl in many way interesting have be watching have not be favoured with very much of attention fact have enabled to see in profile miss seyffert be fairly crude mixture of frankness insincerity explanatory egotism have be able to disregard considerable amount of conversation have addressed to now guess miss grammont have have mother since be quite little guess doctor be apt to be pretty good said sir richmond know that have told a much h be well impressed a having air of girl who have have to solve many problem for normal mother provides ready made solution be how inferred that there be mother think there have be stepmother friendly hostile there have be thought not have have various governess companion lady of birth education engaged to look after have done exactly what liked with manner with miss seyffert excellent manner for miss seyffert by bye be sort of manner anyone acquires in day for one person only be very sure commanding young woman sir richmond nodded suppose father adores neglect whenever have wanted companion governess butchered thing have be done business american be told neglect womenkind give money power let loose on world be sort of moral laziness masquerading a affection still suppose custom tradition kept girl in place be petted honoured amused talked about not in harmful way rather bored right up to time when america came into war theoretically have tremendously good time think must be near truth of biography said sir richmond suppose have lover mean though be matter ought to have special interest for mean that be surrounded by retinue of men who wanted to marry who behaved a though wanted to marry who made happiness gratification condescension seem matter of very great importance to have flattery of extremely uncritical unexacting admiration be sort of thing gratifies silly woman extremely miss grammont be not silly homage facile approval probably bored more than realized to anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying thing wearing thing dancing playing game going to place of entertainment being given flower sweet jewellery pet animal book bound in special sort of leather prospect of being rich man only daughter until such time a becomes advisable to change into rich man wealthy wife be probably not nearly so amusing a envious people might suppose take miss grammont have got must out of sort of thing time before war that have already read thought rather more than most young woman in position before be twenty guess be already looking for something more interesting in way of men than rich admirer with automobile full of present who seek find what do think found what must rich girl find out there in america know have material to guess with in london girl might find considerable variety of active interesting men rising politician university men of distinction artist writer even men of science men there be still such men active in creative work of empire in america suppose there be at least equal variety made up of rather different type must find that life be worth while to such people in way made ordinary entertainment amusement of life monstrous silly waste of time with facility of sex must pick up from one of idea made life worth while for be inclined to think there be someone in case who did seem to promise sort of life be worth while that somehow war came to alter look of promise how know perhaps be only romancing for young woman be convinced expedition to europe have meant experience harsh educational experience very profound mental disturbance there have be love experience experience be something more than treat attention proposal made up life when be sheltered over there something more than what be know war have turned ugly face to have seen death suffering ruin perhaps have seen people knew killed perhaps man have be killed have met with cowardice cruelty treachery where did expect have be shocked out of first confidence of youth have ceased to take world for granted have broken have matured think be why history have become real to so attracts in history for have ceased to be fabric of picturesque incident be study of tragic struggle still go on see history a see see be very grown up young woman be just said sir richmond be just that if see a much in miss grammont a why want to come on with see interest of see lot more than that know what advantage be to be a be rather cold unresponsive to woman unattractive negligible negligible be exact word to ca look at woman for five minute without losing sight of in mist of imaginative excitement because look back at have privilege of negligible be cool head miss grammont have startled matured mind original mind yes there be something more to be said intelligence be better than character quite see what be driving at intelligence of intelligent woman be better than character goodness in woman a understand seems to imply necessarily certain imaginative fixity miss grammont have impulsive adventurous character a have be saying be spoilt child with discipline also be person of high intelligence defective control be very much at loose end on account of illness of rather forgotten lady miss martin leeds be rather abusing secret of confessional be confessional close to morrow morning be confessional still look at thing frankly say be also at loose end can deny dear sir know that ever since left london have be ready to fall in love with pretty thing in petticoat seemed to promise three have'porth of kindness lost dog looking for master be stray man looking for mistress miss grammont being woman be little more selective than if be at loose end a suppose be protected by sense of having made selection have preconception of what want be very interesting man in many way carry marriage entanglement lightly with air of being married entangled be quite prepared to fall in love with really think that said sir richmond with ill concealed eagerness dr martineau rolled face towards sir richmond miracle grotesquely happen said know nothing of martin leeds must remember that then added if fall in love a phrase go what be to follow there be pause sir richmond looked at toe for moment so a if took counsel with then decided to take offence really said be preposterous talk of falling in love a though be impossible for man woman to be deeply interested in other without gulf in age in quality from psychologist of new age find amazing be men woman to go on for ever separated by possibility into two hardly communicating yet interpenetrating world be there never to be friendship companionship between men woman without passion ought to know even better than do that there be not for such people a two anyhow at present world be not prepared to tolerate friendship companionship with accompaniment be core of situation pause fell between two gentleman have smoothed over extreme harshness of separation there be very little more to be said well said sir richmond in conclusion be very sorry indeed martineau that have to part like chapter seventh companionship section well said dr martineau extending hand to sir richmond on salisbury station platform leave to round face betrayed little vestige of overnight irritation ought to leave to smiled sir richmond will be interested to learn what happens if wo stay to see now sir please said guard respectfully firmly dr martineau got in sir richmond walked thoughtfully down platform towards exit what else must do asked aloud to nobody in particular for little while thought confusedly of collapse of expedition into secret place of own heart with dr martineau then prepossession with miss grammont resumed possession of mind dr martineau be forgotten section for better part of forty hour sir richmond have be talking to miss grammont carrying on imaginary conversation with in absence sleeping dreaming dream in never failed to play part even if at time be altogether amazing incongruous part a be very frank expressive people already knew very great deal about other for american miss grammont be by mean autobiographical gave sketch of idiosyncrasy repeated remembered comment prophet of contemporary about concealed have lost great interest in own personality be interested in curious about people have met in life talk of reflected considerable amount of light upon own upbringing experience liking for sir richmond be pleasingly manifest liked turn of thought watched with faint smile on lip a spoke spread opinion before carefully in soft voice of hers like shy child showing treasure to suddenly trusted favoured visitor way of thought harmonized talked at first chiefly about history of world extraordinary situation of

have walked round old circumvallation together belinda seyffert have strayed away from professing interest in flower be not so much that felt have to be left together that made do a own consciousness of being possessed by devil who interrupted conversation when miss grammont be keenly interested in conversation then belinda have learnt from experience that be wiser to go off with devil out of range of temptation to interrupt really think said miss grammont that must be possible to take confused old world reshape set marching towards that new world of yours of two hundred fifty million fully developed beautiful happy people why not nobody be doing anything with world except muddle about why not give direction 'd take in hand like clay obdurate clay with sort of recalcitrant

new age sir richmond fore shadowed world under scientific control utopia of fully developed people fully developing resource of earth for number of trivial reason sir richmond found ascribing project of new age almost wholly to dr martineau presenting a much completer scheme than be justified in doing be true that dr martineau have not said many of thing sir richmond ascribed to also be true that have not crystallized out in sir richmond mind before talk with dr martineau idea of new age necessarily carry with idea of fresh rule of conduct of different relationship between human being throw

sunlight of wiltshire somerset with miss seyffert acting part of almost ostentatiously discreet chorus be inevitable that conversation must become by imperceptible gradation more personal intimate kept up pose be supposed to represent dr martineau philosophy of being man woman on planet considering future insensibly developed idiosyncrasy of position might profess to be man woman in most general term fact that be daughter not of everyman old grammont that sir richmond be angry leader of minority upon fuel commission became more more important what will do with planet of ours gave way by easiest transition to what be doing have got to do how do feel about what do desire what do dare be natural that sir richmond must talk of fuel commission to young woman whose interest in fuel be even greater than own found that be very much better read than be in recent literature of socialism that have what considered to be most unfeminine grasp of economic idea thought attitude towards socialism very sane one because be also own so far a socialism involved idea of scientific control of natural resource a common property administered in common interest be very greatly attracted by so

working class possessing a class profounder political wisdom more generous public impulse than other class illusion have long since departed people be much same thought in class there be stratification of rightness righteousness found must talk to of work aim upon fuel commission of conflict failure of motif found in a freely a have done to dr martineau with surer confidence of understanding perhaps talk with doctor have got idea into order made more readily expressible than must have be otherwise argued against belief that class must be good a class bad a class instanced conflict of motif found in member of committee most so in repeated persuasion have already confessed to dr martineau that there be not single member of fuel commission have considerable drive towards doing right thing about fuel not one who have single minded unencumbered drive towards right thing said sir richmond be what make life so interesting in spite of thousand tragic disappointment so hopeful man be bad man man be feeble man man be good man motif come go yours do same vary in response to circumstance about given proper atmosphere most men will be public spirited right living

for common end be trader owner worker so forth by inner necessity be just ugly part play in present drama be nearly at end of run be hopeful view said miss grammont see flaw in if there be flaw there be one said sir richmond be chief discovery about life began with question of fuel energy affords mankind have found that generalization applies to human affair human being be fool weakling coward passionate idiot grant be brown cloak side of so to speak be not such fool so forth that ca do pretty well materially if once hammer out sane collective method of getting using fuel people generally will understand in place of present method of snatch wrangle of be absolutely convinced work help willingness can get out of everybody be red same principle applies to most labour property problem to

richmond so long a confidence last repeated after ah cried sir richmond there be so long a confidence last so long a one keep one mind steady be what came away with dr martineau to discus went to for advice have known for more than month be amusing to find preaching forth to be just faith have lost suddenly have lost power of work confidence in rightness of what be doing evaporated will failed know if will understand what mean be that reason did assure just a certainly a ever that what be trying to do be right thing to try to do somehow seemed cold personally unimportant proposition life have gone out of paused a if arrested by momentary doubt know why tell thing said tell said be little like patient in hydropath retailing ailment go on began to think now that what took go out of a

sensitive man might have felt something of fool might have felt premature presumptuous red be others knew be red also why show be peculiar distress of people like ourselves who have sense of history sense of larger life within than merely personal life want to go on with old story merely want to live somehow in larger life to live for greater end lose something unbearable of ourselves in wanting to do that be only wanting to do what nearly everybody perhaps be ripe to do will presently want to do when new age martineau talk about begin to come may come very quickly a red came at prague for present everyone hesitates about throwing back cloak until cloak becomes unbearable said repeating word came upon holiday in queerest state thought be ill thought be overworked real trouble be loneliness robbed of driving force nobody seemed thinking feeling with have never realized until now what gregarious beast man be needed only day so with martineau in atmosphere of idea belief like own to begin restoration now a talk to be why have clutched at company because here be coming from thousand of mile away talk idea fall into way of thought a though have gone to same school perhaps

to friend duty have neglected for day evening be warm still moon be approaching full very bright insensibly soft afterglow passed into moonlight at first two companion talked very little sir richmond be well content with tacit friendliness miss grammont be preoccupied because be very strongly moved to tell thing about that hitherto have told to one be not merely that wanted to tell thing also that for reason did not put a yet very clearly to herself thought be thing ought to know talked of herself at first in general term life come on anyone with rush childhood seems lasting for ever then

becoming that be why have be making sort of historical pilgrimage story sir richmond education somehow though trouble be different seems to that little muddle make understand how be with what have got idea of scientific ordering of world be what in younger le experienced way have be feeling way towards want to join on want to got hold of idea of great fuel control in world of still greater economic educational control of be part want to make idea part of rather want to make part of when talk of believe in altogether believe in when talk of to section sir richmond be stirred very deeply by miss grammont confidence dispute with dr martineau be present in mind so that did not want to make love to be extremely anxious to express vivid sense of value of friendship while hesitated over difficult unfamiliar task began to talk again of herself in such way a to give new turn to sir richmond thought perhaps ought to tell little more about said now have told so much did thing still puzzle be filled with sense of hopeless disaster in france suppose have sort of desperate idea of saving something out of situation renewed correspondence with gunter lake made suggestion knew must make renewed engagement to go back to wealth dignity in new york yes love be always be plain to what did realize until have given promise over again be that dislike acutely have realized that before have thought about sufficiently now have to think about lot other affair have given idea perhaps of what mean to be married to man here be drifting back to horrible thing about be steady enveloping way in have always come at without fellowship without community of idea ready to make most extraordinary bargain so long a can in way fix get doe mean what be there behind watching soliciting eye of in least love desire service rest of offer be not love be not even such love a caston gave be game play with imagination have released flood of new idea in sir richmond mind be illuminating said dislike lake acutely always have disliked suppose have be only now admit to myself yes might for example have married in new york before war came very near to then probably must have discovered disliked must have admitted to suppose must suppose must have tried to believe loved woman do sort of thing odd never realized before there be endless wife suppressing acute dislike wife doe see now quite clearly that detests reasonably enough from angle be entirely detestable wo admit wo know of never will to end of life always will keep detestation unconfessed put face on matter do affair of yours have thought how unjust be to lake not nearly so much a might have done be unfair to atrociously unfair be not sort of man perhaps will hurt cruelly according to peculiar law of being seems to crawling sort of lover with immense self conceit at back of crawlingness have endorsed back to crawl until crawl triumphantly right over like to think of dream have take will lose be fair to go into game with in interest of lake said smiling softly at sir richmond in moonlight be perfectly right suppose doe lose sir richmond found uttering sentiment there be only one decent way in civilized man civilized woman may approach one passionate desire be not enough what be called love be not enough pledge rational consideration thing be worthless thing be compatible with primary essential be friendship clear understanding absolute confidence then within condition in elect relationship love be permissible mating marriage marriage a will all thing be permissible came long pause between dear old cathedral said miss grammont little irrelevantly have air of having concluded something to sir richmond seemed scarcely to have begun stood looking at great dark facade edged with moonlight for moment then turned towards hotel showed pink lit window wonder said if belinda be still up what will think when tell of final extinction of mr lake think rather looked forward to being intimate friend secret everything of mr gunter lake section sir richmond woke up at dawn woke out of extraordinary dream be saying to miss grammont there be other marriage than marriage of true mind there be other marriage than marriage of true mind saw a have seen evening before light cool coming towards in moonlight from hotel also in inconsistent way of dream be very close to kind faintly smiling face eye be wet with tear be kissing hand dear wife mate be saying suddenly be kissing cool lip woke up stared at dream faded out only very slowly before fresh sun rise upon red tile tree bough outside open window before first stir clamour of bird felt like court in overwhelmingly revolutionary piece of evidence have be tendered elaborate defence have broken down at one blow sat up on edge of bed facing new fact be monstrous ridiculous said martineau judged exactly be in love with be head over heel in love with have never be so much in love so truly in love with anyone before section be dawn of long day of tension for sir richmond miss grammont because be now vividly aware of being in love with other so be able to see how thing be with other be afraid of other restraint have come upon restraint be greatly enhanced by sense of belinda acutely observant ostentatiously tactful self effacing prepared at slightest encouragement to be overwhelmingly romantic sympathetic talk waned be revived to artificial activity waned again historical interest have evaporated from west of england left only urgent embarrassing present loveliness of weather did not fail whole day be set in severn landscape first saw great river like sea with welsh mountain hanging in sky behind a came over mendip crest above shipham saw again a crossed hill before clifton bridge so continued climbing to hill crest for view at alveston near dursley so to gloucester lowest bridge thence back down stream again through fat meadow land at first much apple blossom then over gentle hill through wide pale nownham lidney alvington woolaston to old chepstow brown castle always with widening estuary to left of foaming shoal shining sand bank from chepstow turned back north along steep wye gorge to tintern there at snug little beaufort arm with prim lawn flower garden ended day journey tintern abbey thought poor graceless mass of ruin down beside river be fenced about jealously locked up from invasion after dinner sir richmond miss grammont went for walk in mingled twilight moonlight up hill towards chepstow of be absurdly nervously pressing to belinda to come with be far too wise to take sudden desire for company seriously dinner shoe said be too thin perhaps must change come out little later yes come later said miss grammont led way to door passed through garden think go up hill said sir richmond yes agreed up hill followed silence sir richmond made effort after artificial disconnected talk about tintern abbey concerning have history ready then still lamer about whether monmouthshire be in england wale silence fell again silence lengthened assumed significance dignity that common word might break then sir richmond spoke love said with heart soft voice came back after stillness love said with have long ceased to hope said sir richmond must ever find friend lover perfect companionship went on walking side by side without touching other turning to other thing wanted to think believe have come alive in said cool sweet said sir richmond such happiness a must not have imagined light of silent bicycle appeared above up hill swept down upon lit two still face brightly passed dear whispered in darkness between high hedge stopped short stood quite still trembling saw face dim tender looking up to then took in arm kissed lip a have desired in dream when returned to inn belinda seyffert offered flat explanation of why have not followed enlarged upon moonlight effect of abbey ruin from inn lawn scared congratulation in eye betrayed recognition that momentous thing have happened

have lain awake unable to sleep be haunted by figure of sir richmond lying on uncomfortable little bed in big bedroom by curious effect of loneliness produced by nocturnal desk by evident dread felt by sir richmond of death bed parting realized how much man who have once sought so feverishly for intimacy have shrunken back upon how solitary motif have become how rarely have taken counsel with anyone in later year mind now dwelt apart even if people came about must still be facing death alone so seemed meant to slip out of life a man might slip out of crowded assembly unobserved even now
