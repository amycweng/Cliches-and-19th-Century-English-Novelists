attention to one urgent necessity to keep hold of point of view that think be common tragedy of almost human conflict rapid breakdown from first cool apprehension of issue to heat confusion insistence know if indeed raised voice memory have effect of raised voice when at last went out of house seemed to that men servant in hall be a hushed a beast before thunderstorm of quite fully aware of tremendous catastrophe have come to marten moreover a recalled afterwards with astonishment went past out into driving rain unprotected not one of stirred serviceable hand what be said have vivid sense of declaring not once only several time mary be husband wife in sight of god be full of idea now must inevitably be mine must have spoken to justin at time a if have come merely to confirm view of long dispute there have be between for while mind resisted extraordinary attitude that matter lay between mary be in way interloper seemed to there be nothing for now that mary must stand by side

still talking closed door tried to think how must get to station five mile away then what must do in london must seem rather odd visitor to hotel without luggage be behind valiant demand that must come with come now then mind be lanced by thin edge of realization that did not intend to come now that justin be resolved must not do so after first shock of finding discovered have stood pale

here in house be house made room of be full of here be stood there making magnificently extravagant claim eye blazing blue hair little dishevelled with strand across cheek justin spoke together then turned in helpless anger upon one remember with clumsiest of weak gesture bade begone from house that with now rather deflated rhetoric answered must go only with mary at side there stood le like desperate rebel against most fundamental social relation than indignant princess demanded of high heaven why must be fought for why must be fought for then abruptly gathered skirt in hand advanced

ancient rule while on side be determining ever more definitely that will not be possessed have little to say to one mere echo endorsement of recent declaration must come to said will save from at cost be gist of confrontation then turned about walked along gallery towards entrance with justin following slowly be full of wrath of baffled heroic turned towards with something of gesture down perspective of white empty gallery appeared small perplexed pane of tall french window be slashed with rain sec forget now absolutely what may have expected to happen next can not remember return to father house that day know that what did happen be most unanticipated incredible experience of life be a if whole world of mankind be suddenly to turn upside down people go about calmly in position of complete inversion have note from mary on morning after discovery indeed dealt with be otherwise not very different from endless note have received before crisis be destroyed so that know exact text

amazement sec there stood real solid little unfamiliar in tweed with shining eye intimate unforgettable a though have never ceased to see for intervening year bracing holding back emotion be quite unmistakably miss summersley satchel blonde business like young woman with stumpy nose very cruelly corrugated inflamed by pince nez savagely did much more than duty by name remained seated tilting chair little pushing back from table regarding intelligently be one of moment in life when one be taken unawares think common realization of need of masking reality of encounter hasty search in mind for plausible face upon meeting must have be very obvious to lady who observed mary first thought be for pseudonym mine be to make plain met by accident be mr stephen said mary be dropped out of sky from over there be benighted go there late very late one gleam of light yawning waiter must have have to break window then meet then for moment so be silent with sense of immense gravity of position growing upon little tow headed waiter boy appeared with coffee roll on tray poised high on hand will have coffee out here with said mary where else said a though there be conceivable alternative told tow headed waiter belatedly mary turned to introduce to secretary friend miss summersley satchel mr stephen miss satchel bowed to other agreed that lake be very beautiful in morning light mr stephen said mary in entirely unnecessary explanation be old friend of mother have seen for year how be mr stephen child answered briefly began to tell of climb down titlis addressed with unnecessary explicitness to miss satchel did perhaps over accentuate extreme fortuitousness of appearance from where stood whole course of previous day after have come over shoulder be visible seemed soft little shining pathway to top danger of descent have romantic intensification in morning light rule of game said be that one stop wait for daylight wonder if anyone keep that rule talked for time of mountain still standing little aloof until coffee came miss summersley satchel produced that frequent most unpleasant bye product of british education intelligent interest in etymology wonder said with brow of ruffled omniscience eyeing rather severely with magnified eye why be called titlis there must be reason presently miss satchel be dismissed indoors on transparent excuse mary be alone together eyed one gravely perhaps more gravely because of wild excitement be quickening pulse breathing thrilling through nerve pushed back plate before put dear elbow on table dropped chin between hand in attitude seemed made of little memory suppose said something of kind be bound to happen turned eye to mountain shining in morning light be glad have happened in beautiful place might have be anywhere last night said be thinking of wanting to hear voice again thought did too wonder if have dim perception scanned face stephen be not much changed be looking well eye be dog tired eye have be working too

india damaged leg have meant to rest here for day well rest here with why not now be here after have promised be none of planning stephen seems to ought to go right on so soon a breakfast be over weighed that with just same still pause same quiet moment of lip eye recalled so well be a thing have always be between that must make decision first bring to be natural decided with sun rising day still freshly beginning that must go must go have wanted to meet like talk about thing ten thousand time a for stephen wo go wo let go if can help not morning anyhow go later in day if will let two take one talk that god have given have not planned be doing not ours sat yielding be not so sure of god participation said know be very tired glad to be with ca tell how glad so glad think must weep

will keep point of honor will go to day let drive point of honor into quick go easy stephen old friend dear dear what have happened to have forgotten of course be possible for to go mute with so much that can say mountain sunlight looked up to see with elbow on table hand clasped under chin that face close to mine dear blue eye watching lip little apart other human being have ever have that effect upon so seem to feel life stir in other body more than feel own sec from moment when confessed decision to stay gave further thought to rightfulness wisdom of spending next few hour together thought only of hour thing lent to stood up walked out in front of hotel there moored to stake at edge of water be little leaky punt one vessel on engstlen see must take food with a decided row out there to where vast cliff came sheer from water out of earshot interference talk for time have remember now how mary stood called to miss satchel window to tell of intention how discovered again that exquisite slender grace knew so well know very rowing out from shore have in something sweet incredible be a if be dreaming together might at moment awaken again countless mile thousand thing apart rowed slowly with clumsy swiss oar one must thrust forward breaking smooth crystal of lake sat sideways looking forward saying very little with much same sense think of enchantment unreality saw now for first time a watched over oar that face be changed be graver thought stronger than mary have known even now can still doubt if boat lake be real yet remember even minute irrelevant detail of day impression with extraordinary exquisite vividness perhaps be that very luminous distinctness distinguishes event from common experience of life put so above quality of thing be ordinarily real rowed slowly past great headland into bay at upper end of water have not realized at first that must row beyond range of hotel window rock come out of lake be clear dead white when be dry very faintly tinted when be wetted light warmly with flash blotch of color be seen to be full of most exquisite delicate vein splinter vertically go up in cliff very high sculptured with quality almost of porcelain at certain level suddenly become more rude massive begin to overhang under cliff water be very deep blue green run here there into narrow cleft place where landed be kind of beach left by recession of ice rock immediately about be ice worn place be paved with ice worn boulder two huge bluff put forehead together above hid glacier from one must feel near presence of ice in air out between boiled little torrent spread into hundred intercommunicating channel amidst great pebble pebble be covered by network of marvellously gnarled twisted stem bearing little leaf blossom network at once very ancient very fresh giving peculiar gentleness richness to alpine severity have dwarfed tangled be astounding that plant must find nourishment among stone great headland with patch of yellowish old snow still lingering here there upon upper mass have crept insensibly between remote hotel now hid altogether there be nothing to remind of world have separated except old leaky boat have drawn up upon stone at limpid water edge be a if have come out of life together whispered giving voice to thought sat down upon boulder sat on lower slab yard so away looked at one be still unreal said felt awkward at loss a sat there before a man unused to drawing room might feel in presence of strange hostess be so said so altogether nearest thing so strange too so far off feel shy be shy repeated feel that if speak loudly will vanish looked about surely be most beautiful place in whole world be indeed in world stephen dear began presently what strange thing life be strange disproportion thing will not fit together little thing eat up beautiful thing might save save seem indeed to have meaning in regard to ordinary sensible affair beauty do remember stephen how long ago in old park talked about immortality said then did not want to know anything of what come after life even now do want to know be too busy be not busy enough want to be sure not only to know to know that be so that life not life life be only bleak twilight of morning think death just dead death after life have have be most impossible of end want particularly want to passionately want to live again out of body stephen that carves with to be free a beautiful thing be free to be free a be free exquisite clean freedom ca believe that life of earth be that there be for why must ever think strange why must still find ordinary matter of fact thing of everyday strange do because be eating stuffing into thin slice of what be queer little hot eager beast perpetual need to do such thing mad fury of sex stephen live suffocate in living body storm rage snatch be stephen really ca be be so excessive if be anything more than first furious rush into existence of being will go on go on at last to quite beautiful real thing like perhaps to day world be beautiful indeed with sun shining love shining dear so near to be so incredible that must part to day be a if someone told sun be little mad be so perfectly natural to be with again voice sank leant little forward towards stephen suppose that be dead to day suppose that when imagined be climbing yesterday died suppose that yesterday died that just thought be still climbing a made way to perhaps be dead up there on mountain be lying dead in room in hotel be great beginning stephen be talking nonsense because be so happy to be with here sec for time said very little then irregularly disconnectedly began to tell other thing about substance of life seemed strangely objective that day have a be come to one clean out of common condition told of trouble secret weakness bared spirit confessed of have same tale of mean angry hasty impulse of must find kindred inconsistency have exalted assurance that other must understand completely forgive love talked for most part talked much more than with sort of wonder at thing have happened to for long space did not talk at feel need of talking what seems very strange to now seeing that have be impassioned lover never kissed never kissed at even remember that thought of kissing have shyness between kept little apart can not remember that ever touched one except for time took led by hand towards little place of starry flower have drawn eye wished to see already for two body be dead gone be shy shy of contact be little afraid of one there be kind of awe between that have met again in strange beautiful place fancy that be dead together have fitness can not possibly convey to can not give by writing light sweet freshness of high desolation must need to go there what be lovely in talk being said in setting must seem rambling discourse be to write down a believe that even now must write down word for word almost thought of so fresh doe remain with dear moment be eternal seems to that a write to tell of be telling not of something happened two year ago of thing immortal be a if mary be together there holding reality of life before a though be little sorry tale written in book upon knee sec be still in early afternoon that came down again across meandering ice water stream to old boat pushed off rowed slowly out of magic corner back to day again little knew to what be rowed a glided across water rounded headland came slowly into view of hotel again mary be reminded of parting for little while be disposed to make remain if must stay little longer said day if harm be done be done have be beautiful said meeting be just a if when be so jaded discouraged must have put work aside despaired altogether power have said 'have forgotten friendship gave ' will have have time have met have seen one have heard one have hurt one will go to day before sunset be right must go stay whispered with light in eye dare not did not speak for long time of course said at last be right only said must have said for if have not be so right stephen suppose poor silly little thing that if stayed must certainly begin making love to other must be necessary must fence about little then there must be no barrier to stop of want to happen be what want must become urgent suppose must be coquettish in spite of ourselves power must make puppet a if already have made love must find in heart now stephen must make stay oh why be so tormented stephen in next world will meet will trouble no longer love will be there oh love will be there like something have at last got fully born got free from queer clinging seed case will be rid of jealousy stephen that inflammation of mind bitterness that pitiless sore so that sha be tormented by thought of rachel will be able to tolerate be so sweet wonderful girl with dark eye have never done justice never snatched from snatched someday will be different putting round person like fence against everyone else almost against everything else be so wicked so fierce be so possible to be different sometimes now sometimes for long part of day have base passion at even in life to be like always ca see clearly how thing can be one dream of in kind of luminous mist if one look directly at vanish again sec at last came to landing moored little boat walked up winding path to hotel dull pain of separation be already upon think have forgotten miss summersley satchel altogether appeared a sat down to tea at same table at have breakfasted joined a matter of course conceivably found two animated friend of morning have become rather taciturn indeed there came lapse of silence so portentous that roused to effort told over again a realized afterwards difficulty have benighted upon titlis then miss satchel regaled mary with particular of various coming going of hotel became anxious to end tension went into inn to pay bill get knapsack when came out mary stood up will come just little way with stephen said must have fancied glass of companion flashed to hear surname of morning reappear christian name in afternoon be that woman behind safe asked breaking silence a went up mountain side mary looked over shoulder for contemplative second be always be discretion thought more of miss satchel parting said mary be worst of price have to pay now come to end there seem thousand thing one have said presently came back to that sha remember so much perhaps be there met over there in sunlight among rock suppose perhaps managed to say something a ascent grew steeper became clear that if be to reach melch see inn by moment for parting have come with well white lipped smile glance at argus eyed hotel held out hand to will live on brother stephen said for year too answered be wonderful to stand face there see real living with warm sunlight on face one glowing tenderness clasped hand warm life of hand met clung parted went on alone up winding path zigzag up mountain side in full sight of hotel for better part of hour climbing steadily higher looking back looking back until be just little strip of white that halted seemed to wave to waved back found weeping fool said to go on be by effort kept on way instead of running back to again presently curvature of slope came up between hid altogether hid hotel hid lake cliff seemed to must not possibly see more be a if knew that sun have set for ever sec lay at melch see inn night rose betimes started down wild grey gorge in early morning light walked to sachseln caught early train to lucerne went on in afternoon to como there stayed in sunshine taking boat rowing alone far up lake lying in thinking of love friendship accident significance of life for most part not thinking at feeling feeling glow of meeting finality of separation a one feel clear glow of sunset when wind rise cold night draw near everything be pervaded by sense of just over mountain thought be mary be alone in boat presence filled sky seemed to that at moment must go to last vestige of cloud between for anything have done failed to do in crisis of distress separation have vanished gone altogether in afternoon wrote to rachel have not written to for three day even now told nothing of meeting with mary have not written partly because must not decide whether must tell of not in end tried to hide from seemed little thing in regard to thing must not hurt thing a detached from life a inconsecutive a dream in head three day later reached day before formal opening of peace congress found telegram have come that morning to poste restante to banish thought of pacific mission from mind came from paris blue ribbon of text ran come back at once to london justin have be told of meeting be resolved upon divorce will do in power to explain avert feel must know at once there be thing so monstrously destructive to hold dear that for time be impossible to believe remember now that a read that amazing communication through at first reading be little difficult to understand because italian operator have guessed at one two of word real sense of meaning came to that followed sluggishly felt a one might feel when one open offensive anonymous letter hears preposterous threat what

mouth perspiring little bead looking more out of condition than ever never knew man so wine sodden so sharp witted be very well stratton said between very unfortunate sort of thing doe satisfy justin evidently have got to put different look on if can before go before jury see seemed to be considering rejecting unpalatable phrase wo understand said after mere chance of same hotel there must be more evidence than that spent night in adjacent room said dryly adjacent room cried regarded for moment with something bordering on admiration did know said have routed that out be sleeping with two head within yard of one anyhow thirty six have have thirty seven said stopped maxwell hartington admiration gave place think to slight resentment at sustained innocence lady mary changed room with

confidence of habitually unchallenged people that word must be accepted have hoped indeed to get whole affair settled abolished without anything of coming to rachel ear then at leisure must be able to tell exactly how thing have come about day made clearer that thing be not going to be settled that monstrous incredible be going to happen that justin have set mind implacably upon divorce sense of complete innocence have already be shaken by maxwell hartington have come to perceive that have be amazingly indiscreet be beginning to think have be criminally indiscreet saw maxwell hartington for second time became clear to must abandon hope of keeping thing further from rachel took luggage round to house to great astonishment of two servant have supposed of course be in italy then went down on heel of telegram to rachel forget wording of telegram be a little alarming a possible think said something about back in london for document will try to get down to did not specify particular train

brought back dancing gladness in eye vanished swiftly a waited for answer to question caught note of tragedy from face why have come back from italy asked in altered voice rachel said taking arm with desolating sense of futility in gesture of protection let walk along beach want to tell something something rather complicated be there going to be war stephen asked abruptly seemed then that question
