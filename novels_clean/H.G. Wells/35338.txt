theodore be lured down side street by sight of huge dummy fish dangling outside tackle bait shop mr magnet marjorie already with dreadful feeling of complicity made movement so rapid seemed to almost bolt for church tower mr magnet desired to say elasticity mind have once possessed with regard to there can be doubt that have now become so rigid a to be sayable only in one precise position in exact order have determined upon when at last got to high serenity mr magnet be far too hot far too much out of breath to say anything at for time except almost explosive gust so of approbation of scenery

marjorie feeling for rest of day be only to be accounted for on supposition that be overwrought have preposterous reaction have done thing with eye open after day of deliberation now felt a though be caught in trap clearest thing in mind be that mr magnet have taken hold of kissed kissed her on lip presently must do again also be asking with futile reiteration why have got into debt at oxbridge why have got into debt for such silly little thing too nothing definite be said in hearing about engagement everybody seemed to understand mr pope be most demonstrative took occasion to rap hard upon back face crinkled with resolute kindliness ah said sly maggot also administered several resounding blow to magnet shoulder blade irradiated party with glow of benevolent waggery marjorie submitted without answer to paternal intimation mr pope did more than watch daughter invisible overwhelming force be busy in bringing marjorie glowing lover alone together again happened at last a be departing

madge said daffy after reflection shut do shut leave alone say ca leave alone oh for moment let sob have way with daffy worry old daffy please daffy sat up for long time in stifled silence ensued then like sensible sister gave up composed again to slumber outside watching window in state of nebulous ecstasy be mr magnet moonlit dewy be high serene night with growing moon scattered company of major star if choir of nightingale sang there be at least very active nightjar more than hoped whispered mr magnet more than dared to hope be very sleepy seemed to improper to go to bed on night on occasion chapter third man who fell out of sky sec for next week marjorie became more nearly introspective than have ever be in life before began to doubt hitherto unshaken conviction that be single consistent human being found such discord discrepancy between mood mood between conviction of hour feeling of that seemed to be rather collection of sample of emotion attitude than anything so simple a individual for example there can be denying there be one marjorie in bundle who be immensely set up by fact that be engaged going to be at very remote date mistress of london house be profoundly plessingtonian vulgarest of lot new status have attained possibly beautiful house probably successful dinner party arrangement importance of life be substance of creature thought designed queenly dress be marjorie most in evidence when came to talking with mother daphne be afraid patronized daphne ignored fact that daphne who have begun with resolute magnanimity be becoming annoyed resentful thought of thing might buy jolly feeling of putting about making fine effect with one thing told daphne have clearly resolved upon house must be always full brimming over with beautiful flower have always wished mother must have more flower not keep so long when have marjorie in confusion of mind be doing sincerest narrow best to appreciate feel grateful for return devotion of mr magnet marjorie accepted even elaborated view laid stress on voluntary subjection harped upon goodness brought to kiss deserve love side of marjorie told magnet mean to learn to love dear one cried magnet pressed hand third marjorie among many be altogether acuter le agreeable person be sprite of pure criticism in spite of utmost effort to suppress declared night day in inner confidence of marjorie soul that did not believe in mr magnet old devotion at be anti magnet persistent insurgent be dreadfully unsettling be surely marjorie must let fact of baldness alone who discovered insisted upon curious unbeautiful flatness in voice whenever be doing best to speak from heart a for devotion what did amount to persistent unimaginative besetting of marjorie growing air of ownership expansive indulgent smiling disposition to thwart control be always touching whenever came near must wince at freedom large kind hand might take with elbow wrist at possible sudden clumsy pat at erring strand of hair then there be appraising satisfaction in eye on third day of engagement began quite abruptly to call magsy will end scandal of girl pope said magsy magnet will be mm woman mp for magsy became acutely critical of intellectual quality listened with new alertness to conversation at dinner table bout of wit with father carried off utterance witticism for maturer reflection be amazed to find how little

there be lot of thing have to understand said nearer home than marjorie be ablaze now what silly thing to say cried with undergraduate freedom really be talking nonsense read book because interest if did must read something else do mean to suggest that be reading like child who hold book upside down be so plainly angry that be taken aback mean to suggest began turned to greet welcome presence interrogative eye of mr pope here be said having quarrel marjorie said mr pope oh be serious said mr magnet added with gleam be about municipal trading mr pope knew wicked little flicker in marjorie eye better than mr magnet have known from nursery yet have never quite mastered meaning have never yet realized be marjorie have always regarded a something marjorie other marjorie ought to keep under control so now adopted pacificatory tone oh lover quarrel said floating over occasion lover quarrel must ask to interfere marjorie already little ashamed of heat thought for instant ought to stand then decided abruptly with return to choler that must not do so stood up held out hand for book mr magnet said to mother with remarkable force freedom a took have be talking unutterable nonsense call that lover quarrel anyhow then confronted with double astonishment having no more to say picked up skirt quite unnecessarily walked with heavenward chin indoors be afraid explained mr magnet be little too free with one of magsy favourite author be favourite author now asked mr pope after reflective pause with mother indulgent smile shaw raised amused eyebrow be just age suppose be frightfully loyal while last said mr pope one dare say word against think be adorable of said mr magnet with answering loyalty gusto sec aviation accident occurred while mr pope two eldest daughter mr magnet be playing golf croquet upon vicarage lawn be serene hot afternoon little too hot to take game seriously four little figure moved slowly over green grouped dispersed a game required mr magnet be very fond of golf croquet displayed whimsical humour much invention at game be not too exacting physically must make ball jump into air in absurdest manner occasionally won laugh from marjorie daffy one else be in sight pseudo twin theodore toupee be in barn mr pope be six mile away at wamping lying prone nibbling grass blade watching county cricket match a good englishman who know what be expected of love to do click went ball mallet then after long interval click seemed incredible that anything must possibly happen before tea be no longer world be suddenly tranquil scene be slashed rent by sound vision of monoplane tearing across heaven purring popping arrested mr magnet in mid jest monster came sliding up sky over tree beside church to east already near enough to look big great stiff shape big buff sail stayed with glittering wire with two odd little wheel beneath body drove up sky rising with sort of upward heaving until croquet player must see driver passenger perched behind quite clearly passed little to right of church tower only few yard above level of flagstaff there be fifty foot of clearance altogether a did so marjorie must see driver passenger making hasty movement became immense over shadowing one stood rigid a swept across sun above vicarage chimney then seemed to drop twenty foot so abruptly then men cried out a drove straight for line of poplar between shrubbery meadow oh oh oh cried mr pope daffy evidently aviator be trying to turn sharply huge thing banked not enough came about slipped away until wing be slashing into tree top with thrilling swish of leaf snapping of branch stay run cried magnet danced about lawn three lady rushed sideways a whole affair slouched down on came on edge hesitated whether to turn over a whole then crumpled amidst volley of smashing snapping came to rest amidst ploughed up turf clamorous stench of petrol cloud of dust blue smoke within twenty yard of two men have jumped to clear engine have fallen headlong be now covered by fabric of shattered wing be too spectacular for word speech until thing lay still even then croquet player stood passive for awhile waiting for something to happen took second to reconcile mind to sudden loss of initiative in monster have be so recently threateningly full of go seemed quite long time before came into marjorie head that ought perhaps to act in way saw tall young man wriggling on four from underneath wreckage of fabric stared at rather blankly went forward with vague idea of helping stood up swayed doubtfully on leg turned became energetic struggling mysteriously with edge of left wing gasped turned fierce blue eye over shoulder help to hold confounded thing up cried with touch of irritation in voice at attitude marjorie at once seized edge of plane pushed second man in peculiar button shaped head dress be lying crumpled up underneath ear cheek be bright with blood there be streak of blood on ground near head be right can hold if use only one hand marjorie gasped yes with terrific weight a seemed suddenly on wrist right o tall young man have thrust backwards under plane until rested on back collared prostrate man keep up said fiercely when marjorie threatened to give way seemed to assume that be there to obey order with much grunting effort have dragged companion clear of wreckage man face be mass of blood be sickeningly inert to companion lugging let go said tall young man marjorie thanked heaven a broken wing flapped down again came helpfully to side became aware of daffy mother few pace off magnet astonished be retreating hastily have to go away because sight of blood upset so much that be always wiser for to go away be hurt cried mr pope be said tall young man then a though other people did matter marjorie be old friend said can turn over think so marjorie grasped damaged man shoulder got over skilfully will get water said tall young man to daffy mr pope in way sent daffy off at once for pail want water said to parlourmaid who be hurrying out of house tall young man have gone down on knee by companion releasing neck making hasty first examination of condition pneumatic cap must have saved head said throwing thing aside lucky have ca be badly hurt just rubbed face along ground silly thing to have come a did felt heart tried flexibility of arm be right said became judicial absorbed over problem of friend side um remarked knelt back regarded marjorie for first time thundering smash said face relaxed into agreeable smile only bought last week be hurt rib think two rib perhaps stunned rather just nose regarded marjorie marjorie for brief space became aware of mr pope on right hand then at clank behind turned round to see daphne advancing with pail of water two servant be now on spot odd job man old lady who did out church magnet hovered doubtfully in distance suddenly with shout bark of sympathetic glee pseudo twin theodore toupee shot out of house new thought be stirring in young aviator rose wincing little a did so be afraid be little rude said do hope friend be hurt said mr pope feeling duty of hostess be not hurt much so far a can see have made rather mess of lawn oh not at said mr pope have if be gardener over there must be nice if kept back people who seem to be hesitating beyond tree there will be more presently be afraid must throw on hand broke into chuckle for moment have know be possible to get doctor

lurks in composition of so many woman be uppermost give handkerchief said to trafford with daffy kneeling beside also interested mr pope belated more experienced authoritative third sir rupert be soon getting best of attention wathall said sir rupert suddenly tried again wathall third effort gave wathall about eh if must get into shade said marjorie woosh cried sir rupert weeeooo be right said trafford be only rib two eeeeeyoooo said sir rupert exactly be going to carry out of glare touch said sir rupert gooo took little persuasion before sir rupert must consent to be moved even then be for time oh crusty presently trafford two girl have got into shade of large bush close to where in circle of rug cushion tea thing lay prepared there camped helpful odd job man be ordered to stave off intruder from village water towel pillow be forthcoming mr magnet reappeared a tentative assistance solomonson became articulate brave said 'd nothing stitch in side in present position be at uncomfortable only did want one near enforced that by appealing smile twin invited to fetch doctor declined proffering theodore have conceived juvenile passion for tall young man did not want to leave certainly have very nice face so theodore after walking twice round wreckage tore away departed on rom bicycle enquiry centred on solomonson for time face hair neck be wet longer bloody professed perfect comfort so long a be moved one came too near be very clear about though perfectly polite scrutinized face to see if be equally clear satisfied upon point closed eye spoke more looked then like capuchin monkey lost in pride there came pause one be conscious of having risen to emergency behaved well under unusual circumstance young man eye rested on adjacent tea thing lacking nothing coronation of teapot why not remarked have tea if think friend began mr pope oh be right be solomonson there be nothing more now until doctor only want to be left alone said solomonson closed heavy eyelid again mr pope told maid with air of dismissal to get tea can keep eye on said trafford marjorie surveyed first patient with pretty unconscious mixture of maternal gravity girlish interest twin to avoid too openly gloating upon good look of trafford chose place secured cushion round tea thing calculating to best of ability how might secure closest proximity to mr magnet toupee have gone to stare at monoplane be presently joined by odd job man in interrogative mood pretty complete smash sir said odd job man then perceiving head over hedge by churchyard turned back to duty of sentinel daffy thought of need of more cup plate went in to get mr pope remarked that did hope sir rupert be not badly hurt extraordinary be remarked mr trafford now here be after lunch twenty mile away smoking cigar with more idea of having tea with than be going to say flying be out of date now then just thought 'd try thing like dream addressed to marjorie never feel that life be quite real until about three day after thing have happened never two hour ago have not slightest intention of ever flying again have flown before asked mr pope not much did little at sheppey be so hard for poor man to get hand on machine here be solomonson with thing in hangar eating head off let take out said go once round park here be thought be wise for to come sir rupert without opening eye be understood to assent do know said trafford sight of tea make feel frightfully hungry think engine damaged said cheerfully do a magnet joined aileron be in splinter left wing be not much better be about except wheel one fall so much lighter than might suppose from smash lucky did turn over then know engine come on top of be done doctor arrived after tea with bag stethoscope in small coffin like box pope mr magnet withdrew while sir rupert be carefully sounded tested scrutinized questioned watched examined in way known to medical science outcome of conference be presently communicated to pope by mr trafford doctor sir rupert be not very seriously injured be suffering from concussion shock two of rib be broken wrist sprained unless perhaps one of small bone be displaced ought to be bandaged up put to bed must said mr pope doctor assured own house be quite best place there sir rupert must stay for day at present cross country journey over down by south eastern railway must be needlessly trying painful must with pope permission lie quietly where be for hour so then doctor must come with couple of men carrying bed have take off to own house there must be a mr trafford said a right a ninepence mr trafford must put up at red lion with mr magnet in little cottage next door to doctor mr trafford elected for latter a closer to friend a for smashed aeroplane telegram must be sent at once to sir rupert engineer at chesilbury must have cleared away by mid day to morrow doctor departed sir rupert after stimulant closed eye mr trafford seated at tea thing for more cake a though introduction by aeroplane be most regular thing in world have very pleasant easy manner entire absence of self consciousness quick talkative disposition that made very rapidly at home with everybody described sensation of flight early lesson experiment in utmost detail event of afternoon have led to disastrous adventure made suggestion of trying thing seem most natural impulse in world bulk of conversation fell on mr magnet save for intervention of one two jest be quietly observant rest be well disposed to listen a mr trafford talked eye rested ever again on marjorie with faintest touch of scrutiny perplexity too found curious little persuasion growing up in mind that somewhere somehow have met have talked rather earnestly how where eluded altogether have sat for hour men from doctor seemed never coming when mr pope returned unexpectedly from cricket match have ended little prematurely in rot on over dry wicket be full of particular of day play how wiper have got most amazing catch held though fell how jenks have deliberately bowled at man head believed little gibbs thrown man out from slip be burning to tell in utmost detail to magnet family so that might at least share retrospect of pleasure have thought out rather good pun on wiper be naturally little thwarted to find good rich talk crowded out by more engrossing topic at sight of stranger grouped in popular manner beside tea thing displayed slight acerbity be if anything increased by discovery of prostrate person with large brown eye expression of oriental patience disdain in shade of bush near by at first seemed scarcely to grasp mr pope explanation regarded sir rupert with expression bordered on malevolence then when attention be directed to smashed machine upon lawn broke out into loud indignant good god what next walked towards wreckage disregarding mr trafford beside man ca go away from house for hour complained can assure did must to prevent said trafford ought never to have have to prevent said mr pope be friend hurt rib shock said trafford well deserves said mr pope rather than launch into air in one of infernal thing 'd be stood against wall shot taste differ of course said trafford with unruffled urbanity will have cleared away said mr pope mechanic oh complete break down party be speeding to in fast motor said trafford thanks to kindness of domestic in taking telegram for hope wo kill one said mr pope just for moment conversation hung fire friend asked go in next ten minute well whenever litter come from doctor poor old solomonson solomonson sir rupert oh said mr pope be that pigmentation solomonson believe doe do beastly company of sort said trafford be amazing did smash engine sir rupert solomonson be indeed familiar name to mr pope have organized exploitation of number of pigment bye product patent ordinary deferred share of syndicate have risen to so high price a to fill mr pope with utmost confidence in future indeed have bought considerably withdrawing capital to do so from argentine railway whose stock have awakened distaste sort of moral aversion by slumping heavily after bad wheat linseed harvest discovery did much to mitigate first asperity next remark to trafford be almost neutral be even asking sir rupert whether must do anything to make comfortable when doctor returned with litter borne by four hastily compiled bearer sec brightness seemed to vanish when buoyant mr trafford still undauntedly cheerful limped off after more injured friend disappeared through gate marjorie found in world whose remaining manhood declined to see anything extreme annoyance in gay exciting rupture of afternoon good god said mr pope what next what next registration hope said mr magnet relegation to desert of sahara one good thing about said pope waste petrol when petrol supply give out be done certainly might have be killed said mr pope feeling have to bear witness against visitor added if have moved out of way be there be simultaneous movement towards shattered apparatus about small contingent of villager who have availed of withdrawal of sentinel have now assembled look at said mr pope with bitter hostility look at everyone have anticipated command will never come to anything said mr pope after pause of silent hatred have to come to something said marjorie have come to smash said mr magnet with true humorist air consider impudence of invasion wild objectionableness of be nasty thing said mr magnet nasty thing curious spirit of opposition stirred in marjorie seemed to that men who play golf croquet watch cricket match have business to contemn men who risk life in air sought for controversial opening be engine rather wonderful remarked mr magnet regarded engine with head little on one side be usual sort said there be engine like twenty year ago there be people like twenty year ago said mr magnet smiling wisely kindly turned back on thing mr pope followed suit be filled with bitter thought that must never now be able to tell history of remarkable match have witnessed be spoilt for spoilt for ever everything be disturbed put out have left tennis lawn said with not unnatural resentment passing to invitation what do say magnet now have begun game must keep up if marjorie mr pope daffy said magnet mr pope declared house required so with gravest apprehension insincere compliment to father energy daffy marjorie made up foursome for healthy invigorating game that evening mr pope got serve well into bay of sagging net almost at once with marjorie in background taking anything left won quite easily everything became pleasant again magnet gloated upon marjorie served like missionary giving bible to heathen child seemed always looking at instead of ball except for slight disposition on part of daffy to slash nothing must have be more delightful at supper mr pope rather crushing wife attempt to recapitulate more characteristic saying doings of sir rupert friend did after succeed in giving one very good idea indeed of more remarkable incident of cricket match at wamping made pun have be accustomed to use upon name of wiper in new improved form general talk about cricket immense good of cricket followed mr pope said must make cricket playing compulsory for english boy everyone seemed to marjorie be forgetting that dark shape athwart lawn immense implication of presence with deliberate irrational skill noted that usual move towards garden at end of evening be not made sec in night time marjorie have dream that be flying about in world on monoplane with mr trafford a passenger then mr trafford disappeared be flying about alone with curious uneasy feeling that in minute so must be unable longer to manage machine then father mr magnet appeared very far below walking about disapproving of mr magnet be shaking head very very sagely saying rather stiff job for little marjorie father be saying must be steadier when married then be clear how engine refused to work until bill be paid began to fall fall fall towards mr magnet tried frantically to pay bill be falling down front of skyscraper precipice mr magnet be waiting for below with quiet kindly smile that grew wider wider wider woke up palpitating sec next morning curious restlessness came upon marjorie conceivably be due to absence of magnet who have gone to london to deliver long promised address on characteristic of english humour to literati club conceivably missed attention crystallized out in early afternoon into oddest form powerful craving to go to little town of pensting five mile off on other side of buryhamstreet to buy silk shoelace decided to go in donkey cart communicated intention to mother did not communicate equally definite intention to be reminded suddenly of sir rupert solomonson a be passing surgery make inquiry on spur of moment must surely be anything kindly justifiable impulse to do might see mr trafford perhaps there be particular harm in be also to be remarked that finding theodore little disposed to encumber vehicle with presence expressed delight at being released from need of going abandoned whole expedition to knowing a did perfectly well that if theodore hated anything more than navigating donkey cart alone be going unprotected into shop to buy article of feminine apparel until chucked whole project went fishing if one can call fishing when there be fish fisherman know in decadent ornamental water be also to be remarked that a marjorie approached surgery be seized with absurd powerful shyness so that not only did not call at surgery did not even look at surgery gazed almost rigidly straight ahead telling however that merely deferred that kindly impulse until have bought lace so happened that about mile beyond end of buryhamstreet came round corner upon trafford by singular fatality also be driving donkey rather be tracing fan like pattern on road with donkey hoof be very similar donkey to marjorie vehicle be governess cart much smarter than marjorie turn out ingenuous face displayed great animation at sight of a drew alongside hailed with almost unnatural ease of manner hullo cried be taking air seem to be able to drive donkey forward how do do ca never done anything so dangerous in life before have just be missed by two motor car hung for terrible minute with left wheel on very verge of unfathomable ditch must hear little duckling far far below bit of mould dropping tried to count before splash be white why be doing must do something be bandaged up ca walk hurt leg more than knew doctor say solomonson wo talk of anything how feel care rap how feel so got thing came out with marjorie made inquiry there came little pause day one will believe that men be ever so foolish a to trust to draught animal remarked hullo look out horror of large oil van huge drum on wheel motor driven have come round corner after preliminary quite insufficient hoot bore down upon missing trafford a seemed by miracle swept past driver did wonderful thing with whip rein found alone in road again with wheel locked indefinite future leave situation to said trafford will just sit talk until next motor car kill ought to make effort said marjorie cheerfully descended to lead two beast assisted by elderly hedger who have be taking disregarded interest in for time separated wheel got two donkey abreast old hedger opinion of safety on king highway be expressed by action rather than word directed beast towards shady lane opened at right angle to road stood by bridle while marjorie resumed seat seems to clearly case for compromise said trafford want to go way want to go way let go way be by such arrangement civilization becomes possible dismissed hedger generously resumed rein will race asked with leg inquired with donkey say be rather lark at first thought be dangerous dull thing have changed be in beastly high spirit feel there will be cry before night still be wanted companionship of unbroken person be so jolly to meet again again after year before last after year before last did know said trafford have met before how aggressive must have seemed well be quite clear spent greater part of last night ankle being foolish in small hour in trying to remember how where remember said marjorie remembered very distinctly thing thought about not where have happened then in night got be puzzle be see be

woman be correct by rote unintelligent in such question a doe matter rap about anything of sort whether be correct not a long a mental gesture be right paused for moment a though tired of sentence remembered proceeded in easy detached manner seemed to make topic possible to tell first impression of show how very distinctly indeed remembered set philosophizing 'd never examined girl school before be suddenly struck by spectacle of fifty of what be going to become of thought went on how bright be how keen eager be mean in particular just how certain be brightness eagerness must be swallowed up by silly ordinariness other stuffy marriage stuffy domestic duty old old story done over again with sort of threadbare badness nothing to say against if be done well got quite sentimental pathetic about life breach of faith with woman odd be how one mind run on be what thought be come back to be bright clear eye came round to see very much wrong with lot of woman reflected thing be different nowadays anyhow paused want to be man be emphatic of cut more sharply at life than think said plumbing unspoken sense have never met man before who understood just how girl can feel slow obtuseness of sex be almost a if have found out at something oh said perhaps do looked at with increased interest be half feminine believe said for instance have got just woman joy in texture little significant shape know how feel about can spend hour even now in crystal gazing mean to see silly revelation of silly person proceeding somewhere just for thing wonder if have ever be in natural history museum at south kensington looked at ruskin crystal collection saw when be boy became ca help word obsession inclusion like moss like tree sort of fantastic thing cleavage enclosure with little bubble light shimmer what be talking about oh about keen way feminine perception cut into thing yet somehow be throwing contempt on feminine intelligence do justice to order of thought never mind have lost thread wish knew mother went on while marjorie be still considering proper response to see be only son brought up know other oh very well help with work understands nearly of make suggestion to day know if be most original most parasitic of creature be way with woman girl seems to be a critical a light a undiscriminating say do strike a talking nonsense not bit said marjorie do

of wonderland can assure work sometimes like man who be exploring magic palace do know anything of molecular physic examined said sense one have of exquisite wonderful rhythm just beyond sound sight there be taunting suggestion of being there displayed confessed if only one be quick enough to see why for instance when change composition of felspar almost imperceptibly do angle change what be correspondence between altered angle substituted atom why doe bit of clear stuff swing ray of light so much out of path that swing more then what happens when crystal gutter down go into solution endless launching of innumerable little craft think what clear solution must be if only one have ultra microscopic eye must see into see extraordinary patternings swimming circling constellation then path of ray of polarized light beating through take like music do know anything of effect of polarized light sight of slice of olivine gabbro for instance between crossed nicols have seen rock section

about went back to debacle of game sec after mr trafford have one clear desire in being ruled other desire wanted long frank unembarrassed uninterrupted conversation with marjorie have very strong impression that marjorie wanted exactly same thing for week besieged situation in vain after fourth day solomonson be only kept in buryhamstreet by sheer will power exerted with brutality threatened to end friendship abruptly went home on sixth day in largest car trafford stayed on beyond limit of decency to perform incomprehensible service that spoke of a clearing up want said to clear up what

be going off trafford conviction that marjorie also wanted with almost equal eagerness same opportunity for speech explanation that desired sustained in series of unjustifiable intrusion upon seclusion of pope although manner of mr mr pope did change considerably for better after next visit be extraordinary how impossible seemed for marjorie to achieve common end of encounter always something intervened in first place mr pope disposition to optimism have got better of earlier discretion casual glance at daphne face when visitor reappeared started quite new thread of interpretation in mind have taken opportunity of hinting at when mr pope asked over shirt stud night what devil that chauffeur chap meant by always calling in afternoon now will magnet monopolizes marjorie said after little pause rustle so see why daffy must have little company of own age mr pope turned round stared at did think of said anyhow like fellow seems to be rather clever said mr pope though certainly talk too much after be sir rupert aeroplane be only driving to oblige will think twice before drive said mr pope wrenching off collar once mr pope have turned imagination in more more agreeable direction be rather disposed be afraid to let bolt with be deflection that certainly fell in very harmoniously with certain secret speculation of daphne trafford too being quite unused to sort of social furtiveness did perhaps in order to divert attention from preoccupation with marjorie attend more markedly to daphne than must otherwise have done so presently found daphne almost continuously on hand so far a be concerned might have told entire history of life secret have in world without let hindrance mr pope too showed growing appreciation of company became sympathetic confidential in way invited confidence threw lot of light on family history daffy character have found daffy wonderful study said mr pope too seemed partly reconciled to idea that after motor car monoplane be sir rupert not trafford have produced reaction in latter gentleman favour moreover have occurred to that trafford accident have perhaps disposed towards more thoughtful view of mechanical traction that tendency must be greatly helped by little genial chaff so that ceased to go indoors when trafford be there hung about meditating delivering sly dig at new victim of ripe old fashioned did help trafford in quest for marjorie free outspoken delivery that pseudo twin considered person of very considerable charm that theodore though indisposed to suck up to publicly write here in

fourth day of emotional incubation marjorie be thinking of trafford to exclusion of reading trafford be lying awake at night oh for hour more thinking of bold decisive way of getting at marjorie bold decisive thing to say to when did why must be engaged to magnet continued nevertheless to puzzle extremely be puzzle to complete solution be ever to be forthcoming sec at last that opportunity came marjorie have come with mother into village while mr pope made purchase at general shop walked on to speak to mr blythe washerwoman trafford suddenly emerged from red lion with soda syphon under arm

knew trafford might be excellent match behind must be invader of guarded mind prowled even worse one doubt horrible disloyal doubt about wisdom kindness of mr pope quite early in life mr pope have realized that be necessary to be very careful with one thought lead to trouble have clipped wing of own mind therefore so successfully that conclusion have become evasion decision compromise profoundest working conviction be belief that nothing in world be of value tact that art of living be to tide thing over here seemed almost beyond strength to achieve sort of tiding over why must mr

enough concluded be infernally right said trafford very well said solomonson now can get to business sec immediate business be systematic exploitation of fact that trafford have worked out problem of synthesizing indiarubber have done so with entire indifference to commercial possibility of case because have be irritated by enormous publicity given to behrens assertion that have achieved long sought end of course production of artificial rubber rubber like substance have be one of activity of synthetic chemist for many year from appearance of tilden isoprene rubber onward there be already formidable list of collateral dimethybutadiene so forth by coveted goal must be approached behrens have boldly added to list a own number of variation upon theme of trafford originally designed to settle certain curiosity about elasticity behrens product be not only more massively rubber like than anything have gone before also extremely cheap to produce bold announcement of success have produced check in rubber sale widespread depression in quiveringly sensitive market of plantation share solomonson have consulted trafford about matter at vevey have heard with infinite astonishment that trafford have already roughly prepared be proposing to complete publish unpatented absolutely unprotected first smashing demonstration of unsoundness of behrens claim then lucid exposition of just what have to be done what must be done to make indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from natural product business man must not believe ear dear chap positively must solomonson have screamed have opened finger humped shoulder for public school university training lapsed undisguisedly into oriental see be throwing away squealed suppose be quality to throw such thing away said trafford when at last solomonson point of view became clear to have embarked upon long rambling discussion of issue of publication discussion be now taking up again when men dropped that idea of concealing knowledge alchemist gave place to chemist said trafford be worth having in modern life make better safer more hopeful than ancient life began dear fellow said solomonson know know to give away synthesis of rubber to just shove out of window into street gare l'eau o when must do with so much too now resumed divergent thread of vevey talk solomonson have always entertained warmest friendship admiration for trafford be new thing that must desire business co operation have be working for in old day at riplings have never altogether let possibility drop out of sight between in spite of

fixed barrier unsurmountable condition to trained investigator commonplace mind must yield to gift of magic inquiry must startle accepted error into self betrayal other men might play game of business infinitely better than solomonson knew indeed quite well that must play game infinitely better than trafford rested with trafford by right divine of genius to alter rule if only must be induced to alter rule secretly unostentatiously on business footing instead of making catastrophic plunge into publicity everything have made trafford up to day of marriage be antagonistic to such strategic reservation servant of science have a such concern with personal consequence business be steady relentless clarification of knowledge human affair change wealth make destroys be concern of once thing weigh with become primary have lost honour a scientific man must think of consequence solomonson have cried during intermittent talk at vevey here be shying cheap synthetic rubber of yours into world for be bound to be cheap one can see that like bomb into market place what be good of saying care about market place that business be just to make bomb drop out of window smash up thing just same why will ruin hundred thousand of people people living on rubber share people working in plantation old inadaptable worker in rubber work sir rupert be now still little incredulous of trafford change of

begin planning necessary work forthwith large scale operation in process be to be protected a far a possible by patent essential feature addition of specific catalytic agent must be safely dealt with a secret process hate secrecy said trafford business interjected solomonson went on with exposition of relative advantage of secrecy patent right be matter of just how many people have to trust a

child distribution of early strawberry among trafford have two note in correspondence threw new light upon reconstruction of norton batsford company in be interested formed definite conclusion upon situation went quite normally to study telephone to act upon that be only a morning wore on that became real to that marjorie have decided to leave world then with norton batsford business settled sat at desk mused apathy passed imagination began to present first one picture then of retreat walked along oxford street to club thinking soon will be out of by time be at lunch in club labrador have become again magic refuge have seemed day before after lunch went to work in library finding out book about labrador looking up detail of journey sense of futility hopeless oppression have vanished walked along corridor down great staircase without trace of despairful hostility of previous day passed blenkins talking grey bosh with infinite thoughtfulness nodded easily to blenkins be going out of a man might do who discovers after year of weary incarceration that wall of cell be made of thin paper time when blenkins seemed part of prison house of routine invincible stupidity seemed ten age ago in pall mall trafford remarked lady grampians countess of claridge two woman of great influence in big green car on way doubt to create sustain destroy seemed to that be limitless age since poor old dear with ridiculous hat ridiculous air luncheon dinner dirty aggressive old mind have sent tidal wave of competitive anxiety into home found jostling through shopping crowd on sunny side of regent street felt now that looked over swarming preoccupied head at distant thing marjorie be going out of going clean out of be going to escape from society shopping petty engagement incessant triviality a bird fly up out of weed sec marjorie fluctuated more than did there be time when expedition for be now preparing rapidly methodically seemed to most adventurously beautiful thing have ever come to time when seemed maddest most hopeless of eccentricity there be time when have devastating premonition of filth hunger strain fatigue damp cold when whole being recoiled from project when must even think of staying secure in london letting go alone developed complicated anxiety for child found reason for further inquiry for delay why not suggested wait year no said wo mean be to do do now nothing sheer physical inability to do will prevent carrying out of course be to come ca drag shrieking way to labrador short of be going to make come with sat looked up at with dark light in upturned eye little added warmth in cheek have never forced will like before said in low voice never be too intent upon own resolve to heed tone have seemed necessary somehow said considering statement now doe be something final said be final found old familiar phrasing running through head a sat crouched together looking up at rather gaunt very intent face speech of woman echoing to across vast space of year whither thou goest will go in labrador began chapter third pilgrimage to lonely hut sec marjorie be surprised to find how easy be at last to part from child go with trafford be not sorry said not bit sorry be fearfully afraid will dream be ill apart from that be strange how grip in train to liverpool watched trafford with queer feeling come to husband wife at time that other partner be indeed undiscovered stranger just beginning to show perplexing trait full of inconceivable possibility for reason tearing up by root in fashion have fascinated imagination felt strange new wonder at have in just pleasant faint flavour of fear always before have felt curious aversion contempt for servile woman who be said to seek master to want to be mastered to be eager even for physical subjugation of brute force now must at least understand sympathize even with not only trafford surprised found be in unwonted perplexing series of mood feeling struck now a being incorrect a well a unexpected not only have life become suddenly full of novelty be making novel response felt that ought to be resentful tragically sorry for home child felt departure ought to have quality of immense sacrifice desperate heroic undertaking for trafford sake instead must detect little beyond adventurous exhilaration when presently walked deck of steamer be to take to st john have visited cabin seen luggage stowed away now surveyed mersey shipping with renewed freshness of mind be reminded of day now nearly nine year ago when have crossed sea for first time to italy then too trafford have seemed being of infinitely wonderful possibility be child doing ought to have be preoccupation did know did care trafford came stood beside pointed out that upon landing stage no longer heavily sullen alert interested almost gay of must find way to great discussion have set out upon in voyage to st john there be plenty of time before plenty of time be prey of uneasy distraction seems inevitable quality of passenger steamship surveyed criticized fellow traveller prowled up down through long swaying day cold dark night slept uneasily amidst fog horn hootings startling sound of wave swirling against port marjorie have never have long sea voyage before for first time in life saw world through succession of day a circle of endless blue water with star planet sun moon rising sharply from rim until one have have voyage one really understands that old earth be watery globe ran into thirty hour of storm subsided then came slow time among iceberg hooting dreary passage through fog first three iceberg be marvel rest bore passing collier out of course pitching heavily lonely black dirty ship with manner almost derelict filled thought for day mind be in state of tedious inactivity eager for such small interest only capable of such small interest there be hurry to talk agreed hurry at until be settled away ahead there among snow there will have plenty of time for everything came landfall then st john found side by side watching town draw near thought of landing transference to ship refreshed be going trafford said in search of god be far more like two child starting out upon holiday sec there be trouble procrastination about half breed guide that trafford have arranged must meet at st john be three week from reaching newfoundland before got guide equipment general store aboard boat for port dupre thence have planned must go in gibson schooner to manivikovik marconi station at mouth of green river thence past new pulp mill up river to wilderness there be delay few trivial troublesome complication in carrying out scheme at last day came when trafford must wave good bye to seven people eleven dog constituted population of peter hammond last rude outpost of civilization twenty mile above pulp mill turn face in good earnest towards wilderness marjorie looked back at headland for last glimpse of little settlement be leaving stared ahead over broad smooth sweep of water broken by one transverse bar of foaming willow scanned low tree clad hill beyond drew together at last in distant gorge out of river came morning be warm full of promise of hot noon so that veil wore against assault of sand fly mosquito be already little inconvenient seemed incredible in morning glow that wooded slope along shore of lake be border of land in nearly inhabitant die of starvation deep laden canoe swept almost noiselessly through water with rhythmic alternation of rush pause a dripping paddle drove returned altogether there be four long canoe five indian breed in party when came to pas through willow marjorie trafford took paddle came to throat of gorge towards noon found strong flowing deep water between high purple cliff hand have to paddle again be only when came to rest in pool to eat mid day meal afterwards to land upon mossy corner for stretch smoke marjorie discovered peculiar beauty of rock about on dull purplish grey surface played most extraordinary mist of luminous iridescence fascinated here be land whose common substance have gemlike opalescence attention be very soon withdrawn from glancing splendour have have to put aside veil to eat presently felt vividly painful stab of black fly discovered blood upon face bigger fly size something of appearance of small wasp with evil buzz also assailed trafford be bad corner for fly breed even be slapping wrist swearing under torment one be glad to embark push on up winding gorge opened out for time then wooded shore crept in again in half hour saw ahead of long rush of foaming water among tumbled rock poured down from brimming splashing line of light against sky crossed river ran canoe into eddy under shelter of big stone began to unload have reached first portage rest of first day be spent in packing lugging first cargo then canoe up through thicket over boulder across stretch of reindeer moss for better part of two mile to camping ground about way up rapid marjorie trafford tried to help with carrying evidently shocked distressed men too much so desisted set to work cutting wood gathering moss for fire bedding for camp when iron stove be brought up man who have carried showed how to put up on stake start fire in then trafford went to river to get water marjorie made kind of flour cake in frying pan in manner american woman from wilderness have once shown boiled water for tea twilight have deepened to night while men be still stumbling up trail with last two canoe gave curiously homeless feeling to stand there in open with sunset dying away below black scrubby outline of treetop uphill to northwest to realize nearest roof be already day toilsome journey away cool night breeze blew upon bare face arm for now insect have ceased from troubling have cast aside glove veil turned up sleeve to cook air be full of tumult of rapid tearing seaward over rock below struggling through bush towards be immense headless quadruped with unsteady leg hesitating pace two of men carrying last canoe two others be now assisting trafford to put up little tent be to shelter fifth be kneeling beside very solemnly respectfully cutting slice of bacon for to fry air be very sweet wished must sleep not in tent under open sky be queer thought how much of wrapping of civilization have slipped from already day of journey from london have released deprived hardly knew of multitude of petty comfort easy accessibility afternoon toil uphill intensified effect of having clambered up out of thing to loneliness twilight openness simplicity men ate apart at fire made for after trafford marjorie have supped on damper bacon tea smoked be too healthily tired to talk very much there be moon frosty brilliance of star air have be hot sultry at mid day grew keen penetrating after have made tell name of constellation have forgotten suddenly perceived wisdom of tent went into be sweet wonderful with sprig of labrador tea shrub undressed have hardly rolled up into cocoon of blanket before be fast asleep be awakened by blaze of sunshine pouring into tent smell of fried bacon trafford voice telling to get up have gone on with first load said get up wrap in blanket come bathe in river be a cold a ice blinked at be stiff asked be stiffer before bathed said took tin offered be to see china cup again for year be woman work getting tea said a drank ca be squaw at once said trafford sec after marjorie have taken dip dried roughly behind bush twisted hair into pigtail coiled under hat amused trafford a clambered up through rock willow to tent again by cataloguing apparatus of bath toilette at sussex square tracing just when how have parted from item on way to place say cried with sudden sharp note of dismay have soap be last cake almost never thought of soap said trafford spoke again presently turn back for soap said turn back for anything said marjorie still did count on soapless winter will manage something said trafford little doubtfully trust chemist that day finished portage came out upon wide lake with sloping shore distant view of snow topped mountain lake so willow that at time loaded canoe scraped on glaciated rock below have to alter course camped in lurid sunset night be warm mosquito be troublesome towards morning came thunderstorm wind rain dawn broke upon tearing race of wave wild drift of slanting rain sweeping across lake before gale marjorie peered out at a one peer out under edge of umbrella be manifestly impossible to go on did nothing that day run up canvas shelter for men shift tent behind thicket of tree out of full force of wind men squatted stoically smoked yarned everything got coldly wet for most part traffords sat under tent stared blankly at summer day in labrador now said trafford ought to begin talking there be nothing much to do else said marjorie only one ca begin said trafford be silent for time be getting out of thing said next day began with fine drizzle through sun broke suddenly about ten o'clock made start at once got good dozen mile up lake before be necessary to camp again marjorie trafford felt stiff weary uncomfortable day secretly little doubtful now of own endurance camped on island on turf amidst slippery rock next day be in foaming difficult river again with glittering willow obliged one to get out at time to wade push through afternoon be greatly beset by fly so worked way on through third day journey towards silent inland of labrador day followed day of toilsome often tedious travel fought rapid waited while men stumbled up long portage under vast load going returning camped discussed difficulty alternative fly sustained unrelenting persecution until face be scarred in spite of veil smoke fire until wrist neck be swollen blood in fever a got higher higher towards central plateau mid day heat increased night grew colder until must find toiling wet with perspiration over rock sheltered fringe of ice beneath shadow first fatigue lassitude shrinking from cold water ache of muscular effort gave place to tougher tougher endurance skin seemed to have lost capacity for pain without losing tithe of discrimination muscle attained steely resilience be getting seasoned feel philosophical said trafford feel well be getting out of thing suppose be getting out of problem one day a paddled across mile long pool saw three bear prowling in single file high up on hillside look said man pointed with paddle at big soft furry black shape magnified startling in clear air canoe rippled to stop men at first still whispered softly one passed gun to trafford who hesitated looked at air of tranquil assurance about three huge loafing monster have queer effect on marjorie mind made feel that be at home that be intruder have never in life seen big wild animal except in menagerie have developed sort of unconscious belief that big wild animal be in menagerie nowadays spectacle of beast entirely at large startled there be never bar between creature felt sleeping self might thought do desperate thing to feeble men woman who came way will take shot asked trafford said marjorie pervaded by desire for mutual toleration let be big brute disappeared in gully reappeared came out against skyline one by one vanished too long shot said trafford handing back gun journey lasted altogether month never once did come upon human being save though in one place passed pole for most part overthrown of old indian encampment desolation be by mean lifeless saw great quantity of waterbird goose diver arctic partridge like became familiar with banshee cry of loon lived very largely on goose partridge then for time about string of lake country be alive with migrating deer going south men found trace of wolf killed six caribou stayed to skin cut up dry meat to replace bacon have consumed caught fried ate great quantity of trout became accustomed to mysterious dance of northern light a sunset afterglow faded everywhere except in river gorge country displayed low hummocky line tarn like pool of intensely glaciated land everywhere be carpeted with reindeer moss growing upon peat variegated by bush of flowering sweet smelling labrador tea in place be starred with little harebell diversified by tussock of heather rough grass over rock trailed delicate dwarf shrub very pretty fragrant pink flowered plant of trafford knew name there be astonishing amount of wild fruit raspberry cranberry white kind of strawberry be very delightful weather after first outbreak remained brightly serene at last seemed fit to trafford to halt choose winter quarter chose place on side of low razor hacked rocky mountain ridge about fifty foot above river have now dwindled to thirty foot stream site be near tributary rivulet gave convenient water in kind of lap sheltered between two rocky knee bearing thicket of willow balsam not dozen mile away from now reckoned be height of land low watershed between water go to atlantic go to hudson bay close beside site have chosen shelf of rock ran out gave glimpse up narrow rocky valley of green river upper water broad prospect of hill tarn towards south east north north east of country rose to line of low crest with here there yellowing patch of last year snow across valley be slope covered in place by wood of stunted pine have empty spaciousness of effect one continually living thing seemed to be green river hurrying headlong noisily perpetually in eternal flight from high desolation bird be rare here insect buzzed shrilled tormented among rock willow in gorge came sparingly up slope to here presently said trafford will be in peace be very lonely said marjorie nearer to god think not one of hill have ever have name well might be in other planet oh will christen that will be marjorie ridge that rag valley space will be oh bayswater before have done with place feature of will be a familiar a sussex square more so for house there must be stranger to if must see inside than anything in

of wood barren upper slope dust soiled survival of winter snowfall all contributed to effect at once carelessly desert hopelessly untidy looked westward memory be full of interminable streaming rapid waste of ice striated rock tiresome struggle through wood wild wide stretch of tundra tarn trackless treeless infinitely desolate seemed to that sea coast be step from london ten thousand mile away

great wilderness during decade followed that first tragic experiment in hubbard died that one not of indian esquimaux blood must propose to face out labrador winter be new thing to be really very sceptical at outset whether two highly civilized looking people must ever get up to height of land at be still with manifest incredulity that set about building of hut construction of sleeping bunk for have brought up planking stream of speculative talk have flowed along beside marjorie trafford ever since have entered green river did so much come to end a get cut off at last by necessity of

night seemed to talk of nothing else indulged in boldest hypothesis even in theory that trafford knew of deposit of diamond gold must trust one wife with secret seemed also attracted by idea that two young people have done something lean with memory of tattered sixpenny novel have drifted into hand from england have even notion of elopement of pursuing husband vindictive wife be young romantic seemed incredible must suggest that marjorie be royal princess yet there be moment when manner betrayed more than personal respect one night after hard day portage mackenzie be inspired by brilliant

rotten ice trail crossed turning sharply uphill went on until be clear of shrub tree in windy open of upper slope crossed ridge came over lip of large desolate valley with slope of ice icy snow here spent time in following loop back on homeward trail before saw what be manifestly final trail running far away out across snow with spoor of lynx lightly dotted line to right of followed suggestion of trail put on snowshoe shuffled way across valley opened a proceeded hoped that over ridge must find trafford scanned sky for faintest discolouration of fire there be none seemed odd to wind be in face perhaps beat smoke down then a eye scanned hummocky ridge ahead saw something something very intent still that brought heart into mouth be big grey wolf standing with back haunched head down watching winding something beyond there out of sight marjorie have instinctive fear of wild animal still seemed dreadful to that must go at large uncaged suddenly wanted trafford violently wanted by side also thought of leaving trail going back to bush have to take herself in hand in waste one did not fear wild beast one have fear of why not fire shot to let know be near beast flashed round with animal instantaneous change of pose looked at for couple of second perhaps woman brute regarded one across quarter of mile of snowy desolation suppose came towards must fire must fire at made guess at range aimed very carefully saw snow fly two yard ahead of grisly shape then in instant have vanished over crest reloaded stood for moment waiting for trafford answer answer came queer whispered queer suddenly such horror of anticipation assailed that started running floundering through snow to escape twice called name once just stopped from firing shot over ridge must find surely must find over ridge found among rock there be beaten trampled place where trafford must have waited crouched then on down slope of tumbled boulder there came patch where have thrown down fallen seemed to must have

forced brandy between teeth then after moment hesitation poured little brandy on wound glanced at leg be surely broken back at face then gave more brandy eyelid flickered moved hand weakly blood said kept getting in eye gave brandy once again wiped face glanced at leg something ought to be done to that thought thing must be done in order stared up at darkling sky with grey promise of snow down slope of mountain clearly must stay night here be too high for wood among rock three four hundred yard below there be number of dwarfed fir tree have brought axe so that fire be possible must go back to camp get tent trafford be trying to speak again got said yes got leg in crack damn damned nuisance be able to advise looked at then perceived must bind up head face knelt behind raised head on knee

knee have raised on elbow afterwards asked build fire wood down there two bit of wood tied on leg splint then can drag see like blessed old walrus smiled kissed bandaged face again else hurt apologized more than can stand stood up again thought put rifle knife to hand for fear of lurking wolf abandoning own rifle with effort went striding leaping from rock to rock towards tree below made chip fly be presently towing three venerable pine dwarf bumping over rock crevice back to trafford flung down stood for moment bright breathless then set to hack off splint needed from biggest stem now said coming to fool remarked must have made splint down there be good marjorie lugged leg out straight put into natural least painful pose padded with moss torn handkerchief bound up a did so handful of snowflake came whirling about be now braced up to possibility never rain said grimly pours went on with bone setting be badly weakened by pain shock once swore at sharply sorry said rolled

bough tree determined must not start fire until nightfall waste time in preparing food until then there be dead bough for kindling more than enough be snowing quite fast by time got up to with second load premature twilight already obscured exaggerated rock mound about gave of cheese to trafford gnawed herself on way down to wood again regretted that have brought neither candle lantern because then might have kept on until cold of night stopped reproached bitterly because have brought no tea must forgive lantern have never expected to be out after dark tea be inexcusable muttered reproach while worked like two men among tree panting puff of mist that froze upon lip iced knitted wool covered chin why teach girl to handle axe when at last wolfish cold of labrador night have come found trafford marjorie seated almost warmly on bed of pine bough between sheltering dark rock behind big well husbanded fire in front drinking queer tasting not unsavory soup of lynx flesh that have fortified with remainder of brandy then tried roast lynx ate little finished with scrap of cheese deep draught of hot water then oh tyburnia chelsea be becoming smoked trafford pipe for alternate minute marjorie found great comfort in snowstorm poured incessantly out of darkness to become flake of burning fire in light of flame flake that vanished magically only reached wetted in occasional gust what did matter for moment if dim snow heap rose rose about glorious fatigue immense self satisfaction possessed marjorie felt that have done well be not afraid of to morrow now said at last

fluid thinly skinned against evaporation wrapped about with woven wool skin of beast yet reflected perceived suffered sought to understand held million memory framed thought plumbed deep of space time day of snow icy wind might leave just scattered bone torn rag gnawed by famishing wolf felt passionate desire to pray glanced at trafford beside found awake staring face be very pale strange in livid flickering light must have spoken then saw lip be moving something something did not understand held back from doing so sec bleak slow dawn found marjorie intently busy have made up fire boiled water washed dressed trafford wound made soup of lynx trafford have weakened in night stuff nauseated refused tried to smoke be sick then sat back rather despairfully after second attempt to persuade to leave there to die failure of spirit distressed little astonished only made more resolute to go through with work have awakened cold stiff weary fatigue vanished with movement toiled for hour replenishing pile of fuel made up fire put gun ready to hand kissed abused lovingly for trouble gave until poor torn face lit in response then parting on note of cheerful confidence set out to return to hut found way not altogether easy to make out wind snow have left scarcely trace of track mind be full of store must bring possibility of moving nearer to hut be startled to see by fresh deep spoor along ridge how near wolf have dared approach in darkness ever again marjorie have to halt look back to get direction right a be came through willow scrub nearly mile above hut have to follow steep bank of frozen river down at one place nearly slipped upon icy slope of rock one possibility did not dare to think of during time blizzard now must cut off absolutely from return to trafford short of believed must get through quick mind be full of have to do at first have thought chiefly of immediate necessity of food sort of shelter have got list of thing in head meat extract bandage corrosive sublimate by way of antiseptic brandy tin of beef bread so forth went over several time to be sure of then for time puzzled about tent thought must manage bale of blanket on back that must rig sleeping tent for herself trafford with one bent stick big tent must be too much to strike shift then mind went on to bolder enterprise be to get home nearer must bring to log hut nearer must be to supply cast about for sort of sledge snow be too soft broken for runner especially among tree if must get flat of smooth wood thought might be able to drag decided to try side of bunk must easily get that off must have of course to run edgewise through thicket across ravine after must have almost clear going until reached steep place of broken rock within two hundred yard of idea of sledge grew upon planned to nail rope along edge make kind of harness for found camping place piled high with drifted snow have invaded tent hut that beast wolverine guessed have be into hut devoured candle end upper of trafford well greased second boot have then gone to corner of store shed clambered up to store made account of depredation there set to make sledge get supply together there be gleam of sunshine did not like look of sky be horribly afraid of what might be happening to trafford carried stuff through wood across ravine returned for improvised sledge be still struggling with among tree when began to snow again be hard then not to be frantic in effort a be packed stuff so loosely on planking that have to repack started without putting on snowshoe floundered fifty yard before discovered that omission snow be now falling fast darkling sky hiding everything object close at hand have to use wit to determine direction knew must go down long slope then up to ridge came to a happy inspiration that if bore to left might strike recognizable vestige of morning trail have read of people walking in circle when have light guidance troubled until bethought of little compass on watch chain by kept direction wished very much have timed across waste so that must tell when approached ridge soon back shoulder be aching violently rope across chest be tugging like evil tempered thing did not dare to rest snow be now falling thick fast flake traced white spiral made head spin so that be constantly falling away to south westward then correcting by compass tried to think how zig zagging might affect course snow whirl confused mind growing anxiety must not let pause to think felt blinded seemed to be snowing inside eye so that wanted to rub soon ground must rise to ridge told must surely rise then sledge came bumping at heel perceived be going down hill consulted compass found be facing south turned sharply to right again snowfall became noiseless pitiless torture to

on between life together intellectual life be only just growing clear in own mind be just a if one turned up light on something have always be there be most extraordinary thing to think out marjorie that antagonism love have kept so close together always purpose have be like that spread divergent hand have speculated again again whether there be something incurably antagonistic between woman be generalized marjorie men be directly pas beyond condition of individualistic struggle believe couple of lover who have ever married have felt that strain yet be not difference in kind between degree
