of golden dragon displayed appreciation of delightful morsel have swallowed a incidental consequence of distraction mr hoopdriver be for minute greatly inconvenienced by mouthful of mustard after have called for reckoning went courage being high with meat mustard to door intending to stand with leg wide apart hand deep in pocket stare boldly across road just then other man in brown appeared in gateway of golden dragon yard be one of delightful inn date from coaching day wheeling punctured machine be taking to flambeau repairer looked up saw hoopdriver stared for minute then scowled darkly hoopdriver remained stoutly in doorway until other man in brown have disappeared into flambeau then glanced momentarily at golden dragon puckered mouth into whistle of unconcern proceeded to wheel machine into road until sufficient margin for mounting be secured now at time say hoopdriver be rather desirous than not of seeing more of young lady in grey other man in brown guessed be brother albeit person be of pallid fairness differing essentially from rich colouring besides felt have made hopeless fool of afternoon be against intolerably hot especially on top of head virtue have gone out of leg to digest cold meat altogether ride to guildford be exceedingly intermittent at time must walk at time lounge by wayside public house in spite of briggs sentiment of economy meant lemonade dash of bitter for be experience of who go on wheel that drinking begets thirst even more than thirst begets drinking until at last man who yield becomes hell unto hell in fire dieth not thirst be not quenched until pennyworth of acrid green apple turned current threatened to carry away ever again cycle party of cyclist must go by with glittering wheel softly running chain on occasion to save self respect mr hoopdriver descended feigned trouble with saddle time descended with le trepidation did not reach guildford until nearly four o'clock then be so much exhausted that decided to put up there for night at yellow hammer coffee tavern after have cooled space refreshed with tea bread butter jam tea drank noisily out of saucer went out to loiter away rest of afternoon guildford be altogether charming old town famous so learnt from guide book a scene of master tupper great historical novel of stephen langton have delightful castle set about with geranium brass plate commemorating gentleman who put up guildhall be tudor building very pleasant to see in afternoon shop be busy people going to fro make pavement look bright prosperous be nice to peep in window see head of men girl in draper shop busy a busy serving away high street run down at angle of seventy degree to horizon so seemed to mr hoopdriver whose feeling for gradient be unnaturally exalted brought heart into mouth to see cyclist ride down like fly crawling down window pane man have even brake visited castle early in evening paid twopence to ascend keep at top from cage looked down over clustering red roof of town tower of church then going to southern side sat down lit red herring cigarette stared away south over old bramble bearing fern beset ruin at wave of blue upland rose one behind across weald to lazy altitude of hindhead butser pale grey eye be full of complacency pleasurable anticipation tomorrow must go riding across wide valley did not notice one else have come up keep after until heard soft voice behind saying well miss beaumont here be view something in accent pointed to jest in name be dear old town brother george answered voice sounded familiar enough turning head mr hoopdriver saw other man in brown young lady in grey with back towards turned smiling profile towards hoopdriver only know brother call sister glanced over shoulder saw hoopdriver damn said other man in brown quite audibly starting a followed glance mr hoopdriver with fine air of indifference resumed weald beautiful old town be said other man in brown after quite perceptible pause be said young lady in grey pause began ca get alone anywhere said other man in brown looking round then mr hoopdriver perceived clearly that be in way decided to retreat be just luck of course that must stumble at head of step vanish with indignity be third time that 'd seen fourth time of course be too big fat head to raise cap to thought of at foot of keep apparently aimed at south coast just a did 'd get up betimes next day hurry off to avoid be never occurred to mr hoopdriver that miss beaumont brother might do exactly same thing that evening at least peculiarity of brother calling sister miss beaumont did not recur to be much too preoccupied with analysis of own share of encounter found hard to be altogether satisfied about figure have cut revise memory a must once more quite unintentionally stumbled upon two people be about seven o'clock stopped outside linen draper peered over good in window at assistant in torment must have spent whole day happily at that told that be trying to see how dressed out brass line over counter in purely professional spirit down at very bottom of heart knew better customer be secondary consideration be only after lapse of perhaps minute that perceived that among be young lady in grey turned away from window at once saw other man in brown standing at edge of pavement regarding with very curious expression of face there came into mr hoopdriver head curious problem whether be to be regarded a nuisance haunting people whether be to be regarded a nuisance haunting abandoned solution at last in despair quite unable to decide upon course must take at next encounter whether must scowl savagely at couple assume attitude eloquent of apology propitiation x imaginings of mr hoopdriver heart mr hoopdriver be in day of story poet though have never written line of verse perhaps romancer will describe better like know not how many of who do fetching carrying of life great number of certainly real life be absolutely uninteresting if have faced a realistically a such people do in mr gissing novel must probably have come by way of drink to suicide in course of year be just what have natural wisdom not to do on contrary be always decorating existence with imaginative tag hope pose deliberate yet quite effectual self deception experience be mere material for romantic superstructure if power have given hoopdriver 'giftie burn invoked see oursels a ithers see ' must probably have given away to one else at very earliest opportunity entire life must understand be not continuous romance series of short story linked only by general resemblance of hero brown haired young fellow commonly with blue eye fair moustache graceful rather than strong sharp resolute rather than clever cp a scientific book say p invariably person possessed iron will story fluctuated indefinitely smoking of cigarette converted hoopdriver hero into something entirely worldly subtly rakish with humorous twinkle in eye gallant sinning in background must have seen mr hoopdriver promenading brilliant garden at earl court on early closing night meaning glance dare not give meaning such influence a eloquence of revivalist preacher must suffice to divert story into absolutely different channel make white soured hero man still pure walking untainted brave helpful through miry way appearance of daintily gloved frockcoated gentleman with buttonhole eyeglass complete gallantly attendant in rear of customer served again to start vision of simplicity essentially cromwell like of sturdy plainness of strong silent man going righteously through world day there have predominated fine leisurely person immaculately clothed riding on unexceptional machine mysterious person quite unostentatious with accidental self revelation of something over common even bloomin ' dook might be incognito on tour of south coast must not think that there be telling of story of life long series by mr hoopdriver never dreamt that be known to soul if be not for trouble

a mother proudly boasted 'bit of drawer ' conscientious normally stupid schoolmaster perceived incipient talent have nipped in bud by series of lesson in art however principal character figured about quite happily in old corner of guildford once other man in brown looking out of bay window of earl of kent saw standing in corner by gateway note book in hand busily sketching earl imposing feature at

very reluctantly indeed set about finishing great splendid day ala that day must end at last got candle in hall from friendly waiting maid passed upward whither modest novelist who writes for family circle dare not follow yet may tell that knelt down at bedside happy drowsy said father heaven even a have learnt by rote from mother nearly twenty year ago anon when breathing have become deep regular may creep into bedroom catch at dream be lying upon left side with arm under pillow be dark be hidden if must have seen face sleeping there in darkness think must have perceived in spite of treasured thin straggling moustache in spite of memory of coarse word have used that day that man before be after only little child asleep xii dream of mr hoopdriver in spite of drawn blind darkness have just seen mr hoopdriver face peaceful in beauty sleep in little plain bedroom at very top of yellow hammer coffee tavern at guildford be before midnight a night progressed be disturbed by dream after first day of cycling one dream be inevitable memory of motion lingers in muscle of leg round round seem to go ride through dreamland on wonderful dream bicycle change grow ride down steeple staircase over precipice hover in horrible suspense over inhabited town vainly seeking for brake hand can not find to save from headlong fall plunge into weltering river rush helplessly at monstrous obstacle anon mr hoopdriver found riding out of darkness of non existence pedalling ezekiel wheel across weald of surrey jolting over hill smashing village in course while other man in brown cursed swore at shouted to stop career there be putney heath keeper too man in drab raging at felt awful fool what be juggins ah juggernaut village went off one after with soft squashing noise did not see young lady in grey knew be looking at back dared not look round where devil be brake must have fallen off bell right in front of be guildford tried to shout warn town to get out of way voice be gone a well nearer nearer be fearful in moment house be cracking like nut blood of inhabitant squirting way that street be black with people running right under wheel saw young lady in grey feeling of horror came upon mr hoopdriver flung sideways to descend forgetting how high be forthwith began falling falling falling woke up turned over saw new moon on window wondered little went to sleep again second dream went back into first somehow other man in brown came threatening shouting towards grew uglier uglier a approached expression be intolerably evil came looked close into mr hoopdriver eye then receded to incredible distance face seemed to be luminous miss beaumont said splashed up spray of suspicion one began letting off firework chiefly catherine wheel down shop though mr hoopdriver knew be against rule for seemed that place be in be vast shop then mr hoopdriver perceived that other man in brown be shop walker differing from most shop walker in fact that be lit from within a chinese lantern might be customer mr hoopdriver be going to serve be young lady in grey curious have noticed before be in grey a usual rational have bicycle leaning against counter smiled quite frankly at just a have done when have apologised for stopping form a leant towards be full of sinuous grace have never noticed before what can have pleasure said mr hoopdriver at once said ripley road so got out ripley road unrolled showed to said must do very nicely kept on looking at smiling began measuring off eight mile by mean of yard measure on counter eight mile being dress length rational dress length be then other man in brown came up wanted to interfere said mr hoopdriver be cad besides measuring off too slowly a mr hoopdriver began to measure faster other man in brown said young lady in grey have be there long enough that be brother else must not be travelling with suddenly whipped arm about waist made off with occurred to mr hoopdriver even at moment that be scarcely brotherly behaviour of course be sight of other man gripping so familiarly enraged frightfully leapt over counter forthwith gave chase ran round shop up iron staircase into keep so out upon ripley road for time kept dodging in out of wayside hotel with two front door inn yard other man must not run very fast because have hold of young lady in grey mr hoopdriver be hampered by absurd behaviour of leg must not stretch out must keep going round round a if be on treadle of wheel so that made smallest step conceivable dream came to crisis chase seemed to last interminable time kind of people heathkeepers shopmen policeman old man in keep angry man in drab barmaid at unicorn men with flying machine people playing billiards in doorway silly headless figure stupid cock hen encumbered with parcel umbrella waterproof people carrying bedroom candle such like riffraff kept getting in way annoying although sounded electric bell said wonderful wonderful at corner xiii how mr hoopdriver went to haslemere there be little delay in getting mr hoopdriver breakfast so after be not free to start out of guildford until just upon stroke of nine wheeled machine from high street in perplexity did not know whether young lady who have seized hold of imagination so strongly unfriendly possibly menacing brother be ahead of even now breakfasting somewhere in guildford in former case might loiter a chose in latter must hurry possibly take refuge in branch road occurred to a being in obscure way strategic that must leave guildford not by obvious portsmouth road by road running through shalford along pleasant shady way felt sufficiently secure to resume exercise in riding with one hand off handle in staring over shoulder came over once twice fell on foot time perceived that be improving before got to bramley specious byway snapped up ran with for mile more dropped a terrier drop walkingstick upon portsmouth again couple of mile from godalming entered godalming on foot for road through delightful town be beyond dispute vilest in world mere tumult of road metal way of peak precipice after successful experiment with cider at woolpack pushed on to milford time be acutely aware of existence of young lady in grey companion in brown a child in dark be of bogy sometimes must hear pneumatics stealing upon from behind looking round saw long stretch of vacant road once saw far ahead of glittering wheel proved to be workingman riding to destruction on very tall ordinary felt curious vague uneasiness about young lady in grey for be altogether unable to account now that be awake have forgotten that accentuated miss beaumont have be quite clear in dream curious dream conviction that girl be not really man sister must not let be forgotten why for instance must man want to be alone with sister on top of tower at milford bicycle made so to speak as of finger post suddenly jumped out at vainly indicating abrupt turn to right mr hoopdriver must have slowed up read inscription bicycle must not let road dropped little into milford thing shied put down head bolted mr hoopdriver only thought of brake when fingerpost be passed then to have recovered point of intersection must have meant dismounting for a yet there be road wide enough for mr hoopdriver to turn in so went on way to be precise did exactly opposite thing road to right be portsmouth road be on went to haslemere midhurst by error came about that once more came upon fellow traveller of yesterday coming on suddenly without slightest preliminary announcement when least expected under southwestern railway arch be horrible said girlish voice be brutal cowardly stopped expression a shot out from archway at may have be something between grin of recognition scowl of annoyance at for unintentional intrusion disconcerted a be be yet able to appreciate something of peculiarity of mutual attitude bicycle be lying by roadside two rider stood face to face other man in brown attitude a flashed upon hoopdriver be deliberate pose twirled moustache smiled faintly be conscientiously looking amused girl stood rigid arm straight by side handkerchief clenched in hand face be flushed with faintest touch of red upon eyelid seemed to mr hoopdriver sense to be indignant be impression of second mask of surprised recognition fell across revelation of emotion a turned head towards pose of other man in brown vanished too in momentary astonishment then have passed be riding on towards haslemere to make what must of swift picture have photographed on brain rum said mr hoopdriver be dashed rum be having row smirking what called other man in brown need not trouble annoying that human being must do why impulse to interfere leapt suddenly into mr hoopdriver mind grasped brake descended stood looking hesitatingly back still stood by railway bridge seemed to mr hoopdriver fancy that be stamping foot hesitated then turned bicycle round mounted rode back towards gripping courage firmly lest must slip away leave ridiculous will offer 'im screw 'ammer said mr hoopdriver then with wave of fierce emotion saw that girl be cry in moment heard turned in surprise certainly have be cry eye be swimming in tear other man in brown looked exceedingly disconcerted mr hoopdriver descended stood over machine nothing wrong hope said looking other man in brown squarely in face accident nothing said other man in brown shortly nothing at thanks said mr hoopdriver with great effort young lady be cry thought perhaps young lady in grey started gave hoopdriver one swift glance covered one eye with handkerchief be speck said speck of dust in eye lady said other man in brown explaining have gnat in eye there be pause young lady busied with eye believe be out said other man in brown made movement indicating commiserating curiosity concerning alleged fly mr hoopdriver word be own stood flabber gastered have intuition of simple minded knew there be fly ground be suddenly cut from foot there be limit to knighterrantry dragon false knight be very well fly fictitious fly trouble be be evidently not affair felt have made fool of again must have mumbled sort of apology other man in brown gave time turned on abruptly even fiercely hope said that curiosity be satisfied certainly said mr hoopdriver then wo detain ignominiously mr hoopdriver turned machine about struggled upon resumed road southward when learnt that be not on portsmouth road be impossible to turn go back for must be to face shame again so have to ride on by brook street up hill to haslemere away to right portsmouth road mocked at made off to fastness amid sunlit green purple mass of hindhead where mr grant allen writes hill top novel day by day sun shone wide blue hill view pleasant valley one saw on hand from sandscarred roadway even side of road set about with grey heather scrub prickly mass of gorse pine tree with year growth still bright green against darkened needle of previous year be fresh delightful to mr hoopdriver eye brightness of day day old sense of freedom fought uphill fight against intolerable vexation at abominable encounter have still to win when reached haslemere great brown shadow monstrous hatred of other man in brown possessed have conceived brilliant idea of abandoning portsmouth at least giving up straight way to fellow wayfarer of striking out boldly to left eastward did not dare to stop at of inviting public house in main street of haslemere turned up side way found little beer shop good hope wherein to refresh there ate gossipped condescendingly with aged labourer assuming while for own private enjoyment attribute of lost heir afterwards mounted rode on towards northchapel place number of finger post conspired to boom insidious turning prevented from attaining xiv how mr hoopdriver reached midhurst be one of uncle profoundest remark that human being be only unreasonable creature observation be so far justified by mr hoopdriver that after spending morning tortuously avoiding other man in brown young lady in grey spent considerable part of afternoon in thinking about young lady in grey contemplating in optimistic spirit possibility of seeing again memory imagination played round so that course be largely determined by winding of road traversed of one general proposition be absolutely convinced there be something juicy wrong with 'em said once even aloud what be must not imagine recapitulated fact miss beaumont brother sister stoppage to quarrel weep be perplexing material for young man of small experience there be exertion hated so much a inference after time gave up attempt to get at reality of case let imagination go free must ever see again suppose did with other chap not about vision found pleasantest be encounter with unexpected encounter at annual dancing class ' at putney assembly room somehow must drift together must dance with again again be pleasant vision for must understand that mr hoopdriver danced uncommonly well again in shop sudden radiance in doorway be bowed towards manchester counter then to lean over counter murmur seemingly apropos of good under discussion have not forgotten that morning on portsmouth road lower never will forget at northchapel mr hoopdriver consulted map took counsel weighed course of action petworth seemed possible resting place pullborough midhurst seemed too near place over

lest young lady in grey must come glittering round corner for flavour of young lady in grey be present through mixing with flower delight of touch made second day quite different from first undertone of expectation anxiety something like regret must not be ignored be only late in long evening that quite abruptly began to repent vividly decidedly having fled two people be getting hungry have curious effect upon emotional colouring of mind man be sinister brute hoopdriver saw in flash of inspiration girl be in serious trouble who might have helped have taken first impulse a decisive bolted new view of depressed dreadfully what might not be happening to now thought again of tear surely be merely duty seeing trouble afoot to keep eye upon began riding fast to get quit of such selfreproaches found in tortuous tangle of road a dusk be coming on emerged not at petworth at easebourne mile from midhurst be getting hungry said mr hoopdriver inquiring of gamekeeper in easebourne
