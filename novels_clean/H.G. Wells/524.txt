disappointingly also wanted to borrow money did seem in so many way exactly what ramage said be sensible thing to do there be to be borrowed must put whole adventure on broader better footing seemed indeed almost only possible way in might emerge from rebellion with anything like success if only for sake of argument with home wanted success why after must not borrow money from ramage be so true what said middle class people be ridiculously squeamish about money why must be ramage be friend very good friend if be in position to help must help only happened to be other way round be in position

compatriot cooked better ramage with fine perception of feminine palate ordered vero capri be ann veronica felt a sip so of remarkable blend warmed blood just sort of thing that aunt must not approve to be lunching thus tete tete with man yet at same time be perfectly innocent a well a agreeable proceeding talked across meal in easy friendly manner about ann veronica affair be really very bright clever with sort of conversational boldness be just within limit of permissible daring described goopes fabian to gave sketch of landlady talked in most liberal entertaining way of modern young woman outlook seemed to know great deal about life gave glimpse of possibility roused curiosity contrasted wonderfully with empty showing off of teddy friendship seemed thing worth having when be thinking over in room that evening vague baffling doubt came drifting across conviction doubted how stood toward what restrained gleam of face might signify felt that perhaps in desire to play adequate part in conversation have talked rather more freely than ought to have done given wrong impression of part be two day before christmas eve next morning came compact letter from father dear daughter ran here

only did tentacular generalization gather fact of natural history comparative anatomy together seemed always stretching out further further into world of interest lay altogether outside legitimate bound came to ann veronica one night after long talk with miss miniver a sudden remarkable thing a grotesque novel aspect that slowly elaborating biological scheme have something more than academic

also so far a be concerned irregularity mattered not at that have flung kept on flinging such consideration to wind in addition be now seeing talking to ramage almost weekly on theory took very gravely that be exceptionally friend must ask to come to dinner with in little italian semi bohemian restaurant in district toward soho in one of more stylish magnificent establishment about piccadilly circus for most part did not care to refuse indeed did want to refuse dinner from lavish display of ambiguous hors d'oeuvre to skimpy ice in dish of frilled paper with chianti flask parmesan dish polyglot waiter polyglot clientele be very funny bright really liked ramage valued help advice be interesting to see how different characteristic mode of approach be to sort of question interested be amusing to discover other side to life of morningside park inhabitant have thought that morningside park householder came home before seven at latest a father usually did ramage talked always about woman woman concern very much about ann veronica own outlook upon life be always drawing contrast between woman lot man treating a wonderful new departure in comparison ann veronica liked relationship more because be unusual one after dinner must have walk usually to thames embankment to see two sweep of river on side of waterloo bridge then must part at westminster bridge perhaps must go on to waterloo once suggested must go to music hall see wonderful new dancer ann veronica did not feel cared to see new dancer so instead talked of dancing what might mean in human life ann veronica thought be spontaneous release of energy expressive of well being ramage thought that by dancing men such bird animal a dance come to feel think of body intercourse have be planned to warm ann veronica to familiar affection with ramage be certainly warming ramage to constantly deepening interest in ann veronica felt that be getting on with very slowly indeed did not see how must get on faster have felt to create certain idea vivify certain curiosity feeling in until be done certain experience of life assured that girl be locked coldness against man approach have fascination of being absolutely perplexing in respect on one hand seemed to think plainly simply must talk serenely freely about topic that most woman have be trained to avoid conceal on other be unconscious else have air of being unconscious be riddle to sort of personal application almost girl woman one might have thought must have made be always doing best to call attention to fact that be man of spirit quality experience young beautiful woman that sort of construction upon relationship be possible trusting to go on from to idea that sort of relationship be possible responded with unfaltering appearance of insensibility never a young beautiful woman conscious of sex always in character of intelligent girl student perception of personal beauty deepened quickened with encounter now then general presence became radiantly dazzling in eye must appear in street coming toward surprise so fine smiling welcoming be so expanded illuminated living in contrast with mere expectation must find something wave in hair little line in contour of brow neck made exquisite discovery be beginning to think about inordinately must sit in inner office compose conversation with penetrating illuminating nearly conclusive conversation never proved to be of slightest use at with when met face to face began also at time to wake at night think about thought of no longer in vein of incidental adventure in have begun thought too of fretful invalid who lay in next room to whose money have created business made position in world have have most of thing wanted said ramage in stillness of night part for time ann veronica family have desisted from direct offer of free pardon be evidently waiting for resource to come to end father aunt brother made sign then one afternoon in early february aunt came up in state between expostulation dignified resentment obviously very anxious for ann veronica welfare have dream in night said saw in sort of sloping slippery place holding on by hand slipping seemed to to be slipping slipping face be white be really most vivid most vivid seemed to be slipping just going to tumble holding on made wake up there lay thinking of spending night up here alone one to look after wondered what must be doing what might be happening to said to myself at once be coincidence caper sauce ' made sure be felt must do something anyhow up came just a soon a must to see have spoken rather rapidly ca help saying said with quality of voice altering think be right for unprotected girl to be in london alone a be be quite equal to taking care of aunt must be most uncomfortable here be most uncomfortable for one concerned spoke with certain asperity felt that ann veronica have duped in dream now that have come up to london might a well speak mind christmas dinner said anything nice one doe even know what be doing be going on working for degree why must do at home be working at imperial college see aunt be only possible way for to get good degree in subject father wo hear of there 'd only be endless row if be at home how must come home when lock in room do wish be going on said miss stanley after pause do wish father must come to agreement ann veronica responded with conviction wish so too ca arrange something ca make sort of treaty must keep must get very cross one evening one must dare to remind of how can say such thing must still be place to say so prevents treaty must make treaty ann veronica thought must not see possible treaty must leave open for to have quasi surreptitious dinner with ramage go on walking round london square discussing socialism with miss miniver toward small hour have tasted freedom now so far have not felt need of protection still there certainly be something in idea of treaty see at how can be managing said miss stanley ann veronica hastened to reply do on very little mind went back to treaty be there fee to pay at imperial college aunt be saying disagreeable question there be few fee then how have managed bother said ann veronica to herself tried not to look guilty be able to borrow money borrow money who lent money friend said ann veronica felt getting into corner sought hastily in mind for plausible answer to obvious question did come aunt went off at tangent dear ann veronica will be getting into debt ann veronica at once with feeling of immense relief took refuge in dignity think aunt said might trust to self respect to keep out of for moment aunt must not think of reply to counterstroke ann veronica followed up advantage by sudden inquiry about abandoned boot in train going home aunt reasoned out if be borrowing money said miss stanley must be getting into debt be nonsense part be by imperceptible degree that cape became important in ann veronica thought then began to take step at last stride to something more more like predominance began by being interested in demonstration biological theory then be attracted by character then in manner fell in love with mind one day be at tea in laboratory discussion sprang up about question of woman suffrage movement be then in earlier militant phase one of woman only miss garvice opposed though ann veronica be disposed to be lukewarm man opposition always inclined to suffrage side have curious feeling of loyalty in seeing more aggressive woman through cape be irritatingly judicial in matter absurdly against in case one might have smashed hopelessly undecided tepidly sceptical miss klegg youngest girl made vigorous attack on miss garvice who have said thought woman lost something infinitely precious by mingling in conflict of life discussion wandered be punctuated with bread butter cape be inclined to support miss klegg until miss garvice cornered by quoting against citing recent paper in nineteenth century in following atkinson have made vigorous damaging attack on lester ward case for primitive matriarchate predominant importance of female throughout animal kingdom ann veronica be not aware of literary side of teacher have little tinge of annoyance at miss garvice advantage afterwards hunted up article in question seemed to quite delightfully written argued cape have gift of easy unaffected writing coupled with very clear logical thinking to follow written thought gave sensation of cutting thing with perfectly new perfectly sharp knife found anxious to read more of next wednesday went to british museum hunted first among half crown magazine for essay then through various scientific quarterly for research paper ordinary research paper when be not extravagant theorizing be apt to be rather sawdusty in texture ann veronica be delighted to find same easy confident luminosity that distinguished work for general reader returned to latter at back of mind a looked over again be very distinct resolve to quote after manner of miss garvice at very first opportunity when got home to lodging that evening reflected with something like surprise upon half day employment decided that showed nothing more le than cape be really very interesting person indeed then fell into musing about cape wondered why be so distinctive so unlike other men never occurred to for time that might be because be falling in love with part yet ann veronica be thinking very great deal about love dozen shyness intellectual barrier be being outflanked broken down in mind influence about worked with own predisposition against tradition of home upbringing to deal with fact of life in unabashed manner ramage by hundred skilful hint have led to realize that problem of own life be inseparably associated with indeed only one special case of problem of woman life that problem of woman life be love young man come into life asking how best may place ramage have said woman come into life thinking instinctively how best may give noted that a good saying germinated spread tentacle of explanation through brain biological laboratory perpetually viewing life a pairing breeding selection again pairing breeding seemed only translated generalization of assertion talk of miniver people widgett people seemed always to be like ship in adverse weather on lee shore of love for seven year said ann veronica have be trying to keep from thinking about love have be training to look askance at beautiful thing gave permission now to look at squarely made private declaration of liberty be mere nonsense mere tongue tied fear said be slavery of veiled life might a well be at morningside park business of love be supreme affair in life be woman one event crisis make up for other restriction cower a cower with blushing paralyzed mind until overtakes will be hanged if do must not talk freely about love found for manumission ramage seemed always fencing about forbidden topic probing for opening wondered why did not give something instinctive prevented with finest resolve not to be silly prudish found that whenever became at bold in matter became severely scientific impersonal almost entomological indeed in method killed remark a made pinned out for examination in biological laboratory be invincible tone disapproved more more of own mental austerity here be experienced man of world friend who evidently took great interest in supreme topic be willing to give benefit of experience why must not be at ease with why must not know thing be hard enough anyhow for human being to learn decided be dozen time more difficult than need be because of locking of lip thought contrived to break down barrier of shyness at last in one direction talked one night of love fact of love with miss miniver miss miniver be highly unsatisfactory repeated phrase of mr goopes advanced people said with air of great elucidation tend to generalize love 'he prayeth best who loveth best thing great small ' for own part go about loving yes men said ann veronica plunging want love of men for second remained silent shocked by question miss miniver looked over glass at friend almost balefully said at last with something in voice that reminded ann veronica of sprung tennis racket have be through that went on after pause spoke slowly have never yet met man whose intellect must respect ann veronica looked at thoughtfully for moment decided to persist on principle if have said ca imagine said miss miniver think think voice sank of horrible coarseness what coarseness said ann veronica dear vee voice became very low know oh know well face be unaccustomed pink ann veronica ignored friend confusion rather humbug about coarseness woman mean said decided to go on after momentary halt pretend body be ugly really be most beautiful thing in world pretend never think of everything make what be cried miss miniver almost vehemently be wrong did not think thought such thing body body horrible thing be soul love life on higher plane be not animal if ever did meet man must love must love voice dropped again platonically made glass glint absolutely platonically said soul to soul turned face to fire gripped hand upon elbow drew thin shoulder together in shrug ugh said ann veronica watched wondered about want men said miss miniver want with sneer loud laughter empty silly coarse brute brute be brute still with science day may teach way to do without be only woman matter be not sort of creature need male have male there be green fly admitted ann veronica even then conversation hung for thoughtful moment ann veronica readjusted chin on hand wonder of be right said have scrap of sort of aversion tolstoy be so good about said miss miniver regardless of friend attitude see through higher life lower see men

hitherto have seen chiefly in picture other work of art incidentally a thing taken out of life now sense of beauty be spreading to multitude of hitherto unsuspected aspect of world about thought of beauty became obsession interwove with biological work found asking more more curiously why on principle of survival of fittest have sense of beauty at enabled to go on thinking about beauty when seemed to right that must be thinking about biology be very greatly exercised by two system of value two series of explanation that comparative anatomy on one hand sense of beauty on other set going in thought must not make up mind be finer more elemental thing gave value to other be that struggle of thing to survive produced a sort of necessary by product intense preference appreciation be that

talked well always talked at length when took difficulty to sent to various literature upon marking of butterfly incomprehensible elaboration splendor of bird of paradise humming bird plume patterning of tiger leopard spot be interesting inconclusive original paper to referred discursive be at best only suggestive afterward one afternoon hovered about came sat beside talked of beauty riddle of beauty for time displayed quite unprofessional vein of mysticism in matter contrasted with russell whose intellectual method be so to speak sceptically dogmatic talk drifted to beauty of music took that up again at tea time a student sat about miss garvice tea pot drank tea smoked cigarette talk got away from cape scotchman informed ann veronica that view of beauty necessarily depended on metaphysical premise young man with russell like hair became anxious to distinguish by telling japanese student western art be symmetrical eastern art asymmetrical that among higher organism tendency be toward external symmetry veiling internal want of balance ann veronica decided must have to go on with cape day looking up discovered sitting on stool with hand in pocket head little on one side regarding with thoughtful expression met eye for moment in curious surprise turned eye stared at miss garvice like one who wake from reverie then got up strolled down laboratory toward refuge preparation room part then one day little thing happened that clothed in significance have be working upon ribbon of microtome section of developing salamander came to see what have made of stood up sat down at microscope for time be busy scrutinizing one section after looked down at saw that sunlight be gleaming from cheek that over cheek be fine golden down of delicate hair at sight something leaped within something changed for became aware of presence a have never be aware of human being in life before became aware of modelling of ear of muscle of neck texture of hair came off brow soft minute curve of eyelid that must just see beyond brow perceived familiar object a though be acutely beautiful thing be realized acutely beautiful thing sense followed shoulder under coat down to where flexible sensitive looking hand rested lightly upon table felt a something solid strong trustworthy beyond measure perception of flooded being got up here be something rather good said with start effort took place at microscope while stood beside almost leaning over found be trembling at nearness full of thrilling dread that might touch pulled together put eye to eye piece see pointer asked see pointer said be like said dragged stool beside sat down with elbow four inch from hers made sketch then got up left have feeling at departure a of immense cavity of something enormously gone must not tell whether be infinite regret infinite relief now ann veronica knew what be matter with part a sat on bed that night musing half undressed began to run one hand down arm scrutinize soft flow of muscle under skin thought of marvellous beauty of skin delightfulness of living texture oh back of arm found faintest down of hair in world etherialized monkey said held out arm straight before turned hand way that why must one pretend whispered why must one pretend think of beauty in world be covered up overlaid glanced shyly at mirror above dressing table then about at furniture a though might penetrate to thought peeped in mind wonder said ann veronica at last if be beautiful wonder if will ever shine like light like translucent goddess wonder suppose girl woman have prayed for have come to in babylon in nineveh why must one face fact of one self stood up posed before mirror surveyed with gravely thoughtful gravely critical yet admiring eye after be just one common person watched throb of artery in stem of neck put hand at last gently almost timidly to where heart beat beneath breast part realization that be in love flooded ann veronica mind altered quality of topic began to think persistently of cape seemed to now that for week at least must have be thinking persistently of unawares be surprised to find how stored mind be with impression memory of how vividly remembered gesture little thing that have said occurred to that be absurd wrong to be so continuously thinking of one engrossing topic made strenuous effort to force mind to other question be extraordinary what seemingly irrelevant thing must restore to thought of cape again when went to sleep then always cape became novel wonderful guest of dream for time really seemed sufficient to that must love that cape must love seemed beyond compass of imagination indeed did not want to think of a loving wanted to think of a beloved person to be near watch to have going about doing that saying unconscious of while too remained unconscious of to think of a loving must make different then must turn face to must have to think of in eye must become defensive what did must be thing mattered must require thing of must be passionately concerned to meet requirement loving be better than loving be self forgetfulness pure delighting in human being felt that with cape near to must be content always to go on loving went next day to school world seemed made of happiness just worked up roughly into shape occasion duty found must do microscope work better for being in love winced when first heard preparation room door open cape came down laboratory when at last reached be possessed put stool for at little distance from own after have seen day work hesitated then plunged into resumption of discussion about beauty think said be little too mystical about beauty other day like mystical way said business here be right way have be thinking know be not sure that primarily perception of beauty be just intensity of feeling free from pain intensity of perception without tissue destruction like mystical way better said ann veronica thought number of beautiful thing be not intense delicacy for example may be intensely perceived why be one face beautiful not objected ann veronica on theory two face side by side in sunlight ought to be equally beautiful one must get with exactly same intensity did not agree with mean simply intensity of sensation said intensity of perception may perceive harmony proportion rhythm intensely be thing faint slight in a physical fact be like detonator of bomb let loose explosive there be internal factor a well a external know if express clearly mean that point be that vividness of perception be essential factor of beauty of course vividness may be created by whisper brings back said ann veronica to mystery why must thing not others open deep well that might after be outcome of selection like preference for blue flower be not nearly so bright a yellow of insect doe explain sunset not quite so easily a explains insect alighting on colored paper perhaps if people did like clear bright healthy eye be biologically understandable must like precious stone one thing may be necessary collateral of others after fine clear sky of bright color be signal to come out of hiding rejoice go on with life h be said ann veronica shook head cape smiled cheerfully with eye meeting hers throw out in passing said what be after be beauty be special inserted sort of thing idea be just life pure life life nascent running clear strong stood up to go on to next student there be morbid beauty said ann veronica wonder if there be said cape paused then bent down over boy who wore hair like russell ann veronica surveyed sloping back for moment then drew microscope toward then for time sat very still felt that have passed difficult corner now must go on talking with again just a have be used to do before understood what be matter with have one idea found very clear in mind that must get research scholarship so contrive year in laboratory now see what everything mean said ann veronica to really felt for day a though secret of universe have be wrapped hidden from so obstinately be at last altogether displayed chapter ninth discord part one afternoon soon after ann veronica great discovery telegram came into laboratory for ran bored nothing to do will dine with to night somewhere talk will be grateful ramage ann veronica be rather pleased by have not seen ramage for ten eleven day be quite ready for gossip with now mind be so full of thought that be in love in love marvellous state really believe have dim idea of talking to about at rate must be good to hear saying sort of thing did perhaps now must grasp better with world shaking secret brandishing about inside head within yard of be sorry to find ramage little disposed to be melancholy have made over seven hundred pound in last week said that be exhilarating said ann veronica not bit of said be only score in game be score can buy sort of thing with nothing one want turned to waiter who held wine card nothing can cheer said except champagne meditated said then be sweeter very well everything go well with said folding arm under regarding ann veronica with slightly projecting eye wide open be not happy believe be in love leaned back for soup presently resumed believe must be in love ca be said ann veronica wisely how do know well be exactly depressing state be know one have theory said ann veronica radiantly oh theory being in love be fact ought to make one happy be unrest longing what be that waiter have intervened parmesan take away glanced at ann veronica face seemed to that really be exceptionally radiant wondered why thought love made people happy began to talk of smilax pink adorned table filled glass with champagne must said because of depression be eating quail when returned to topic of love what made think said abruptly with gleam of avidity in face that love make people happy know must how be thought little too insistent woman know thing by instinct answered wonder said if woman do know thing by instinct have doubt about feminine instinct be one of conventional superstition woman be supposed to know when man be in love with do think doe ann veronica picked among salad with judicial expression of face think must decided ah said ramage impressively ann veronica looked up at found regarding with eye be almost woebegone into indeed be trying to throw much more expression than must carry there be little pause between full for ann veronica of rapid elusive suspicion intimation perhaps one talk nonsense about woman instinct said be way of avoiding explanation girl woman perhaps be different know suppose girl can tell if man be in love with not in love with mind went off to cape thought took word for ca suppose depends on own state of mind if one want thing very much perhaps one be inclined to think one ca have suppose if one be to love one one must feel doubtful if one be to love one very much be just so that one must be blindest just when one wanted most to see stopped abruptly afraid that ramage might be able to infer cape from thing have said indeed face be very eager yes said ann veronica blushed be said be afraid be little confused about thing ramage looked at then fell into deep reflection a waiter came to paragraph talk again have ever be to opera ann veronica said ramage once twice will go now think must like to listen to music what be there tristan have never heard tristan isolde settle will go there be sure to be place somewhere be rather jolly of said ann veronica be jolly of to come said ramage so presently got into hansom together ann veronica sat back feeling very luxurious pleasant looked at light stir misty glitter of street traffic from under slightly drooping eyelid while ramage sat closer to than need have done glanced ever again at face made to speak said nothing when got to covent garden ramage secured one of little upper box came into a overture began ann veronica took off jacket sat down in corner chair leaned forward to look into great hazy warm brown cavity of house ramage placed chair to sit beside near facing stage music took hold of slowly a eye wandered from indistinct still rank of audience to little busy orchestra with quivering violin methodical movement of brown silver instrument brightly lit score shaded light have never be to opera before except a one of congested mass of people in cheaper seat with back head woman hat for frame of spectacle there be by contrast fine large sense of space ease in present position curtain rose out of concluding bar of overture revealed isolde on prow of barbaric ship voice of young seaman came floating down from masthead story of immortal lover have begun knew story only imperfectly followed now with passionate deepening interest splendid voice sang on from phase to phase of love unfolding ship drove across sea to beating rhythm of rower lover broke into passionate knowledge of other then jarring intervention came king mark amidst shout of sailormen stood beside curtain came festooning slowly down music ceased light in auditorium glowed out ann veronica woke out of confused dream of involuntary commanding love in glory of sound color to discover ramage be sitting close beside with one hand resting lightly on waist made quick movement hand fell away by god ann veronica said sighing deeply stir one sat quite still looking at wish have drunk that love potion said found ready reply to went on music be food of love make desire life beyond measure life life love make want to be always young always strong always devoting life dying splendidly be very beautiful said ann veronica in low tone said more for moment be now acutely aware of other ann veronica be excited puzzled with sense of strange disconcerting new light breaking over relation with ramage have never thought of at in way before did not shock amazed interested beyond measure also must not go on felt be going to say something more something still more personal intimate be curious at same time clearly resolved must not hear felt must get talking upon impersonal theme at cost snatched about in mind what be exact force of motif asked at random before heard much wagnerian music heard enthusiastic description of from mistress did like at school gave impression of sort of patched quilt little bit of patterned stuff coming up again again stopped with air of interrogation ramage looked at for long discriminating interval without speaking seemed to be hesitating between two course of action know much about technique of music said at last with eye upon be matter of feeling with contradicted by plunging into exposition of motif by tacit agreement ignored significant thing between ignored slipping away of ground on have stood together hitherto through love music of second act until hunting horn of mark break in upon dream ann veronica consciousness be flooded with perception of man close beside preparing new thing to say to preparing perhaps to touch stretching hungry invisible tentacle about tried to think what must do in eventuality that mind have be be full of thought of cape huge generalized cape lover in incomprehensible way ramage be confused with cape have grotesque disposition to persuade that be really cape who surrounded a be with wing of desire fact that be trusted friend making illicit love to remained in spite of effort insignificant thing in mind music confused distracted made struggle against feeling of intoxication head swam be inconvenience of head be swimming music throbbed into warning preceded king irruption abruptly gripped wrist love ann veronica

of will remembered liked ramage owed thing to be interested be profoundly interested be in love with tried to grasp welter of value in situation simultaneously draw conclusion from disorder began to talk again in quick undertone that must not clearly hear have loved be saying ever since sat on gate talked have always loved care what divide care what else there be in world want beyond measure

at foot king mark incarnation of masculine force obligation masculine creditor of love beauty stood over second climax be ending in wreath reek of melody then curtain be coming down in series of short rush music have ended people be stirring breaking out into applause light of auditorium be resuming lighting up pierced obscurity of box ramage stopped urgent flow of word abruptly sat back helped to restore ann veronica self command turned eye to again saw late friend pleasant trusted companion who have seen fit suddenly to change into lover babbling interesting inacceptable thing looked eager

with hair like russell cleared throat said rather irrelevantly that knew man who knew thomas bayard simmons who have rioted in stranger gallery then cape finding distinctly pro ann veronica if not pro feminist ventured to be perverse started vein of speculation upon scotchman idea that there be still hope of woman evolving into something higher be unusually absurd ready time seemed to ann veronica

a refuge a security certain simple purpose emerged from disingenuous muddle of feeling desire seeing cape from day to day made bright eventfulness hampered in course have resolved to follow vanished from laboratory for week week of oddly interesting day when renewed attendance at imperial college third finger of left hand be adorned with very fine old ring with dark blue sapphire have once belonged to great aunt of manning that ring manifestly occupied thought great deal kept pausing in work regarding when cape came round to first put hand in lap then rather awkwardly in front of men be

like pouring strong acid over dulled metal tarnish of constraint have recently spread over intercourse with cape vanished again embarked upon open declared friendship even talked about friendship went to zoological garden together one saturday to see for point of morphological interest about toucan bill that friendly entertaining bird spent rest of afternoon walking about elaborating in general

afternoon when said let go see wart hog thought one ever have have so quick flow of good idea a when explained that sugar not bun be talisman of popularity among animal marvelled at practical omniscience finally at exit into regent park ran against miss klegg be expression of miss klegg face put idea into ann veronica head of showing manning at college one day idea did for reason other carry out for fortnight part when at last did so sapphire ring took on new quality in imagination of cape ceased to be symbol of liberty remote quite abstracted person became suddenly very disagreeably token of large portentous body visible tangible manning appeared just at end of afternoon work biologist be going through perplexity scotchman have created by metaphysical treatment of skull of hyrax young african elephant be clearing up difficulty by tracing partially obliterated suture scotchman have overlooked when door from passage opened manning came into universe seen down length of laboratory manning looked very handsome shapely gentleman indeed at sight of eager advance to fiancee miss klegg replaced one long cherished romance about ann veronica by one more normal simple carried cane silk hat with mourning band in one gray gloved hand frock coat trouser be admirable handsome face black mustache prominent brow conveyed eager solicitude want said with white hand outstretched to take out to tea have be clearing up said ann veronica brightly dreadful scientific thing said with smile miss klegg thought extraordinarily kindly dreadful scientific thing said ann veronica stood back smiling with air of proprietorship looking about at business like equipment of room low ceiling made seem abnormally tall ann veronica wiped scalpel put card over watch glass containing thin shred of embryonic guinea pig swimming in mauve stain dismantled microscope wish understood more of biology said manning be ready said ann veronica closing microscope box with click looking for one brief instant up laboratory have air grace here hat hang from peg in passage led way to door manning passed behind round opened door for when cape glanced up at for moment manning seemed to be holding arm about there be nothing quiet acquiescence in bearing after cape have finished scotchman trouble went back into preparation room sat down on sill of open window folded arm stared straight before for long time over wilderness of tile chimney pot into sky be blue empty be not addicted to monologue only audible comment permitted at first upon universe be evidently anything satisfactory to that afternoon be one compact entirely unassigned damn word must have have gratifying quality because repeated then stood up repeated again fool have be cried now speech be coming to

thrusting through window turned back on temptation then suddenly seized new preparation bottle stood upon table contained better part of week work displayed dissection of snail beautifully done hurled across room to smash resoundingly upon cemented floor under bookcase then without haste pause swept arm along shelf of re agent sent to mingle with debris on floor fell in diapason of smash h be said regarding wreckage with calmer visage silly remarked after pause one hardly know time put hand in pocket mouth puckered to whistle went to door of outer preparation room stood there looking save for faintest intensification of natural ruddiness embodiment of blond serenity gellett called just come clear up mess will have smashed thing part there be one serious flaw in ann veronica arrangement for self rehabilitation be ramage hung over loan to connection with terrible evening vague disconcerting possibility of annoyance exposure must not see relief from anxiety except repayment repayment seemed impossible raising of twenty five pound be task altogether beyond power birthday be four month away at extremist point might give five pound thing rankled in mind night day must wake in night to repeat bitter cry oh why did burn note added greatly to annoyance of situation that have twice seen ramage in avenue since return to shelter of father roof have saluted with elaborate civility eye distended with indecipherable meaning felt be bound in honor to tell whole affair to manning sooner later indeed seemed inevitable that must clear up with assistance not at when manning be not about thing seemed simple enough must compose extremely lucid honorable explanation when came to broaching proved to be much more difficult than have supposed went down great staircase of building while sought in mind for beginning broke into appreciation of simple dress self congratulation upon engagement make feel said that nothing be impossible to have here beside said that day at surbiton 'there be many good thing in life there be only one best be wild haired girl who be pulling away at oar will make grail day perhaps if god will will become wife ' looked very hard before a said voice be full of deep feeling grail said ann veronica then oh yes of course anything holy one be afraid altogether holy ann veronica ah ca imagine what be to what mean to suppose there be something mystical wonderful about woman there be something mystical wonderful about human being see that men need bank with woman man doe said manning true man anyhow for there be only one treasure house by jove when

maiden distrust of yours make shrink from kiss will vanish forgive if certain warmth creep into word park be green gray to day be glowing pink gold be difficult to express thing part sat with tea strawberry cream before at little table in front of pavilion in regent park confession be still unmade manning leaned forward on table talking discursively on probable brilliance of married life ann veronica sat back in attitude of inattention eye on distant game of cricket mind perplexed busy be recalling circumstance under have engaged to manning trying to understand curious development of quality of relationship particular of engagement be very clear in memory have taken care must have momentous talk with on garden seat commanded by window of house have be playing tennis with manifest intention looming over let sit down for moment have said made speech little elaborately plucked at knot of racket heard to end then spoke in restrained undertone ask to be engaged to mr manning began want to lay life at foot mr manning think love want to be very plain with have nothing nothing can possibly be passion for be sure nothing at be silent for moment perhaps be only sleeping said how can know think perhaps be rather cold blooded person stopped remained listening attentively have be very kind to said must give life for heart have warmed toward have seemed to life might be very good indeed with kindliness sacrifice about thought of a always courteous helpful a realizing indeed ideal of protection service a chivalrously leaving free to live own life rejoicing with infinite generosity in detail of irresponsive being twanged catgut under finger seems so unfair said to take offer give so little in return be world to be not trader looking at equivalent know mr manning really want to marry seems so so unworthy picked among phrase of noble love give stopped through difficulty found in expressing be judge of said manning must wait for manning be silent for space a

racket on turf through moment of silence be most perfect most glorious of created thing tender frank intellectual brave beautiful be servitor be ready to wait for to wait pleasure to give life to winning let only wear livery give leave to try want to think for time to be free for time be so like diana pallas athene pallas athene be better be slender goddess understand let engage be ask looked at face downcast in profile be handsome strong gratitude swelled within be too good for said in low voice then will long pause be fair will yes for second have remained quite still if sit here said standing up before abruptly will have to shout let walk about tum tum tirray tum tum tum te tum that thing of mendelssohn if making one human being absolutely happy be satisfaction to held out hand also stood up drew close up to with strong steady pull then suddenly in front of window folded in arm pressed to kissed unresisting face cried ann veronica struggling faintly released forgive said be at singing pitch have moment of sheer panic at thing have done mr manning said for time will tell one will keep secret be doubtful will please not even tell aunt a will said if manner tell can not help if show only mean secret for little time just for little time said yes ring aunt triumphant eye note of approval in father manner novel disposition in to praise manning in just impartial voice have soon placed very definite qualification upon covenanted secrecy part at first quality of relationship to manning seemed moving beautiful to ann veronica admired rather pitied be unfeignedly grateful to even thought that perhaps might come to love in spite of faint indefinable flavor of absurdity pervaded courtly bearing must never love a loved cape of course there be grade quality of love for manning must be more temperate love altogether much more temperate discreet joyless love of virtuous reluctant condescending wife have be quite convinced that engagement with at last marriage have exactly that quality of compromise distinguishes way of wise must be wrappered world almost at best saw building up life upon that life restrained kindly beautiful little pathetic altogether dignified life of great discipline suppression extensive reserve ramage affair needed clearing up of course be flaw upon project have to explain about pay off forty pound then quite insensibly queenliness have declined be never able to trace change attitude have undergone from time when believed to be pampered queen of fortune crown of good man love secretly nobly worshipping one else to time when realized be in fact just mannequin for lover imagination that cared more for reality of being for thing felt desired for passion dream might move than child care for sawdust in doll be actress whim have chosen to play passive part be one of most educational disillusionment in ann veronica career did many woman get anything better afternoon when be urgent to explain hampering tainting complication with ramage realization of alien quality in relationship with manning became acute hitherto have be qualified by conception of life a compromise by new effort to be unexacting of life perceived that to tell manning of ramage adventure a have happened must be like tarring figure upon water color be in different key have different timbre how must tell indeed already began to puzzle why have borrowed that money at plain fact be that have grabbed bait have grabbed became le le attentive to meditative self complacent fragment of talk a told secret thought made hasty half hearted excursion into possibility of telling thing in romantic tone ramage be a black villain a white fantastically white maiden doubted if manning must even listen to that must refuse to listen absolve unshriven then came to with shock a extraordinary oversight that must never tell manning about ramage never dismissed idea of doing so that still left forty pound mind went on generalizing so must always be between manning saw life before robbed of generous illusion wrappered life unwrappered forever vista of dull response crisis of make believe year of exacting mutual disregard in misty garden of fine sentiment did woman get anything better from man perhaps woman conceals from man perforce thought of cape must not help thinking of cape surely cape be different cape looked at one not over one spoke to one treated one a visible concrete fact cape saw felt for cared for greatly even if did not love anyhow did not sentimentalize have be doubting since walk in zoological garden whether indeed did simply care for little thing almost impalpable have happened to justify doubt something in manner have belied word did not look for in morning when entered come very quickly to thought of a have last seen looking down length of laboratory to see go why have glanced up quite in way thought of cape flooded being like long veiled sunlight breaking again through cloud came to like dear thing rediscovered that loved cape came to to marry one cape be impossible if must not marry must not marry one must end sham with manning ought never to have begun be cheating pitiful cheating then if day cape wanted saw fit to alter view upon friendship dim possibility that must not seem to look at even to gesticulated in twilight background of mind leaped suddenly at desperate resolution in one moment have made into new self flung aside plan have in life discretion of course why not must be honest anyhow turned eye to manning be sitting back from table now with one arm over back of green chair other resting on little table be smiling under heavy mustache head be little on one side a looked at what be dreadful confession have to make be saying quiet kindly smile implied serene disbelief in confessible thing ann veronica pushed aside tea cup vestige of strawberry cream put elbow before on table mr manning said have confession to make wish must use christian name said attended to then dismissed a unimportant something in voice manner conveyed effect of unwonted gravity to for first time seemed to wonder what might be that have to confess smile faded think engagement can go on plunged felt exactly that loss of breath come with dive into icy water how said sitting up astonished beyond measure not go on have be thinking while have be talking see did understand stared hard at finger nail be hard to express one self do want to be honest with when promised to marry thought must thought be possible arrangement did think must be done admired chivalry be grateful paused go on said moved elbow nearer to spoke in still lower tone told did not love know said manning nodding gravely be fine brave of there be something more paused again be sorry did explain thing be difficult be clear to have to explain love one else remained looking at other for three four second then manning flopped back in chair dropped chin like man shot there be long silence between god said at last with tremendous feeling then again god now that thing be said mind be clear calm heard standard expression of strong soul wrung with critical coldness that astonished realized dimly that there be personal thing behind cry that countless myriad of mannings have god ed with equal gusto at situation a flatly apprehended mitigated remorse enormously rested brow on hand conveyed magnificent tragedy by pose why said in gasping voice of one subduing agony looked at from under pain wrinkled brow why did not tell before did know thought might be able to control ca think ought to control have be dreaming thinking be frightfully sorry bolt from blue god ann veronica understand shatters world tried to feel sorry sense of immense egotism be strong clear went on with intense urgency why did ever let love why did ever let peep through gate of paradise oh god begin to feel realize seems to just talk seems to like fancy of dream tell have heard be joke of yours made voice very low full looked closely into face twisted finger tightly be joke said feel shabby disgraced ought never to have thought of of mean fell back in chair with expression of tremendous desolation god said again became aware of waitress standing over with book pencil ready for bill never mind bill said manning tragically standing up thrusting four shilling piece into hand turning broad back on astonishment let walk across park at least said to ann veronica just at present mind simply wo take hold of at tell never mind bill keep keep part walked long way that afternoon crossed park to westward then turned back walked round circle about royal botanical garden then southwardly toward waterloo trudged talked manning struggled a said to get hang of be long meandering talk stupid shameful unavoidable ann veronica be apologetic to bottom of soul at same time be wildly exultant at resolution have taken end have made to blunder have only to get through to solace manning a much a must to put such clumsy plastering on wound a be possible then anyhow must be free free to put fate to test made few protest few excuse for action in accepting few lame explanation did not heed care for then realized that be business to let manning talk impose own interpretation upon situation so far a be concerned did best to do about unknown rival be acutely curious made tell core of difficulty can not say who be said ann veronica be married man even know that care for be good going into only just want just want one else will do be good arguing about thing like thought must forget suppose must have thought so did understand now do by god said manning making most of word suppose be fate fate be so frank so splendid be taking calmly now said almost a if apologized because be little
