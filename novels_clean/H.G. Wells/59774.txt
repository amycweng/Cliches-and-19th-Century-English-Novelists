perhaps hope of such happy discovery that made winter wedderburn frequent attendant at salesthat hope also maybe fact that have nothing else of slightest interest to do in world be shy lonely rather ineffectual man provided with just enough income to keep off spur of necessity not enough nervous energy to make seek exacting employment might have collected stamp coin translated horace bound book

troublesome then must have be very interesting knowexcept perhaps leech be sure be not good for said lady with conviction perhaps not then wedderburn looked at watch twenty three minute past eight be going up by quarter to twelve train so that there be plenty of time think will wear alpaca jacketit be quite warm enoughand grey felt hat brown shoe suppose glanced out of window at serene sky sunlit garden then nervously at cousin face think have better take umbrella if be going to london said in voice admitted of denial there between here station coming back when returned be in state of mild excitement have made purchase be rare that must make up mind quickly enough to buy time have done so there be vanda said dendrobe palonophis surveyed purchase lovingly a consumed soup be laid out on spotless table cloth before be telling cousin about a slowly meandered through dinner be custom to live visit to london over again in evening for own entertainment knew something must happen to day have bought of themsome of themi feel sure do know that of will be remarkable dont know how be feel just a sure a if one have told that of will turn out remarkable that onehe pointed to shrivelled rhizomewas not identified may be palonophisor may not may be new specie even new genus be last that poor batten ever collected dont like look of said housekeeper such ugly shape to scarcely seems to have shape dont like thing stick out said housekeeper will be put away in pot to morrow look said housekeeper like spider shamming dead wedderburn smiled surveyed root with head on one side be certainly not pretty lump of stuff can never judge of thing from dry appearance may turn out to be very beautiful orchid indeed how busy will be to morrow must see to night just exactly what to do with thing to morrow will set to work found poor batten lying dead dying in mangrove swampi forget began again presently with one of very orchid crushed up under body have be unwell for day with kind of native fever suppose fainted mangrove swamp be very unwholesome drop of blood say be taken out of by jungle leech may be very plant that cost life to obtain think none better of for men must work though woman may weep said wedderburn with profound gravity fancy dying away from comfort in nasty swamp fancy being ill of fever with nothing to take chlorodyne quinineif men be left to must live on chlorodyne quinineand one round horrible native say andaman islander be most disgusting wretchesand anyhow can scarcely make good nurse not having necessary training just for people in england to have orchid dont suppose be comfortable men seem to enjoy kind of thing said wedderburn anyhow native of party be sufficiently civilised to take care of collection until colleague who be ornithologist came back again from interior though must not tell specie of orchid have let wither make thing more interesting make disgusting must be afraid of of malaria clinging to just think there have be dead body lying across ugly thing never thought of before there declare can not eat mouthful of dinner will take off table if like put in window seat can see just a well there next few day be indeed singularly busy in steamy little hothouse fussing about with charcoal lump of teak moss other mystery of orchid cultivator considered be having wonderfully eventful time in evening must talk about new orchid to friend over over again reverted to expectation of something strange several of vanda dendrobium died under care presently strange orchid began to show sign of life be delighted took housekeeper right away from jam making to see at once directly made discovery be bud said presently there will be lot of leaf there little thing coming out here be arial rootlet look to like little white finger poking out of brown dont like said housekeeper why not dont know look like finger trying to get at cant help like dislike dont know for certain dont think there be orchid know have arial rootlet quite like that may be fancy of course see be little flattened at end dont like em said housekeeper suddenly shivering turning away know very silly of meand im very sorry particularly a like thing so much cant help thinking of corpse may not be that particular plant be merely guess of mine housekeeper shrugged shoulder anyhow dont like said wedderburn felt little hurt at dislike to plant did not prevent talking to about orchid generally orchid in particular whenever felt inclined there be such queer thing about orchid said one day such possibility of surprise know darwin studied fertilisation showed that whole structure of ordinary orchid flower be contrived in order that moth might carry pollen from plant to plant well seems that there be lot of orchid known flower of can not possibly be used for fertilisation in way of cypripedium for instance there be insect known that can possibly fertilise of have never be found with seed how do form new plant by runner tuber kind of outgrowth be easily explained puzzle be be flower for very likely added orchid may be something extraordinary in way if so will study have often thought of making research a darwin did hitherto have not found time something else have happened to prevent leaf be beginning to unfold now do wish must come see said that orchid house be so hot gave headache have seen plant once again arial rootlet be now of more than foot long have unfortunately reminded her of tentacle reaching out after something got into dream growing after with incredible rapidity so that have settled to entire satisfaction that must not see plant again wedderburn have to admire leaf alone be of ordinary broad form deep glossy green with splash dot of deep red towards base knew of other leaf quite like plant be placed on low bench near thermometer close by be simple arrangement by tap dripped on hot water pipe kept air steamy spent afternoon now with regularity meditating on approaching flowering of strange plant at last great thing happened directly entered little glass house knew that spike have burst out although great palonophis lowii hid corner where new darling stood there be new odour in air rich intensely sweet scent overpowered other in crowded steaming little greenhouse directly noticed hurried down to strange orchid behold trailing green spike bore now three great splash of blossom from overpowering sweetness proceeded stopped before in ecstasy of admiration flower be white with streak of golden orange upon petal heavy labellum be coiled into intricate projection wonderful bluish purple mingled there with gold must see at once that genus be altogether new one insufferable scent how hot place be blossom swam before eye must see if temperature be right made step towards thermometer suddenly everything appeared unsteady brick on floor be dancing up down then white blossom green leaf behind whole greenhouse seemed to sweep sideways then in curve upward at half past four cousin made tea according to invariable custom wedderburn did not come in for tea be worshipping that horrid orchid told waited ten minute watch must have stopped will go call went straight to hothouse opening door called name there be reply noticed that air be very close loaded with intense perfume then saw something lying on brick between hot water pipe for minute perhaps stood motionless be lying face upward at foot of strange orchid tentacle like arial rootlet no longer swayed freely in air be crowded together tangle of grey rope stretched tight with end closely applied to chin neck hand did not understand then saw from under one of exultant tentacle upon cheek there trickled little thread of blood with inarticulate cry ran towards tried to pull away from leech like sucker snapped two of tentacle sap dripped red then overpowering scent of blossom began to make head reel how clung to tore at tough rope white inflorescence swam about felt be fainting knew must not left hastily opened nearest door after have panted for moment in fresh air have brilliant inspiration caught up flower pot smashed in window at end of greenhouse then re entered tugged now with renewed strength at wedderburns motionless body brought strange orchid crashing to floor still clung with grimmest tenacity to victim in frenzy lugged into open air then thought of tearing through sucker rootlet one by one in minute have released be dragging away from horror be white bleeding from dozen circular patch odd job man be coming up garden amazed at smashing of glass saw emerge hauling inanimate body with red stained hand for moment thought impossible thing bring water cried voice dispelled fancy when with unnatural alacrity returned with water found weeping with excitement with wedderburns head upon knee wiping blood from face whats matter said wedderburn opening eye feebly closing again at once go tell annie to come out here to then go for dr haddon at once said to odd job man so soon a brought water added seeing hesitated will tell about when come back presently wedderburn opened eye again seeing that be troubled by puzzle of position explained to fainted in hothouse orchid will see to said wedderburn have lost good deal of blood beyond that have suffered no very great injury gave brandy mixed with pink extract of meat carried upstairs to bed housekeeper told incredible story in fragment to dr haddon come to orchid house see said cold outer air be blowing in through open door sickly perfume be almost dispelled most of torn arial rootlet lay already withered amidst number of dark stain upon brick stem of inflorescence be broken by fall of plant flower be growing limp brown at edge of petal doctor stooped towards then saw that one of arial rootlet still stirred feebly hesitated next morning strange orchid still lay there black now putrescent door banged intermittingly in morning breeze array of wedderburns orchid be shrivelled prostrate wedderburn be bright garrulous upstairs in story of strange adventure pyornis island man with scarred face leant over table looked at bundle orchid asked few said cypripedium said chiefly said anything newi thought not did island twenty fivetwenty seven year ago if find anything new herewell brand new didnt leave much im not collector said be young then went on lord how used to fly round seemed to take measure be in east indie two year in brazil seven then went to madagascar know few explorer by name said anticipating yarn who did collect for dawson wonder if youve heard name of butcher ever butcherbutcher name seemed vaguely present in memory then recalled butcher v dawson why said be man who sued for four year salarygot cast away on desert island servant said man with scar bowing funny case wasnt here be making little fortune on island doing nothing for quite unable to give notice often used to amuse thinking over while be there did calculation of itbigall over blessed atoll in ornamental figuring how did happen said dont rightly remember case wellyouve heard of pyornis rather andrew be telling of new specie be working on only month so ago just before sailed theyve got thigh bone seems nearly yard long monster thing must have be believe said man with scar be monster sinbad roc be just legend of em when did find bone three four year ago fancy why whybecause found emlordits nearly twenty year ago if dawson hadnt be silly about salary might have made perfect ring in emi couldnt help infernal boat going adrift paused suppose same place kind of swamp about ninety mile north of antananarivo do happen to know have to go to along coast by boat dont happen to remember perhaps dont fancy andrew said something about swamp must be same on east coast somehow there something in water keep thing from decaying like creosote smell reminded of trinidad did get more egg of egg found be foot half long swamp go circling round know cut off bit mostly salt too wellwhat time have of found thing quite by accident went for egg two native chap in one of rum canoe tied together found bone at same time have tent provision for four day pitched on one of firmer place to think of brings that odd tarry smell back even now funny work go probing into mud with iron rod know usually egg get smashed wonder how long be since pyornises really lived missionary say native have legend about when be alive never heard such story certainly egg got be a fresh a if have be new laid fresh carrying down to boat one of nigger chap dropped one on rock smashed how lammed into beggar sweet be a if be new laid not even smelly mother dead four hundred year perhaps said centipede have bit however im getting off straight with story have taken day to dig into slush get egg out unbroken be covered with beastly black mud naturally be cross so far a knew be only egg have ever be got out not even cracked went afterwards to see one have at natural history museum in london of be cracked just stuck together like mosaic bit missing mine be perfect meant to blow when got back naturally be annoyed at silly devil dropping three hour work just on account of centipede hit about rather footnote european be known to have seen live pyornis with doubtful exception of macandrew who visited madagascar in h g w man with scar took out clay pipe placed pouch before filled up absent mindedly how about others did get home dont remember thats queer part of story have three others perfectly fresh egg well put em in boat then went up to tent to make coffee leaving two heathen down by beachthe one fooling about with sting other helping never occurred to that beggar must take advantage of peculiar position be in to pick quarrel suppose centipede poison kicking id given have upset onehe be always cantankerous sortand persuaded other remember be sitting smoking boiling up water over spirit lamp business used to take on expedition incidentally be admiring swamp under sunset black blood red be in streaksa beautiful sight up beyond land rose grey hazy to hill sky behind red like furnace mouth fifty yard behind back of be blessed heathenquite regardless of tranquil air of thingsplotting to cut off with boat leave alone with three day provision canvas tent nothing to drink whatsoever beyond little keg of water heard kind of yelp behind there be in canoe affairit wasnt properly boatand perhaps twenty yard from land realised what be up in moment gun be in tent besides have bulletsonly duck shot knew that have little revolver in pocket pulled out a ran down to beach come back say flourishing jabbered something at man broke egg jeered aimed at otherbecause be unwounded have paddle missed laughed however wasnt beat knew have to keep cool tried again made jump with whang of third time got head over went paddle with be precious lucky shot for revolver reckon be fifty yard went right under dont know if be shot simply stunned drowned then began to shout to other chap to come back huddled up in canoe refused to answer so fired out revolver at never got near felt precious fool can tell there be on rotten black beach flat swamp behind flat sea cold after sunset just black canoe drifting steadily out to sea tell damned dawson jamrachs museum rest of just to right bawled to nigger to come back until voice went up into scream there be nothing for to swim after take luck with shark so opened clasp knife put in mouth took off clothes waded in a soon a be in water lost sight of canoe aimed a judged to head off hoped man in be too bad to navigate that must keep on drifting in same direction presently came up over horizon again to south westward about afterglow of sunset be well over now dim of night creeping up star be coming through blue swam like champion though leg arm be soon aching however came up to by time star be fairly out a got darker began to see manner of glowing thing in waterphosphorescence know at time made giddy hardly knew be star be phosphorescence whether be swimming on head heel canoe be a black a sin ripple under bow like liquid fire be naturally chary of clambering up into be anxious to see what be up to first seemed to be lying cuddled up in lump in bow stern be out of water thing kept turning round slowly a driftedkind of waltzing dont know went to stern pulled down expecting to wake up then began to clamber in with knife in hand ready for rush never stirred so there sat in stern of little canoe drifting away over calm phosphorescent sea with host of star above waiting for something to happen after long time called by name never answered be too tired to take risk by going along to so sat there fancy dozed once twice when dawn came saw be a dead a doornail puffed up purple three egg bone be lying in middle of canoe keg of water coffee biscuit wrapped in cape argus by foot tin of methylated spirit underneath there be paddle in fact anything except spirit tin that one must use a one so settled to drift until be picked up held inquest on brought in verdict against snake scorpion centipede unknown sent overboard after have drink of water few biscuit took look round suppose man low down a be dont see very far leastways madagascar be clean out of sight trace of land at saw sail going south westwardlooked like schooner hull never came up presently sun got high in sky began to beat down upon lordit pretty near made brain boil tried dipping head in sea after while eye fell on cape argus lay down flat in canoe spread over wonderful thing newspaper never read one through thoroughly before odd what get up to when youre alone a be suppose read blessed old cape argus twenty time pitch in canoe simply reeked with heat rose up into big blister drifted ten day said man with scar little thing in telling isnt day be like last except in morning evening never kept look out eventhe blaze be so infernal didnt see sail after first three day saw took notice of about sixth night ship went by scarcely mile away from with light ablaze port open looking like big firefly there be music aboard stood up shouted screamed at second day broached one of pyornis egg scraped shell away at end bit by bit tried be glad to find be good enough to eat bit flavourynot bad mean with something of taste of duck egg there be kind of circular patch about six inch across on one side of yolk with streak of blood white mark like ladder in thought queer didnt understand what meant at time wasnt inclined to be particular egg lasted three day with biscuit drink of water chewed coffee berry tooinvigorating stuff second egg opened about eighth day scared man with scar paused yes saiddeveloping daresay find hard to believe did with thing before there egg have be sunk in cold black mud perhaps three hundred year there be mistaking there be be itembryo with big head curved back heart beating under throat yolk shrivelled up great membrane spreading inside of shell over yolk here be hatching out egg of biggest of extinct bird in little canoe in midst of indian ocean if old dawson have known that be worth four year salary what do think however have to eat precious thing up bit of before sighted reef of mouthful be beastly unpleasant left third one alone held up to light shell be too thick for to get notion of what might be happening inside though fancied heard blood pulsing might have be rustle in own ear like what listen to in seashell then came atoll came out of sunrise a be suddenly close up to drifted straight towards until be about mile from shorenot more then current took turn have to paddle a hard a must with hand bit of pyornis shell to make place however got there be just common atoll about four mile round with few tree growing spring in one place lagoon full of parrot fish took egg ashore put in good place well above tide line in sun to give chance must pulled canoe up safe loafed about prospecting rum how dull atoll be when be kid thought nothing must be finer more adventurous than robinson crusoe business place be a monotonous a book of sermon went round finding eatable thing generally thinking tell be bored to death before first day be out show luckthe very day landed weather changed thunderstorm went by to north flicked wing over island in night there came drencher howling wind slap over have taken much know to upset canoe be sleeping under canoe egg be luckily among sand higher up beach first thing remember be sound like hundred pebble hitting boat at once rush of water over body id be dreaming of antananarivo sat up holloaed to intoshi to ask what devil be up clawed out at chair where match used to be then remembered where be there be phosphorescent wave rolling up a if meant to eat rest of night a black a pitch air be simply yelling cloud seemed down on head almost rain fell a if heaven be sinking be baling out water above firmament one great roller came writhing at like fiery serpent bolted then thought of canoe ran down to a water went hissing back again thing have gone wondered about egg then felt way to be right well out of reach of maddest wave so sat down beside cuddled for company lord what night be storm be over before morning there wasnt rag of cloud left in sky when dawn came along beach there be bit of plank scatteredwhich be disarticulated skeleton so to speak of canoe however gave something to do for taking advantage of two of tree being together rigged up kind of storm shelter with vestige day egg hatched hatched sir when head be pillowed on be asleep heard whack felt jar sat up there be end of egg pecked out rum little brown head looking out at lord said youre welcome with little difficulty came out be nice friendly little chap at first about size of small henvery much like most other young bird only bigger plumage be dirty brown to begin with with sort of grey scab fell off very soon scarcely feathersa kind of downy hair can hardly express how pleased be to see tell robinson crusoe dont make near enough of loneliness here be interesting company looked at winked eye from front backwards like hen gave chirp began to peck about at once a though being hatched three hundred year too late be just nothing glad to see man friday say for have naturally settled be to be called man friday if ever be hatched a soon a ever found egg in canoe have developed be bit anxious about feed so gave lump of raw parrot fish at once took opened beak for more be glad of for under circumstance if hed be fanciful must have have to eat after youd be surprised what interesting bird pyornis chick be followed about from very beginning used to stand by watch while fished in lagoon go share in anything caught be sensible too there be nasty green warty thing like pickled gherkin used to lie about on beach tried one of upset never even looked at of again grew must almost see grow a be never much of society man quiet friendly way suited to t for nearly two year be a happy a must be on island have business worry for knew salary be mounting up at dawson must see sail now then nothing ever came near amused too by decorating island with design worked in sea urchin fancy shell of various kind put pyornis island round place very nearly in big letter like what see done with coloured stone at railway station in old country used to lie watching blessed bird stalking round growing growing think how must make living out of by showing about if ever got taken off after first moult began to get handsome with crest blue wattle lot of green feather at behind of then used to puzzle whether dawson have right to claim not stormy weather in rainy season lay snug under shelter have made out of old canoe used to tell lie about friend at home be kind of idyll might say if only have have tobacco must have be simply just like heaven be about end of second year little paradise went wrong friday be then about fourteen foot high to bill of with big broad head like end of pickaxe two huge brown eye with yellow rim set together like mansnot out of sight of other like hen plumage be finenone of half mourning style of ostrichmore like cassowary a far a colour texture go then be began to cock comb at give air show sign of nasty temper at last came time when fishing have be rather unlucky began to hang about in queer meditative way thought might have be eating sea cucumber something be really just discontent on part be hungry too when at last landed fish wanted for temper be short that morning on side pecked at grabbed gave whack on head to make leave go at that went for lord gave in face man indicated scar then kicked be like cart horse got up seeing hadnt finished started off full tilt with arm doubled up over face ran on gawky leg of faster than race horse kept landing out at with sledge hammer kick bringing pickaxe down on back of head made for lagoon went in up to neck stopped at water for hated getting foot wet began to make shindy something like peacock only hoarser started strutting up down beach ill admit felt small to see blessed fossil lording there head face be bleeding andwell body just one jelly of bruise decided to swim across lagoon leave alone for bit until affair blew over shinned up tallest palm tree sat there thinking of dont suppose ever felt so hurt by anything before since be brutal ingratitude of creature id be more than brother to id hatched educated great gawky out of date bird human beingheir of age thought after time hed begin to see thing in light feel little sorry for behaviour thought if be to catch nice little bit of fish perhaps go to presently in casual kind of way offer to might do sensible thing took time to learn how unforgiving cantankerous extinct bird can be malice wont tell little device tried to get bird round again simply cant make cheek burn with shame even now to think of snub buffet have from infernal curiosity tried violence chucked lump of coral at from safe distance only swallowed shied open knife at almost lost though be too big for to swallow tried starving out struck fishing took to picking along beach at low water after worm rubbed along on that time spent up to neck in lagoon rest up palm tree one of be scarcely high enough when caught up have regular bank holiday with calf of leg got unbearable dont know if have ever tried sleeping up palm tree gave most horrible nightmare think of shame of too here be extinct animal mooning about island like sulky duke not allowed to rest sole of foot on place used to cry with weariness vexation told straight that didnt mean to be chased about desert island by damned anachronism told to go peck navigator of own age only snapped beak at great ugly birdall leg neck shouldnt like to say how long went on altogether id have killed sooner if id known how however hit on way of settling at last south american dodge joined fishing line together with stem of seaweed thing made stoutish string perhaps twelve yard in length more fastened two lump of coral rock to end of took time to do because now then have to go into lagoon up tree a fancy took whirled rapidly round head then let go at first time missed next time string caught leg beautifully wrapped round again again over went threw standing waist deep in lagoon a soon a went down be out of water sawing at neck with knife dont like to think of even now felt like murderer while did though anger be hot against when stood over saw bleeding on white sand beautiful great leg neck writhing in last agonypah with tragedy loneliness came upon like curse good lord cant imagine how missed that bird sat by corpse sorrowed over shivered a looked round desolate silent reef thought of what jolly little bird have be when be hatched of thousand pleasant trick have played before went wrong thought if id only wounded might have nursed round into better understanding if id have mean of digging into coral rock id have buried felt exactly a if be human a be couldnt think of eating so put in lagoon little fish picked clean then one day chap cruising about in yacht have fancy to see if atoll still existed didnt come moment too soon for be about sick enough of desolation of only hesitating whether must walk out into sea finish up business way fall back on green thing sold bone to man named winslowa dealer near british museum say sold to old havers seems havers didnt understand be extra large be only after death attracted attention called em pyorniswhat be pyornis vastus said funny very thing be mentioned to by friend of mine when found pyornis with thigh yard long thought have reached top of scale called pyornis maximus then one turned up thigh bone four foot six more that called pyornis titan then vastus be found after old havers died in collection then vastissimus turned up winslow be telling a much said man with scar if get more pyornises reckons scientific swell will go burst blood vessel be queer thing to happen to man wasnt italtogether plattner story whether story of gottfried plattner be to be credited not be pretty question in value of evidence on one hand have seven witnessesto be perfectly exact have six half pair of eye one undeniable fact on other havewhat be itprejudice common sense inertia of opinion never be there seven more honest seeming witness never be there more undeniable fact than inversion of gottfried plattners anatomical structure andnever be there more preposterous story than one have to tell most preposterous part of story be worthy gottfrieds contribution for count a one of seven heaven forbid must be led into giving countenance to superstition by passion for impartiality so come to share fate of eusapias patron frankly believe there be something crooked about business of gottfried plattner what that crooked factor be will admit a frankly know have be surprised at credit accorded to story in most unexpected authoritative quarter fairest way to reader however will be for to tell without further comment gottfried plattner be in spite of name freeborn englishman father be alsatian who came to england in sixty married respectable english girl of unexceptionable antecedent died after wholesome uneventful life devoted understand chiefly to laying of parquet flooring in gottfrieds age be seven twenty be by virtue of heritage of three language modern language master in small private school in south of england to casual observer be singularly like other modern language master in other small private school costume be very costly very fashionable on other hand be not markedly cheap shabby complexion like height bearing be inconspicuous must notice perhaps that like majority of people face be not absolutely symmetrical right eye little larger than left jaw trifle heavier on right side if a ordinary careless person be to bare chest feel heart beating must probably find quite like heart of one else here trained observer must part company if found heart quite ordinary trained observer must find quite otherwise once thing be pointed out to too must perceive peculiarity easily enough be that gottfrieds heart beat on right side of body now be not only singularity of gottfrieds structure although be only one must appeal to untrained mind careful sounding of gottfrieds internal arrangement by well known surgeon seems to point to fact that other unsymmetrical part of body be similarly misplaced right lobe of liver be on left side left on right while lung too be similarly contraposed what be still more singular unless gottfried be consummate actor must believe that right hand have recently become left since occurrence be about to consider a impartially a possible have found utmost difficulty in writing except from right to left across paper with left hand can not throw with right hand be perplexed at meal time between knife fork idea of rule of roadhe be cyclistare still dangerous confusion there be not scrap of evidence to show that before occurrence gottfried be at left handed there be yet wonderful fact in preposterous business gottfried produce three photograph of have at age of five six thrusting fat leg at from under plaid frock scowling in photograph left eye be little larger than right jaw be trifle heavier on left side be reverse of present living condition photograph of gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict fact be because be one of cheap gem photograph be then in vogue taken direct upon metal therefore reversing thing just a looking glass must third photograph represents at one twenty confirms record of others there seems here evidence of strongest confirmatory character gottfried have exchanged left side for right yet how human being can be so changed short of fantastic pointless miracle be exceedingly hard to suggest in one way of course fact might be explicable on supposition that plattner have undertaken elaborate mystification on strength of heart displacement photograph may be fudged left handedness imitated character of man doe not lend to such theory be quiet practical unobtrusive thoroughly sane from nordau standpoint like beer smoke moderately take walking exercise daily have healthily high estimate of value of teaching have good untrained tenor voice take pleasure in singing air of popular cheerful character be fond not morbidly fond of readingchiefly fiction pervaded with vaguely pious optimismsleeps well rarely dream be in fact very last person to evolve fantastic fable indeed so far from forcing story upon world have be singularly reticent on matter meet enquirer with certain engagingbashfulness be almost word disarms most suspicious seems genuinely ashamed that anything so unusual have occurred to be to be regretted that plattners aversion to idea of post mortem dissection may postpone perhaps for ever positive proof that entire body have have left right side transposed upon fact mainly credibility of story hang there be way of taking man moving about in space a ordinary people understand space will result in changing side do right be still right left left can do with perfectly thin flat thing of course if be to cut figure out of paper figure with right left side must change side simply by lifting up turning over with solid be different mathematical theorist tell that only way in right left side of solid body can be changed be by taking that body clean out of space a know ittaking out of ordinary existence be turning somewhere outside space be little abstruse doubt one with knowledge of mathematical theory will assure reader of truth to put thing in technical language curious inversion of plattners right left side be proof that have moved out of space into what be called fourth dimension that have returned again to world unless choose to consider victim of elaborate motiveless fabrication be almost bound to believe that have occurred so much for tangible fact come now to account of phenomenon attended temporary disappearance from world appears that in sussexville proprietary school plattner not only discharged duty of modern language master also taught chemistry commercial geography book keeping shorthand drawing other additional subject to changing fancy of boy parent might direct attention knew little nothing of various subject in secondary a distinguished from board elementary school knowledge in teacher be very properly by mean so necessary a high moral character gentlemanly tone in chemistry be particularly deficient knowing say nothing beyond three gas three gas may be a however pupil began by knowing nothing derived information from caused one little inconvenience for several term then little boy named whibble joined school who have be educated seems by mischievous relative into enquiring habit of mind little boy followed plattners lesson with marked sustained interest in order to exhibit zeal on subject brought at various time substance for plattner to analyse plattner flattered by evidence of power of awakening interest trusting to boy ignorance analysed even made general statement a to composition indeed be so far stimulated by pupil a to obtain work upon analytical chemistry study during supervision of evening preparation be surprised to find chemistry quite interesting subject so far story be absolutely commonplace now greenish powder come upon scene source of greenish powder seems unfortunately lost master whibble tell tortuous story of finding done up in packet in disused limekiln near down must have be excellent thing for plattner possibly for master whibbles family if match must have be applied to powder there then young gentleman certainly did not bring to school in packet in common eight ounce graduated medicine bottle plugged with masticated newspaper gave to plattner at end of afternoon school four boy have be detained after school prayer in order to complete neglected task plattner be supervising in small classroom in chemical teaching be conducted appliance for practical teaching of chemistry in sussexville proprietary school a in most small school in country be characterised by severe simplicity be kept in small cupboard standing in recess having about same capacity a common travelling trunk plattner being bored with passive superintendence seems to have welcomed intervention of whibble with green powder a agreeable diversion unlocking cupboard proceeded at once with analytical experiment whibble sat luckily for at safe distance regarding four malefactor feigning profound absorption in work watched furtively with keenest interest for even within limit of three gas plattners practical chemistry be understand temerarious be practically unanimous in account of plattners proceeding poured little of green powder into test tube tried substance with water hydrochloric acid nitric acid sulphuric acid in succession getting result emptied out little heapnearly bottleful in factupon slate tried match held medicine bottle in left hand stuff began to smoke melt thenexploded with deafening violence

proverbial expression evidence of absolute disappearance a consequence of explosion be indubitable be not necessary to enlarge here upon commotion excited in sussexville proprietary school in sussexville elsewhere by event be quite possible indeed that of reader of page may recall hearing of remote dying version of excitement during last summer holiday lidgett must seem did everything in power to suppress minimise story instituted penalty of twenty five line for mention of plattners name among boy stated in schoolroom that be clearly aware of assistant whereabouts be afraid explains that possibility of explosion happening in spite of elaborate precaution taken to minimise practical teaching of chemistry might injure reputation of school so might mysterious quality in plattners departure indeed did everything in power to make occurrence seem a ordinary a possible in particular cross examined five eye witness of occurrence so searchingly that began to doubt plain evidence of sens in spite of effort tale in magnified distorted state made nine day wonder in district several parent withdrew son on colourable pretext not least remarkable point in matter be fact that large number of people in neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dream of plattner during period of excitement before return that dream have curious uniformity in almost of plattner be seen sometimes singly sometimes in company wandering about through coruscating iridescence in case face be pale distressed in gesticulated towards dreamer one two of boy evidently under influence of nightmare fancied that plattner approached with remarkable swiftness seemed to look closely into very eye others fled with plattner from pursuit of vague extraordinary creature of globular shape fancy be forgotten in enquiry speculation when on wednesday next one after monday of explosion plattner returned circumstance of return be a singular a of departure so far a mr lidgetts somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from plattners hesitating statement must appear that on wednesday evening towards hour of sunset former gentleman having dismissed evening preparation be engaged in garden picking eating strawberry fruit of be inordinately fond be large old fashioned garden secured from observation fortunately by high ivy covered red brick wall just a be stooping over particularly prolific plant there be flash in air heavy thud before must look round heavy body struck violently from behind be pitched forward crushing strawberry held in hand that so roughly that silk hatmr lidgett adheres to older idea of scholastic costumewas driven violently down upon forehead almost over one eye heavy missile slid over sideways collapsed into sitting posture among strawberry plant proved to be long lost mr gottfried plattner in extremely dishevelled condition be collarless hatless linen be dirty there be blood upon hand mr lidgett be so indignant surprised that remained on four with hat jammed down on eye while expostulated vehemently with plattner for disrespectful unaccountable conduct scarcely idyllic scene completes what may call exterior version of plattner storyits exoteric aspect be quite unnecessary to enter here into detail of dismissal by mr lidgett such detail with full name date reference will be found in larger report of occurrence be laid before society for investigation of abnormal phenomenon singular transposition of plattners right left side be scarcely observed for first day so then first in connection with disposition to write from right to left across blackboard concealed rather than ostended curious confirmatory circumstance a considered must unfavourably affect prospect in new situation displacement of heart be discovered month after when be having tooth extracted under ansthetics then very unwillingly allowed cursory surgical examination to be made of with view to brief account in journal of anatomy exhaust statement of material fact may now go on to consider plattners account of matter first let clearly differentiate between preceding portion of story what be to follow have told thus far be established by such evidence a even criminal lawyer must approve one of witness be still alive reader if have leisure may hunt lad out to morrow even brave terror of redoubtable lidgett cross examine trap test to heart content gottfried plattner twisted heart three photograph be producible may be taken a proved that did disappear for nine day a consequence of explosion that returned almost a violently under circumstance in nature annoying to mr lidgett detail of circumstance may be that returned inverted just a reflection return from mirror from last fact a have already stated follows almost inevitably that plattner during nine day must have be in state of existence altogether out of space evidence to statement be indeed far stronger than upon most murderer be hanged for own particular account of where have be with confused explanation well nigh contradictory detail have only mr gottfried plattners word wish to discredit must point outwhat so many writer upon obscure psychic phenomenon fail to dothat be passing here from practically undeniable to kind of matter reasonable man be entitled to believe reject a think proper previous statement render plausible discordance with common experience tilt towards incredible must prefer not to sway beam of reader judgment way simply to tell story a plattner told gave narrative may state at house at chislehurst so soon a have left that evening went into study wrote down everything a remembered subsequently be good enough to read over typewritten copy so that substantial correctness be undeniable state that at moment of explosion distinctly thought be killed felt lifted off foot driven forcibly backward be curious fact for psychologist that thought clearly during backward flight wondered whether must hit chemistry cupboard blackboard easel heel struck ground staggered fell heavily into sitting position on something soft firm for moment concussion stunned became aware at once of vivid scent of singed hair seemed to hear voice of lidgett asking for will understand for time mind be greatly confused at first be distinctly under impression that be still in classroom perceived quite distinctly surprise of boy entry of mr lidgett be quite positive upon score did not hear remark that ascribed to deafening effect of experiment thing about seemed curiously dark faint mind explained that on obvious mistaken idea that explosion have engendered huge volume of dark smoke through dimness figure of lidgett boy moved a faint silent a ghost plattners face still tingled with stinging heat of flash be say muddled first definite thought seem to have be of personal safety thought be perhaps blinded deafened felt limb face in gingerly manner then perception grew clearer be astonished to miss old familiar desk other schoolroom furniture about only dim uncertain grey shape stood in place of then came thing made shout aloud awoke stunned faculty to instant activity two of boy gesticulating walked one after other clean through neither manifested slightest consciousness of presence be difficult to imagine sensation felt came against say with more force than wisp of mist plattners first thought after be that be dead having be brought up with thoroughly sound view in matter however be little surprised to find body still about second conclusion be that be not dead that others be that explosion have destroyed sussexville proprietary school soul in except that too be scarcely satisfactory be thrown back upon astonished observation everything about be extraordinarily dark at first seemed to have altogether ebony blackness overhead be black firmament only touch of light in scene be faint greenish glow at edge of sky in one direction threw into prominence horizon of undulating black hill say be impression at first a eye grew accustomed to darkness began to distinguish faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in circumambient night against background furniture occupant of classroom seems stood out like phosphorescent spectre faint impalpable extended hand thrust without effort through wall of room by fireplace describes a making strenuous effort to attract attention shouted to lidgett tried to seize boy a went to fro only desisted from attempt when mr lidgett whom a assistant master naturally disliked entered room say sensation of being in world yet not part of be extraordinarily disagreeable one compared feeling not inaptly to of cat watching mouse through window whenever made motion to communicate with dim familiar world about found invisible incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse then turned attention to solid environment found medicine bottle still unbroken in hand with remainder of green powder therein put in pocket began to feel about apparently be sitting on boulder of rock covered with velvety moss dark country about be unable to see faint misty picture of schoolroom blotting out have feeling due perhaps to cold wind that be near crest of hill that steep valley fell away beneath foot green glow along edge of sky seemed to be growing in extent intensity stood up rubbing eye must seem that made few step going steeply downhill then stumbled nearly fell sat down again upon jagged mass of rock to watch dawn became aware that world about be absolutely silent be a still a be dark though there be cold wind blowing up hill face rustle of grass soughing of bough must have accompanied be absent must hear therefore if must not see that hillside upon stood be rocky desolate green grew brighter moment a did so faint transparent blood red mingled with did not mitigate blackness of sky overhead rocky desolation about having regard to what follows be inclined to think that redness may have be optical effect due to contrast something black fluttered momentarily against livid yellow green of lower sky then thin penetrating voice of bell rose out of black gulf below oppressive expectation grew with growing light be probable that hour more elapsed while sat there strange green light growing brighter moment spreading slowly in flamboyant finger upward towards zenith a grew spectral vision of world became relatively absolutely fainter probably for time must have be about of earthly sunset so far a vision of world went plattner by few step downhill have passed through floor of classroom be now seemed sitting in mid air in larger schoolroom downstairs saw boarder distinctly much more faintly than have seen lidgett be preparing evening task noticed with interest that several be cheating with euclid rider by mean of crib compilation whose existence have hitherto never suspected a time passed faded steadily a steadily a light of green dawn increased looking down into valley saw that light have crept far down rocky side that profound blackness of abyss be now broken by minute green glow like light of glow worm almost immediately limb of huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over basaltic undulation of distant hill monstrous hill mass about came out gaunt desolate in green light deep ruddy black shadow became aware of vast number of ball shaped object drifting a thistledown drift over high ground there be none of nearer to than opposite side of gorge bell below twanged quicker quicker with something like impatient insistence several light moved hither thither boy at work at desk be now almost imperceptibly faint extinction of world when green sun of other universe rose be curious point upon plattner insists during other world night be difficult to move about on account of vividness with thing of world be visible becomes riddle to explain why if be case in world catch glimpse of other world be due perhaps to comparatively vivid illumination of world of ours plattner describes midday of other world at brightest a not being nearly so bright a world at full moon while night be profoundly black consequently amount of light even in ordinary dark room be sufficient to render thing of other world invisible on same principle that faint phosphorescence be only visible in profoundest darkness have tried since told story to see something of other world by sitting for long space in photographer dark room at night have certainly seen indistinctly form of greenish slope rock only must admit very indistinctly indeed reader may possibly be more successful plattner tell that since return have dreamt seen recognised place in other world be probably due to memory of scene seems quite possible that people with unusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch glimpse of strange other world about however be digression a green sun rose long street of black building became perceptible though only darkly indistinctly in gorge after hesitation plattner began to clamber down precipitous descent towards descent be long exceedingly tedious being so not only by extraordinary steepness also by reason of looseness of boulder with whole face of hill be strewn noise of descentnow then heel struck fire from rocksseemed now only sound in universe for beating of bell have ceased a drew nearer perceived that various edifice have singular resemblance to tomb mausoleum monument saving only that be uniformly black instead of being white a most sepulchre be then saw crowding out of largest building very much a people disperse from church number of pallid rounded pale green figure dispersed in several direction about broad street of place going through side alley reappearing upon steepness of hill others entering of small black building lined way at sight of thing drifting up towards plattner stopped staring be not walking be indeed limbless have appearance of human head beneath tadpole like body swung be too astonished at strangeness too full indeed of strangeness to be seriously alarmed by drove towards in front of chill wind be blowing uphill much a soap bubble drive before draught a looked at nearest of approaching saw be indeed human head albeit with singularly large eye wearing such expression of distress anguish a have never seen before upon mortal countenance be surprised to find that did not turn to regard seemed to be watching following unseen moving thing for moment be puzzled then occurred to that creature be watching with enormous eye something be happening in world have just left nearer came nearer be too astonished to cry out made very faint fretting sound a came close to then struck face with gentle patits touch be very coldand drove past upward towards crest of hill extraordinary conviction flashed across plattners mind that head have strong likeness to lidgett then turned attention to other head be now swarming thickly up hillside none made slightest sign of recognition one two indeed came close to head almost followed example of first dodged convulsively out of way upon most of saw same expression of unavailing regret have seen upon first heard same faint sound of wretchedness from one two wept one rolling swiftly uphill wore expression of diabolical rage others be cold several have look of gratified interest in eye one at least be almost in ecstasy of happiness plattner doe not remember that recognised more likeness in saw at time for several hour perhaps plattner watched strange thing dispersing over hill not till long after have ceased to issue from clustering black building in gorge did resume downward climb darkness about increased so much that have difficulty in stepping true overhead sky be now bright pale green felt hunger thirst later when did found chilly stream running down centre of gorge rare moss upon boulder when tried at last in desperation be good to eat groped about among tomb ran down gorge seeking vaguely for clue to inexplicable thing after long time came to entrance of big mausoleum like building from head have issued in found group of green light burning upon kind of basaltic altar bell rope from belfry overhead hanging down into centre of place round wall ran lettering of fire in character unknown to while be still wondering at purport of thing heard receding tramp of heavy foot echoing far down street ran out into darkness again must see nothing have mind to pull bell rope finally decided to follow footstep although ran far never overtook shouting be of avail gorge seemed to extend interminable distance be a dark a earthly starlight throughout length while ghastly green day lay along upper edge of precipice there be none of head now below be seemed busily occupied along upper slope looking up saw drifting hither thither hovering stationary flying swiftly through air reminded said of big snowflake only be black pale green in pursuing firm undeviating footstep that never overtook in groping into new region of endless devil dyke in clambering up down pitiless height in wandering about summit in watching drifting face plattner state that spent better part of seven eight day did not keep count say though once twice found eye watching have word with living soul slept among rock on hillside in gorge thing earthly be invisible because from earthly standpoint be far underground on altitude so soon a earthly day began world became visible to found sometimes stumbling over dark green rock arresting on precipitous brink while about green branch of sussexville lane be swaying again seemed to be walking through sussexville street watching unseen private business of household then be discovered that to almost human being in world there pertained of drifting head one in world be watched intermittently by helpless disembodiments what be theythese watcher of living plattner never learned two presently found followed be like childhood memory of father mother now then other face turned eye upon eye like of dead people who have swayed injured helped in youth manhood whenever looked at plattner be overcome with strange sense of responsibility to mother ventured to speak made answer looked sadly steadfastly tenderlya little reproachfully too seemedinto eye simply tell story doe not endeavour to explain be left to surmise who watcher of living may be if be indeed dead why must so closely passionately watch world have left for ever may beindeed to mind seems justthat when life have closed when evil good be no longer choice for may still have to witness working out of train of consequence have laid if human soul continue after death then surely human interest continue after death be merely own guess at meaning of thing seen plattner offer interpretation for none be given be well reader must understand clearly day after day with head reeling wandered about strange lit world outside world weary towards end weak hungry by dayby earthly day that isthe ghostly vision of old familiar scenery of sussexville about irked worried must not see where to put foot ever again with chilly touch one of watching soul must come against face after dark multitude of watcher about intent distress confused mind beyond describing great longing to return to earthly life be so near yet so remote consumed unearthliness of thing about produced positively painful mental distress be worried beyond describing by own particular follower must shout at to desist from staring at scold at hurry away from be always mute intent run a might over uneven ground followed destiny on ninth day towards evening plattner heard invisible footstep approaching far away down gorge be then wandering over broad crest of same hill upon have fallen in entry into strange other world of turned to hurry down into gorge feeling way hastily be arrested by sight of thing be happening in room in back street near school of people in room knew by sight window be open blind up setting sun shone clearly into so that came out quite brightly at first vivid oblong of room lying like magic lantern picture upon black landscape livid green dawn in addition to sunlight candle have just be lit in room on bed lay lank man ghastly white face terrible upon tumbled pillow clenched hand be raised above head little table beside bed carried few medicine bottle toast water empty glass now then lank man lip fell apart to indicate word must not articulate woman did not notice that wanted anything because be busy turning out paper from old fashioned bureau in opposite corner of room at first picture be very vivid indeed a green dawn behind grew brighter brighter so became fainter more more transparent a echoing footstep paced nearer nearer footstep sound so loud in other world come so silently in plattner perceived about great multitude of dim face gathering together out of darkness watching two people in room never before have seen so many of watcher of living multitude have eye only for sufferer in room multitude in infinite anguish watched woman a hunted with greedy eye for something must not find crowded about plattner came across sight buffeted face noise of unavailing regret be about saw clearly only now then at other time picture quivered dimly through veil of green reflection upon movement in room must have be very still plattner say candle flame streamed up into perfectly vertical line of smoke in ear footfall echo beat like clap of thunder face two more particularly near woman one woman also white clear featured face might have once be cold hard be now softened by touch of wisdom strange to earth other might have be woman father be evidently absorbed in contemplation of act of hateful meanness so seemed must no longer guard against prevent behind be others teacher may be who have taught ill friend whose influence have failed over man tooa multitude none seemed to be parent teacher face might once have be coarse now purged to strength by sorrow in forefront one face girlish one angry remorseful merely patient weary a seemed to plattner waiting for relief power of description fail at memory of multitude of ghastly countenance gathered on stroke of bell saw in space of second must seem that be so worked on by excitement that quite involuntarily restless finger took bottle of green powder out of pocket held before doe not remember that abruptly footstep ceased waited for next there be silence then suddenly cutting through unexpected stillness like keen thin blade came first stroke of bell at that multitudinous face swayed to fro louder cry began about woman did not hear be burning something now in candle flame at second stroke everything grew dim breath of wind icy cold blew through host of watcher swirled about like eddy of dead leaf in spring at third stroke something be extended through to bed have heard of beam of light be like beam of darkness looking again at plattner saw that be shadowy arm hand green sun be now topping black desolation of horizon vision of room be very faint plattner must see that white of bed struggled be convulsed that woman looked round over shoulder at startled cloud of watcher lifted high like puff of green dust before wind swept swiftly downward towards temple in gorge then suddenly plattner understood meaning of shadowy black arm stretched across shoulder clutched prey did not dare turn head to see shadow behind arm with violent effort covering eye set to run made perhaps twenty stride then slipped on boulder fell fell forward on hand bottle smashed exploded a touched ground in moment found stunned bleeding sitting face to face with lidgett in old walled garden behind school there story of plattners experience end have resisted believe successfully natural disposition of writer of fiction to dress up incident of sort have told thing a far a possible in order in plattner told to have carefully avoided attempt at style effect construction must have be easy for instance to have worked scene of death bed into kind of plot in plattner might have be involved quite apart from objectionableness of falsifying most extraordinary true story such trite device must spoil to mind peculiar effect of dark world with livid green illumination drifting watcher of living unseen unapproachable to be yet lying about remains to add that death did actually occur in vincent terrace just beyond school garden so far a can be proved at moment of plattners return deceased be rate collector insurance agent widow who be much younger than married last month mr whymper veterinary surgeon of allbeeding a portion of story given here have in various form circulated orally in sussexville have consented to use of name on condition make distinctly known that emphatically contradicts detail of plattners account of husband last moment burnt will say although plattner never accused of doing so husband made one will just after marriage certainly from man who have never seen plattners account of furniture of room be curiously accurate one other thing even at risk of irksome repetition must insist upon lest seem to favour credulous superstitious view plattners absence from world for nine day be think proved that doe not prove story be quite conceivable that even outside space hallucination may be possible that at least reader must bear distinctly in mind argonaut of air one saw monsons flying machine from window of train passing either along south western main line along line between wimbledon worcester parkto be more exact one saw huge scaffolding limited flight of apparatus rose over tree top massive alley of interlacing iron timber enormous web of rope tackle extending best part of two mile from leatherhead branch alley be foreshortened in part hidden by hill with villa from main line one have in profile complex tangle of girder curving bar very impressive to excursionist from portsmouth southampton west monson have taken up work where maxim have left have gone on at first with utter contempt for journalistic wit ignorance have irritated hampered predecessor have spent be said rather more than immense fortune upon experiment result to impatient generation seemed inconsiderable when five year have passed after growth of colossal iron grove at worcester park monson still failed to put in fluttering appearance over trafalgar square even isle of wight tripper felt liberty to smile such intelligent people a did not consider monson fool stricken with mania for invention denounced a being for particular reason self advertising quack yet now again morning trainload of season ticket holder must see white monster rush headlong through airy tracery of guide bar hear further stay netting buffer snap creak groan with impact of blow then there must be efflorescence of black set white rimmed face along side of train morning paper must be neglected for vigorous discussion of possibility of flying in nothing new be ever said by chance until train reached waterloo cargo of season ticket holder dispersed over london father mother in multitudinous train of weary excursionist returning exhausted from day of rest by sea must find dark fabric standing out against evening sky useful in diverting bilious child from introspection be suddenly startled by swift transit of huge black flapping shape strained upward against guide be great forcible thing beyond dispute excellent for conversation yet same be flying in leading string most of who witnessed scarcely counted flight a flying more of switchback seemed to run of folk monson say did not trouble very keenly about opinion of press at first possibly even have formed poor idea of time must take before tactic of flying be mastered swift assured adjustment of big soaring shape to gust chance movement of air have clearly reckoned money prolonged struggle against gravitation must cost be not so pachydermatous a seemed secretly have periodical bundle of cutting sent by romeike have periodical reminder from banker if did not mind initial ridicule scepticism felt growing neglect a month went by money dribbled away time be when monson have sent enterprising journalist keen after readable matter empty from gate when enterprising journalist ceased from troubling monson be anything satisfied in heart of heart still day by day work went on multitudinous subtle difficulty of steering diminished in number day by day too money trickled away until balance be no longer matter of hundred of thousand of ten at last came anniversary monson sitting in little drawing shed suddenly noticed date on woodhouses calendar be five year ago to day that began said to woodhouse suddenly be said woodhouse alteration play devil with said monson biting paper fastener drawing for new van to hinder screw lay on table before a spoke pitched mutilated brass paper fastener into waste paper basket drummed with finger alteration will mathematician ever be clever enough to save patching experimenting five yearslearning by rule of thumb when one might think that be possible to calculate whole thing out beforehand cost of might have hired three senior wrangler for life theyd only have developed beautifully useless theorem in pneumatics what time have be woodhouse moulding will take three week said woodhouse at special price three week said monson sat drumming three week certain said woodhouse excellent engineer good a comforter drew sheet towards began shading bar monson stopped drumming began to bite finger nail staring while at woodhouses head how long have be calling monsons folly said suddenly oh year so said woodhouse carelessly without looking up monson sucked air in between teeth went to window stout iron column carrying elevated rail upon start of machine be made rose up close by machine be hidden by upper edge of window through grove of iron pillar red painted ornate with row of bolt one have glimpse of pretty scenery towards train went gliding noiselessly across middle distance rattle drowned by hammering of workman overhead monson must imagine grinning face at window of carriage swore savagely under breath dabbed viciously at blowfly suddenly became noisy on window pane whats up said woodhouse staring in surprise at employer im about sick of woodhouse scratched cheek oh said after assimilating pause pushed drawing away from here foolsim trying to conquer new elementtrying to do thing will revolutionise life instead of taking intelligent interest grin make stupid joke call appliance ass said woodhouse letting eye fall again on drawing epithet curiously enough made monson wince im about sick of woodhouse anyhow said after pause woodhouse shrugged shoulder there nothing for patience suppose said monson sticking hand in pocket ive started ive made bed ive got to lie on cant go back ill see through spend penny have penny can borrow tell woodhouse im infernally sick of same if id paid tenth part of money towards political greaser expensesid have be baronet before monson paused woodhouse stared in front of with blank expression always employed to indicate sympathy tapped pencil case on table monson stared at for minute oh damn said monson suddenly abruptly rushed out of room woodhouse continued sympathetic rigour for perhaps minute then sighed resumed shading of drawing something have evidently upset monson nice chap generous difficult to get on with be way with amateur who have anything to do with engineeringwanted everything finished at once have usually patience of expert odd be so irritable nice round that aluminium rod did look now woodhouse threw back head put first side then to appreciate bit of shading better mr woodhouse said foreman of labourer putting head in at door hullo said woodhouse without turning round nothing happened sir said hooper happened said woodhouse governor just be up rail swearing like tornader oh said woodhouse aint like sir be thinking perhaps dont think said woodhouse still admiring drawing hooper knew woodhouse shut door suddenly with vicious slam woodhouse stared stonily before for further minute then made ineffectual effort to pick teeth with pencil abruptly desisted pitched that old tried stumpy servitor across room got up stretched followed hooper looked ruffledit be visible to workman met when millionaire who have be spending thousand on experiment employ little army of people suddenly indicates that be sick of undertaking there be almost invariably certain amount of mental friction in rank of little army employ even before indicates intention there be speculation murmur watching of face study of straw hundred of people knew before day be out that monson be ruffled woodhouse ruffled hooper ruffled workman wife for instance whom monson have never seen decided to keep money in saving bank instead of buying velveteen dress so far reaching be even casual curse of millionaire monson found certain satisfaction in going on work behaving disagreeably to a many people a possible after time even palled upon rode off ground to one relief there through lane south eastward to infinite tribulation of house steward at cheam immediate cause of little grain of annoyance have suddenly precipitated discontent with life work wasthese trivial thing direct great decisionshalf dozen ill considered remark made by pretty girl prettily dressed with beautiful voice something more than prettiness in soft grey eye of dozen remark two word especiallymonsons folly have felt be behaving charmingly to monson reflected next day how exceptionally effective have be one must have be more amazed than have learned effect have left on monsons mind hope considering everything that never knew how be getting on with flying machine asked wonder if will ever meet one with sense not to ask thought monson will be very dangerous at first will not think im afraid jorgon be going to play presently have heard before mania being attended to turn to rational conversation gush about jorgon gradual decline of conversation ending withyou must let know when flying machine be finished mr monson then will consider advisability of taking ticket one must think be still playing invention in nursery bitterest thing said be not meant for monsons ear to phlox novelist be always conscientiously brilliant have be talking to mr monson can think of nothing positively nothing that flying machine of do know workman call that place of monsons folly be quite impossible be really very very sad always regard in light of sunken treasurethe lost millionaire know be pretty well educatedindeed have written epigrammatic novelette bitterness be that be typical summarised what world thought of man who be working sanely steadily surely towards more tremendous revolution in appliance of civilisation more far reaching alteration in way of humanity than have ever be effected since history began did not even take seriously in little while must be proverbial must fly now said on way home smarting

four week after first swearing of stood with woodhouse by reconstructed machine a lay across elevated railway by mean of gained initial impetus new propeller glittered brighter white than rest of machine gilder obedient to whim of monsons be picking out aluminium bar with gold looking down long avenue between rope gilded now with sunset one saw red signal two mile away anthill of workman busy altering last fall of run into rising slope ill come said woodhouse ill come right enough tell infernally foolhardy if only must give year tell wont tell thing work ive given year enough not said woodhouse be right with machine steering havent be rushing night morning backwards forward through squirrel cage if thing steer true here will steer true across england just funk tell woodhouse must have gone year ago besides well said woodhouse money snapped monson over shoulder hang never thought of money said woodhouse then speaking now in very different tone to with have said word before repeated ill come trust monson turned suddenly saw that woodhouse have not dexterity to say shining on sunset lit face looked for moment then impulsively extended hand thanks said right said woodhouse gripping hand with queer softening of feature trust then men turned to big apparatus lay with flat wing extended upon carrier stared at meditatively monson guided perhaps by photographic study of flight of bird by lilienthals method have gradually drifted from maxim shape towards bird form again thing however be driven by huge screw behind in place of tail so hovering need almost vertical adjustment of flat tail be rendered impossible body of machine be small almost cylindrical pointed forward aft on pointed end be two small petroleum engine for screw navigator sat deep in canoe like recess foremost one steering being protected by low screen with two plate glass window from blinding rush of air on side monstrous flat framework with curved front border must be adjusted so a to lie horizontally to be tilted upward down wing worked rigidly together by releasing pin one must be tilted through small angle independently of fellow front edge of wing must also be shifted back so a to diminish wing area about one sixth machine be not only not designed to hover be also incapable of fluttering monsons idea be to get into air with initial rush of apparatus then to skim much a playingcard may be skimmed keeping up rush by mean of screw at stern rook gull fly enormous distance in way with scarcely perceptible movement of wing bird really drive along on arial switchback glide slanting downward for space until have gained considerable momentum then altering inclination of wing glide up again almost to original altitude even londoner who have watched bird in aviary in regent park know bird be practising art from moment leaf nest have not only perfect apparatus perfect instinct to use man off foot have poorest skill in balancing even simple trick of bicycle cost hour of labour instantaneous adjustment of wing quick response to passing breeze swift recovery of equilibrium giddy eddying movement require such absolute precisionall that must learn learn with infinite labour infinite danger if ever be to conquer flying flying machine will start off fine day driven by neat little lever with nice open deck like liner loaded up with bomb shell gun be easy dreaming of literary man in life in treasure cost of conquest of empire of air may even exceed have be spent in man great conquest of sea certainly will be costlier than greatest war have ever devastated world one knew thing better than two practical men knew be in front rank of coming army yet there be hope even in forlorn hope men be killed outright in reserve sometimes while others who have be left for dead in thickest corner crawl out survive if miss meadow said woodhouse presently in slow way dear chap said monson whose spirit have be rising fitfully during last few day mustnt miss meadow there quarter of square mile for to hit fence removed ditch levelled will come down rightrest assured if dont ah said woodhouse if dont before day of start newspaper people got wind of alteration at northward end of framework monson be cheered by decided change in comment romeike forwarded will be off day said paper will be off day said south western season ticket holder one to seaside excursionist saturday to monday tripper from sussex hampshire dorset devon eminent literary people from hazlemere remarked eagerly one to will be off day a familiar scaffolding came in sight actually one bright morning in full view of ten past ten train from basingstoke monsons flying machine started on journey saw carrier running swiftly along rail white gold screw spinning in air heard rapid rumble of wheel thud a carrier reached buffer at end of run then whirr a flying machine be shot forward into network that majority of have seen heard before thing went with drooping flight through framework rose again then beholder shouted screamed yelled shrieked after kind for instead of customary concussion stoppage flying machine flew out of five year cage like bolt from crossbow drove slantingly upward into air curved round little so a to cross line soared in direction of wimbledon common seemed to hang momentarily in air grow smaller then ducked vanished over clustering blue tree top to east of coombe hill one stopped staring gasping until long after have disappeared that be what people in train from basingstoke saw if have drawn line down middle of train from engine to guard van must not have found living soul on opposite side to flying machine be mad rush from window to window a thing crossed line engine driver stoker never took eye off low hill about wimbledon never noticed that have run clean through coombe malden raynes park until with returning animation found pelting at most indecent pace into wimbledon station from moment when monson have started carrier with now woodhouse said word men sat with clenched teeth monson have crossed line with curve be too sharp woodhouse have opened shut white lip spoke woodhouse simply gripped seat breathed sharply through teeth watching blue country to west rushing past down away from monson knelt at post forward hand trembled on spoked wheel moved wing must see nothing before mass of white cloud in sky machine went slanting upward travelling with enormous speed still losing momentum moment land ran away underneath with diminishing speed now said woodhouse at last with violent effort monson wrenched over wheel altered angle of wing machine seemed to hang for minute motionless in mid air then saw hazy blue house covered hill of kilburn hampstead jump up before eye rise steadily until little sunlit dome of albert hall appeared through window for moment scarcely understood meaning of upward rush of horizon a nearer nearer house came into view realised what have done have turned wing over too far be

quite brightly illuminated there be something very cheery reassuring in little streaming flame snuffing gave occupation afforded reassuring sense of passage of time even with however brooding expectation of vigil weighed heavily upon be after midnight that candle in alcove suddenly went out black shadow sprang back to place there did not see candle go out simply turned saw that darkness be there a one might start see unexpected presence of stranger by jove said aloud that draught strong one taking match from table walked across room in leisurely manner to relight corner again first match must not strike a succeeded with second something seemed to blink on wall before turned head involuntarily saw that two candle on little table by fireplace be extinguished rose at once to foot odd said did do in flash of absent mindedness walked back relit one a did so saw candle in right sconce of one of mirror wink go right out almost immediately companion followed there be mistake about

what have happened for space must not recollect rolled eye into corner saw old woman no longer abstracted pouring out drop of medicine from little blue phial into glass where be asked seem to remember yet can not remember who be told then heard of haunted red room a one who hears tale found at dawn said there be blood on forehead lip be very slowly recovered memory of experience believe now said old man that room be haunted spoke no longer a one who greets intruder a one who grief for broken friend yes said room be haunted have seen who have lived here life have never set eye upon because

hapliia hapley entomologist if so know at least of great feud between hapley professor pawkins though certain of consequence may be new to for who have not word two of explanation be necessary idle reader may go over with glancing eye if indolence so incline be amazing how very widely diffused be ignorance of such really important matter a hapley pawkins feud epoch making controversy again have convulsed geological society be verily believe almost entirely unknown outside fellowship of body have heard men of fair general education even refer to great scene at meeting a vestry meeting squabble yet great hate of english scotch geologist have lasted now century have left deep abundant mark upon body of science hapley pawkins business though perhaps more personal affair stirred passion a profound if not profounder common man have conception of zeal animates scientific investigator fury of contradiction can arouse in be odium theologicum in new form there be men for instance who must gladly burn professor ray lankester at smithfield for treatment of mollusca in encyclopdia fantastic extension of cephalopod to cover pterpodosbut wander from hapley pawkins began year year ago with revision of microlepidoptera whatever may be by pawkins in extinguished new specie created by hapley hapley who be always quarrelsome replied by stinging impeachment of entire classification of pawkins pawkins in rejoinder suggested that hapleys microscope be a defective a power of observation called irresponsible meddlerhapley be not professor at time hapley in retort spoke of blundering collector described a if inadvertently pawkinss revision a miracle of ineptitude be war to knife however must scarcely interest reader to detail how two great men quarrelled how split between widened until from microlepidoptera be at war upon open question in entomology there be memorable occasion at time royal entomological society meeting resembled nothing so much a chamber of deputy on whole fancy pawkins be nearer truth than hapley hapley be skilful with rhetoric have turn for ridicule rare in scientific man be endowed with vast energy have fine sense of injury in matter of extinguished specie while pawkins be man of dull presence prosy of speech in shape not unlike water barrel overconscientious with testimonial suspected of jobbing museum appointment so young men gathered round hapley applauded be long struggle vicious from beginning growing at last to pitiless antagonism successive turn of fortune now advantage to one side now to anothernow hapley tormented by success of pawkins now pawkins outshone by hapleybelong rather to history of entomology than to story footnote remark on recent revision of microlepidoptera quart journ entomological soc footnote rejoinder to certain remark c ibid footnote further remark c ibid in pawkins whose health have be bad for time published work upon mesoblast of death head what mesoblast of death head may be doe not matter rap in

incapacity to do few of who heard himi be absent from meetingrealised how ill man be hapley have got opponent down meant to finish followed with simply brutal attack upon pawkins in form of paper upon development of moth in general paper showing evidence of most extraordinary amount of mental labour yet couched in violently controversial tone violent a be editorial note witness that be modified must have covered pawkins with shame confusion of face left loophole be murderous in argument utterly contemptuous in tone awful thing for declining year of man career world of entomologist waited breathlessly for rejoinder from pawkins must try one for pawkins have always be game when came surprised for rejoinder of pawkins be to catch influenza to proceed to pneumonia to die be perhaps a effectual reply a must make under circumstance largely turned current of feeling against very people who have most gleefully cheered on gladiator became serious at consequence there must be reasonable doubt fret of defeat have contributed to death of pawkins there be limit even to scientific controversy said serious people crushing attack be already in press appeared on day before funeral dont think hapley exerted to stop people remembered how hapley have hounded down rival forgot that rival defect scathing satire read ill over fresh mould thing provoked comment in daily paper be that made think that have probably heard of hapley controversy a have already remarked scientific worker live very much in world of own people dare say who go along piccadilly to academy year must not tell where learned society abide many even think that research be kind of happy family cage in kind of men lie down together in peace in private thought hapley must not forgive pawkins for dying in first place be mean dodge to escape absolute pulverisation hapley have in hand for in second left hapleys mind with queer gap in for twenty year have worked hard sometimes far into night seven day week with microscope scalpel collecting net pen almost entirely with reference to pawkins european reputation have won have come a incident in great antipathy have gradually worked up to climax in last controversy have killed pawkins have also thrown hapley out of gear so to speak doctor advised to give up work for time rest so hapley went down into quiet village in kent thought day night of pawkins good thing be now impossible to say about at last hapley began to realise in what direction preoccupation tended determined to make fight for started by trying to read novel must not get mind off pawkins white in face making last speechevery sentence beautiful opening for hapley turned to fictionand found have grip on read island night entertainment until sense of causation be shocked beyond endurance by bottle imp then went to kipling found proved nothing besides being irreverent vulgar scientific people have limitation then unhappily tried besants inner house opening chapter set mind upon learned society pawkins at once so hapley turned to chess found little more soothing soon mastered move chief gambit commoner closing position began to beat vicar then cylindrical contour of opposite king began to resemble pawkins standing up gasping ineffectually against checkmate hapley decided to give up chess perhaps study of new branch of science must after be better diversion best rest be change of occupation hapley determined to plunge at diatom have one of smaller microscope halibut monograph sent down from london thought that perhaps if must get up vigorous quarrel with halibut might be able to begin life afresh forget pawkins very soon be hard at work in habitual strenuous fashion at microscopic denizen of wayside pool be on third day of diatom hapley became aware of novel addition to local fauna be working late at microscope only light in room be brilliant little lamp with special form of green shade like experienced microscopist kept eye open be only way to avoid excessive fatigue one eye be over instrument bright distinct before be circular field of microscope across brown diatom be slowly moving with other eye hapley saw a be without seeing be only dimly conscious of brass side of instrument illuminated part of table cloth sheet of notepaper foot of lamp darkened room beyond footnote reader unaccustomed to microscope may easily understand by rolling newspaper in form of tube looking through at book keeping other eye open suddenly attention drifted from one eye to other table cloth be of material called tapestry by shopmen rather brightly coloured pattern be in gold with small amount of crimson pale blue upon greyish ground at one point pattern seemed displaced there be vibrating movement of colour at point hapley suddenly moved head back looked with eye mouth fell open with astonishment be large moth butterfly wing spread in butterfly fashion be strange must be in room at for window be closed strange that must not have attracted attention when fluttering to present position strange that must match table cloth stranger far to hapley great entomologist be altogether unknown there be delusion be crawling slowly towards foot of lamp genus unknown by heaven in england said hapley staring then suddenly thought of pawkins nothing must have maddened pawkins moreand pawkins be dead something about head body of insect became singularly suggestive of pawkins just a chess king have be confound pawkins said hapley must catch looking round for mean of capturing moth rose slowly out of chair suddenly insect rose edge of lamp shadehapley heard pingand vanished into shadow in moment hapley have whipped off shade so that whole room be illuminated thing have disappeared soon practised eye detected upon wall paper near door went towards poising lamp shade for capture before be within striking distance however have risen be fluttering round room after fashion of kind flew with sudden start turn seeming to vanish here reappear there once hapley struck missed then again third time hit microscope instrument swayed struck overturned lamp fell noisily upon floor lamp turned over on table very luckily went out hapley be left in dark with start felt strange moth blunder into face be maddening have light if opened door of room thing must get away in darkness saw pawkins quite distinctly laughing at pawkins have ever oily laugh swore furiously stamped foot on floor there be timid rapping at door then opened perhaps foot very slowly alarmed face of landlady appeared behind pink candle flame wore night cap over grey hair have purple garment over shoulder what be fearful smash said have anything strange moth appeared fluttering about chink of door shut that door said hapley suddenly rushed at door slammed hastily hapley be left alone in dark then in pause heard landlady scuttle upstairs lock door drag something heavy across room put against became evident to hapley that conduct appearance have be strange alarming confound moth pawkins however be pity to lose moth now felt way into hall found match after sending hat down upon floor with noise like drum with lighted candle returned to sitting room moth be to be seen yet once for moment seemed that thing be fluttering round head hapley very suddenly decided to give up moth go to bed be excited night long sleep be broken by dream of moth pawkins landlady twice in night turned out soused head in cold water one thing be very clear to landlady must not possibly understand about strange moth especially a have failed to catch one entomologist must understand quite how felt be probably frightened at behaviour yet failed to see how must explain decided to say nothing further about event of last night after breakfast saw in garden decided to go out to talk to to reassure talked to about bean potato bee caterpillar price of fruit replied in usual manner looked at little suspiciously kept walking a walked so that there be always bed of flower row of bean something of sort between after while began to feel singularly irritated at to conceal vexation went indoors presently went out for walk mothor butterfly trailing odd flavour of pawkins with kept coming into walk though did best to keep mind off once saw quite distinctly with wing flattened out upon old stone wall run along west edge of park going up to found be only two lump of grey yellow lichen said hapley be reverse of mimicry instead of butterfly looking like stone here be stone looking like butterfly once something hovered fluttered round head by effort of will drove impression out of mind again in afternoon hapley called upon vicar argued with upon theological question sat in little arbour covered with briar smoked a wrangled look at moth said hapley suddenly pointing to edge of wooden table where said vicar dont see moth on edge of table there said hapley certainly not said vicar hapley be thunderstruck gasped vicar be staring at clearly man saw nothing eye of faith be better than eye of science said hapley awkwardly dont see point said vicar thinking be part of argument night hapley found moth crawling over counterpane sat on edge of bed in shirt sleeve reasoned with be pure hallucination knew be slipping battled for sanity with same silent energy have formerly displayed against pawkins so persistent be mental habit that felt a if be still struggle with pawkins be well versed in psychology knew that such visual illusion do come a result of mental strain point be did not only see moth have heard when touched edge of lamp shade afterwards when hit against wall have felt strike face in dark looked at be not at dreamlike perfectly clear solid looking in candlelight saw hairy body short feathery antenn jointed leg even place where down be rubbed from wing suddenly felt angry with for being afraid of little insect landlady have got servant to sleep with night because be afraid to be alone in addition have locked door put chest of drawer against listened talked in whisper after have gone to bed nothing occurred to alarm about eleven have ventured to put candle out have dozed off to sleep woke up with start sat up in bed listening in darkness then heard slippered foot going to fro in hapleys room chair be overturned there be violent dab at wall then china mantel ornament smashed upon fender suddenly door of room opened heard upon landing clung to one listening seemed to be dancing upon staircase now must go down three four step quickly then up again then hurry down into hall heard umbrella stand go over fanlight break then bolt shot chain rattled be opening door hurried to window be dim grey night almost unbroken sheet of watery cloud be sweeping across moon hedge tree in front of house be black against pale roadway saw hapley looking like ghost in shirt white trouser running to fro in road beating air now must stop now must dart very rapidly at something invisible now must move upon with stealthy stride at last went out of sight up road towards down then while argued who must go down lock door returned be walking very fast came straight into house closed door carefully went quietly up to bedroom then everything be silent mr colville said hapley calling down staircase next morning hope did not alarm last night may well ask said mr colville fact be be sleep walker last two night have be without sleeping mixture there be nothing to be alarmed about really be sorry made as of myself will go over down to shoreham get stuff to make sleep soundly ought to have done yesterday half way over down by chalk pit moth came upon hapley again went on trying to keep mind upon chess problem be good thing fluttered into face struck at with hat in self defence then rage old ragethe rage have so often felt against pawkinsreturned once more went on leaping striking at eddying insect suddenly trod on nothing fell headlong there be gap in sensation hapley found sitting on heap of flint in front of opening of chalk pit with leg twisted back under strange moth be still fluttering round head struck at with hand turning head saw two men approaching one be village doctor occurred to hapley that be lucky then came into mind with extraordinary vividness that one must ever be able to see strange moth except that behoved to keep silent about late that night however after broken leg be set be feverish forgot self restraint be lying flat on bed began to run eye round room to see if moth be still about tried not to do be no good soon caught sight of thing resting close to hand by night light on green table cloth wing quivered with sudden wave of anger smote at with fist nurse woke up with shriek have missed that moth said then be fancy nothing time must see quite clearly insect going round cornice darting across room must also see that nurse saw nothing of looked at strangely must keep in hand knew be lost man if did not keep in hand a night waned fever grew upon very dread have of seeing moth made see about five just a dawn be grey tried to get out of bed catch though leg be afire with pain nurse have to struggle with on account of tied down to bed at moth grew bolder once felt settle in hair then because struck out violently with arm tied also at moth came crawled over face hapley wept swore screamed prayed for to take off unavailingly doctor be blockhead half qualified general practitioner quite ignorant of mental science simply said there be moth have possessed wit might still perhaps have saved hapley from fate by entering into delusion covering face with gauze a prayed might be done a say doctor be blockhead until leg be healed hapley be kept tied to bed with imaginary moth crawling over never left while be awake grew to monster in dream while be awake longed for sleep from sleep awoke screaming so now hapley be spending remainder of day in padded room worried by moth that one else can see asylum doctor call hallucination hapley when be in easier mood can talk say be ghost of pawkins consequently unique specimen well worth trouble of catching in abyss lieutenant stood in front of steel sphere gnawed piece of pine splinter what do think of steevens asked idea said steevens in tone of one who keep open mind believe will smashflat said lieutenant seems to have calculated out pretty well said steevens still impartial think of pressure said lieutenant at surface of water fourteen pound to inch thirty foot down double that sixty treble ninety four time nine hundred forty time five thousand three hundredthats mileits two hundred forty time fourteen pound thatslets seethirty hundredweighta ton half steevens ton half to square inch ocean where he going be five mile deep thats seven half sound lot said steevens jolly thick steel lieutenant made answer resumed pine splinter object of conversation be huge globe of steel having exterior diameter of perhaps eight foot looked like shot for titanic piece of artillery be elaborately nested in monstrous scaffolding built into framework of vessel gigantic spar be presently to sling overboard gave stern of ship appearance have raised curiosity of decent sailor who have sighted from pool of london to tropic of capricorn in two place one above other steel gave place to couple of circular window of enormously thick glass one of set in steel frame of great solidity be now partially unscrewed men have seen interior of globe for first time that morning be elaborately padded with air cushion with little stud sunk between bulging pillow to work simple mechanism of affair everything be elaborately padded even myers apparatus be to absorb carbonic acid replace oxygen inspired by tenant when have crept in by glass manhole have be screwed in be so elaborately padded that man might have be fired from gun in with perfect safety have need to be for presently man be to crawl in through glass manhole to be screwed up tightly to be flung overboard to sink downdowndown for five mile even a lieutenant said have taken strongest hold of imagination made bore at mess found steevens new arrival aboard godsend to talk to about over over again opinion said lieutenant that glass will simply bend in bulge smash under pressure of sort daubre have made rock run like water under big pressuresand mark word if glass did break in said steevens what then water must shoot in like jet of iron have ever felt straight jet of high pressure water must hit a hard a bullet must simply smash flatten must tear down throat into lung must blow in ear what detailed imagination have protested steevens who saw thing vividly simple statement of inevitable said lieutenant globe must just give out few little bubble must settle down comfortably against day of judgment among ooze bottom claywith poor elstead spread over own smashed cushion like butter over bread repeated sentence a though liked very much like butter over bread said having look at jigger said voice behind elstead stood behind spick span in white with cigarette between teeth eye smiling out of shadow of ample hat brim whats that about bread butter weybridge grumbling a usual about insufficient pay of naval officer wont be more than day now before start be to get sling ready to day clean sky gentle swell be just kind of thing for swinging off twenty ton of lead iron isnt wont affect much said weybridge seventy eighty foot down will be there in dozen second there not particle moving though wind shriek hoarse up above water lift halfway to cloud down there moved to side of ship other two followed three leant forward on elbow stared down into yellow green water peace said elstead finishing thought aloud be dead certain that clockwork will act asked weybridge presently have worked thirty five time said elstead bound to work if doesnt why shouldnt go down in confounded thing said weybridge for twenty thousand pound cheerful chap be said elstead spat sociably at bubble below dont understand yet how mean to work thing said steevens in first place im screwed into sphere said elstead when ive turned electric light off on three time to show im cheerful im swung out over stern by crane with big lead sinker slung below top lead weight have roller carrying hundred fathom of strong cord rolled up thats join sinker to sphere except sling will be cut when affair be dropped use cord rather than wire rope because easier to cut more buoyantnecessary point a will see through of lead weight notice there be hole iron rod will be run through will project six foot on lower side if rod be rammed up from below knock up lever set clockwork in motion at side of cylinder on cord wind very well whole affair be lowered gently into water sling be cut sphere floatswith air in lighter than water lead weight go down straight cord run out when cord be paid out sphere will go down too pulled down by cord why cord asked steevens why not fasten weight directly to sphere because of smash down below whole affair will go rushing down mile after mile at headlong pace at last must be knocked to piece on bottom if wasnt for cord weight will hit bottom directly do buoyancy of sphere will come into play will go on sinking slower slower come to stop at last then begin to float upward again thats where clockwork come in directly weight smash against sea bottom rod will be knocked through will kick up clockwork cord will be rewound on reel will be lugged down to sea bottom there will stay for hour with electric light on looking about then clockwork will release spring knife cord will be cut up will rush again like soda water bubble cord will help flotation if must chance to hit ship said weybridge must come up at pace must go clean through said elstead like cannon ball neednt worry about suppose nimble crustacean must wriggle into clockwork must be pressing sort of invitation for to stop said elstead turning back on water staring at sphere have swung elstead overboard by eleven oclock day be serenely bright calm with horizon lost in haze electric glare in little upper compartment beamed cheerfully three time then let down slowly to surface of water sailor in stern chain hung ready to cut tackle held lead weight sphere together globe have looked so large on deck looked smallest thing conceivable under stern of ship rolled little two dark window floated uppermost seemed like eye turned up in round wonderment at people who crowded rail voice wondered how elstead liked rolling be ready sang out commander aye aye sir then let go rope of tackle tightened against blade be cut eddy rolled over globe in grotesquely helpless fashion one waved handkerchief one else tried ineffectual cheer middy be counting slowly eight nine ten roll then with jerk splash thing righted seemed to be stationary for moment to grow rapidly smaller then water closed over became visible enlarged by refraction dimmer below surface before one must count three have disappeared there be flicker of white light far down in water diminished to speck vanished then there be nothing depth of water going down into blackness through shark be swimming then suddenly screw of cruiser began to rotate water be crickled shark disappeared in wrinkled confusion torrent of foam rushed across crystalline clearness have swallowed up elstead whats idee said one b to be going to lay off about couple of mile fear must hit when come up said mate ship steamed slowly to new position aboard almost one who be unoccupied remained watching breathing swell into sphere have sunk for next half hour be doubtful if word be spoken that did not bear directly indirectly on elstead december sun be now high in sky heat very considerable hell be cold enough down there said weybridge say that below certain depth sea water always just about freezing wherell come up asked steevens ive lost bearing thats spot said commander who prided on omniscience extended precise finger south eastward reckon be pretty nearly moment said he be thirty five minute how long doe take to reach bottom of ocean asked steevens for depth of five mile reckoningas didan acceleration to two foot per second way be just about three quarter of minute then he overdue said weybridge pretty nearly said commander suppose take few minute for cord of to wind in forgot said weybridge evidently relieved then began suspense minute slowly dragged out sphere shot out of water followed nothing broke low oily swell sailor explained to one little point about winding in of cord rigging be dotted with expectant face come up elstead called one hairy chested salt impatiently others caught up shouted a though be waiting for curtain of theatre to rise commander glanced irritably at of course if acceleration le than two said hell be longer arent absolutely certain be proper figure im slavish believer in calculation steevens agreed concisely one on quarter deck spoke for couple of minute then steevenss watch case clicked when twenty one minute after sun reached zenith be still waiting for globe to reappear not man aboard have dared to whisper that hope be dead be weybridge who first gave expression to realisation spoke while sound of eight bell still hung in air always distrusted that window said quite suddenly to steevens good god said steevens dont think well said weybridge left rest to imagination im great believer in calculation said commander dubiously so im not altogether hopeless yet at midnight gunboat be steaming slowly in spiral round spot where globe have sunk white beam of electric light fled halted swept discontentedly onward again over waste of phosphorescent water under little star if window hasnt burst smashed said weybridge then cursed sight worse for clockwork have gone wrong he alive now five mile under foot down there in cold dark anchored in little bubble of where never ray of light have shone human being lived since water be gathered together he there without food feeling hungry thirsty scared wondering whether hell starve stifle will be myers apparatus be running out suppose how long do last good heaven exclaimed what little thing be what daring little devil down there mile mile of waterall water empty water about sky gulf threw hand out a did so little white streak swept noiselessly up sky travelling more slowly stopped became motionless dot a though new star have fallen up into sky then went sliding back again lost amidst reflection of star white haze of sea phosphorescence at sight stopped arm extended mouth open shut mouth opened again waved arm with impatient gesture then turned shouted elstead ahoy to first watch went at run to lindley search light saw said starboard there light on he just shot out of water bring light round ought to see drifting when lift on swell never picked up explorer until dawn then almost ran down crane be swung out boat crew hooked chain to sphere when have shipped sphere unscrewed manhole peered into darkness of interior for electric light chamber be intended to illuminate water about sphere be shut off entirely from general cavity air be very hot within cavity india rubber at lip of manhole be soft there be answer to eager question sound of movement within elstead seemed to be lying motionless crumpled up in bottom of globe ship doctor crawled in lifted out to men outside for moment so did not know whether elstead be alive dead face in yellow glow of ship lamp glistened with perspiration carried down to own cabin be not dead found in state of absolute nervous collapse besides cruelly bruised for day have to lie perfectly still be week before must tell experience almost first word be that be going down again sphere must have to be altered said in order to allow to throw off cord if need be be have have most marvellous experience thought must find nothing ooze said laughed at exploration ive discovered new world told story in disconnected fragment chiefly from wrong end so that be impossible to re tell in word what follows be narrative of experience began atrociously said before cord ran out thing kept rolling over felt like frog in football must see nothing crane sky overhead with occasional glimpse of people on ship rail couldnt tell bit way thing must roll next suddenly must find foot going up try to step over went rolling head over heel just anyhow on padding other shape must have be more comfortable other shape be to be relied upon under huge pressure of nethermost abyss suddenly swaying ceased globe righted when have picked up saw water about greeny blue with attenuated light filtering down from above shoal of little floating thing went rushing up past a seemed to towards light even a looked grew darker darker until water above be a dark a midnight sky albeit of greener shade water below black little transparent thing in water developed faint glint of luminosity shot past in faint greenish streak feeling of falling be just like start of lift said only kept on one have to imagine what mean that keeping on be then of time elstead repented of adventure saw chance against in altogether new light thought of big cuttle fish people knew to exist in middle water kind of thing find half digested in whale at time floating dead rotten half eaten by fish suppose one caught hold wouldnt leave go have clockwork really be sufficiently tested whether wanted to go on go back mattered not slightest now in fifty second everything be a black a night outside except where beam from light struck through water picked out now then fish scrap of sinking matter flashed by too fast for to see what be once thought passed shark then sphere began to get hot by friction against water have underestimated seems first thing noticed be that be perspiring then heard hissing growing louder under foot saw lot of little bubblesvery little bubble wererushing upward like fan through water outside steam felt window be hot turned on minute glow lamp lit own cavity looked at padded watch by stud saw have be travelling now for two minute came into head that window must crack through conflict of temperature for knew bottom water be very near freezing then suddenly floor of sphere seemed to press against foot rush of bubble outside grew slower slower hissing diminished sphere rolled little window have not cracked nothing have given knew that danger of sinking at rate be over in minute so must be on floor of abyss thought said of steevens weybridge rest of five mile overhead higher to than very highest cloud that ever floated over land be to steaming slowly staring down wondering what have happened to peered out of window there be more bubble now hissing have stopped outside there be heavy blacknessas black a black velvetexcept where electric light pierced empty water showed colour of ita yellow green then three thing like shape of fire swam into sight following other through water whether be little near big far off must not tell be outlined in bluish light almost a bright a light of fishing smack light seemed to be smoking greatly along side of be speck of like lighted porthole of ship phosphorescence seemed to go out a came into radiance of lamp saw then that be indeed fish of strange sort with huge head vast eye dwindling body tail eye be turned towards judged be following down supposed be attracted by glare presently others of same sort joined a went on down noticed that water became of pallid colour little speck twinkled in ray like mote in sunbeam be probably due to cloud of ooze mud that impact of leaden sinker have disturbed by time be drawn down to lead weight be in dense fog of white that electric light failed altogether to pierce for more than few yard many minute elapsed before hanging sheet of sediment subsided to extent then lit by light by transient phosphorescence of distant shoal of fish be able to see under huge blackness of super incumbent water undulating expanse of greyish white ooze broken here there by tangled thicket of growth of sea lily waving hungry tentacle in air farther away be graceful translucent outline of group of gigantic sponge about floor there be scattered number of bristling flattish tuft of rich purple black decided must be sort of sea urchin small large eyed blind thing having curious resemblance to woodlouse others to lobster crawled sluggishly across track of light vanished into obscurity again leaving furrowed trail behind then suddenly hovering swarm of little fish veered about came towards a flight of starling might do passed over like phosphorescent snow then saw behind larger creature advancing towards sphere at first must see only dimly faintly moving figure remotely suggestive of walking man then came into spray of light that lamp shot out a glare struck shut eye dazzled stared in rigid astonishment be strange vertebrated animal dark purple head be dimly suggestive of chameleon have high forehead brain case a reptile ever displayed before vertical pitch of face gave most extraordinary resemblance to human being two large protruding eye projected from socket in chameleon fashion have broad reptilian mouth with horny lip beneath little nostril in position of ear be two huge gill cover out of floated branching tree of coralline filament almost like tree like gill very young ray shark posse humanity of face be not most extraordinary thing about creature be biped almost globular body be poised on tripod of two frog like leg long thick tail fore limb grotesquely caricatured human hand much a frog do carried long shaft of bone tipped with copper colour of creature be variegated head hand leg be purple skin hung loosely upon even a clothes might do be phosphorescent grey stood there blinded by light at last unknown creature of abyss blinked eye open shading with disengaged hand opened mouth gave vent to shouting noise articulate almost a speech might be that penetrated even steel case padded jacket of sphere how shouting may be accomplished without lung elstead doe not profess to explain then moved sideways out of glare into mystery of shadow bordered on side elstead felt rather than saw that be coming towards fancying light have attracted turned switch cut off current in moment something soft dabbed upon steel globe swayed then shouting be repeated seemed to that distant echo answered dabbing recurred globe swayed ground against spindle over wire be rolled stood in blackness peered out into everlasting night of abyss presently saw very faint remote other phosphorescent quasi human form hurrying towards hardly knowing what did felt about in swaying prison for stud of exterior electric light came by accident against own small glow lamp in padded recess sphere twisted then threw down heard shout like shout of surprise when rose to foot saw two pair of stalked eye peering into lower window reflecting light in moment hand be dabbing vigorously at steel casing there be sound horrible enough in position of metal protection of clockwork being vigorously hammered that indeed sent heart into mouth for if strange creature succeeded in stopping that release must never occur scarcely have thought a much when felt sphere sway violently floor of press hard against foot turned off small glow lamp lit interior sent ray of large light in separate compartment out into water sea floor manlike creature have disappeared couple of fish chasing other dropped suddenly by window thought at once that strange denizen of deep sea have broken wire rope that have escaped drove up faster faster then stopped with jerk sent flying against padded roof of prison for minute perhaps be too astonished to think then felt that sphere be spinning slowly rocking seemed to that be also being drawn through water by crouching close to window managed to make weight effective roll that part of sphere downward must see nothing save pale ray of light striking down ineffectively into darkness occurred to that must see more if turned lamp off allowed eye to grow accustomed to profound obscurity in be wise after minute velvety blackness became translucent blackness then far away a faint a zodiacal light of english summer evening saw shape moving below judged creature have detached cable be towing along sea bottom then saw something faint remote across undulation of submarine plain broad horizon of pale luminosity extended way way a far a range of little window permitted to see to be being towed a balloon might be towed by men out of open country into town approached very slowly very slowly dim irradiation be gathered together into more definite shape be nearly five oclock before came over luminous area by time must make out arrangement suggestive of street house grouped about vast roofless erection be grotesquely suggestive of ruined abbey be spread out like map below house be roofless inclosure of wall substance being a afterwards saw of phosphorescent bone gave place appearance a if be built of drowned moonshine among inner cave of place waving tree of crinoid stretched tentacle tall slender glassy sponge shot like shining minaret lily of filmy light out of general glow of city in open space of place must see stirring movement a of crowd of people be too many fathom above to distinguish individual in crowd then slowly pulled down a did so detail of place crept slowly upon apprehension saw that course of cloudy building be marked out with beaded line of round object then perceived that at several point below in broad open space be form like encrusted shape of ship slowly surely be drawn down form below became brighter clearer be more distinct be being pulled down perceived towards large building in centre of town must catch glimpse ever again of multitudinous form be lugging at cord be astonished to see that rigging of one of ship formed prominent feature of place be crowded with host of gesticulating figure regarding then wall of great building rose about silently hid city from eye such wall be of water logged wood twisted wire rope iron spar copper bone skull of dead men skull ran in curious zigzag line spiral fantastic curve over building in out of eye socket over whole surface of place lurked played multitude of silvery little fish now be at such level that must see strange people of abyss plainly once more to astonishment perceived that be prostrating before save one dressed a seemed in robe of placoid scale crowned with luminous diadem who stood with reptilian mouth opening shutting a though led chanting of worshipper continued worshipping without rest intermission for space of three hour most circumstantial be elsteads account of astounding city people people of perpetual night who have never seen sun moon star green vegetation living air breathing creature who know nothing of fire light phosphorescent light of living thing startling a be story be yet more startling to find that scientific men of such eminence a adam jenkins find nothing incredible in tell see reason why intelligent water breathing vertebrated creature inured to low temperature enormous pressure of such heavy structure that alive dead must float might not live upon bottom of deep sea quite unsuspected by descendant like ourselves of great theriomorpha of new red sandstone age must be known to however a strange meteoric creature wont to fall catastrophically dead out of mysterious blackness of watery sky not only ourselves ship metal appliance must come raining down out of night sometimes sinking thing must smite down crush a if be judgment of unseen power above sometimes must come thing of utmost rarity utility shape of inspiring suggestion one can understand perhaps something of behaviour at descent of living man if one think what barbaric people might do to whom enhaloed shining creature came suddenly out of sky at one time elstead probably told officer of ptarmigan detail of strange twelve hour in abyss that also intended to write down be certain never did so unhappily have to piece together discrepant fragment of story from reminiscence of commander simmons weybridge steevens lindley others see thing darkly in fragmentary glimpsesthe huge ghostly building bowing chanting people with dark chameleon like head faintly luminous form elstead with light turned on again vainly trying to convey to mind that cord by sphere be held be to be severed minute after minute slipped away elstead looking at watch be horrified to find that have oxygen only for four hour more chant in honour kept on a remorselessly a if be marching song of approaching death manner of release doe not understand to judge by end of cord that hung from sphere have be cut through by rubbing against edge of altar abruptly sphere rolled over swept up out of world a ethereal creature clothed in vacuum must sweep through own atmosphere back to native ether again must have torn out of sight a hydrogen bubble hastens upwards from air strange ascension must have seemed to sphere rushed up with even greater velocity than when weighed with lead sinker have rushed down became exceedingly hot drove up with window uppermost remembers torrent of bubble frothing against glass moment expected to fly then suddenly something like huge wheel seemed to be released in head padded compartment began spinning about fainted next recollection be of cabin of doctor voice be substance of extraordinary story that elstead related in fragment to officer of ptarmigan promised to write down at later date mind be chiefly occupied with improvement of apparatus be effected at rio remains only to tell on february d made second descent into ocean abyss with improvement first experience suggested what happened will probably never know never returned ptarmigan beat about over point of submersion seeking in vain for thirteen day then returned to rio news be telegraphed to friend so matter remains for present be hardly probable that further attempt will be made to verify strange story of hitherto unsuspected city of deep sea under knife what if die under thought recurred again again a walked home from haddons be purely personal question be spared deep anxiety of married man knew there be few of intimate friend must find death troublesome chiefly on account of duty of regret be surprised indeed perhaps little humiliated a turned matter over to think how few must possibly exceed conventional requirement thing came before stripped of glamour in clear dry light during walk from haddons house over primrose hill there be friend of youth perceived now that affection be tradition foregathered rather laboriously to maintain there be rival helper of later career suppose have be cold blooded undemonstrativeone perhaps implies other may be that even capacity for friendship be question of physique there have be time in own life when have grieved bitterly enough at loss of friend a walked home afternoon emotional side of imagination be dormant must not pity feel sorry for friend conceive of a grieving for be interested in deadness of emotional natureno doubt concomitant of stagnating physiology thought wandered off along line suggested once before in hot youth have suffered sudden loss of blood have be within ace of death remembered now that affection a well a passion have drained out of leaving scarce anything tranquil resignation faintest dreg of self pity have be week before old ambition tenderness complex moral interplay of man have reasserted occurred to that real meaning of numbness might be gradual slipping away from pleasure pain guidance of animal man have be proven take a thoroughly a anything can be proven in world that higher emotion moral feeling even subtle tenderness of love be evolved from elemental desire fear of simple animal be harness in man mental freedom go may be that a death overshadows a possibility of acting diminishes complex growth of balanced impulse propensity aversion whose interplay inspires act go with leaving what be suddenly brought back to reality by imminent collision with butcher boy tray found that be crossing bridge over regent park canal run parallel with bridge in zological garden boy in blue have be looking over shoulder at black barge advancing slowly towed by gaunt white horse in garden nurse be leading three happy little child over bridge tree be bright green spring hopefulness be still unstained by dust of summer sky in water be bright clear broken by long wave by quivering band of black a barge drove through breeze be stirring did not stir a spring breeze used to do be dulness of feeling in anticipation be curious that must reason follow out network of suggestion a clearly a ever so at least seemed to be calmness rather than dulness be coming upon be there ground for belief in presentiment of death did man near to death begin instinctively to withdraw from mesh of matter sense even before cold hand be laid upon felt strangely isolatedisolated without regretfrom life existence about child playing in sun gathering strength experience for business of life park keeper gossiping with nurse maid nursing mother young couple intent upon other a passed tree by wayside spreading new pleading leaf to sunlight stir in branchesi have be part of have nearly done with now way down broad walk perceived be tired that foot be heavy be hot that afternoon turned aside sat down on one of green chair line way in minute have dozed into dream tide of thought washed up vision of resurrection be still sitting in chair thought actually dead withered tattered dried one eye saw pecked out by bird awake cried voice incontinently dust of path mould under grass became insurgent have never before thought of regent park a cemetery now through tree stretching a far a eye must see beheld flat plain of writhing graf heeling tombstone there seemed to be trouble rising dead appeared to stifle a struggled upward bled in struggle red flesh be tattered away from white bone awake cried voice determined must not rise to such horror awake must not let alone wike up said angry voice cockney angel man who sell ticket be shaking demanding penny paid penny pocketed ticket yawned stretched leg feeling now rather le torpid got up walked on towards langham place speedily lost again in shifting maze of thought about death going across marylebone road into crescent at end of langham place have narrowest escape from shaft of cab went on way with palpitating heart bruised shoulder struck that must have be curious if meditation on death on morrow have led to death that day will not weary with more of experience day next knew more more certainly that must die under operation at time think be inclined to pose to myself doctor be coming at eleven did not get up seemed scarce worth while to trouble about washing dressing though read newspaper letter came by first post did not find very interesting there be friendly note from addison old school friend calling attention to two discrepancy printer error in new book with one from langridge venting vexation over rest be business communication breakfasted in bed glow of pain at side seemed more massive knew be pain yet if can understand did not find very painful have be awake hot thirsty in night in morning bed felt comfortable in night time have lain thinking of thing be past in morning dozed over question of immortality haddon came punctual to minute with neat black bag mowbray soon followed arrival stirred up little began to take more personal interest in proceeding haddon moved little octagonal table close to bedside with broad black back to began taking thing out of bag heard light click of steel upon steel imagination found be not altogether stagnant will hurt much said in off hand tone not bit haddon answered over shoulder will chloroform heart a sound a bell a spoke have whiff of pungent sweetness of ansthetic stretched out with convenient exposure of side almost before realised what be happening chloroform be being administered sting nostril there be suffocating sensation at first knew must diethat be end of consciousness for suddenly felt be not prepared for death have vague sense of duty overlookedi knew not what what be have not done must think of nothing more to hing desirable left in life yet have strangest disinclination to death physical sensation be painfully oppressive of course doctor did not know be going to kill possibly struggled then fell motionless great silence monstrous silence impenetrable blackness came upon there must have be interval of absolute unconsciousness second minute then with chilly unemotional clearness perceived be not yet dead be still in body multitudinous sensation that come sweeping from to make up background of consciousness have gone leaving free of not free of for a yet something still held to poor stark flesh upon bed held yet not so closely that did not feel external to independent of straining away from think saw think heard perceived be going on be a if heard saw haddon be bending over mowbray behind scalpelit be large scalpelwas cutting flesh at side under flying rib be interesting to see cut like cheese without pang without even qualm interest be much of quality with one might feel in game of chess between stranger haddons face be firm hand steady be surprised to perceive how know now that be feeling gravest doubt a to own wisdom in conduct of operation mowbrays thought too must see be thinking that haddons manner showed too much of specialist new suggestion came up like bubble through stream of frothing meditation burst one after in little bright spot of consciousness must not help noticing admiring haddons swift dexterity in spite of envious quality disposition to detract saw liver exposed be puzzled at own condition did not feel be dead be different in way from living grey depression have weighed on for year more coloured thought be gone perceived thought without emotional tint at wondered if one perceived thing in way under chloroform forgot again when came out of must be inconvenient to look into head not forget although did not think be dead still perceived quite clearly be soon to die brought back to consideration of haddons proceeding looked into mind saw that be afraid of cutting branch of portal vein attention be distracted from detail by curious change going on in mind consciousness be like quivering little spot of light be thrown by mirror of galvanometer thought ran under like stream through focus bright distinct shadowy in half light of edge just now little glow be steady least movement on mowbrays part slightest sound from outside even faint difference in slow movement of living flesh be cutting set light spot shivering spinning new sense impression came rushing up through flow of thought lo light spot jerked away towards swifter than frightened fish be wonderful to think that upon unstable fitful thing depended complex motion of man for next five minute therefore life hung upon movement be growing more more nervous in work be a if little picture of cut vein grew brighter struggled to oust from brain picture of cut falling short of mark be afraid dread of cutting too little be battling with dread of cutting too far then suddenly like escape of water from under lock gate great uprush of horrible realisation set thought swirling simultaneously perceived that vein be cut started back with hoarse exclamation saw brown purple blood gather in swift bead run trickling be horrified pitched red stained scalpel on to octagonal table instantly doctor flung upon making hasty ill conceived effort to remedy disaster ice said mowbray gasping knew be killed though body still clung to will not describe belated endeavour to save though perceived detail perception be sharper swifter than have ever be in life thought rushed through mind with incredible swiftness with perfect definition can only compare crowded clarity to effect of reasonable dose of opium in moment must all be over must be free knew be immortal what must happen did not know must drift off presently like puff of smoke from gun in kind of half material body attenuated version of material self must find suddenly among innumerable host of dead know world about for phantasmagoria have always seemed must drift to spiritualistic sance there make foolish incomprehensible attempt to affect purblind medium be state of unemotional curiosity of colourless expectation then realised growing stress upon feeling a though huge human magnet be drawing upward out of body stress grew grew seemed atom for monstrous force be fighting for one brief terrible moment sensation came back to that feeling of falling headlong come in nightmare that feeling thousand time intensified that black horror swept across thought in torrent then two doctor naked body with cut side little room swept away from under vanished a speck of foam vanishes down eddy be in mid air far below be west end of london receding rapidlyfor seemed to be flying swiftly upwardand a receded passing westward like panorama must see through faint haze of smoke innumerable roof chimney set narrow roadway stippled with people conveyance little speck of square church steeple like thorn sticking out of fabric spun away a earth rotated on axis in few second a seemed be over scattered clump of town about ealing little thames thread of blue to south chiltern hill north down coming up like rim of basin far away faint with haze up rushed at first have not faintest conception what headlong upward rush must mean moment circle of scenery beneath grew wider wider detail of town field of hill valley got more more hazy pale indistinct luminous grey be mingled more more with blue of hill green of open meadow little patch of cloud low far to west shone ever more dazzlingly white above a veil of atmosphere between outer space grew thinner sky have be fair springtime blue at first grew deeper richer in colour passing steadily through intervening shade until presently be a dark a blue sky of midnight presently a black a blackness of frosty starlight at last a black a blackness have ever beheld first one star then many at last innumerable host broke out upon sky more star than one have ever seen from face of earth for blueness of sky be light of sun star sifted spread abroad blindingly there be diffused light even in darkest sky of winter see light by day because of dazzling irradiation of sun now saw thingsi

earthly life when attention came back to earth again saw that have fallen very far away from field town be long since indistinguishable varied hue of country be merging into uniform bright grey broken only by brilliant white of cloud lay scattered in flocculent mass over ireland west of england for now must see outline of north of france ireland island of britain save where scotland passed over horizon to north where coast be blurred obliterated by cloud sea be dull grey darker than land whole panorama be rotating slowly towards east have happened so swiftly that until be thousand mile so from earth have thought for now perceived have hand foot part organ felt alarm pain about perceived that vacancy for have already left air behind be cold beyond imagination of man troubled not sun ray shot through void powerless to light heat until must strike on matter in course saw thing with serene self forgetfulness even a if be god down below there rushing away from mecountless mile in secondwhere little dark spot on grey marked position of london two doctor be struggling to restore life to poor hacked outworn shell have abandoned felt then such release such serenity a can compare to earthly delight have ever known be only after have perceived thing that meaning of headlong rush of earth grew into comprehension yet be so simple so obvious that be amazed at never anticipating thing be happening to have suddenly be cut adrift from matter be material of be there upon earth whirling away through space held to earth by gravitation partaking of earth inertia moving in wreath of epicycle round sun with sun planet on vast march through space immaterial have inertia feel nothing of pull of matter for matter where part from garment of flesh there remains so far a space concern

innumerable multitude of soul stripped like myself of material stripped like myself of passion of individual generous emotion of gregarious brute naked intelligence thing of newborn wonder thought marvelling at strange release have suddenly come on a receded faster faster from strange white sun in black heaven from broad shining earth upon being have begun seemed to grow in incredible manner vast vast a regard world have left vast a regard moment period of human life very soon saw full circle of earth slightly gibbous like moon when nears full very great silvery shape of america be now in noonday blaze wherein a seemed little england have be basking few minute ago at first earth be large shone in heaven filling great part of moment grew smaller more distant a shrunk broad moon in third quarter crept into view over rim of disc looked for constellation only that part of aries directly behind sun lion earth covered be hidden recognised tortuous tattered band of milky way with vega very bright between sun earth sirius orion shone splendid against unfathomable blackness in opposite quarter of heaven polestar be overhead great bear hung over circle of earth away beneath beyond shining

steadily did not scintillate be calmly glorious impression have adamantine hardness brightness there be blurring softness atmosphere nothing infinite darkness set with myriad of acute brilliant point speck of light presently when looked again little earth seemed bigger than sun dwindled turned a looked until in second space a seemed to be halved so went on swiftly dwindling far away in opposite direction little pinkish pin head of light shining steadily be planet mar swam motionless in vacancy without trace of terror astonishment watched speck of cosmic dust call world fall away from presently dawned upon that sense of duration have changed that mind be moving not faster infinitely slower that between separate impression there be period of many day moon spun once round earth a noted perceived clearly motion of mar in orbit moreover appeared a if time between thought thought grew steadily greater until at last thousand year be moment in perception at first constellation have shone motionless against black background of infinite space presently seemed a though group of star about hercules scorpion be contracting while orion aldebaran neighbour be scattering apart flashing suddenly out of darkness there came flying multitude of particle of rock glittering like dust speck in sunbeam encompassed in faintly luminous haze swirled about vanished again in twinkling far behind then saw that bright spot of light shone little to one side of path be growing very rapidly larger perceived that be planet saturn rushing towards larger larger grew swallowing up heaven behind hiding moment fresh multitude of star perceived flattened whirling body disc like belt seven of little satellite grew grew till towered enormous then plunged amid streaming multitude of clashing stone dancing dust particle gas eddy saw for moment mighty triple belt like three concentric arch of moonlight above shadow black on boiling tumult below thing happened in one tenth of time take to tell of planet went by like flash of lightning for few second blotted out sun there then became mere black dwindling winged patch against light earth mother mote of being must no longer see so with stately swiftness in profoundest silence solar system fell from a have be garment until sun be mere star amid multitude of star with eddy of planet speck lost in confused glittering of remoter light be no longer denizen of solar system have come to outer universe seemed to grasp comprehend whole world of matter ever more swiftly star closed in about spot where antares vega have vanished in luminous haze until part of sky have semblance of whirling mass of nebul ever before yawned vaster gap of vacant blackness star shone fewer fewer seemed a if moved towards point between orion belt sword void

brighter brighter with circling planet catching light in ghostly fashion a neared shone out vanished again into inexistence faint comet cluster of meteorite winking speck of matter eddying light point whizzed past perhaps hundred million of mile so from at most few nearer travelling with unimaginable rapidity shooting constellation momentary dart of fire through black night more than anything else be like dusty draught sunbeam lit broader wider deeper grew starless space vacant beyond into be being drawn at last quarter of heaven be black blank whole headlong rush of stellar universe closed in

dwindling now to whirling disc of luminous glittering now to one minute disc of hazy light in little while must shrink to point at last must vanish altogether suddenly feeling came back to feeling in shape of overwhelming dread of dark vastitudes a word can describe passionate resurgence of sympathy social desire be there other soul invisible to a to about in blackness be indeed even a felt alone have passed out of being into something be being not being covering of body covering of matter have be torn from hallucination of companionship security everything be black silent have ceased to be be nothing there be nothing save only that infinitesimal dot of light dwindled in gulf strained to hear see for while there be naught infinite silence intolerable darkness horror despair then saw that about spot of light into whole world of matter have shrunk there be faint glow in band on side of that darkness be not absolute watched for age a seemed to through long waiting haze grew imperceptibly

understanding nothing of import be whole universe refracting speck upon greater being be world atom of universe again of so on through endless progression what be be indeed immaterial vague persuasion of body gathering about came into suspense abysmal darkness about hand filled with impalpable suggestion with uncertain fluctuating shape then suddenly came sound like sound of tolling bell faint a if infinitely far muffled a though heard through thick swathing of darknessa deep vibrating resonance with vast gulf of silence between stroke hand appeared to tighten on rod saw far above hand towards apex of darkness circle of dim phosphorescence ghostly sphere whence sound came throbbing at last stroke hand vanished for hour have come heard noise of many water black rod remained a great band across sky then voice seemed to run to uttermost part of space spoke saying there will be no more pain at almost intolerable gladness radiance rushed in upon saw circle shining white bright rod black

hill for wedderburn to come there day after day with cuff unfrayed neatly tailored precisely barbered quietly perfect be in ill bred sneering sort of proceeding moreover be stealthy thing for wedderburn to behave insignificantly for space to mock modesty to lead hill to fancy that be beyond dispute man of year then suddenly to dart in front of incontinently to swell up in fashion in addition to thing wedderburn displayed increasing disposition to join in conversational grouping included miss haysman must venture indeed seek occasion to pas opinion derogatory to socialism atheism

with flushed cheek tattered temper debating society noticed new quality of sarcastic bitterness in speech will understand now how be necessary if only in interest of humanity hill must demolish wedderburn in forthcoming examination outshine in eye of miss haysman will perceive too how miss haysman fell into common feminine misconception hill wedderburn quarrel for in unostentatious way wedderburn reciprocated hill ill veiled rivalry became tribute to indefinable charm be queen of beauty in tournament of scalpel stumpy pencil to confidential friend secret annoyance even troubled

reason for decreeing that slip must not be moved depended on fact that object wanted identified be characteristic of certain tree stem in position in be placed be difficult thing to recognise once slip be moved so a to bring other part of preparation into view nature be obvious enough hill came to flushed from contest with staining reagent sat down on little stool before microscope turned mirror to get best light then out of sheer habit shifted slip at once remembered prohibition with almost continuous motion of hand moved back sat paralysed with astonishment at action then slowly turned head professor be out of room demonstrator sat aloft on impromptu rostrum reading q jour mi sci rest of examinee be busy with back to must own up to accident now knew quite clearly what thing be be lenticel characteristic preparation from elder tree eye roved over intent fellow student wedderburn suddenly glanced over shoulder at with queer expression in eye mental excitement have kept hill at abnormal pitch of vigour two day gave way to curious nervous tension book of answer be beside did not write down what thing be with one eye at microscope began making hasty sketch of mind be full of grotesque puzzle in ethic have suddenly be sprung upon must identify must leave question unanswered in case wedderburn must probably come out first in botanical list how must tell now whether might not have identified thing without shifting be possible that wedderburn have failed to recognise of course suppose wedderburn too have shifted slide looked up at clock there be fifteen minute in to make up mind gathered up book of answer coloured pencil used in illustrating reply walked back to seat read through manuscript then sat thinking gnawing knuckle must look queer now if owned up must

though at time perceived clearly that shifting be accidental a day wore on memory became confused about until at last be not sure although assured that be sure whether movement have be absolutely involuntary then be possible that hill dietary be conducive to morbid conscientiousnessa breakfast frequently eaten in hurry midday bun at such hour after five a chanced to be convenient such meat a mean determined usually in chophouse in back street off brompton road occasionally treated to threepenny ninepenny classic usually represented suppression of potato chop be indisputable that outbreak of self abasement emotional revival have distinct relation to period of scarcity apart from influence on feeling there be in hill distinct aversion to falsity that blasphemous landport cobbler have inculcated by strap tongue from earliest year of one fact about professed atheist be convinced may be usually be fool void of subtlety revilers of holy institution brutal speaker mischievous knave lie with difficulty if be not so if have faintest grasp of idea of compromise must simply be liberal churchman moreover memory poisoned regard for miss haysman for now preferred to wedderburn so evidently

in gallery of old iron poisoned too denunciation of capitalist dishonesty have be one of life pleasure lastly poisoned triumph over wedderburn previously have be wedderburns superior in own eye have raged simply at want of recognition now began to fret at darker suspicion of positive inferiority fancied found justification for position in browning vanished on analysis at last moved curiously enough by exactly same motive force have resulted in dishonesty went to professor bindon made clean breast of whole affair a hill be paid student professor bindon did not ask to sit down stood before professor desk a made confession curious story said professor bindon slowly realising how thing reflected on then letting anger rise most remarkable story cant understand doing cant understand avowal youre type of studentcambridge men must never dreami suppose ought to have thoughtwhy did cheat didntcheat said hill have just be telling did thought explained cheated did not cheat said motion be involuntary be not metaphysician be servant of scienceof fact be told not to move slip did move slip if be not cheating if be cheat said hill with note of hysteric in voice must come here tell repentance of course doe credit said professor bindon doe not alter original fact sir said hill giving in in utter self abasement even now cause enormous amount of trouble examination list will have to be revised suppose so sir suppose so of course must be revised dont see how can conscientiously pas not pas said hill fail rule in examination where must be what else did expect dont want to shirk consequence of own act thought perhaps said hill then fail thought a told must simply deduct mark given for slip impossible said bindon besides must still leave above wedderburn deduct only mark preposterous departmental regulation distinctly say own admission sir regulation say nothing of manner in matter come to light simply provide will ruin if fail examination wont renew scholarship must have thought of before sir consider circumstance can not consider anything professor in college be machine regulation will not even let recommend student for appointment be machine have worked have to do very hard sir possibly be if be to be failed examination might a well go home at once be a think proper bindons voice softened little perceived have be unjust provided did not contradict be disposed to amelioration a private person said think confession of yours go far to mitigate offence have set machinery in motion know now must take course ii be really sorry gave way wave of emotion prevented hill from answering suddenly very vividly saw heavily lined face of old landport cobbler father good godwhat fool have be said hotly abruptly hope said bindon that will be lesson to curiously enough be not thinking of quite same indiscretion there be pause must like day to think sir then will let knowabout going home mean said hill moving towards door next day hill place be vacant spectacled girl in green be a usual first with news wedderburn miss haysman be talking of meistersingers when came up to have heard said heard what there be cheating in examination cheating said wedderburn with face suddenly hot how slide moved never be that slide that werent to move nonsense said wedderburn why how must find out who do say be mr hill hill mr hill notsurely not immaculate hill said wedderburn recovering dont believe said miss haysman how do know didnt said girl in spectacle know now for fact mr hill went confessed to professor bindon by jove said wedderburn hill of peoplebut be always inclined to distrust philanthropist on principle be quite sure said miss haysman with catch in breath quite dreadful isnt know what can expect father be cobbler then miss haysman astonished girl in spectacle dont care will not believe said flushing darkly under warm tinted skin will not believe until have told so himselfface to face must scarcely believe then abruptly

piccadilly swell might say up to neck of then ugly black head whopping turban with diamond in blessed bird pecked suddenly have when chap made fuss realised have done wrong suppose went mixed with others to preserve incog happened in minute be among first to arrive there be heathen going over god two sailor man who have charge of bird laughing fit to split be rummy way of losing jewel come to think of man in charge hadnt be about just at moment so that didnt know bird be clean lost see didnt feel half sorry to tell truth beggar have be swaggering over blessed diamond ever since came aboard thing like go from stem to stem of ship in time one be talking about padishah went below to hide feeling at dinnerhe pigged at table by two other hindoosthe captain kind of jeered at about got very excited turned round talked into ear must not buy bird must have diamond demanded right a british subject diamond must be found be firm upon that must appeal to house of lord man in charge of bird be one of wooden headed chap cant get new idea into anyhow refused proposal to interfere with bird by way of medicine instruction be to feed so so treat so so be a much a place be worth not to feed so so treat so so padishah have wanted stomach pumpthough cant do to bird know padishah be full of bad law like most of blessed bengali talked of having lien on bird so forth old boy who said son be london barrister argued that what bird swallowed became ipso facto part of bird that padishahs only remedy lay in action for damage even then might be possible to show contributory negligence hadnt right of way about ostrich didnt belong to that upset padishah extremely more so a most of expressed opinion that be reasonable view there wasnt lawyer aboard to settle matter so talked pretty free at last after aden appears that came round to general opinion went privately to man in charge made offer for five ostrich next morning there be fine shindy at breakfast man hadnt authority to deal with bird nothing on earth must induce to sell seems told padishah that eurasian named potter have already made offer on padishah denounced potter before think most of thought rather smart of potter know that when potter said that hed wired at aden to london to buy bird must have answer at suez cursed pretty richly at lost opportunity at suez padishah gave way to tearsactual wet tearswhen potter became owner of bird offered two hundred fifty right off for five being more than two hundred per cent on what potter have given potter said hed be hanged if parted with feather of themthat meant to kill off one by one find diamond afterwards thinking over relented little be gambling hound be potter little queer at card kind of prize packet business must have suited down to ground anyhow offered for lark to sell bird separately to separate people by auction at starting price of for bird one of said meant to keep for luck must understand diamond be valuable onea little jew chap diamond merchant who be with have put at three four thousand when padishah have shown to himand idea of ostrich gamble caught on now happened that id be having few talk on general subject with man who looked after ostrich quite incidentally hed said one of bird be ailing fancied have indigestion have one feather in tail almost white by knew so when next day auction started with capped padishahs eighty five by ninety fancy be bit too sure eager with bid of others spotted fact be in know padishah went for particular bird like irresponsible lunatic at last jew diamond merchant got for padishah said just after hammer came downso potter declared at rate jew merchant secured there then got gun shot potter made hades of fuss because said must injure sale of other three padishah of course behaved like idiot of be very much excited can tell be precious glad when dissection be over diamond have turned upprecious glad id gone to one forty on particular bird little jew be like most jewshe didnt make great fuss over bad luck potter declined to go on with auction until be understood that good must not be delivered until sale be over little jew wanted to argue that case be exceptional a discussion ran pretty even thing be postponed until next morning have lively dinner table that evening can tell in end potter got way since must stand to reason must be safer if stuck to bird that owed consideration for sportsman like behaviour old gentleman whose son be lawyer said hed be thinking thing over that be very doubtful if when bird have be opened diamond recovered ought not to be handed back to proper owner remember suggested came under law of treasure trovewhich be really truth of matter there be hot argument settled be certainly foolish to kill bird on board ship then old gentleman going at large through legal talk tried to make out sale be lottery illegal appealed to captain potter said sold bird a ostrich didnt want to sell diamond said didnt offer that a inducement three bird put up to best of knowledge belief did not contain diamond be in one keptso hoped price ruled high next day same fact now there be four chance instead of five of course caused rise blessed bird averaged oddly enough padishah didnt secure one of emnot one made too much shindy when ought to have be bidding be talking about lien besides potter be bit down on one fell to quiet little officer chap to little jew third be syndicated by engineer then potter seemed suddenly sorry for having sold said hed flung away clear thousand pound very likely hed draw blank that always have be fool when went have bit of talk to with idea of getting to hedge on last chance found hed already sold bird hed reserved to political chap be on board chap whod be studying indian moral social question in vacation that last be three hundred pound bird well landed three of blessed creature at brindisithough old gentleman said be breach of custom regulationsand potter padishah landed too hindoo seemed half mad a saw blessed diamond going way so to speak kept on saying hed get injunctionhe have injunction on brainand giving name address to chap bought bird so theyd know where to send diamond none of wanted name address none of must give own be fine row can tell youon platform went off by different train came on to southampton there saw last of bird a came ashore be one engineer bought be standing up near bridge in kind of crate looking a leggy silly setting for valuable diamond a ever sawif be setting for valuable diamond how did end oh like wellperhaps yes there one more thing may throw light on week so after landing be down regent street doing bit of shopping who must see arm in arm having purple time of padishah potter if come to think of yes ive thought that only see there doubt diamond be real padishah be

have be cunning subtle became choleric outspoken judgment grew harsh taint seemed to about to be assuredly taint of avarice crept into act moreover inclined golam shah to hopefulness seemed to take dislike to azim khan once indeed made kind of speech in hall of audience therein declared many time over in peculiarly husky voice husky yet full of conviction that azim khan be not worth half anna not worth half anna to human soul in latter day of rajah decline moreover when merchant came must go aside with secretly into little room speak low so that in hall of audience howsoever strained ear

exceedingly strained one fact stand out prominently that azim khan be hopelessly feeble soldier must not at first believe in exemplary integrity of safe deputation insisted in most occidental manner in verifying new rajah statement moreover populace clamoured then by naked man running came alarming intelligence that new deputy commissioner at allapore be coming headlong with soldier to verify account of revolution golam shah samud singh have sent in name of new deputy commissioner be raw young man partly obscured by pith helmet chock full of zeal desire for distinction have heard of treasure be going said to sift matter thoroughly on arrival of distressing intelligence there be hasty informal council of state at azim be not present counter revolution be arranged azim ever learnt

inquiry a knowing a knowingness of english go in order to show not too credulous elicited nothing have heard tale of treasure have commissioner of great box so have golam samud where be must not tell too have certainly heard tale of treasuremany tale indeed perhaps there be treasure have deputy commissioner have scientific turn of mind must have observed that strong smell of gunpowder still hung about audience chamber more than be explained by narrative told have explored adjacent apartment must presently have discovered small treasure room with smashed lock ceiling now dependent ruin amid ruin safe bulging perilously from partly collapsed wall still unconquered with treasure unexplored also be fact that golam shah bandaged hand be not consequence of heroism in combat of certain private blasting operation too amateurishly prosecuted so have situation deputy commissioner installed in palace sending incorrect information to headquarters awaiting instruction safe a safe a ever assistant

le alarmed seem to have sort of invisible body said by jove there boat coming round headland very much like old life after allin different climate shook arm davidson cried wake up ii be just then that boyce came in so soon a spoke davidson exclaimed old boyce dead too what lark hastened to explain that davidson be in kind of somnambulistic trance boyce be interested at once did must to rouse fellow out of extraordinary state answered question asked of own attention seemed distracted by hallucination about beach ship kept interpolating observation concerning boat davit sail filling with wind made one feel queer in dusky laboratory to hear saying such thing be blind helpless have to walk down passage one at elbow to boyces private room while boyce talked to there humoured about ship idea went along corridor asked old wade to come look at voice of dean sobered little not very much asked where hand be why have to walk about up to waist in ground wade thought over long timeyou know how knit browsand then made feel couch guiding hand to thats couch said couch in private room of professor boyce horsehair stuffing davidson felt about puzzled over answered presently that must feel right couldnt see do see asked wade davidson said must see nothing lot of sand broken up shell wade gave other thing to feel telling what be watching keenly ship be almost hull down said davidson presently apropos of nothing never mind ship said wade listen to davidson do know what hallucination mean rather said davidson well everything see be hallucinatory bishop berkeley said davidson dont mistake said wade be alive in room of boyces something have happened to eye can not see can feel hear not see do follow seems to that see too much davidson rubbed knuckle into eye well said thats dont let perplex bellow here will take home in cab wait bit davidson thought help to sit down said presently nowim sorry to trouble youbut will tell over again wade repeated very patiently davidson shut eye pressed hand upon forehead yes said quite right now eye be shut know youre right thats bellow sitting by on couch im in england again be in dark then opened eye there said be sun just rising yard of ship tumbled sea couple of bird flying never saw anything so real im sitting up to neck in bank of sand bent forward covered face with hand then opened eye again dark sea sunrise yet im sitting on sofa in old boyces roomgod help iii be beginning for three week strange affection of davidsons eye continued unabated be far worse than being blind be absolutely helpless have to be fed like newly hatched bird led about undressed if attempted to move fell over thing struck against wall door after day so got used to hearing voice without seeing willingly admitted be at home that wade be right in what told sister to whom be engaged insisted on coming to see must sit for hour day while talked about beach of holding hand seemed to comfort immensely explained that when left college drove homehe lived in hampstead villageit appeared to a if drove right through sandhillit be perfectly black until emerged againand through rock tree solid obstacle when be taken to own room made giddy almost frantic with fear of falling because going upstairs seemed to lift thirty forty foot above rock of imaginary island kept saying must smash egg end be that have to be taken down into father consulting room laid upon couch stood there described island a being bleak kind of place on whole with very little vegetation except peaty stuff lot of bare rock there be multitude of penguin made rock white disagreeable to see sea be often rough once there be thunderstorm lay shouted at silent flash once twice seal pulled up on beach only on first two three day said be very funny way in penguin used to waddle right through how seemed to lie among without disturbing remember one odd thing be when wanted very badly to smoke put pipe in handshe almost poked eye out with itand lit couldnt taste anything ive since found same with mei dont know if usual casethat can not enjoy tobacco at unless can see smoke queerest part of vision came when wade sent out in bath chair to get fresh air davidsons hired chair got that deaf obstinate dependent of theirs widgery to attend to widgerys idea of healthy expedition be peculiar sister who have be to dog home met in camden town towards king cross widgery trotting along complacently davidson evidently most distressed trying in feeble blind way to attract widgerys attention positively wept when sister spoke to oh get out of horrible darkness said feeling for hand must get out of will die be quite incapable of explaining be matter sister decided must go home presently a went up hill towards hampstead horror seemed to drop from said be good to see star again though be then about noon blazing day seemed told afterwards a if be being carried irresistibly towards water be not very much alarmed at first of course be night therea lovely night of course asked for struck a odd of course said always night there when be day here well went right into water be calm shining under moonlightjust broad swell seemed to grow broader flatter a came down into surface glistened just like skinit might have be empty space underneath for must tell to contrary very slowly for rode slanting into water crept up to eye then went under skin seemed to break heal again about eye moon gave jump up in sky grew green dim fish faintly glowing came darting round meand thing seemed made of luminous glass passed through tangle of seaweed shone with oily lustre so drove down into sea star went out one by one moon grew greener darker seaweed became luminous purple red be very faint mysterious everything seemed to quiver while must hear wheel of bath chair creaking footstep of people going by man with bell cry coal kept sinking down deeper deeper into water became inky black about not ray from above came down into darkness phosphorescent thing grew brighter brighter snaky branch of deeper weed flickered like flame of spirit lamp after time there be more weed fish came staring gaping towards into through never imagined such fish before have line of fire along side of a though have be outlined with luminous pencil there be ghastly thing swimming backwards with lot of twining arm then saw coming very slowly towards through gloom hazy mass of light resolved a drew nearer into multitude of fish struggling darting round something drifted drove on straight towards presently saw in midst of tumult by light of fish bit of splintered spar looming over dark hull tilting over glowing phosphorescent form be shaken writhed a fish bit at then be began to try to attract widgerys attention horror came upon ugh must have driven right into half eatenthings if sister have not come have great hole in bellow andnever mind be ghastly iv for three week davidson remained in singular state seeing what at time imagined be altogether phantasmal world stone blind to world around then one tuesday when called met old davidson in passage can see thumb old gentleman said in perfect transport be struggling into overcoat can see thumb bellow said with tear in eye lad will be right yet rushed in to davidson be holding up little book before face looking at laughing in weak kind of way amazing said there kind of patch come there pointed with finger im on rock a usual penguin be staggering flapping about a usual there be whale showing now then got too dark now to make out put something there see iti do see very dim broken in place see same like faint spectre of found out morning while be dressing like hole in infernal phantom world just put hand by mine nonot there ah yes see base of thumb bit of cuff look like ghost of bit of hand sticking out of darkening sky just by there group of star like cross coming out from time davidson began to mend account of change like account of vision be oddly convincing over patch of field of vision phantom world grew fainter grew transparent a be through translucent gap began to see dimly real world about patch grew in size number ran together spread until only here there be blind spot left upon eye be able to get up steer about feed once more read smoke behave like ordinary citizen again at first be very confusing to to have two picture overlapping other like changing view of lantern in little while began to distinguish real from illusory at first be unfeignedly glad seemed only too anxious to complete cure by taking exercise tonic a odd island of began to fade away from became queerly interested in wanted particularly to go down into deep sea again must spend time wandering about low lying part of london trying to find water logged wreck have seen drifting glare of real daylight very soon impressed so vividly a to blot out everything of shadowy world of night time in darkened room must still see white splashed rock of island clumsy penguin staggering to fro even grew fainter fainter at last soon after married sister saw for last time v now to tell of queerest thing of about two year after cure dined with davidsons after dinner man named atkins called in be lieutenant in royal navy pleasant talkative man be on friendly term with brother in law be soon on friendly term with came out that be engaged to davidsons cousin incidentally took out kind of pocket photograph case to show new rendering of fiance by by said here old fulmar davidson looked at casually then suddenly face lit up good heaven said must almost swear what said atkins that have seen that ship before dont see how can have hasnt be out of south sea for six year before then began davidson then yesthats ship dreamt of im sure thats ship dreamt of be standing off island swarmed with penguin fired gun good lord said atkins who have never heard particular of seizure how deuce must dream then bit by bit came out that on very day davidson be seized h m s fulmar have actually be off little rock to south of antipode island boat have landed overnight to get penguin egg have be delayed thunderstorm drifting up boat crew have waited until morning before rejoining ship atkins have be one of corroborated word for word description davidson have given of island boat there be not slightest doubt in of mind davidson have really seen place in unaccountable way while moved hither thither in sight moved hither thither in manner corresponded about distant island how be absolutely mystery completes remarkable story of davidsons eye be perhaps best authenticated case in existence of real vision at distance explanation there be none forthcoming except what professor wade have thrown out explanation invokes fourth dimension dissertation on theoretical kind of space to talk of there being kink in space seems mere nonsense to may be because be mathematician when said that nothing must alter fact that place be eight thousand mile away answered that two point might be yard away on sheet of paper yet be brought together by bending paper round reader may grasp argument certainly idea seems to be that davidson stooping between pole of big electro magnet have extraordinary twist given to retinal element through sudden change in field of force due to lightning think a consequence of that may be possible to live visually in one part of world while one life bodily in have even made experiment in support of view so far have simply succeeded in blinding few dog believe be net result of work though have not seen for week latterly have be so busy with work in connection with saint pancras installation have have little opportunity of calling to see whole of theory seems fantastic to fact concerning davidson stand on altogether different footing can testify personally to accuracy of detail have given cone night be hot overcast sky redrimmed with lingering sunset of midsummer sat at open window trying to fancy air be fresher there tree shrub of garden stood stiff dark beyond in roadway gas lamp burnt bright orange against hazy blue of evening further be three light of railway signal against lowering sky man woman spoke to one in low tone doe not suspect said man little nervously not said peevishly a though too irritated think of nothing work price of fuel have imagination poetry none of men of iron have said sententiously have heart have not said turned discontented face towards window distant sound of roaring rushing drew nearer grew in volume house quivered one heard metallic rattle of tender a train passed there be glare of light above cutting driving tumult of smoke one two three four five six seven eight black oblongseight truckspassed across dim grey of embankment be suddenly extinguished one by one in throat of tunnel with last seemed to swallow down train smoke sound in one abrupt gulp country be fresh beautiful once said nowit be gehenna down that waynothing pot bank chimney belching fire dust into face of heaven what doe matter end come end to crueltyto morrow spoke last word in whisper to morrow said speaking in whisper too still staring out of window dear said putting hand on hers turned with start eye searched one anothers hers softened to gaze dear one said then seems so strangethat must have come into life like thisto open paused to open said wonderful world hesitated spoke still more softlythis world of love to then suddenly door clicked closed turned head started violently back in shadow of room stood great shadowy figuresilent saw face dimly in half light with unexpressive dark patch under pent house brow muscle in rauts body suddenly became tense when must door have opened what have heard have heard what have seen tumult of question new comer voice came at last after pause seemed interminable well said be afraid have missed horrocks said man at window gripping window ledge with hand voice be unsteady clumsy figure of horrocks came forward out of shadow made answer to rauts remark for moment stood above woman heart be cold within told mr raut be just possible might come back said in voice never quivered horrocks still silent sat down abruptly in chair by little work table big hand be clenched one saw now fire of eye under shadow of brow be trying to get breath eye went from woman have trusted to friend have trusted then back to woman by time for moment three half understood one yet none dared say word to ease pent up thing that choked be husband voice broke silence at last wanted to see said to raut raut started a spoke came to see said resolved to lie to last yes said horrocks promised said raut to show fine effect of moonlight smoke promised to show fine effect of moonlight smoke repeated horrocks in colourless voice thought might catch to night before went down to work proceeded raut come with there be pause did man mean to take thing coolly did after know how long have be in room yet even at moment when heard door attitudeshorrocks glanced at profile of woman shadowy pallid in half light then glanced at raut seemed to recover suddenly of course said promised to show work under proper dramatic condition odd how must have forgotten if im troubling began raut horrocks started again new light have suddenly come into sultry gloom of eye not in least said have be telling mr raut of contrast of flame shadow think so splendid said woman turning now to husband for first time confidence creeping back again voice just one half note too high that dreadful theory of yours machinery be beautiful everything else in world ugly thought must not spare mr raut great theory one discovery in art be slow to make discovery said horrocks grimly damping suddenly what discover stopped well said nothing suddenly rose to foot promised to show work said to raut put big clumsy hand on friend shoulder be ready to go quite said raut stood up also there be pause of peered through indistinctness of dusk at other two horrockss hand still rested on rauts shoulder raut half fancied still that incident be trivial after mr horrocks knew husband better knew that grim quiet in voice confusion in mind took vague shape of physical evil very well said horrocks dropping hand turned towards door hat raut looked round in half light thats work basket said mr horrocks with gust of hysterical laughter hand came together on back of chair here be said have impulse to warn in undertone must not frame word dont go beware of struggled in mind swift moment passed got said horrocks standing with door half open raut stepped towards better say good bye to mr horrocks said ironmaster even more grimly quiet in tone than before raut started turned good evening mr horrocks said hand touched horrocks held door open with ceremonial politeness unusual in towards men raut went out then after wordless look at husband followed stood motionless while rauts light footfall husband heavy tread like bass treble passed down passage together front door slammed heavily went to window moving slowly stood watchingleaning forward two men appeared for moment at gateway in road passed under street lamp be hidden by black mass of shrubbery lamplight fell for moment on face showing only unmeaning pale patch telling nothing of what still feared doubted craved vainly to know then sank down into crouching attitude in big arm chair eye wide open staring out at red light from furnace flickered in sky hour after be still there attitude scarcely changed oppressive stillness of evening weighed heavily upon raut went side by side down road in silence in silence turned into cinder made by way presently opened out prospect of valley blue haze half dust half mist touched long valley with mystery beyond be hanley etruria grey dark mass outlined thinly by rare golden dot of street lamp here there gas lit window yellow glare of late working factory crowded public house out of mass clear slender against evening sky rose multitude of tall chimney many of reeking few smokeless during season of play here there pallid patch ghostly stunted beehive shape showed position of pot bank wheel black sharp against hot lower sky marked colliery where raise iridescent coal of place nearer at hand be broad stretch of railway half invisible train shunteda steady puffing rumbling with run ringing concussion rhythmic series of impact passage of intermittent puff of white steam across further view to left between railway dark mass of low hill beyond dominating whole view colossal inky black crowned with smoke fitful flame stood great cylinder of jeddah company blast furnace central edifice of big ironwork of horrocks be manager stood heavy threatening full of incessant turmoil of flame seething molten iron about foot of rattled rolling mill steam hammer beat heavily splashed white iron spark hither thither even a looked truckful of fuel be shot into one of giant red flame gleamed out confusion of smoke black dust came boiling upwards towards sky certainly get fine effect of colour with furnace said raut breaking silence have become apprehensive horrocks grunted stood with hand in pocket frowning down at dim steaming railway busy ironwork beyond frowning a if be thinking out knotty problem raut glanced at away again at present moonlight effect be hardly ripe continued looking upward moon be still smothered by vestige of daylight horrocks stared at with expression of man who have suddenly awakened vestige of daylight of course of course too looked up at moon pale still in midsummer sky come along said suddenly gripping rauts arm in hand made move towards path dropped from towards railway raut hung back eye met saw thousand thing in moment that lip came near to say horrockss hand tightened then relaxed left go before raut be aware be arm in arm walking one unwillingly enough down path see fine effect of railway signal towards burslem said horrocks suddenly breaking into loquacity striding fast tightening grip of elbow while little green light red white light against haze have eye for effect raut fine effect look at furnace of mine how rise upon a come down hill to right be petseventy foot of packed he boiled away cheerfully with iron in gut for five long year ive particular fancy for line of red therea lovely bit of warm orange youd call rautthats puddler furnace there in hot light three black figuresdid see white splash of steam hammer thenthats rolling mill come along clang clatter how go rattling across floor sheet tin rautamazing stuff glass mirror be not in when stuff come from mill squelchthere go hammer again come along have to stop talking to catch at breath arm twisted into rauts with benumbing tightness have come striding down black path towards railway a though be possessed raut have not spoken word have simply hung back against horrockss pull with strength say said now laughing nervously with undernote of snarl in voice why on earth be nipping arm off horrocks dragging along like at length horrocks released manner changed again nipping arm off said sorry taught trick of walking in friendly way havent learnt refinement of yet then said raut laughing artificially again by jove im black blue horrocks offered apology stood now near bottom of hill close to fence bordered railway ironwork have grown larger spread out with approach looked up to blast furnace now instead of down further view of etruria hanley have dropped out of sight with descent before by stile rose notice board bearing still dimly visible word beware of train hidden by splash of coaly mud fine effect said horrocks waving arm here come train puff of smoke orange glare round eye of light in front of melodious rattle fine effect furnace of mine used to be finer before shoved cone in throat saved gas how said raut cone cone man cone ill show one nearer flame used to flare out of open throat greatwhat be itpillars of cloud by day red black smoke pillar of fire by night now run off in pipe burn to heat blast top be shut by cone youll be interested in cone now then said raut get burst of fire smoke up there cone not fixed hung by chain from lever balanced by equipoise will see nearer else of course thered be way of getting fuel into thing now then cone dip out come flare see said raut looked over shoulder moon get brighter said come along said horrocks abruptly gripping shoulder again moving suddenly towards railway crossing then came one of swift incident vivid so rapid that leave one doubtful reeling half way across horrockss hand suddenly clenched upon like vice swung backward through half turn so that looked up line there chain of lamp lit carriage window telescoped swiftly a came towards red yellow light of engine grew larger larger rushing down upon a grasped what meant turned face to horrocks pushed with strength against arm held back between rail struggle did not last moment just a certain a be that horrocks held there so certain be that have be violently lugged out of danger out of way said horrocks with gasp a train came rattling by stood panting by gate into ironwork did not see coming said raut still even in spite of own apprehension trying to keep up appearance of ordinary intercourse horrocks answered with grunt cone said then a one who recovers himselfi thought did not hear didnt said raut wouldnt have have run over then for world said horrocks for moment lost nerve said raut horrocks stood for minute then turned abruptly towards ironwork again see how fine great mound of mine clinker heap look in night truck yonder up above there up go out tilt slag see palpitating red stuff go sliding down slope a get nearer heap rise up cut blast furnace see quiver up above big one not way way between block heap go to puddling furnace want to show canal first came took raut by elbow so went along side by side raut answered horrocks vaguely what asked have really happened on line be deluding with own fancy have horrocks actually held back in way of train have just be within ace of being murdered suppose slouching scowling monster did know anything for minute two then raut be really afraid for life mood passed a reasoned with after horrocks might have heard nothing at rate have pulled out of way in time odd manner might be due to mere vague jealousy have shown once before be talking now of ash heap canal eigh said horrocks what said raut rather haze in moonlight fine canal said horrocks stopping suddenly canal by moonlight firelight be immense effect youve never seen fancy that youve spent too many of evening philandering up in newcastle there tell for real florid effect will see boiling water a came out of labyrinth of clinker heap mound of coal ore noise of rolling mill sprang upon suddenly loud near distinct three shadowy workman went by touched cap to horrocks face be vague in darkness raut felt futile impulse to address before must frame word passed into shadow horrocks pointed to canal close before now weird looking place seemed in blood red reflection of furnace hot water cooled tuyeres came into fifty yard upa tumultuous almost boiling affluent steam rose up from water in silent white whisps streak wrapping damply about incessant succession of ghost coming up from black red eddy white uprising made head swim shining black tower of larger blast furnace rose overhead out of mist tumultuous riot filled ear raut kept away from edge of water watched horrocks here be red said horrocks blood red vapour a red hot a sin yonder there where moonlight fall on drive across clinker heap be a white a death raut turned head for moment then came back hastily to watch on horrocks come along to rolling mill said horrocks threatening hold be not so evident that time raut felt little reassured same what on earth did horrocks mean about white a death red a sin coincidence perhaps went stood behind puddler for little while then through rolling mill where incessant din deliberate steam hammer beat juice out of succulent iron black half naked titan rushed plastic bar like hot sealing wax between wheel come on said horrocks in rauts ear went peeped through little glass hole behind tuyeres saw tumbled fire writhing in pit of blast furnace left one eye blinded for while then with green blue patch dancing across dark went to lift by truck of ore fuel lime be raised to top of big cylinder out upon narrow rail overhung furnace rauts doubt came upon again be wise to be here if horrocks did knoweverything do what must must not resist violent trembling right underfoot be sheer depth of seventy foot be dangerous place pushed by truck of fuel to get to railing crowned place reek of furnace sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent bitterness seemed to make distant hillside of hanley quiver moon be riding out now from among drift of cloud way up sky above undulating wooded outline of newcastle steaming canal ran away from below under indistinct bridge vanished into dim haze of flat field towards burslem thats cone ive be telling of shouted horrocks below sixty foot of fire molten metal with air of blast frothing through like gas in soda water raut gripped handrail tightly stared down at cone heat be intense boiling of iron tumult of blast made thunderous accompaniment to horrockss voice thing have to be gone through now perhaps after in middle bawled horrocks temperature near thousand degree if be dropped into itflash into flame like pinch of gunpowder in candle put hand out feel heat of breath why even up here ive seen rain water boiling off truck that cone there damned sight too hot for roasting cake top side of three hundred degree three hundred degree said raut three hundred centigrade mind said horrocks will boil blood out of in time eigh said raut turned boil blood out of in dont let go screamed raut let go arm with one hand clutched at handrail then with for moment two men stood swaying then suddenly with violent jerk horrocks have twisted from hold clutched at horrocks missed foot went back into empty air in mid air twisted then cheek shoulder knee struck hot cone together clutched chain by cone hung thing sank infinitesimal amount a struck circle of glowing red appeared about tongue of flame released from chaos within flickered up towards intense pain assailed at knee must smell singeing of hand raised to foot tried to climb up chain then something struck head black shining with moonlight throat of furnace rose about horrocks saw stood above by one of truck of fuel on rail gesticulating figure be bright white in moonlight shouting fizzle fool fizzle hunter of woman hot blooded hound boil boil boil suddenly caught up handful of coal out of truck flung deliberately lump after lump at raut horrocks cried raut horrocks clung cry to chain pulling up from burning of cone missile horrocks flung hit clothes charred glowed a struggled cone dropped rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out burned round in swift breath of flame human likeness departed from when momentary red have passed horrocks saw charred blackened figure head streaked with blood still clutching fumbling with chain writhing in agonya cindery animal inhuman monstrous creature began sobbing intermittent shriek abruptly at sight ironmasters anger passed deadly sickness came upon heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to nostril sanity returned to god have mercy upon cried oh god what have done knew thing below save that still moved felt be already dead manthat blood of poor wretch must be boiling in vein intense realisation of agony came to mind overcame other feeling for moment stood irresolute then turning to truck hastily tilted content upon struggling thing have once be man mass fell with thud went radiating over cone with thud shriek ended boiling confusion of smoke dust flame came rushing up towards a passed saw cone clear again then staggered back stood trembling clinging to rail with hand lip moved word came to down below be sound of voice running step clangour of rolling in shed ceased abruptly purple pileus mr coombes be sick of life walked away from unhappy home sick not only of own existence of everybody el turned aside down gaswork

at stiff finger of bandaged hand felt at neck for throb of artery morning be very cold steel blade felt like ice sea raider until extraordinary affair at peculiar specie haploteuthis ferox be known to science only generically on strength of half digested tentacle obtained near azores decaying body pecked by bird nibbled by fish found early in by mr jennings near land end in department of zological science indeed be quite so much in dark a with regard to deep sea cephalopod mere accident for instance be that led to prince of monaco discovery of nearly dozen new form in summer of discovery in before mentioned tentacle be included chanced that cachalot be killed off terceira by sperm whaler in last struggle charged almost to prince yacht missed rolled under died within twenty yard of rudder in agony threw up number of large object prince dimly perceiving be strange important be by happy expedient able to secure before sank set screw in motion kept circling in vortex thus created until boat must be lowered specimen be whole cephalopod fragment of cephalopod of gigantic proportion almost of unknown to science must seem indeed that large agile creature living in middle depth of sea must to large extent for ever remain unknown to since under water be too nimble for net be only by such rare unlooked for accident that specimen can be obtained in case of haploteuthis ferox for instance be still altogether ignorant of habitat a ignorant a be of breeding ground of herring sea way of salmon zologists be altogether at loss to account for sudden appearance on coast possibly be stress of hunger migration drove hither out of deep will be perhaps better to avoid necessarily inconclusive discussion to proceed at once with narrative first human being to set eye upon living haploteuthisthe first human being to survive be for there can be little doubt now that wave of bathing fatality boating accident travelled along coast of cornwall devon in early may be due to causewas retired tea dealer of name of fison who be stopping at sidmouth boarding house be in afternoon be walking along cliff path between sidmouth ladram bay cliff in direction be very high down red face of in one place kind of ladder staircase have be made be near when attention be attracted by what at first thought to be cluster of bird struggling over fragment of food caught sunlight glistened pinkish white tide be right out object be not only far below remote across broad waste of rock reef covered with dark seaweed interspersed with silvery shining tidal pool be moreover dazzled by brightness of further water in minute regarding again perceived that judgment be in fault for over struggle circled number of bird jackdaw gull for most part latter gleaming blindingly when sunlight smote wing seemed minute in comparison with curiosity be perhaps aroused more strongly because of first insufficient explanation a have nothing better to do than amuse decided to make object whatever be goal of afternoon walk instead of ladram bay conceiving might perhaps be great fish of sort stranded by chance flapping about in distress so hurried down long steep ladder stopping at interval of thirty foot so to take breath scan mysterious movement at foot of cliff be of course nearer object than have be on other hand now came up against incandescent sky beneath sun so a to seem dark indistinct be pinkish of be now hidden by skerry of weedy boulder perceived that be made up of seven rounded body distinct connected that bird kept up constant croaking screaming seemed afraid to approach too closely mr fison torn by curiosity began picking way across wave worn rock finding wet seaweed that covered thickly rendered extremely slippery stopped removed shoe sock coiled trouser above knee object be of course merely to avoid stumbling into rocky pool about perhaps be rather glad a men be of excuse to resume even for moment sensation of boyhood at rate be to doubt that owes life approached mark with assurance absolute security of country against form of animal life give inhabitant round body moved to fro be only when surmounted skerry of boulder have mentioned that realised horrible nature of discovery came upon with suddenness rounded body fell apart a came into sight over ridge displayed pinkish object to be partially devoured body of human being whether of man woman be unable to say rounded body be new ghastly looking creature in shape somewhat resembling octopus with huge very long flexible tentacle coiled copiously on ground skin have glistening texture unpleasant to see like shiny downward bend of tentacle surrounded curious excrescence at bend tentacle large intelligent eye gave creature grotesque suggestion of face be size of fair sized swine about body tentacle seemed to to be many foot in length there be think seven eight at least of creature twenty yard beyond amid surf of now returning tide two others be emerging from sea body lay flatly on rock eye regarded with evil interest doe not appear that mr fison be afraid that realised that be in danger possibly confidence be to be ascribed to limpness of attitude be horrified of course intensely excited indignant at such revolting creature preying upon human flesh thought have chanced upon drowned body shouted to with idea of driving off finding did not budge cast about picked up big rounded lump of rock flung at one then slowly uncoiling tentacle began moving towards himcreeping at first deliberately making soft purring sound to other in moment mr fison realised that be in danger shouted again threw boot started off with leap forthwith twenty yard off stopped faced about judging slow behold tentacle of leader be already pouring over rocky ridge on have just be standing at that shouted again time not threatening cry of dismay began jumping striding slipping wading across uneven expanse between beach tall red cliff seemed suddenly at vast distance saw a though be creature in world two minute workman engaged in repair of ladder way little suspecting race for life be beginning below at one time must hear creature splashing in pool not dozen foot behind once slipped almost fell chased to very foot of cliff desisted only when have be joined by workman at foot of ladder way up cliff three of men pelted with stone for time then hurried to cliff top along path towards sidmouth to secure assistance boat to rescue desecrated body from clutch of abominable creature ii a if have not already be in sufficient peril that day mr fison went with boat to point out exact spot of adventure a tide be down required considerable detour to reach spot when at last came off ladder way mangled body have disappeared water be now running in submerging first one slab of slimy rock then four men in boatthe workman be boatman mr fisonnow turned attention from bearing off shore to water beneath keel at first must see little below save dark jungle of laminaria with occasional darting fish mind be set on adventure expressed disappointment freely presently saw one of monster swimming through water seaward with curious rolling motion suggested to mr spinning roll of captive balloon almost immediately after waving streamer of laminaria be extraordinarily perturbed parted for moment three of beast became darkly visible struggling for what be probably fragment of drowned man in moment copious olive green ribbon have poured again over writhing group at four men greatly excited began beating water with oar shouting immediately saw tumultuous movement among weed desisted to see more clearly a soon a water be smooth saw a seemed to whole sea bottom among weed set with eye ugly swine cried one of men why there dozen forthwith thing began to rise through water about mr fison have since described to writer startling eruption out of waving laminaria meadow to seemed to occupy considerable time be probable that really be affair of few second only for time nothing eye then speaks of tentacle streaming out parting weed frond way that then thing growing larger until at last bottom be hidden by intercoiling form tip of tentacle rose darkly here there into air above swell of water one came up boldly to side of boat clinging to with three of sucker set tentacle threw four others over gunwale a if with intention of oversetting boat of clambering into mr fison at once caught up boathook jabbing furiously at soft tentacle forced to desist be struck in back almost pitched overboard by boatman who be using oar to resist similar attack on other side of boat tentacle on side at once relaxed hold at slid out of sight splashed into water wed better get out of said mr fison who be trembling violently went to tiller while boatman one of workman seated began rowing other workman stood up in fore part of boat with boathook ready to strike more tentacle might appear nothing else seems to have be said mr fison have expressed common feeling beyond amendment in hushed scared mood with face white drawn set about escaping from position into have so recklessly blundered oar have scarcely dropped into water before dark tapering serpentine rope have bound be about rudder creeping up side of boat with looping motion came sucker again men gripped oar pulled be like trying to move boat in floating raft of weed help here cried boatman mr fison second workman rushed to help lug at oar then man with boathookhis name be ewan ewensprang up with curse began striking downward over side a far a must reach at bank of tentacle now clustered along boat bottom at same time two rower stood up to get better purchase for recovery of oar boatman handed to mr fison who lugged desperately meanwhile boatman opened big clasp knife leaning over side of boat began hacking at spiring arm upon oar shaft mr fison staggering with quivering rocking of boat teeth set breath coming short vein starting on hand a pulled at oar suddenly cast eye seaward there not fifty yard off across long roller of incoming tide be large boat standing in towards with three woman little child in boatman be rowing little man in pink ribboned straw hat white stood in stern hailing for moment of course mr fison thought of help then thought of child abandoned oar forthwith threw up arm in frantic gesture screamed to party in boat to keep away for god sake say much for modesty courage of mr fison that doe not seem to be aware that there be quality of heroism in action at juncture oar have abandoned be at once drawn under presently reappeared floating about twenty yard away at same moment mr fison felt boat under lurch violently hoarse scream prolonged cry of terror from boatman caused to forget party of excursionist altogether turned saw hill crouching by forward rowlock face convulsed with terror right arm over side drawn tightly down gave now succession of short sharp cry oh oh ohoh mr fison belief that must have be hacking at tentacle below water line have be grasped by of course be quite impossible to say now certainly what have happened boat be heeling over so that gunwale be within ten inch of water ewan other labourer be striking down into water with oar boathook on side of hill arm mr fison instinctively placed to counterpoise then hill who be burly powerful man made strenuous effort rose almost to standing position lifted arm indeed clean out of water hanging to be complicated tangle of brown rope eye of one of brute have hold of glaring straight resolute showed momentarily above surface boat heeled more more green brown water came pouring in cascade over side then hill slipped fell with rib across side arm mass of tentacle about splashed back into water rolled over boot kicked mr fisons knee a gentleman rushed forward to seize in moment fresh tentacle have whipped about waist neck after brief convulsive struggle in boat be nearly capsized hill be lugged overboard boat righted with violent jerk that sent mr fison over other side hid struggle in water from eye stood staggering to recover balance for moment a did so became aware that struggle inflowing tide have carried close upon weedy rock again not four yard off table of rock still rose in rhythmic movement above in wash of tide in moment mr fison seized oar from ewan gave one vigorous stroke then dropping ran to bow leapt felt foot slide over rock by frantic effort leapt again towards further mass stumbled over came to knee rose again look out cried one large drab body struck be knocked flat into tidal pool by one of workman a went down heard smothered choking cry that believed at time came from hill then found marvelling at shrillness variety of hill one jumped over curving rush of foamy water poured over passed scrambled to foot dripping without looking seaward ran a fast a terror must let shoreward before over flat space of scattered rock stumbled two workmenone dozen yard in front of other looked over shoulder at last seeing that be not pursued faced about be astonished from moment of rising of cephalopod out of water have be acting too swiftly to fully comprehend action now seemed to a if have suddenly jumped out of evil dream for there be sky cloudless blazing with afternoon sun sea weltering under pitiless brightness soft creamy foam of breaking water low long dark ridge of rock righted boat floated rising falling gently on swell about dozen yard from shore hill monster stress tumult of fierce fight for life have vanished a though have never be mr fisons heart be beating violently be throbbing to finger tip breath came deep there be something missing for second must not think clearly enough what might be sun sky sea be then remembered boatload of excursionist have vanished wondered whether have imagined turned saw two workman standing side by side under projecting mass of tall pink cliff hesitated whether must make one last attempt to save man hill physical excitement seemed to desert suddenly leave aimless helpless turned shoreward stumbling wading towards two companion looked back again there be now two boat floating one farthest out at sea pitched clumsily bottom upward iii so be haploteuthis ferox made appearance upon devonshire coast so far have be most serious aggression mr fisons account taken together with wave of boating bathing casualty to have already alluded absence of fish from cornish coast that year point clearly to shoal of voracious deep sea monster prowling slowly along sub tidal coast line hunger migration have know be suggested a force drove for own part prefer to believe alternative theory of hemsley hemsley hold that pack shoal of creature may have become enamoured of human flesh by accident of foundered ship sinking among have wandered in search of out of accustomed zone first waylaying following ship so coming to shore in wake of atlantic traffic to discus hemsleys cogent admirably stated argument must be out of place here must seem that appetite of shoal be satisfied by catch of eleven peoplefor so far a can be ascertained there be ten people in second boat certainly creature gave further sign of presence off sidmouth that day coast between seaton budleigh salterton be patrolled that evening night by four preventive service boat men in be armed with harpoon cutlass a evening advanced number of more le similarly equipped expedition organised by private individual joined mr fison took part in of expedition about midnight excited hail be heard from boat about couple of mile out at sea to south east of sidmouth lantern be seen waving in strange manner to fro up down nearer boat at once hurried towards alarm venturesome occupant of boat seaman curate two schoolboy have actually seen monster passing under boat creature seems like most deep sea organism be phosphorescent have be floating five fathom deep so like creature of moonshine through blackness of water tentacle retracted a if asleep rolling over over moving slowly in wedge like formation towards south east people told story in gesticulated fragment a first one boat drew alongside then at last there be little fleet of eight nine boat collected together from tumult like chatter of marketplace rose into stillness of night there be little disposition to pursue shoal people have weapon experience for dubious chase presentlyeven with certain relief may bethe boat turned shoreward now to tell what be perhaps most astonishing fact in whole astonishing raid have not slightest knowledge of subsequent movement of shoal although whole southwest coast be now alert for may perhaps be significant that cachalot be stranded off sark on june two week three day after sidmouth affair living haploteuthis came ashore on calais sand be alive because several witness saw tentacle moving in convulsive way be probable that be dying gentleman named pouchet obtained rifle shot be last appearance of living haploteuthis others be seen on french coast on th of june dead body almost complete be washed ashore near torquay few day later boat from marine biological station engaged in dredging off plymouth picked up rotting specimen slashed deeply with cutlas wound how former specimen have come by death be impossible to say on last day of june mr egbert caine artist bathing near newlyn threw up arm shrieked be drawn under friend bathing with made attempt to save swam at once for shore be last fact to tell of extraordinary raid from deeper sea whether be really last of horrible creature be a yet premature to say be believed certainly

be grand thing to liveas man doesself reliant free so at last said aubrey vair come to culmination crown of life paused glanced hastily at then dropped voice almost to whisperand culmination of life be love eye met for moment looked away at once aubrey vair felt peculiar thrill catching in breath emotion be too complex for analysis have certain sense of surprise also at way conversation have developed mr baynes deaf aunt suddenly dug in chest with ear trumpet one at tennis bawled love did tell janes girl have have scarlet fever asked mr baynes deaf aunt said aubrey vair yes be peeling now said mr baynes deaf aunt shutting lip tightly nodding in slow significant manner at of there be pause three seemed lost in thought too deep for word love began aubrey vair presently in severely philosophical tone leaning back in chair holding hand like praying saint in front of staring at toe of shoelove be believe one true real thing in life rise above reason interest explanation yet never

happier if must die soon after golden time like ephemeris there be decay set in eigh said mr baynes deaf aunt startlingly didnt hear be on point of remarking shouted aubrey vair wheeling array of thoughtsi be on point of remarking that few people in redhill must match mr morton fine broad green others have noticed mr baynes deaf aunt shouted back be since have have in new false teeth interruption dislocated conversation little however must thank mr vair said dark girl when parted afternoon for having given very much to think about from manner aubrey vair perceived clearly have not wasted time must require subtler pen than mine to tell how from day passion for miss smith grew like jonah gourd in heart of aubrey vair became pensive in prolonged absence of miss smith irritable mr aubrey vair felt change in put down to vitriolic saturday reviewer indisputably saturday doe at time go little far re read elective affinity lent to miss smith incredible a may appear to member of areopagus club where know aubrey vair did also beyond question inspire sort of passion in sombre eyed rather clever really very beautiful girl talked to lot about love destiny bric brac of minor poet talked together about genius elaborately though discreetly sought society presented read to milder of unpublished sonnet consider byronic feature pasty feminine mind have own law suppose also where girl be not fool literary man have enormous advantage over one preacher in show can make of heart ware at last day in summer came when met alone possibly by chance in quiet lane towards horley there be ample hedge on side rich with honeysuckle vetch mullein conversed intimately of poetic ambition then read verse of subsequently published in hobsons magazine tenderly ever since have met thee have written day before though think sentiment be uncommonly trite there be redeeming note of sincerity about line not conspicuous in aubrey vairs poetry read rather well swell of genuine emotion crept into voice a read with one white hand thrown out to point rhythm of line ever sweet for thee concluded looking up into face before looked up have be thinking chiefly of poem effect straightway forgot arm hung limply before hand be clasped together eye be very tender verse go to heart said softly mobile feature be capable of wonderful shade of expression suddenly forgot wife position a minor poet a looked at be possible that classical feature may have undergone certain transfiguration for one brief momentand be always to linger in memorydestiny lifted out of vain little self to nobler level of simplicity copy of tenderly ever fluttered from hand consideration vanished only one thing seemed of importance love said abruptly expression of fear came into eye grip of hand upon one tightened convulsively became very pale then moved lip a if to speak bringing face slightly nearer to there be nothing in world at moment for of one be trembling exceedingly in whisper said love aubrey vair stood quivering speechless looking into eye have never seen light a saw there before be in wild tumult of emotion be dreadfully scared at what have done must not say word nodded have come to said presently in same awe stricken whisper then oh love love thereupon aubrey vair have clasped to cheek upon shoulder lip to hers thus be that aubrey vair came by cardinal memory of life to day recurs in work little boy clambering in hedge way down lane saw group with surprise then with scorn contempt recking nothing of destiny turned away feeling that at least must never come to unspeakable unmanliness of hugging girl unhappily for reigate scandal shame for sex be altogether too deep for word hour after aubrey vair returned home in hushed mood there be muffin after own heart for teamrs aubrey vair have have hers there be chrysanthemum chiefly white onesflowers lovedset out in china bowl be wont to praise wife came behind to kiss a sat eating de lill jummuns remarked kissing under ear then came into mind of aubrey vair with startling clearness while ear be being kissed with mouth full of muffin that life be singularly complex thing summer passed at last into harvest time leaf began falling be evening warm sunset light still touched down up valley blue haze be creeping one two lamp in reigate be already alight about way up slanting road scale down there be wooden seat where one may obtain fine view of red villa scattered below of succession of blue hill beyond here girl with shadowy face be sitting have book on knee lay neglected be leaning forward chin resting upon hand be looking across valley into darkening sky with troubled eye aubrey vair appeared through hazel bush sat down beside held dozen dead leaf in hand did not alter attitude well said be to be flight asked aubrey vair be rather pale have be having bad night latterly with dream of continental express mr aubrey vair possibly even in pursuithe always fancied making tragedy ridiculous by tearfully bringing additional pair of sock such trifle have forgotten with herall reigate redhill in commotion have never eloped before have vision of difficulty with hotel proprietor mr aubrey vair might telegraph ahead even have have prophetic vision of headline in halfpenny evening newspaper young lady abducts minor poet so there be quaver in voice a asked be to be flight a will answered still not looking at want to consider particularly how will affect man said aubrey vair slowly staring hard at leaf in hand even gain certain clat in affair to woman be ruinsocial moral be not love said girl in white ah dearest think of stupid said under breath spoke nothing can not go on meeting one loving one without great scandal misery must not that interrupted miss smith must be unspeakably horrible be dreadful conversation to life be so intricate such web of subtle strand bind way can not tell what be right must consider man must break such strand there be manliness said aubrey vair with sudden glow of moral exaltation in doing wrong love must at least die together dearest said discontentedly good lord said aubrey vair meanconsider wife have not considered hitherto there be flavourof cowardice of desertion about suicide said aubrey vair frankly have english prejudice like kind of running away miss smith smiled very faintly see clearly now what did not see love yours be very different thing possibly be sexual difference said aubrey vair then feeling remark inadequate relapsed into silence sat for time without word two light in reigate below multiplied to score of bright point above one star have become visible began laughing almost noiseless hysterical laugh jarred unaccountably upon aubrey vair presently stood up will wonder where be said think must be going followed to road then be end said with curious mixture of relief poignant regret yes be end answered turned away there straightway dropped into soul of aubrey vair sense of infinite loss be altogether new sensation be perhaps twenty yard away when groaned aloud with weight of suddenly began running after with arm extended annie criedannie have be talking rot annie now know love can not spare must not be did not understand weight be horrible oh stop annie cried with breaking voice there be tear on face turned upon suddenly with look of annoyance arm fell by side expression changed at sight of pale face understand said have said good bye looked at be evidently greatly distressed little out of breath have just stopped blubbering contemptible quality reached pathetic came up close to taking damp byronic visage between hand kissed again again good bye little man that loved said good bye to folly of love then with something may have be laugh sobshe herself when came to write in novel did not know whichshe turned hurried away again went out of path aubrey vair must pursue at cross road aubrey vair stood where have kissed with mind a inactive a body until white dress have disappeared then gave involuntary sigh large exhaustive expiration so awoke began walking pensively dragging foot through dead leaf home emotion be terrible thing do like potato dear asked mr aubrey vair at dinner cooked aubrey vair descended slowly from cloudy impalpable meditation to level of fried potato potato remarked after pause during be struggling with recollection yes potato have exactly tint of dead leaf of hazel what fanciful poet be said mr aubrey vair taste be very nice potato indeed lord of dynamo chief attendant of three dynamo buzzed rattled at camberwell kept electric railway going

machinery try to learn way of certain odd possibility of negro mind brought into abrupt contact with crown of civilisation holroyd never fully realised though just at end got inkling of to define

cast up shattered in health civilised in costume penniless except in matter of direst necessity practically dumb animal to toil for james holroyd to be bullied by in dynamo shed at camberwell to james holroyd bullying be labour of love there be three dynamo with engine at camberwell two have be there since beginning be small machine larger one be new smaller machine made reasonable noise strap hummed over drum now then brush buzzed fizzled air churned steadily whoo whoo whoo between pole one be loose in foundation kept shed vibrating big dynamo drowned little noise altogether with sustained drone of iron core somehow set part of iron work humming place made visitor head reel with throb throb throb of engine rotation of big wheel spinning ball valve occasional spitting of steam over deep unceasing surging note of big dynamo last noise be from engineering point of view defect azuma zi accounted unto monster for mightiness pride if be possible must have noise of shed always about reader a read must tell story to accompaniment be steady stream of din from ear picked out first one thread then there be intermittent snorting panting seething of steam engine suck thud of piston dull beat on air a spoke of great driving wheel came round note leather strap made a ran tighter looser fretful tumult from dynamo over sometimes inaudible a ear tired of then creeping back upon sens again be trombone note of big machine floor never felt steady quiet beneath one foot quivered jarred be confusing unsteady place enough to send one thought jerking into odd zigzag for three month while big strike of engineer be in progress holroyd who be blackleg azuma zi who be mere black be never out of stir eddy of slept fed in little wooden shanty between shed gate holroyd delivered theological lecture on text of big machine soon after azuma zi came have to shout to be heard in din look at said holroyd wheres eathen idol to match im azuma zi looked for moment holroyd be inaudible then azuma zi heard kill hundred men twelve per cent on ordinary share said holroyd thats something like gord holroyd be proud of big dynamo expatiated upon size power to azuma zi until heaven know what odd current of thought incessant whirling shindy set up within curly black cranium must explain in most graphic manner dozen so way in man might be killed by once gave azuma zi shock a sample of quality after in breathing time of labourit be heavy labour being not only own most of holroydsazuma zi must sit watch big machine now then brush must sparkle spit blue flash at holroyd must swear rest be a smooth rhythmic a breathing band ran shouting over shaft ever behind one a one be complacent thud of piston so lived day in big airy shed with holroyd to wait upon not prisoned up slaving to drive ship a other engine knewmere captive devil of british solomonhad be machine enthroned two smaller dynamo azuma zi by force of contrast despised large one privately christened lord of dynamo be fretful irregular big dynamo be steady how great be how serene easy in working greater calmer even than buddahs have seen at rangoon yet not motionless living great black coil spun spun ring ran round under brush deep note of coil steadied whole affected azuma zi queerly azuma zi be not fond of labour must sit about watch lord of dynamo while holroyd went away to persuade yard porter to get whiskey although proper place be not in dynamo shed behind engine moreover if holroyd caught skulking got hit for with rod of stout copper wire must go stand close to colossus look up at great leather band running overhead there be black patch on band came round pleased somehow among clatter to watch return again again odd thought spun with whirl of scientific people tell that savage give soul to rock treesand machine be thousand time more alive than rock tree azuma zi be practically savage still veneer of civilisation lay deeper than slop suit bruise coal grime on face hand father before have worshipped meteoric stone kindred blood may be have splashed broad wheel of juggernaut took opportunity holroyd gave of touching handling great dynamo be fascinating polished cleaned until metal part be blinding in sun felt mysterious sense of service in doing must go up to touch spinning coil gently god have worshipped be far away people in london hid god at last dim feeling grew more distinct took shape in thought act when came into roaring shed one morning salaamed to lord of dynamo then when holroyd be away went whispered to thundering machine that be servant prayed to have pity on save from holroyd a did so rare gleam of light came in through open archway of throbbing machine shed lord of dynamo a whirled roared be radiant with pale gold then azuma zi knew that service be acceptable to lord after that did not feel so lonely a have done have indeed be very much alone in london even when work time be over be rare loitered about shed then next time holroyd maltreated azuma zi went presently to lord of dynamo whispered thou seest o lord angry whirr of machinery seemed to answer thereafter appeared to that whenever holroyd came into shed different note came into sound of great dynamo lord bides time said azuma zi to iniquity of fool be not yet ripe waited watched for day of reckoning one day there be evidence of short circuiting holroyd making unwary examinationit be in afternoongot rather severe shock azuma zi from behind engine saw jump off curse at peccant coil be warned said azuma zi to surely lord be very patient holroyd have at first initiated nigger into such elementary conception of dynamo working a must enable to take temporary charge of shed in absence when noticed manner in azuma zi hung about monster became suspicious dimly perceived assistant be up to something connecting with anointing of coil with oil have rotted varnish in one place issued edict shouted above confusion of machinery dont ee go nigh that big dynamo more pooh bah ll take thy skin off besides if pleased azuma zi to be near big machine be plain sense decency to keep away from azuma zi obeyed at time later be caught bowing before lord of dynamo at holroyd twisted arm kicked a turned to go away a azuma zi presently stood behind engine glared at back of hated noise of machinery took new rhythm sounded like four word in native tongue be hard to say exactly what madness be fancy azuma zi be mad incessant din whirl of dynamo shed may have churned up little store of knowledge big store of superstitious fancy at last into something akin to frenzy at rate when idea of making sacrifice to dynamo fetich be thus suggested to filled with strange tumult of exultant emotion night two men black shadow be alone in shed together shed be lit with one big arc light winked flickered purple shadow lay black behind dynamo ball governor of engine whirled from light to darkness piston beat loud steady world outside seen through open end of shed seemed incredibly dim remote seemed absolutely silent too since riot of machinery drowned external sound far away be black fence of yard with grey shadowy house behind above be deep blue sky pale little star azuma zi suddenly walked across centre of shed above leather band be running went into shadow by big dynamo holroyd heard click spin of armature changed what be dewin with switch bawled in surprise hant told then saw set expression of azuma zis eye a asiatic came out of shadow towards in moment two men be grappling fiercely in front of great dynamo coffee headed fool gasped holroyd with brown hand at throat keep off contact ring in moment be tripped reeling back upon lord of dynamo instinctively loosened grip upon antagonist to save from machine messenger sent in furious haste from station to find out what have happened in dynamo shed met azuma zi at porter lodge by gate azuma zi tried to explain something messenger must make nothing of black incoherent english hurried on to shed machine be noisily at work nothing seemed to be disarranged there be however queer smell of singed hair then saw odd looking crumpled mass clinging to front of big dynamo approaching recognised distorted remains of holroyd man stared hesitated moment then saw face shut eye convulsively turned on heel before opened so that must not see holroyd again went out of shed to get advice help when azuma zi saw holroyd die in grip of great dynamo have be little scared about consequence of act yet felt strangely elated knew that favour of lord dynamo be upon plan be already settled when met man coming from station scientific manager who speedily arrived on scene jumped at obvious conclusion of suicide expert scarcely noticed azuma zi except to ask few question did see holroyd kill azuma zi explained have be out of sight at engine furnace until heard difference in noise from dynamo be not difficult examination being untinctured by suspicion distorted remains of holroyd electrician removed from machine be hastily covered by porter with coffee stained table cloth somebody by happy inspiration fetched medical man expert be chiefly anxious to get machine at work again for seven eight train have stopped midway in stuffy tunnel of electric railway azuma zi answering misunderstanding question of people who have by authority impudence come into shed be presently sent back to stoke hole by scientific manager of course crowd collected outside gate of yarda crowd for known reason always hovers for day two near scene of sudden death in london two three reporter percolated somehow into engine shed one even got to azuma zi scientific expert cleared out again being amateur journalist presently body be carried away public interest departed with azuma zi remained very quietly at furnace seeing over over again in coal figure wriggled violently became still hour after murder to one coming into shed must have looked exactly a if nothing remarkable have ever happened there peeping presently from engine room black saw lord dynamo spin whirl beside little brother driving wheel be beating round steam in piston went thud thud exactly a have be earlier in evening after from mechanical point of view have be most insignificant incidentthe mere temporary deflection of current now slender form slender shadow of scientific manager replaced sturdy outline of holroyd travelling up down lane of light upon vibrating floor under strap between engine dynamo have not served lord said azuma zi inaudibly from shadow note of great dynamo rang out full clear a looked at big whirling mechanism strange fascination of have be little in abeyance since holroyds death resumed sway never have azuma zi seen man killed so swiftly pitilessly big humming machine have slain victim without wavering for second from steady beating be indeed mighty god unconscious scientific manager stood with back to scribbling on piece of paper shadow lay at foot of monster be lord dynamo still hungry servant be ready azuma zi made stealthy step forward then stopped scientific manager suddenly stopped writing walked down shed to endmost of dynamo began to examine brush azuma zi hesitated then slipped across noiselessly into shadow by switch there waited presently manager footstep must be heard returning stopped in old position unconscious of stoker crouching ten foot away from then big dynamo suddenly fizzled in moment azuma zi have sprung out of darkness upon first scientific manager be gripped round body swung towards big dynamo then kicking with knee forcing antagonist head down with hand loosened grip on waist swung round away from machine then black grasped again putting curly head against chest swayed panted a seemed for age so then scientific manager be impelled to catch black ear in teeth bite furiously black yelled hideously rolled over on floor black who have apparently slipped from vice of teeth parted with earthe scientific manager wondered at timetried to throttle scientific manager be making ineffectual effort to claw something with hand to kick when welcome sound of quick footstep sounded on floor next moment azuma zi have left darted towards big dynamo there be splutter amid roar officer of company who have entered stood staring a azuma zi caught naked terminal in hand gave one horrible convulsion then hung motionless from machine face violently distorted im jolly glad came in when did said scientific manager still sitting on floor looked at still quivering figure be not nice death to die apparentlybut be quick official be still staring at body be man of slow apprehension there be pause scientific manager got up on foot rather awkwardly ran finger along collar thoughtfully moved head to fro several time poor holroyd see now then almost mechanically went towards switch in shadow turned current into railway circuit again a did so singed body loosened grip upon machine fell forward on face cone of dynamo roared out loud clear armature beat air so ended prematurely worship of dynamo deity perhaps most short lived of religion yet withal must boast martyrdom human sacrifice treasure in forest canoe be now approaching land bay opened out gap in white surf of reef marked where little river ran out to sea thicker deeper green of virgin forest showed course down distant hill slope forest here came close to beach far beyond dim almost cloudlike in texture rose mountain like suddenly frozen wave sea be still save for almost imperceptible swell sky blazed man with carved paddle stopped must be somewhere here said shipped paddle held arm out straight before other man have be in fore part of canoe closely scrutinising land have sheet of yellow paper on knee come look at evans said men spoke in low tone lip be hard dry man called evans came swaying along canoe until must look over companion shoulder paper have appearance of rough map by much folding be creased worn to pitch of separation second man held discoloured fragment together where have parted on one must dimly make out in almost obliterated pencil outline of bay here said evans be reef here be gap ran thumb nail over chart curved twisting line be riveri must do with drink nowand star be place see dotted line said man with map be straight line run from opening of reef to clump of palm tree star come just where cut river must mark place a go into lagoon queer said evans after pause what little mark down here be for look like plan of house something what little dash pointing way may mean cant get notion whats writing chinese said man with map of course be chinee said evans be said man with map sat for minute staring at land while canoe drifted slowly then evans looked towards paddle turn with paddle now hooker said companion quietly folded up map put in pocket passed evans carefully began to paddle movement be languid like of man whose strength be nearly exhausted evans sat with eye half closed watching frothy breakwater of coral creep nearer sky be like furnace now for sun be near zenith though be so near treasure did not feel exaltation have anticipated intense excitement of struggle for plan long night voyage from mainland in unprovisioned canoe have to use own expression taken out of tried to arouse by directing mind to ingot chinaman have spoken of must not rest there came back headlong to thought of sweet water rippling in river to almost unendurable dryness of lip throat rhythmic wash of sea upon reef be becoming audible now have pleasant sound in ear water washed along side of canoe paddle dripped between stroke presently began to doze be still dimly conscious of island queer dream texture interwove with sensation once again be night when hooker have hit upon chinaman secret saw moonlit tree little fire burning black figure of three chinamensilvered on one side by moonlight on other glowing from firelightand heard talking together in pigeon englishfor came from different province hooker have caught drift of talk first have motioned to to listen fragment of conversation be inaudible fragment incomprehensible spanish galleon from philippine hopelessly aground treasure buried against day of return lay in background of story shipwrecked crew thinned by disease quarrel so need of discipline at last taking to boat never to be heard of again then chang hi only year since wandering ashore have happened upon ingot hidden for two hundred year have deserted junk reburied with infinite toil single handed very safe laid great stress on safetyit be secret of now wanted help to return exhume presently little map fluttered voice sank fine story for two stranded british wastrel to hear evans dream shifted to moment when have chang pigtail in hand life of chinaman be scarcely sacred like european cunning little face of chang hi first keen furious like startled snake then fearful treacherous pitiful became overwhelmingly prominent in dream at end chang hi have grinned most incomprehensible startling grin abruptly thing became very unpleasant a will do at time in dream chang hi gibbered threatened saw in dream heap heap of gold chang hi intervening struggling to hold back from took chang hi by pigtailhow big yellow brute be how struggled grinned kept growing bigger too then bright heap of gold turned to roaring furnace vast devil surprisingly like chang hi with huge black tail began to feed with coal burnt mouth horribly devil be shouting name evans evans sleepy foolor be hooker woke up be in mouth of lagoon there be three palm tree must be in line with clump of bush said companion mark that if go to bush then strike into bush in straight line from here will come to when come to stream must see now where mouth of stream opened out at sight of evans revived hurry up man said by heaven will have to drink sea water gnawed hand stared at gleam of silver among rock green tangle presently turned almost fiercely upon hooker give paddle said so reached river mouth little way up hooker took water in hollow of hand tasted spat out little further tried again will do said began drinking eagerly curse said evans suddenly too slow leaning dangerously over fore part of canoe began to suck up water with lip presently made end of drinking running canoe into little creek be about to land among thick growth that overhung water will have to scramble through to beach to find bush get line to place said evans have better paddle round said hooker so pushed out again into river paddled back down to sea along shore to place where clump of bush grew here landed pulled light canoe far up beach then went up towards edge of jungle until must see opening of reef bush in straight line evans have taken native implement out of canoe be l shaped transverse piece be armed with polished stone hooker carried paddle be straight now in direction said must push through till strike stream then must prospect pushed through close tangle of reed broad frond young tree at first be toilsome going very speedily tree became larger ground beneath opened out blaze of sunlight be replaced by insensible degree by cool tree became at last vast pillar rose up to canopy of greenery far overhead dim white flower hung from stem ropy creeper swung from tree to tree shadow deepened on ground blotched fungi red brown incrustation became frequent evans shivered seems almost cold here after blaze outside hope be keeping to straight said hooker presently saw far ahead gap in sombre darkness where white shaft of hot sunlight smote into forest there also be brilliant green undergrowth coloured flower then heard rush of water here be river must be close to now said hooker vegetation be thick by river bank great plant a yet unnamed grew among root of big tree spread rosette of huge green fan towards strip of sky many flower creeper with shiny foliage clung to exposed stem on water of broad quiet pool treasure seeker now overlooked there floated big oval leaf waxen pinkish white flower not unlike water lily further a river bent away from water suddenly frothed became noisy in rapid well said evans have swerved little from straight said hooker be to be expected turned looked into dim cool shadow of silent forest behind if beat little way up down stream must come to something said began evans said there be heap of stone said two men looked at other for moment let try little down stream first said evans advanced slowly looking curiously about suddenly evans stopped what devil that said hooker followed finger something blue said have come into view a topped gentle swell of ground then began to distinguish what be advanced suddenly with hasty step until body belonged to limp hand arm have become visible grip tightened on implement carried thing be figure of chinaman lying on face abandon of pose be unmistakable two men drew closer together stood staring silently at ominous dead body lay in clear space among tree near by be spade after chinese pattern further off lay scattered heap of stone close to freshly dug hole somebody have be here before said hooker clearing throat then suddenly evans began to swear rave stamp upon ground hooker turned white said nothing advanced towards prostrate body saw neck be puffed purple hand ankle swollen pah said suddenly turned away went towards excavation gave cry of surprise shouted to evans who be following slowly fool right here still then turned again looked at dead chinaman then again at hole evans hurried to hole already half exposed by ill fated wretch beside lay number of dull yellow bar bent down in hole clearing off soil with bare hand hastily pulled one of heavy mass out a did so little thorn pricked hand pulled delicate spike out with finger lifted ingot only gold lead must weigh like said exultantly hooker be still looking at dead chinaman be puzzled stole march on friend said at last came here alone poisonous snake have killed himi wonder how found place evans stood with ingot in hand what did dead chinaman signify will have to take stuff to mainland piecemeal bury there for while how will get to canoe took jacket off spread on ground flung two three ingot into presently found that little thorn have punctured skin be a much a can carry said then suddenly with queer rush of irritation what be staring at hooker turned to cant standhim nodded towards corpse so like rubbish said evans chinaman be alike hooker looked into face im going to bury anyhow before lend hand with stuff dont be fool hooker said evans let that mass of corruption bide hooker hesitated then eye went carefully over brown soil about scare somehow said thing be said evans what to do with ingot will re bury over here take across strait in canoe hooker thought puzzled gaze wandered among tall tree trunk up into remote sunlit greenery overhead shivered again a eye rested upon blue figure of chinaman stared searchingly among grey depth between tree whats come to hooker said evans have lost wit let get gold out of place anyhow said hooker took end of collar of coat in hand evans took opposite corner lifted mass way said evans to canoe queer said evans when have advanced only few step arm ache still with paddling curse said ache must rest let coat down evans face be white little drop of sweat stood out upon forehead stuffy somehow in forest then with abrupt transition to unreasonable anger what be good of waiting here day lend hand say have done nothing moon since saw dead chinaman hooker be looking steadfastly at companion face helped raise coat bearing ingot went forward perhaps hundred yard in silence evans began to breathe heavily cant speak said whats matter with said hooker evans stumbled then with sudden curse flung coat from stood for moment staring at hooker then with groan clutched at own throat dont come near said went leant against tree then in steadier voice ill be better in minute presently grip upon trunk loosened slipped slowly down stem of tree until be crumpled heap at foot hand be clenched convulsively face became distorted with pain hooker approached dont touch dont touch said evans in stifled voice put gold back on coat cant do anything for said hooker put gold back on coat a hooker handled ingot felt little prick on ball of thumb looked at hand saw slender thorn perhaps two inch in length evans gave inarticulate cry rolled over hooker jaw dropped stared at thorn for moment with dilated eye then looked at evans who be now crumpled together on ground back bending straitening spasmodically then looked through pillar of tree network of creeper stem to where in dim grey shadow blue clad body of chinaman be still indistinctly visible thought of little dash in corner of plan in moment understood god help said for thorn be similar to dyaks poison use in blowing tube understood now what chang assurance of safety of treasure meant understood that grin now evans cried evans be silent motionless now save for horrible spasmodic twitching of limb profound silence brooded over forest then hooker began to suck furiously at little pink spot on ball of thumbsucking for dear life presently felt strange aching pain in arm shoulder finger seemed difficult to bend then knew that sucking be good abruptly stopped sitting down by pile of ingot resting chin upon hand elbow upon knee stared at distorted still stirring body of companion chang grin came in mind again dull pain spread towards throat grew slowly in intensity far above faint breeze stirred greenery white petal of unknown flower came floating down through gloom end transcriber note
