instead of creaking became affected in flavour by progress petrol then young bert smallways got motor bicycle bert be necessary to explain be progressive smallways nothing speaks more eloquently of pitiless insistence of progress expansion in time than that must get into smallways blood there be something advanced enterprising about young smallways before be out of short frock be lost for whole

twenty one married jessica who be thirty have saved little money in service be not bert forte to be utilised hated digging when be given basket of stuff to deliver nomadic instinct arose irresistibly became pack did not seem to care how heavy be where took so long a did not take to destination glamour filled world strayed after basket so tom took good out sought employer for bert who did not know of strain of poetry in nature bert touched fringe of number of trade in succession draper porter chemist boy doctor page junior assistant gas fitter envelope addresser milk cart assistant golf caddie at last helper in bicycle shop here apparently found progressive quality nature have craved employer be pirate souled young man named grubb with black smeared face by day music hall side in evening who dreamt of patent lever chain seemed to bert that be perfect model of gentleman of spirit hired out quite dirtiest unsafest bicycle in whole south of england conducted subsequent discussion with astonishing verve bert settled down very well together bert lived in became almost trick rider must ride bicycle for mile must have come to piece instantly under took to washing face after business spent surplus money upon remarkable tie collar cigarette shorthand class at bun hill institute must go round to tom at time look talk so brilliantly that tom jessie who have natural tendency to be respectful to anybody anything looked up to immensely be go ahead chap be bert said tom know thing two let hope know too much said jessica who have fine sense of limitation be go ahead time said tom noo petaters english at will be having in march if thing go on a do go never see such time see tie last night be suited to tom be gentleman tie be up to not rest of be becoming then presently bert got cyclist suit cap badge to see grubb going down to brighton back head down handle bar down backbone curved be revelation in possibility of smallways blood go ahead time old smallways must sit over fire mumbling of greatness of other day of old sir peter who drove coach to brighton back in eight twenty hour of old sir peter white top hat of lady bone who never set foot to ground except to walk in garden of great prize fight at crawley talked of pink pig skin breech of fox at ring bottom where now county council pauper lunatic be enclosed of lady bone chintz crinoline nobody heeded world have thrown up new type of gentleman altogether gentleman of most ungentlemanly energy gentleman in dusty oilskin motor goggles wonderful cap stink making gentleman swift high class badger who fled perpetually along high road from dust stink perpetually made lady a be able to see at bun hill be weather bitten goddess a free from refinement a gipsy not so much dressed a packed for transit at high velocity so bert grew up filled with ideal of speed enterprise became so far a became anything kind of bicycle engineer of let have look at enamel chipping variety even road racer geared to hundred twenty failed to satisfy for time pined in vain at twenty mile hour along road be continually more dusty more crowded with mechanical traffic at last saving accumulated chance came hire purchase system bridged financial gap one bright memorable sunday morning wheeled new possession through shop into road got on to with advice assistance of grubb teuf teuffed off into haze of traffic tortured high road to add a one more voluntary public danger to amenity of south of england orf to brighton said old smallways regarding youngest son from sitting room window over green grocer shop with something between pride reprobation when be 'be age 'd never be to london never bin south of crawley never bin anywhere on own where must walk nobody did go not unless be gentry now body orf everywhere whole dratted country sims flying to piece wonder get back orf to brighton indeed anybody want to buy 'orses ca say bin to brighton father said tom want to go said jessica sharply creering about spendin ' money for time possibility of motor bicycle so occupied bert mind that remained regardless of new direction in striving soul of man be finding exercise refreshment failed to observe that type of motor car like type of bicycle be settling down losing adventurous quality indeed be a true a be remarkable that tom be first to observe new development gardening made attentive to heaven proximity of bun hill gas work crystal palace from ascent be continually being made presently descent of ballast upon potato conspired to bear in upon unwilling mind fact that goddess of change be turning disturbing attention to sky first great boom in aeronautics be beginning grubb bert heard of in music hall then be driven home to mind by cinematograph then bert imagination be stimulated by sixpenny edition of aeronautic classic mr george griffith clipper of cloud so thing really got hold of at first most obvious aspect be multiplication of balloon sky of bun hill began to be infested by balloon on wednesday saturday afternoon particularly must scarcely look skyward for quarter of hour without discovering balloon somewhere then one bright day bert motoring toward croydon be arrested by insurgence of huge bolster shaped monster from crystal palace ground obliged to dismount watch be like bolster with broken nose below comparatively small be stiff framework bearing man engine with screw whizzed round in front sort of canvas rudder behind framework have air of dragging reluctant gas cylinder after like brisk little terrier towing shy gas distended elephant into society combined monster certainly travelled steered went overhead perhaps thousand foot up bert heard engine sailed away southward vanished over hill reappeared little blue outline far off in east going now very fast before gentle south west gale returned above crystal palace tower circled round chose position for descent sank down out of sight bert sighed deeply turned to motor bicycle again be only beginning of succession of strange phenomenon in heaven cylinder cone pear shaped monster even at last thing of aluminium glittered wonderfully that grubb through confusion of idea about armour plate be inclined to consider war machine there followed actual flight however be not affair be visible from bun hill be something occurred in private ground other enclosed place under favourable condition be brought home to grubb bert smallways only by mean of magazine page of half penny newspaper by cinematograph record be brought home very insistently in day if ever one heard man saying in public place in loud reassuring confident tone be bound to come chance be ten to one be talking of flying bert got box lid wrote out in correct window ticket style grubb put in window inscription aeroplane made repaired quite upset tom seemed taking one shop so lightly most of neighbour sporting one approved of a being very good indeed everybody talked of flying everybody repeated over over again bound to come then know did come there be hitch flew be right flew in machine heavier than air smashed sometimes smashed engine sometimes smashed aeronaut usually smashed machine made flight of three four mile came down safely went up next time to headlong disaster there seemed possible trusting to breeze upset eddy near ground upset passing thought in mind of aeronaut upset also upset simply be betability ' doe 'em said grubb repeating newspaper pitch pitch till pitch to piece experiment fell away after two expectant year of sort of success public then newspaper tired of expensive photographic reproduction optimistic report perpetual sequence of triumph disaster silence flying slumped even ballooning fell away to extent though remained fairly popular sport continued to lift gravel from wharf of bun hill gas work drop upon deserving people lawn garden there be dozen reassuring year for tom at least so far a flying be concerned be great time of mono rail development anxiety be only diverted from high heaven by most urgent threat symptom of change in lower sky there have be talk of mono rail for several year real mischief began when brennan sprang gyroscopic mono rail car upon royal society be leading sensation of soiree celebrated demonstration room be too small for exhibition brave soldier leading zionist deserving novelist noble lady congested narrow passage thrust distinguished elbow into rib world must not willingly let break deeming fortunate if must see just little bit of rail inaudible convincing great inventor expounded discovery sent obedient little model of train of future up gradient round curve across sagging wire ran along single rail on single wheel simple sufficient stopped reversed stood still balancing perfectly maintained astounding equilibrium amidst thunder of applause audience dispersed at last discussing how far must enjoy crossing abyss on wire cable suppose gyroscope stopped few of anticipated tithe of what brennan mono rail must do for railway security face of world in few year realised better in little while one thought anything of crossing abyss on wire mono rail be superseding tram line railway indeed form of track for mechanical locomotion where land be cheap rail ran along ground where be dear rail lifted up on iron standard passed overhead swift convenient car went everywhere did everything have once be done along made track upon ground when old smallways died tom must think of nothing more striking to say of than when be boy there be nothing higher than chimbleys there be wire cable in sky old smallways went to grave under intricate network of wire cable for bun hill became not only sort of minor centre of power distribution home county power distribution company set up transformer generating station close beside old gas work also junction on suburban mono rail system moreover tradesman in place indeed nearly house have own telephone mono rail cable standard became striking fact in urban landscape for most part stout iron erection rather like tapering trestle painted bright bluish green one happened bestrode tom house looked still more retiring apologetic beneath immensity giant stood just inside corner of garden be still not built upon unchanged except for couple of advertisement board one recommending two sixpenny watch one nerve restorer by bye be placed almost horizontally to catch eye of passing mono rail passenger above so served admirably to roof over tool shed mushroom shed for tom day night fast car from brighton hastings went murmuring by overhead long broad comfortable looking car be brightly lit after dusk a flew by at night transient flare of light rumbling sound of passage kept up perpetual summer lightning thunderstorm in street below presently english channel be bridged series of great iron eiffel tower pillar carrying mono rail cable at height of hundred fifty foot above water except near middle where rose higher to allow passage of london antwerp shipping hamburg america liner then heavy motor car began to run about on only couple of wheel one behind other for reason upset tom dreadfully made gloomy for day after first one passed shop gyroscopic mono rail development naturally absorbed vast amount of public attention there be also huge excitement consequent upon amazing gold discovery off coast of anglesea made by submarine prospector miss patricia giddy have taken degree in geology mineralogy in university of london while working upon auriferous rock of north wale after brief holiday spent in agitating for woman suffrage have be struck by possibility of reef cropping up again under water have set to verify supposition by use of submarine crawler invented by doctor alberto cassini by happy mingling of reasoning intuition peculiar to sex found gold at first descent emerged after three hour submersion with about two hundredweight of ore containing gold in unparalleled quantity of seventeen ounce to ton whole story of submarine mining intensely interesting a be must be told at other time suffice now to remark simply that be during consequent great rise of price confidence enterprise that revival of interest in flying occurred be curious how revival began be like coming of breeze on quiet day nothing started came people began to talk of flying with air of never having for one moment dropped subject picture of flying flying machine returned to newspaper article allusion increased multiplied in serious magazine people asked in mono rail train when be going to fly new crop of inventor sprang up in night so like fungi aero club announced project of great flying exhibition in large area of ground that removal of slum in whitechapel have rendered available advancing wave soon produced sympathetic ripple in bun hill establishment grubb routed out flying machine model again tried in yard behind shop got kind of flight out of broke seventeen pane of glass nine flower pot in greenhouse occupied next yard one then springing from nowhere sustained one knew not how came persistent disturbing rumour that problem have be solved that secret be known bert met one early closing afternoon a refreshed in inn near nutfield motor bicycle have brought there smoked meditated person in khaki engineer who presently took interest in bert machine be sturdy piece of apparatus have acquired kind of documentary value in quick changing time be now nearly eight year old point discussed soldier broke into new topic with next going to be aeroplane so far a can see have have enough of road way tork said bert talk do said soldier thing coming keep on coming said bert will believe when see wo be long said soldier conversation seemed degenerating into amiable wrangle of contradiction tell be flying soldier insisted see have seen said bert mean flap up smash up mean real safe steady controlled flying against wind good right ai seen that 'ave aldershot try to keep secret got right enough bet war office be going to be caught napping time bert incredulity be shaken asked question soldier expanded tell got nearly square mile fenced in sort of valley fence of barbed wire ten foot high inside that do thing chap about camp now then get peep be only there be japanese bet got too german soldier stood with leg very wide apart filled pipe thoughtfully bert sat on low wall against motor bicycle be leaning funny thing fighting will be said flying be going to break out said soldier when doe come when curtain doe go up tell will find one on stage busy such fighting too suppose read paper about sort of thing read bit said bert well have noticed what one might call remarkable case of disappearing inventor inventor who turn up in blaze of publicity fire off few successful experiment vanishes ca say 'ave said bert well 'ave anyhow get anybody come along who doe anything striking in line bet vanishes just go off quietly out of sight after bit hear anything more of 'em at see disappear gone address first oh be old story now there be wright brother out in america glided glided mile mile finally glided off stage why must be nineteen hundred four five vanished then there be people in ireland forget name everybody said must fly went ai dead that have heard tell ca say be alive not feather of 'em can see then that chap who flew round paris upset in seine de booley be forget be grand fly in spite of accident where be got to accident did hurt eh ' e gone to cover soldier prepared to light pipe look like secret society got hold of said bert secret society naw soldier lit match drew secret society repeated with pipe between teeth match flaring in response to word war department be more like threw match aside walked to machine tell sir said there be big power in europe asia america africa have

unaccredited native ca get within four mile of lydd nowadays not to mention little circus at aldershot experimental camp in galway well said bert 'd like to see one of anyhow jest to help believing will believe when see that will promise will see fast enough said soldier led machine out into road left bert on wall grave pensive with cap on back of head cigarette smouldering in corner of mouth if what say be true said bert grubb be wasting blessed old time besides incurring expense with green 'ouse be while mysterious talk with soldier still stirred in bert smallways imagination that most astounding incident in whole of dramatic chapter of human history coming of flying occurred people talk glibly enough of epoch making event be epoch making event be unanticipated entirely successful flight of mr alfred butteridge from crystal palace to glasgow back in small businesslike looking machine heavier than air entirely manageable controllable machine must fly a well a pigeon be one felt fresh step forward in matter so much a giant stride leap mr butteridge remained in air altogether for about nine hour during time flew with ease assurance of bird machine be however neither bird like

transparent wing part including two peculiarly curved wing case if one may borrow figure from flying beetle remained expanded stiffly in middle be long rounded body like body of moth on mr butteridge must be seen sitting astride much a man bestrides horse wasp like resemblance be increased by fact that apparatus flew with deep booming hum exactly sound made by wasp at windowpane mr butteridge took world by surprise be one of gentleman from nowhere fate still succeeds in producing for stimulation of mankind came be variously said from australia america south of france be also described quite incorrectly a son of man who have amassed comfortable fortune in manufacture of gold nib butteridge fountain pen be entirely different strain of butteridges for year in spite of loud voice large

inadvisable in view of violent demand for sort of photograph impression of machine mr butteridge having once made demonstration intended to keep secret safe from further risk of leakage faced british public now with question whether wanted secret not be said perpetually imperial englishman first wish last be to see invention privilege monopoly of empire only be there difficulty began mr butteridge became evident be man singularly free from false modesty indeed from modesty of kind singularly willing to see interviewer answer question upon topic except aeronautics volunteer opinion criticism autobiography supply portrait photograph of generally spread personality across terrestrial sky published portrait insisted primarily upon immense black moustache secondarily upon fierceness behind moustache general impression upon public be that butteridge be small man one big be felt must have so virulently aggressive expression though a matter of fact butteridge have height of six foot two inch weight altogether proportionate to moreover have love affair of large unusual dimension irregular circumstance still largely decorous british public learnt with reluctance alarm that sympathetic treatment of affair be inseparable from exclusive acquisition of priceless secret of aerial stability by british empire exact particular of similarity never came to light apparently lady have in fit of high minded inadvertence have gone through ceremony of marriage with one quote unpublished discourse of mr butteridge white livered skunk zoological aberration did in legal vexatious manner mar social happiness wanted to talk about business to show splendour of nature in light of complication be really most embarrassing to press have always possessed considerable turn for reticence wanted thing personal indeed in modern fashion yet not too personal be embarrassing say to be inexorably confronted with mr butteridge great heart to see laid open in relentlesss self vivisection pulsating dissepiments adorned with emphatic flag label confronted be there be getting away from must make appalling viscus beat throb before shrinking journalist uncle with big watch little baby ever harped upon so relentlessly whatever evasion attempted set aside gloried in love said compelled to write down be of course private affair mr butteridge must object injustice sorr be public care be up against

lurve england puritanism sorr abhor fill with loathing raise gorge take own case insisted relentlessly upon heart upon seeing proof of interview if have not done justice to erotic bellowing gesticulation stuck in in large inky scrawl more than have omitted be strangely embarrassing thing for british journalism never be there more obvious uninteresting affair never have world heard story of erratic affection with le appetite sympathy on other hand be extremely curious about mr butteridge invention when mr butteridge must be deflected for moment from cause of lady championed then talked chiefly usually with tear of tenderness in voice about mother childhood mother who crowned complete encyclopedia of maternal virtue by being largely scotch be not quite neat nearly so owe everything in to mother asserted everything eh ask man who be done anything will hear same story have owe to woman be specie sorr man be dream come go woman soul leadeth upward on be always going on like what in particular wanted from government for secret did not appear what beyond money payment must be expected from modern state in such affair general effect upon judicious observer indeed be not that be treating for anything that be using unexampled opportunity to bellow show off to attentive world rumour of real identity spread abroad be said that have be landlord of ambiguous hotel in cape town have there given shelter to witnessed experiment finally stolen paper plan of extremely shy friendless young inventor named palliser who have come to south africa from england in advanced

mile in england like most have hedged little with ambiguous condition now offered resistance one two paid at once vehemently called attention to fact mr butteridge plunged into litigation with more recalcitrant while at same time sustaining vigorous agitation canvas to induce government to purchase invention one fact however remained permanent throughout development of affair behind butteridge preposterous love interest politics personality shouting boasting be so far a mass of people knew be in sole possession of secret of practicable aeroplane in for one must tell to contrary key of future empire of world resided presently to great consternation of innumerable people including among others mr bert smallways became apparent that negotiation be in progress for acquisition of precious secret by british government be in danger of falling through london daily requiem first voiced universal alarm published interview under terrific caption of mr butteridge speaks mind therein inventor if be inventor poured out heart came from end of earth said rather seemed to confirm cape town story bringing motherland secret must give empire of world what do get paused be sniffed at by

though danger to empire worry something frightful work will take off mind said jessica presently too be going out into world of change wonder bowed beneath load of potato patriotic insecurity merged at last into very definite irritation at weight want of style of potato very clear conception of entire detestableness of jessica chapter ii how bert smallways got into difficulty did not occur to tom bert smallways that remarkable aerial performance of mr butteridge be likely to affect of life in special manner that must in way single out from million about when have witnessed from crest of bun

roaring of gyroscopic motor car traversed high street in nature be contentious private grubb business be in difficulty grubb in moment of financial eloquence have given half share in to bert whose relation with employer have be for time unsalaried pallish informal bert be trying to impress tom with idea that reconstructed grubb smallways offered unprecedented unparalleled opportunity to judicious small investor be coming home to bert a though be entirely new fact that tom be singularly impervious to idea in end put financial issue on one side making thing entirely matter of fraternal affection succeeded in borrowing sovereign on security of word of honour firm of grubb smallways formerly grubb have indeed be singularly unlucky in last year so for many year business have struggled along with flavour of romantic insecurity in small dissolute looking shop in high street adorned with brilliantly coloured advertisement of cycle display of bell trouser clip oil can pump clip frame case wallet other accessory announcement of bicycle on hire repair free inflation petrol similar attraction be agent for several obscure make of bicycle two sample constituted stock occasionally effected sale also repaired puncture did best though luck be not always on side with other repairing be brought to handled line of cheap gramophone did little with musical box staple of business be however letting of bicycle on hire be singular trade obeying known commercial economic principle indeed principle there be stock of lady gentleman bicycle in state of disrepair pass description hiring stock be let to unexacting reckless people inexpert in thing of world at nominal rate of one shilling for first hour sixpence per hour afterwards really there be fixed price insistent boy must get bicycle thrill of danger for hour for so low sum a threepence provided must convince grubb that be have saddle handle bar be then sketchily adjusted by grubb deposit exacted except in case of familiar boy machine lubricated adventurer started upon career usually came back at time when accident be serious bert grubb have to go out fetch machine home hire be always charged up to hour of return to shop deducted from deposit be rare that bicycle started out from hand in state of pedantic efficiency romantic possibility of accident lurked in worn thread of screw adjusted saddle in precarious pedal in loose knit chain in handle bar above in brake tyre tapping clankings strange rhythmic creaking awoke a intrepid hirer pedalled out into country then perhaps bell must jam brake fail to act on hill seat pillar must get loose saddle drop three four inch with disconcerting bump loose rattling chain must jump cog of chain wheel a machine ran downhill so bring mechanism to abrupt disastrous stop without at same time arresting forward momentum of rider tyre must bang sigh quietly give up struggle for efficiency when hirer returned heated pedestrian grubb must ignore verbal complaint examine machine gravely ai 'ad fair usage used to begin became mild embodiment of spirit of reason ca expect bicycle to take up in arm carry used to say got to show intelligence after be machinery sometimes process of liquidating consequent claim bordered on violence be always very rhetorical often trying affair in progressive time have to make noise to get living be often hard work nevertheless hiring be fairly steady source of profit until one day pane in window door be broken stock on sale in window greatly damaged disordered by two over critical hirer with sense of rhetorical irrelevance be big coarse stoker from gravesend one be annoyed because left pedal have come off other because tyre have become deflated small indeed negligible accident by bun hill standard due entirely to ungentle handling of delicate machine entrusted to failed to see clearly how put in wrong by method of argument be poor way of convincing man that have let defective machine to throw foot pump about shop take stock of gong outside in order to return through window pane carried real conviction to mind of grubb bert only irritated vexed one quarrel make many unpleasantness led to violent dispute between grubb landlord upon moral aspect of legal responsibility for consequent re glazing in end grubb smallways be put to expense of strategic nocturnal removal to position be position have long considered be small shed like shop with plate glass window one room behind just at sharp bend in road at bottom of bun hill here struggled along bravely in spite of persistent annoyance from former landlord hoping for certain eventuality peculiar situation of shop seemed to promise here too be doomed to disappointment high road from london to brighton ran through bun hill be like british

inky blue sky above rippled veil of still thin sunlit cirrus below through one saw racing drift of rain cloud never glimpse of sea throb throb throb went engine long undulating wedge of airship hurried after flagship like flight of swan after leader save for quiver of engine be a noiseless a dream down there somewhere in wind rain gun roared shell crashed home after old manner of warfare men toiled died a afternoon wore on lower weather abated sea became intermittently visible again air fleet dropped slowly to middle air towards sunset have glimpse of disabled barbarossa far away to east smallways heard men hurrying along passage be drawn out to gallery where found nearly dozen officer collected scrutinising helpless ruin of battleship through field glass two other vessel stood by one exhausted petrol tank very high out of water other converted liner kurt be at end of gallery little apart from others gott said at last lowering binocular be like seeing old friend with nose cut off waiting to be finished der barbarossa with sudden impulse handed glass to bert who have peered beneath hand ignored by one seeing three ship merely a three brown black line upon sea never have bert seen like of magnified slightly hazy image before be not simply battered ironclad wallowed helpless be mangled ironclad seemed wonderful still floated powerful engine have be ruin in long chase of night have got out of line with consort nipped in between susquehanna kansa city discovered proximity dropped back until be nearly broadside on to former battleship signalled up theodore roosevelt little monitor a dawn broke have found hostess of circle fight have not lasted five minute before appearance of hermann to east immediately after of furst bismarck in west forced american to leave in time have smashed iron to rag have vented accumulated tension of hard day retreat upon a bert saw seemed mere metal worker fantasy of frozen metal writhings must not tell part from part of except by position gott murmured kurt taking glass bert restored to gott da waren albrecht der gute albrecht und der alte zimmermann und von rosen long after barbarosa have be swallowed up in twilight distance remained on gallery peering through glass when came back to cabin be unusually silent thoughtful be rough game smallways said at last war be rough game somehow one see different after thing like many men there be worked to make barbarossa there be men in one doe not meet like of day albrecht there be man named albrecht played zither improvised keep on wondering what have happened to be very close friend after german fashion smallways woke next night to discover cabin in darkness draught blowing through kurt talking to in german must see dimly by window have unscrewed opened peering down cold clear attenuated light be not so much light a going of darkness cast inky shadow so often herald dawn in high air be on face what be row said bert shut up said lieutenant ca hear into stillness came repeated heavy thud of gun one two pause then three in quick succession gaw said bert gun be instantly at lieutenant side airship be still very high sea below be masked by thin veil of cloud wind have fallen bert following kurt pointing finger saw dimly through colourless veil first red glow then quick red flash then at little distance from be seemed for while silent flash second after when one have ceased to expect came belated thud thud thud kurt spoke in german very quickly bugle call rang through airship kurt sprang to foot saying something in excited tone still using german went to door say what be up cried bert what be that lieutenant stopped for instant in doorway dark against light passage stay where be smallways keep there hing be going into action explained vanished bert heart began to beat rapidly felt poised over fighting vessel far below in moment be to drop like hawk striking bird gaw whispered at last in awestricken tone thud thud discovered far away second ruddy flare flashing gun back at first perceived difference on vaterland for must not account then realised that engine have slowed to almost inaudible beat stuck head out of window be tight fit saw in bleak air other airship slowed down to scarcely perceptible motion second bugle sounded be taken up faintly from ship to ship out went light fleet became dim dark bulk against intense blue sky still retained occasional star for long time hung for interminable time seemed to then began sound of air being pumped into balloonette slowly slowly vaterland sank down towards cloud craned neck must not see if rest of fleet be following overhang of gas chamber intervened there be something that stirred imagination deeply in stealthy noiseless descent obscurity deepened for time last fading star on horizon vanished felt cold presence of cloud then suddenly glow beneath assumed distinct outline became flame vaterland ceased to descend hung observant must seem unobserved just beneath drifting stratum of cloud thousand foot perhaps over battle below in night struggling naval battle retreat have entered upon new phase american have drawn together end of flying line skilfully dexterously until at last be column well to south of lax sweeping pursuit of german then in darkness before dawn have come about steamed northward in close order with idea of passing through german battle line falling upon flotilla be making for new york in support of german air fleet much have altered since first contact of fleet by time american admiral o'connor be fully informed of existence of airship be no longer vitally concerned for panama since submarine flotilla be reported arrived there from key west delaware abraham lincoln two powerful entirely modern ship be already at rio grande on pacific side of canal manoeuvre be however delayed by boiler explosion on board susquehanna dawn found ship in sight of indeed so close to bremen weimar that instantly engaged there be alternative to abandonment fleet engagement o'connor chose latter course be by mean hopeless fight german though much more numerous powerful than american be in dispersed line measuring nearly forty five mile from end to end there be many chance before must gather in for fight column of seven american must have ripped from end to end day broke dim overcast bremen weimar realised have to deal with more than susquehanna until whole column drew out from behind at distance of mile le bore down on be position of affair when vaterland appeared in sky red glow bert have seen through column of cloud came from luckless susquehanna lay almost immediately below burning fore aft still fighting two of gun steaming slowly southward bremen weimar hit in several place be going west by south away from american fleet headed by theodore roosevelt be crossing behind pounding in succession steaming in between big modern furst bismarck be coming up from west to bert however name of ship be unknown for considerable time indeed misled by direction in combatant be moving imagined german to be american american german saw what appeared to to be column of six battleship pursuing three others who be supported by newcomer until fact that bremen weimar be firing into susquehanna upset calculation then for time be hopelessly at loss noise of gun too confused no longer seemed to boom went whack whack whack whack faint flash made heart jump in anticipation of instant impact saw ironclad too not in profile a be accustomed to see ironclad in picture in plan curiously foreshortened for most part presented empty deck here there little knot of men sheltered behind steel bulwark long agitated nose of big gun jetting thin transparent flash broadside activity of quick firers be chief fact in bird eye view american being steam turbine ship have from two to four blast funnel german lay lower in water having explosive engine now for reason made unwonted muttering roar because of steam propulsion american ship be larger with more graceful outline saw foreshortened ship rolling considerably fighting gun over sea of huge low wave under cold explicit light of dawn whole spectacle waved slowly with long rhythmic rising beat of airship at first only vaterland of flying fleet appeared upon scene below hovered high over theodore roosevelt keeping pace with full speed of ship from ship must have be intermittently visible through drifting cloud rest of german fleet remained above cloud canopy at height of six seven thousand foot communicating with flagship by wireless telegraphy risking exposure to artillery below be doubtful at what particular time unlucky american realised presence of new factor in fight account now survives of experience have to imagine a well a can what must have be to battled strained sailor suddenly glancing upward to discover huge long silent shape overhead vaster than battleship trailing now from hinder quarter big german flag presently a sky cleared more of such ship appeared in blue through dissolving cloud more disdainfully free of gun armour flying fast to keep pace with running fight below from first to last gun be fired at vaterland only few rifle shot be mere adverse stroke of chance that have man killed aboard did take direct share in fight until end flew above doomed american fleet while prince by wireless telegraphy directed movement of consort meanwhile vogel stern preussen with dozen drachenflieger in tow went full speed ahead then dropped through cloud perhaps five mile ahead of american theodore roosevelt let fly at once with big gun in forward barbette shell burst far below vogel stern forthwith dozen single man drachenflieger be swooping down to make attack bert craning neck through cabin port hole saw whole of incident that first encounter of aeroplane ironclad saw queer german drachenflieger with wide flat wing square box shaped head wheeled body single man rider soar down air like flight of bird gaw said one to right pitched extravagantly shot steeply up into air burst with loud report flamed down into sea plunged nose forward into water seemed to fly to piece a hit wave saw little men on deck of theodore roosevelt below men foreshortened in plan into mere head foot running out preparing to shoot at others then foremost flying machine be rushing between bert american deck then bang came thunder of bomb flung neatly at forward barbette thin little crackling of rifle shot in reply whack whack whack went quick firing gun of american battery smash came answering shell from furst bismarck then second third flying machine passed between bert american ironclad dropping bomb also fourth rider hit by bullet reeled down dashed to piece exploded between shot torn funnel blowing apart bert have momentary glimpse of little black creature jumping from crumpling frame of flying machine hitting funnel falling limply to be instantly caught driven to nothingness by blaze rush of explosion smash came vast explosion in forward part of flagship huge piece of metalwork seemed to lift out of dump into sea dropping men leaving gap into prompt drachenflieger planted flaring bomb then for instant bert perceived only too clearly in growing pitiless light number of minute convulsively active animalculum scorched struggling in theodore roosevelt foaming wake what be not men surely not men drowning mangled little creature tore with clutching finger at bert soul oh gord cried oh gord almost whimpering looked again have gone black stem of andrew jackson little disfigured by sinking bremen last shot be parting water have swallowed into two neatly symmetrical wave for moment sheer blank horror blinded bert to destruction below then with immense rushing sound bearing a be straggling volley of crashing minor explosion on back susquehanna three mile more now to east blew up vanished abruptly in boiling steaming welter for moment nothing be to be seen tumbled water then there came belching up from below with immense gulping noise eructation of steam air petrol fragment of canvas woodwork men made distinct pause in fight seemed long pause to bert found looking for drachenflieger flattened ruin of one be floating abeam of monitor rest have passed dropping bomb down american column several be in water apparently uninjured three four be still in air coming round now in wide circle to return to mother airship american ironclad be no longer in column formation theodore roosevelt badly damaged have turned to southeast andrew jackson greatly battered uninjured in fighting part be passing between still fresh vigorous furst bismarck to intercept meet latter fire away to west hermann germanicus have appeared be coming into action in pause after susquehanna disaster bert became aware of trivial sound like noise of ill greased ill hung door fall ajar sound of men in furst bismarck cheering in pause in uproar too sun rose dark water became luminously blue torrent of golden light irradiated world came like sudden smile in scene of hate terror cloud veil have vanished a if by magic whole immensity of german air fleet be revealed in sky air fleet stooping now upon prey whack bang whack bang gun resumed ironclad be not built to fight zenith only hit american scored be few lucky chance in generally ineffectual rifle fire column be now badly broken susquehanna have gone theodore roosevelt have fallen astern out of line with forward gun disabled in heap of wreckage monitor be in grave trouble two have ceased fire altogether so have bremen weimar four ship lying within shot of other in involuntary truce with respective flag still displayed only four american ship now with andrew jackson leading kept to south easterly course furst bismarck hermann germanicus steamed parallel to drew ahead of fighting heavily vaterland rose slowly in air in preparation for concluding act of drama then falling into place one behind other string of dozen airship dropped with unhurrying swiftness down air in pursuit of american fleet kept at height of two thousand foot more until be over little in advance of rearmost ironclad then stooped swiftly down into fountain of bullet going just little faster than ship below pelted thinly protected deck with bomb until became sheet of detonating flame so airship passed one after other along american column a sought to keep up fight with furst bismarck hermann germanicus airship added to destruction confusion predecessor have made american gunfire ceased except for few heroic shot still steamed on obstinately unsubdued bloody battered wrathfully resistant spitting bullet at airship unmercifully pounded by german ironclad now bert have intermittent glimpse of between nearer bulk of airship assailed struck bert suddenly that whole battle be receding growing small le thunderously noisy vaterland be rising in air steadily silently until impact of gun no longer smote upon heart came to ear dulled by distance until four silenced ship to eastward be little distant thing be there four bert now must see only three of floating blackened smoking raft of ruin against sun bremen have two boat out theodore roosevelt be also dropping boat to where drift of minute object struggled rising falling on big broad atlantic wave vaterland be no longer following fight whole of hurrying tumult drove away to south eastward growing smaller le audible a passed one of airship lay on water burning remote monstrous fount of flame far in south west appeared first one then three other german ironclad hurrying in support of consort steadily vaterland soared air fleet soared with came round to head for new york battle became little thing far away incident before breakfast dwindled to string of dark shape one smoking yellow flare presently became mere indistinct smear upon vast horizon bright new day be at last altogether lost to sight so be that bert smallways saw first fight of airship last fight of strangest thing in whole history of war ironclad battleship began career with floating battery of emperor napoleon iii in crimean war lasted with enormous expenditure of human energy resource for seventy year in space of time world produced over twelve thousand five hundred of strange monster in school in type in series larger heavier more deadly than predecessor in turn be hailed a last birth of time most in turn be sold for old iron only about five per cent of ever fought in battle foundered went ashore broke up several rammed one by accident sank life of countless men be spent in service splendid genius patience of thousand of engineer inventor wealth material beyond estimating to account must put stunted starved life on land million of child sent to toil unduly innumerable opportunity of fine living undeveloped lost money have to be found for at cost be law of nation existence during strange time surely be weirdest most destructive wasteful megatheria in whole history of mechanical invention then cheap thing of gas basket work made end of altogether smiting out of sky never before have bert smallways seen pure destruction never have realised mischief waste of war startled mind rose to conception also be in life out of fierce torrent of sensation one impression rose became cardinal impression of men of theodore roosevelt who have struggled in water after explosion of first bomb gaw said at memory might 'ave be grubb suppose kick about get water in mouf suppose last long became anxious to see how kurt be affected by thing also perceived be hungry hesitated towards door of cabin peeped out into passage down forward near gangway to men mess stood little group of air sailor looking at something be hidden from in recess one of be in light diver costume bert have already seen in gas chamber turret be moved to walk along look at person more closely examine helmet carried under arm forgot about helmet when got to recess because there found lying on floor dead body of boy who have be killed by bullet from theodore roosevelt bert have not observed that bullet at have reached vaterland indeed imagined under fire must not understand for time what have killed lad one explained to boy lay just a have fallen died with jacket torn scorched shoulder blade smashed burst away from body left side of body ripped rent there be much blood sailor stood listening to man with helmet who made explanation pointed to round bullet hole in floor smash in panel of passage upon still vicious missile have spent residue of energy face be grave earnest be face of sober blond blue eyed men accustomed to obedience orderly life to whom waste wet painful thing have be comrade came almost a strangely a did to bert peal of wild laughter sounded down passage in direction of little gallery something spoke almost shouted in german in tone of exultation other voice at lower more respectful pitch replied der prinz said voice men became stiffer le natural down passage appeared group of figure lieutenant kurt walking in front carrying packet of paper stopped point blank when saw thing in recess ruddy face went white so said in surprise prince be following talking over shoulder to von winterfeld kapitan eh said to kurt stopping in mid sentence followed gesture of kurt hand glared at crumpled object in recess seemed to think for moment made slight careless gesture towards boy body turned to kapitan dispose of that said in german passed on finishing sentence to von winterfeld in same cheerful tone in have begun deep impression of helplessly drowning men that bert have brought from actual fight in atlantic mixed up inextricably with of lordly figure of prince karl albert gesturing aside dead body of vaterland sailor hitherto have rather liked idea of war a being jolly smashing exciting affair something like bank holiday rag on large scale on whole agreeable exhilarating now knew little better next day there be added to growing disillusionment third ugly impression trivial indeed to describe mere necessary everyday incident of state of war very distressing to urbanised imagination one writes urbanised to express distinctive gentleness of period be quite peculiar to crowded townsman of time different altogether from normal experience of preceding age that never saw anything killed never encountered save through mitigating medium of book picture fact of lethal violence that underlies life three time in existence three time only have bert seen dead human being have never assisted at killing of anything bigger than new born kitten incident gave third shock be execution of one of men on adler for carrying box of match case be flagrant one man have forgotten have upon when coming aboard ample notice have be given to one of gravity of offence notice appeared at numerous point over airship man defence be that have grown so used to notice have be so preoccupied with work that have applied to pleaded in defence what be indeed in military affair serious crime inadvertency be tried by captain sentence confirmed by wireless telegraphy by prince be decided to make death example to whole fleet german prince declared have crossed atlantic to go wool gathering in order that lesson in discipline obedience might be visible to one be determined not to electrocute drown hang offender accordingly air fleet came clustering round flagship like carp in pond at feeding time adler hung at zenith immediately alongside flagship whole crew of vaterland assembled upon hanging gallery crew of other airship manned air chamber be to say clambered up outer netting to upper side officer appeared upon machine gun platform bert thought altogether stupendous sight looking down a be upon entire fleet far off below two steamer on rippled blue water one british other flying american flag seemed minutest object marked scale be immensely distant bert stood on gallery curious to see execution uncomfortable because terrible blond prince be within dozen foot of glaring terribly with arm folded heel together in military fashion hung man from adler gave sixty foot of rope so that must hang dangle in sight of evil doer who might be hiding match contemplating kindred disobedience bert saw man standing living reluctant man doubt scared rebellious enough in heart outwardly erect obedient on lower gallery of adler about hundred yard away then have thrust overboard down fell hand foot extending until with jerk be at end of rope then ought to have died swung edifyingly instead more terrible thing happened head came right off down body went spinning to sea feeble grotesque fantastic with head racing in fall ugh said bert clutching rail before sympathetic grunt came from several of men beside so said prince stiffer sterner glared for second then turned to gang way up into airship for long time bert remained clinging to railing of gallery be almost physically sick with horror of trifling incident found far more dreadful than battle be indeed very degenerate latter day civilised person late afternoon kurt came into cabin found curled up on locker looking very white miserable kurt have also lost something of pristine freshness sea sick asked ought to reach new york evening there be good breeze coming up under tail then will see thing bert did not answer kurt opened out folding chair table rustled for time with map then fell thinking darkly roused presently looked at companion what be matter said nothing kurt stared threateningly what be matter saw kill chap saw that flying machine man hit funnel of big ironclad saw that dead chap in passage seen too much smashing killing lately be matter like did know war be sort of thing be civilian like like said kurt by jove have read about war when see be different be gettin ' giddy be gettin giddy did mind bit being up in balloon at first looking down floating over thing smashing up people be getting on nerve see will have to get off again kurt thought be not only one men be getting strung up flying be just flying naturally make one little swimmy in head at first a for killing have got to be blooded be be tame civilised men have got to get blooded suppose there be not dozen men on ship who have really seen bloodshed nice quiet law abiding german have be so far here be in for be bit squeamy now wait till have got hand in reflected everybody be getting bit strung up said turned again to map bert sat crumpled up in corner apparently heedless of for time kept silence what did prince want to go 'ang chap for asked bert suddenly be right said kurt be right quite right here be order plain a nose on face here be that fool going about with match gaw sha forget bit in 'urry said bert irrelevantly kurt did not answer be measuring distance from new york speculating wonder what american aeroplane be like said something like drachenflieger will know by time to morrow wonder what will know wonder suppose after put up fight rum sort of fight whistled softly mused presently fretted out of cabin later bert found in twilight upon swinging platform staring ahead speculating about thing might happen on morrow cloud veiled sea again long straggling wedge of air ship rising falling a flew

produce explanation shrill bell of airship be ringing to quarter have to go bert hesitated stepped thoughtfully into passage looking back at window a did so be knocked off foot at once by prince who be rushing headlong from cabin to central magazine bert have momentary impression of great figure of prince white with rage bristling with gigantic anger huge fist swinging blut und eisen cried prince a one who swears oh blut und one fell over bert something in manner of falling suggested von winterfeld one else paused kicked spitefully hard then be sitting up in passage rubbing freshly bruised cheek readjusting bandage still wore on head dem prince said bert indignant beyond measure ' e 'as menners of 'og stood up collected wit for minute then went slowly towards gangway of little gallery a

foreshortened humanity have dignity little man on pavement jumped comically doubt with terror a bomb fell beside then blinding flame squirted out in direction from point of impact little man who have jumped became for instant flash of fire vanished vanished absolutely people running out into road took preposterous clumsy leap then flopped down lay still with torn clothes smouldering into flame then piece of archway began to drop lower masonry of building to fall in with rumbling sound of coal being shot into cellar faint screaming reached bert then crowd of people ran out into street one man limping gesticulating awkwardly halted went back towards building falling mass of brick work hit sent sprawling to lie still crumpled where fell dust black smoke came pouring into street be presently shot with red flame in manner massacre of new york began be first of great city of scientific age to suffer by enormous power grotesque limitation of aerial warfare be wrecked a in previous century endless barbaric city have be bombarded because be at once too strong to be occupied too undisciplined proud to surrender in order to escape destruction given circumstance thing have to be done be impossible for prince to desist own defeated be impossible to subdue city except by largely destroying catastrophe be logical outcome of situation created by application of science to warfare be unavoidable that great city must be destroyed in spite of intense exasperation with dilemma prince sought to be moderate even in massacre tried to give memorable lesson with minimum waste of life minimum expenditure of explosive for night proposed only wrecking of broadway directed air fleet to move in column over route of thoroughfare dropping vaterland leading so bert smallways became participant in one of most cold blooded slaughter in world history in men who be neither excited except for remotest chance of bullet in danger poured death destruction upon home crowd below clung to frame of porthole a airship tossed swayed stared down through light rain now drove before wind into twilight street watching people running out of house watching building collapse fire begin a airship

amidst pitching oscillation of airship men about looked tired depressed few talked most be sullen thoughtful one two be air sick seemed to share peculiarly outcast feeling have followed murder of evening sense of land beneath outraged humanity grown more hostile than sea then news hit red faced sturdy man man with light eyelash scar appeared in doorway shouted something in german manifestly startled one bert felt shock of altered tone though must not understand word be said announcement be followed by pause then great outcry of question suggestion even air sick men flushed spoke for minute mess room be bedlam then a if be confirmation of news came shrill ringing of bell called men to post bert with pantomime suddenness found alone what be up said though partly guessed stayed only to gulp down remainder of soup then ran along swaying passage clutching tightly down ladder to little gallery weather hit like cold water squirted from hose airship engaged in new feat of atmospheric jiu jitsu drew blanket closer about clutching with one straining hand found tossing in wet twilight with nothing to be seen mist pouring past above airship be warm with light busy with movement of men going to quarter then abruptly light went out vaterland with bound twist strange writhings be fighting way up air have glimpse a vaterland rolled over of large building burning close below quivering acanthus of flame then saw indistinctly through driving weather airship wallowing along like porpoise also working up presently cloud swallowed again for time then came back to sight a dark whale like monster amidst streaming air be full of flapping piping of void gusty shout noise buffeted confused ever again attention became rigid blind deaf balancing clutching wow something fell past out of vast darkness above vanished into tumult below going obliquely downward be german drachenflieger thing be going so fast have instant apprehension of dark figure of aeronaut crouched together clutching at wheel might be manoeuvre looked like catastrophe gaw said bert pup pup pup went gun somewhere in mirk ahead suddenly quite horribly vaterland lurched bert sentinel be clinging to rail for dear life bang came vast impact out of zenith followed by huge roll about tumbled cloud flashed red lurid in response to flash unseen revealing immense gulf rail went right overhead be hanging loose in air holding on to for time bert whole mind being be given to clutching be going into cabin said a airship righted again brought back gallery floor to foot began to make way cautiously towards ladder whee wow cried a whole gallery reared up forward then plunged down like desperate horse crack bang bang bang then hard upon little rattle of shot bomb came about enveloping engulfing immense overwhelming quivering white blaze of lightning thunder clap be like bursting of world just for instant before explosion universe seemed to be standing still in shadowless glare be then saw american aeroplane saw in light of flash a thing altogether motionless even screw appeared still men be rigid doll for be so near must see men upon quite distinctly stern be tilting down whole machine be heeling over be of

below be threaded a be on lightning flash turned out of path a if to take that out from corner projecting point of huge wing everywhere little branching thorn tree of lightning be streaming like picture bert saw thing picture little blurred by thin veil of wind torn mist crash of thunder clap followed flash seemed part of so that be hard to say whether bert be rather deafened blinded in instant then darkness utter darkness heavy report thin small sound of voice went wailing downward into abyss below there followed upon thing long deep swaying of airship then bert began struggle to get back to cabin be drenched cold terrified beyond measure now more than little air sick seemed to that strength have gone out of knee hand that foot have become icily slippery over metal trod upon be because thin film of ice have frozen upon gallery never knew how long ascent of ladder back into airship took in dream afterwards when recalled that experience seemed to last for hour below above around be gulf monstrous gulf of howling wind eddy of dark whirling snowflake be protected from by little metal grating rail grating rail seemed madly infuriated with passionately eager to wrench off throw into tumult of space once have fancy that bullet tore by ear that cloud snowflake be lit by flash never even turned head to see what new assailant whirled past in void wanted to get into passage wanted to get into passage wanted to get into passage must arm by be clinging hold out must give way snap handful of hail smacked in face so for time be breathless nearly insensible hold tight bert renewed effort found with enormous sense of relief warmth in passage passage be behaving like dice box disposition be evidently to rattle about then throw out again hung on with convulsive clutch of instinct until passage lurched down ahead then must make short run cabin ward clutch again a fore end rose behold be in cabin snapped to door for time be not human being be case of air sickness wanted to get somewhere must fix that need clutch opened locker got inside among loose article sprawled there helplessly with head sometimes bumping one side sometimes other lid shut upon with click did not care then what be happening more did not care who fought who what bullet be fired explosion occurred did not care if presently be shot smashed to piece be full of feeble inarticulate rage despair foolery said one exhaustive comment on human enterprise adventure war chapter of accident have entangled foolery ugh included order of universe in comprehensive condemnation wished be dead saw nothing

did so rush swoop of wonderful night bird be lost upon heroic dash self sacrifice vaterland be rammed for moment hung on verge of destruction sinking swiftly with american aeroplane entangled with smashed propeller american trying to scramble aboard signified nothing to bert to conveyed simply a vehement swaying foolery when american airship dropped off at last with most of crew shot fallen bert in locker appreciated nothing that vaterland have taken hideous upward leap then came infinite relief incredibly blissful relief rolling pitching struggle ceased ceased instantly absolutely vaterland be no longer fighting gale smashed exploded engine throbbed more be disabled driving before wind a smoothly a balloon huge windspread tattered cloud of aerial wreckage to bert be no more than end of series of disagreeable sensation be not curious to know what have happened to airship what have happened to battle for long time lay waiting apprehensively for pitching tossing qualm to return so lying boxed up in locker presently fell asleep awoke tranquil very stuffy at same time very cold quite unable to recollect where must be head ached breath be suffocated have be dreaming confusedly of edna desert dervish of riding bicycle in extremely perilous manner through upper air amidst pyrotechnic display of cracker bengal light to great annoyance of sort of composite person made up of prince mr butteridge then for reason edna have begun to cry pitifully for other woke up with wet eye lash into ill ventilated darkness of locker must never see edna more never see edna more thought must be back in bedroom behind cycle shop at bottom of bun hill be sure vision have have of destruction of magnificent city city quite incredibly great splendid by mean of bomb be more than particularly vivid dream grubb called anxious to tell answering silence dull resonance of locker to voice supplementing stifling quality of air set going new train of idea lifted up hand foot met inflexible resistance be in coffin thought have be buried alive gave way at once to wild panic 'elp screamed drummed with foot kicked struggled let out let out for second struggled with intolerable horror then side of imagined coffin gave way be flying out into daylight then be rolling about on what seemed to be padded floor with kurt being punched sworn at lustily sat up head bandage have become loose got over one eye whipped whole thing off kurt be also sitting up yard away from pink a ever wrapped in blanket with aluminium diver helmet over knee staring at with severe expression rubbing downy unshaven chin be on slanting floor of crimson padding above be opening like long low cellar flap that bert by effort perceived to be cabin door in half inverted condition whole cabin have in fact turned on side what deuce do mean by smallways said kurt jumping out of locker when be certain have gone overboard with rest of where have be what be up asked bert end of airship be up most other thing be down be there battle there be who won have seen paper smallways left before finish got disabled unmanageable colleague consort mean be too busy most of to trouble about wind blew heaven know where wind be blowing blew right out of action at rate of eighty mile hour so gott what wind be what fight here be where in air smallways in air when get down on earth again sha know what to do with leg what be below canada to best of knowledge jolly bleak empty inhospitable country look why ai right way up kurt made answer for space last remember be seeing sort of flying machine in lightning flash said bert gaw be 'orrible gun going off thing explodin cloud 'ail pitching tossing got so scared desperate sick know how fight came off not bit of be up with squad in diver dress inside gas chamber with sheet of silk for caulking must see thing outside except lightning flash never saw one of american aeroplane just saw shot flicker through chamber sent off men for tear caught fire bit not much know be too wet so fire spluttered out before banged then one of infernal thing dropped out of air on rammed did feel felt everything said bert did notice particular smash must have be pretty desperate if meant slashed down on like knife simply ripped after gas chamber like gutting herring crumpled up engine screw most of engine dropped off a fell off 'd have grounded rest be sort of dangling just turned up nose to heaven stayed there eleven men rolled off from various point poor old winterfeld fell through door of prince cabin into chart room broke ankle also got electric

not on slippery partition be civilised man keep thinking of old albrecht barbarossa feel want wash kind word quiet home when look at know want wash gott stifled vehement yawn what cockney tadpole of ruffian look can get grub asked bert heaven know said kurt meditated upon bert for time so far a can judge smallways said prince will probably want to throw overboard next time think of certainly will if see after know came al ballast will have to lighten ship extensively pretty soon unless be prince will wake up presently start doing thing with tremendous vigour have taken fancy to be english strain in be rum little chap sha like seeing whizz down air 'd better make useful smallways think will requisition for squad will have to work know be infernally intelligent will have to hang about upside down bit still be best chance have sha carry passenger much farther trip fancy ballast go over board if want to ground precious soon be taken prisoner of war prince wo do anyhow will be game to last by mean of folding chair be still in place behind door got to window looked out in turn contemplated sparsely wooded country below with railway road only occasional sign of habitation then bugle sounded kurt interpreted a summons to food got through door clambered with difficulty up nearly vertical passage holding on desperately with toe finger tip to ventilating perforation in floor mess steward have found fireless heating arrangement intact there be hot cocoa for officer hot soup for men bert sense of queerness of experience be so keen that blotted out fear might have felt indeed be far more interested now than afraid seemed to have touched down to bottom of fear abandonment overnight be growing accustomed to idea that must probably be killed presently that strange voyage in air be in probability death journey human being can keep permanently afraid fear go at last to back of one mind accepted shelved done with squatted over soup sopping up with bread contemplated comrade be rather yellow dirty with four day beard grouped in tired unpremeditated manner of men on wreck talked little situation perplexed beyond suggestion of idea three have be hurt in pitching up of ship during fight one have bandaged bullet wound be incredible that little band of men have committed murder massacre on scale beyond precedent none of who squatted on sloping gas padded partition soup mug in hand seemed really guilty of anything of sort seemed really capable of hurting dog wantonly be so manifestly built for homely chalet on solid earth carefully tilled field blond wife cheery merrymaking red faced sturdy man with light eyelash who have brought first news of air battle to men mess have finished soup with expression of maternal solicitude be readjusting bandage of youngster whose arm have be sprained bert be crumbling last of bread into last of soup eking out a long a possible when suddenly became aware that one be looking at pair of foot be dangling across downturned open doorway kurt appeared squatted across hinge in mysterious way have shaved face smoothed down light golden hair looked extraordinarily cherubic der prinz said second pair of boot followed making wide magnificent gesture in attempt to feel door frame kurt guided to foothold prince shaved brushed beeswaxed clean big terrible slid down into position astride of door men bert also stood up saluted prince surveyed with gesture of man who site steed head of kapitan appeared beside then bert have terrible moment blue blaze of prince eye fell upon great finger pointed question be asked kurt intervened with explanation so said prince bert be disposed of then prince addressed men in short heroic sentence steadying on hinge with one hand waving other in fine variety of gesture what said bert must not tell perceived that demeanor changed back stiffened began to punctuate prince discourse with cry of approval at end leader burst into song men with ein feste burg ist unser gott chanted in deep strong tone with immense moral uplifting be glaringly inappropriate in damaged half overturned sinking airship have be disabled blown out of action after inflicting cruellest bombardment in world history be immensely stirring nevertheless bert be deeply moved must not sing of word of luther great hymn opened mouth emitted loud deep partially harmonious note far below deep chanting struck on ear of little camp of christianised half breed who be lumbering be breakfasting rushed out cheerfully quite prepared for second advent stared at shattered twisted vaterland driving before gale amazed beyond word in so many respect be like idea of second advent then again in so many respect be stared at passage awe stricken perplexed beyond power of word hymn ceased then after long interval voice came out of heaven vat id dis blace here galled vat made answer indeed did not understand though question repeated at last monster drove away northward over crest of pine wood be more seen fell into hot long disputation hymn ended prince leg dangled up passage again one be briskly prepared for heroic exertion triumphant act smallways cried kurt come here then bert under kurt direction have first experience of work of air sailor immediate task before captain of vaterland be very simple one have to keep afloat wind though have fallen from earlier violence be still blowing strongly enough to render grounding of so clumsy mass extremely dangerous even if have be desirable for prince to land in inhabited country so risk capture be necessary to keep airship up until wind fell then if possible to descend in lonely district of territory where there must be chance of repair rescue by searching consort in order to do weight have to be dropped kurt be detailed with dozen men to climb down among wreckage of deflated air chamber cut stuff clear portion by portion a airship sank so bert armed with sharp cutlas found clambering about upon netting four thousand foot up in air trying to understand kurt when spoke in english to divine when used german be giddy work not nearly so giddy a rather overnourished reader sitting in warm room might imagine bert found quite possible to look down contemplate wild sub arctic landscape below now devoid of sign of habitation land of rocky cliff cascade broad swirling desolate river of tree thicket grew more stunted scrubby a day wore on here there on hill be patch pocket of snow over worked hacking away at tough slippery oiled silk clinging stoutly to netting presently cleared dropped tangle of bent steel rod wire from frame big chunk of silk bladder be trying airship flew up at once a loose hamper parted seemed almost a though be dropping canada stuff spread out in air floated down hit twisted up in nasty fashion on lip of gorge bert clung like frozen monkey to rope did not move muscle for five minute there be something very exhilarating found in dangerous work above thing else there be sense of fellowship be no longer isolated distrustful stranger among others have now common object with worked with friendly rivalry to get through with share before developed great respect affection for kurt have hitherto be only latent in kurt with job to direct be altogether admirable be resourceful helpful considerate swift seemed to be everywhere one forgot pinkness light cheerfulness of manner directly one have trouble be at hand with sound confident advice be like elder brother to men together cleared three considerable chunk of wreckage then bert be glad to clamber up into cabin again give place to second squad companion be given hot coffee indeed even gloved a be job have be cold one sat drinking regarding other with satisfaction one man spoke to bert amiably in german bert nodded smiled through kurt bert whose ankle be almost frozen succeeded in getting pair of top boot from one of disabled men in afternoon wind abated greatly small infrequent snowflake came drifting by snow also spread more abundantly below only tree be clump of pine spruce in lower valley kurt went with three men into still intact gas chamber let out certain quantity of gas from prepared series of ripping panel for descent also residue of bomb explosive in magazine be thrown overboard fell detonating loudly in wilderness below about four o'clock in afternoon upon wide rocky plain within sight of snow crested cliff vaterland ripped grounded be necessarily difficult violent affair for vaterland have not be planned for necessity of balloon captain got one panel ripped too soon others not soon enough dropped heavily bounced clumsily smashed hanging gallery into fore part mortally injuring von winterfeld then came down in collapsing heap after dragging for moment forward shield machine gun tumbled in upon thing below two men be hurt badly one got broken leg one be internally injured by flying rod wire bert be pinned for time under side when at last got clear must take view of situation great black eagle have started so splendidly from franconia six evening ago sprawled deflated over cabin of airship frost bitten rock of desolate place looked most unfortunate bird a though one have caught wrung neck cast aside several of crew of airship be standing about in silence contemplating wreckage empty wilderness into have fallen others be busy under imromptu tent made by empty gas chamber prince have gone little

telegraphist got answer to call then message came clear strong such news be say said bert at breakfast amidst great clamour tell bit de vorlt be at vor said linguist waving cocoa in illustrative

niagara dat be whad be telling china have cot drachenflieger luftschiffe beyont counting de vorlt be at vor gaw said bert yes said linguist drinking cocoa burnt up london 'ave like did new york be bombardment say anything about place called clapham bun hill do haf heard noding said linguist be bert must get for time excitement of men about be contagious presently saw kurt standing alone hand behind looking at one of distant waterfall very steadfastly went up saluted soldier fashion beg pardon lieutenant said kurt turned face be unusually grave that morning be just thinking must like to see that closer said reminds what do want ca make 'ead tail of what be saying sir must mind telling news damn news said kurt will get news enough before day out be end of world be sending graf zeppelin for will be here by morning ought to be at niagara eternal smash within eight forty hour want to look at waterfall 'd better come with have have ration yessir very well come musing profoundly kurt led way across rock towards distant waterfall for time bert walked behind in character of escort then a passed out of atmosphere of encampment kurt lagged for to come alongside will be back in in two day time said be devil of war to go back to be news world gone mad fleet beat american night got disabled be clear lost eleven eleven airship certain aeroplane got smashed god know how much smashed how many killed be only beginning start be like firing magazine country be hiding flying machine be fighting in air over europe over world japanese chinese have joined in be great fact be supreme fact have pounced into little quarrel yellow peril be peril after have got thousand of airship be over world bombarded london paris now french english have smashed up berlin now asia be at on top of be mania china on top know where to stop be limitless be last confusion be bombarding capital smashing up dockyard factory mine fleet did do much to london sir asked bert heaven know said more for time labrador seems quiet place resumed at last be mind to stay here ca do have got to see through have got to see through have got to too one why tell world gone to piece there be way out of way back here be be like mouse caught in house on fire be like cattle overtaken by flood presently will be picked up back will go into fighting will kill smash again perhaps be chino japanese air fleet time odds be against turn will come what will happen to know for know quite well will be killed will be right said bert after queer pause said kurt be going to be killed did know before morning at dawn knew a though 'd be told 'ow tell know 'ow must know know like being told like being certain know repeated for time walked in silence towards waterfall kurt wrapped in thought walked heedlessly at last broke out again have always felt young before smallways morning feel old old so old nearer to death than old men feel have always thought life be lark be sort of thing have always be happening suppose thing war earthquake sweep across decency of life be just a though have woke up to for first time night since be at new york have dreamt of be always be so be way of life people be torn away from people care for home be smashed creature full of life memory little peculiar gift be scalded smashed torn to piece starved spoilt london berlin san francisco think of human history ended in new york others go on again a though such thing be possible a went on like animal just like animal said nothing for long time then dropped out prince be lunatic came to place where have to climb then to long peat level beside rivulet there quantity of delicate little pink flower caught bert eye gaw said stooped to pick one in place like kurt stopped half turned face winced never see such flower said bert be so delicate pick more if want to said kurt bert did so while kurt stood watched funny 'ow one always want to pick flower said bert kurt have nothing to add to that went on again without talking for long time at last came to rocky hummock from view of waterfall opened out there kurt stopped seated on rock be a much a wanted to see explained be very like be like enough like what waterfall knew asked question abruptly got girl smallways funny thing said bert flower suppose be jes ' thinking of 'er so be what edna be thinking of edna have got ednas suppose for imagination to play about be girl be past for ever be hard to think ca see just for minute just let know be thinking of very likely said bert will see 'er right said kurt with decision know met went on in place like in alp engstlen alp there be waterfall rather like one broad waterfall down towards innertkirchen be why came here morning slipped away have half day together beside picked flower just such flower a picked same for know gentian know said bert edna done thing like flower seems year off now be beautiful daring shy mein gott can hardly hold for desire to see hear voice again before die where be look here smallways will write sort of letter there be portrait touched breast pocket will see 'er again all right said bert will never see again understand why people must meet just to be torn apart know will never meet again that know a surely a that sun will rise that cascade come shining over rock after be dead done oh be foolishness haste violence cruel folly stupidity blundering hate selfish ambition thing that men have done thing will ever do gott smallways what muddle confusion life have always be battle massacre disaster hate harsh act murder sweating lynching cheating morning be tired of a though 'd just found out for first time have found out when man be tired of life suppose be time for to die have lost heart death be over death be close to know have got to end think of hope have only little time ago sense of fine beginning be sham there be beginning be just ant in ant hill city in world doe matter go on ramble into nothingness new york new york doe even strike a horrible new york be nothing ant hill kicked to piece by fool think of smallways there be war everywhere be smashing up civilisation before have made sort of thing english did at alexandria japanese at port arthur french at casablanca be going on everywhere everywhere down in south america even be fighting among place be safe place be at peace there be place where woman daughter can hide be at peace war come through air bomb drop in night quiet people go out in morning see air fleet passing overhead dripping death dripping death chapter viii world at war be only very slowly that bert got hold of idea that whole world be at war that formed image at of crowded country south of arctic solitude stricken with terror dismay a new born aerial navy swept across sky be not used to thinking of world a whole a limitless hinterland of happening beyond range of immediate vision war in imagination be something source of news emotion happened in restricted area called seat of war now whole atmosphere be seat of war land cockpit so closely have nation raced along path of research invention so secret yet so parallel have be plan acquisition that be within few hour of launching of first fleet in franconia that asiatic armada beat west ward way across high above marvelling million in plain of ganges preparation of confederation of eastern asia have be on altogether more colossal scale than german with step said tan ting siang overtake pas west recover peace of world that barbarian have destroyed secrecy swiftness invention have far surpassed of german where german have have hundred men at work asiatic have ten thousand there came to great aeronautic park at chinsi fu tsingyen by mono rail that now laced whole surface of china limitless supply of skilled able workman workman far above average european in industrial efficiency news of german world surprise simply quickened effort at time of bombardment of new york be doubtful if german have three hundred airship together in world score of asiatic fleet flying east west south must have numbered several thousand moreover asiatic have real fighting flying machine niais a be called light quite efficient weapon infinitely superior to german drachenflieger like that be one man machine be built very lightly of steel cane chemical silk with transverse engine flapping sidewing aeronaut carried gun firing explosive bullet loaded with oxygen in addition true to best tradition of japan sword mostly be japanese be characteristic that from first be contemplated that aeronaut must be swordsman wing of flyer have bat like hook forward by be to cling to antagonist gas chamber while boarding light flying machine be carried with fleet also sent overland by sea to front with men be capable of flight of from two to five hundred mile according to wind so hard upon uprush of first german air fleet asiatic swarm took to atmosphere instantly organised government in world be frantically vehemently building airship approach to flying machine inventor have discovered there be time for diplomacy warning ultimatum be telegraphed to fro in few hour panic fierce world be openly at war at war in most complicated way for britain france italy have declared war upon germany outraged swiss neutrality india at sight of asiatic airship have broken into hindoo insurrection in bengal mohametan revolt hostile to in north west province latter spreading like wildfire from gobi to gold coast confederation of eastern asia have seized oil well of burmha be impartially attacking america germany in week be building airship in damascus cairo johannesburg australia new zealand be frantically equipping one unique terrifying aspect of development be swiftness with monster must be produced to build ironclad took from two to four year airship must be put together in a many week moreover compared with even torpedo boat airship be remarkably simple to construct given air chamber material engine gas plant design be really not more complicated far easier than ordinary wooden boat have be hundred year before now from cape horn to nova zembla from canton round to canton again there be factory workshop industrial resource german airship be barely in sight of atlantic water first asiatic fleet be scarcely reported from upper burmah before fantastic fabric of credit finance have held world together economically for hundred year strained snapped tornado of realisation swept through stock exchange in world bank stopped payment business shrank ceased factory ran on for day so by sort of inertia completing order of bankrupt extinguished customer then stopped new york bert smallways saw for glare of light traffic be in pit of economic financial collapse unparalleled in history flow of food supply be already little checked before world war have lasted two week by time be that mast be rigged in labrador there be not city town in world outside china however far from actual centre of destruction where police government be not adopting special emergency method to deal with want of food glut of unemployed people special peculiarity of aerial warfare be of such nature a to trend once have begun almost inevitably towards social disorganisation first of peculiarity be brought home to german in attack upon new york immense power of destruction airship have over thing below relative inability to occupy police guard garrison surrendered position necessarily in face of urban population in state of economic disorganisation infuriated starving led to violent destructive collision even where air fleet floated inactive above there must be civil conflict passionate disorder below nothing comparable to state of affair have be known in previous history of warfare unless take case a of nineteenth century warship attacking large savage barbaric settlement one of naval bombardment disfigure history of great britain in late eighteenth century then indeed there have be cruelty destruction faintly foreshadowed horror of aerial war moreover before twentieth century world have have one experience that comparatively light one in communist insurrection of paris of possibility of modern urban population under warlike stress second peculiarity of airship war a first came to world also made for social collapse be ineffectiveness of early air ship against other upon anything below must rain explosive in most deadly fashion fort ship city lay at mercy unless be prepared for suicidal grapple must do remarkably little mischief to other armament of huge german airship big a biggest mammoth liner afloat be one machine gun must easily have be packed up on couple of mule in addition when became evident that air must be fought for air sailor be provided with rifle with explosive bullet of oxygen inflammable substance airship at time ever carried a much in way of gun armour a smallest gunboat on navy list have be accustomed to do consequently when monster met in battle manoeuvred for upper place grappled fought like junk throwing grenade fighting hand to hand in entirely medieval fashion risk of collapse fall on side came near to balancing in case chance of victory a consequence after first experience of battle one find growing tendency on part of air fleet admiral to evade joining battle to seek rather moral advantage of destructive counter attack if airship be too ineffective early drachenflieger be either too unstable like german too light like japanese to produce immediately decisive result later be true brazilian launched flying machine of type scale be capable of dealing with airship built only three four operated only in south america vanished from history untraceably in time when world bankruptcy put stop to further engineering production on considerable scale third peculiarity of aerial warfare be that be at once enormously destructive entirely indecisive have unique feature that side lay open to punitive attack in previous form of war by land sea losing side be speedily unable to raid antagonist territory communication one fought on front behind front winner supply resource town factory capital peace of country be secure if war be naval one destroyed enemy battle fleet then blockaded port secured coaling station hunted down stray cruiser threatened port of commerce to blockade watch coastline be one thing to blockade watch whole surface of country be cruiser privateer be thing take long to make can not be packed up hidden carried unostentatiously from point to point in aerial war stronger side even supposing destroyed main battle fleet of weaker have then either to patrol watch destroy possible point at might produce perhaps novel more deadly form of flyer meant darkening air with airship meant building by thousand making aeronaut by hundred thousand small uninitated airship must be hidden in railway shed in village street in wood flying machine be even le conspicuous in air be street channel point where one can say of antagonist if want to reach capital must come by here in air direction lead everywhere consequently be impossible to end war by of established method having outnumbered overwhelmed b hovers thousand airship strong over capital threatening to bombard unless b submits b reply by wireless telegraphy that be now in act of bombarding chief manufacturing city of by mean of three raider airship denounces b raider a pirate so forth bombard b capital set off to hunt down b airship while b in state of passionate emotion heroic unconquerableness set to work amidst ruin making fresh airship explosive for benefit of war became perforce universal guerilla war war inextricably involving civilian home apparatus of social life aspect of aerial fighting took world by surprise there have be no foresight to deduce consequence if there have be world must have arranged for universal peace conference in mechanical invention have gone faster than intellectual social organisation world with silly old flag silly unmeaning tradition of nationality cheap newspaper cheaper passion imperialism base commercial motif habitual insincerity vulgarity race lie conflict be taken by surprise once war began there be stopping flimsy fabric of credit have grown with man foreseeing have held hundred of million in economic interdependence that man clearly understood dissolved in panic everywhere went airship dropping bomb destroying hope of rally everywhere below be economic catastrophe starving workless people rioting social disorder constructive guiding intelligence there have be among nation vanished in passionate stress of time such newspaper document history a survive from period tell one universal story of town city with food supply interrupted street congested with starving unemployed of crisis in administration state of siege of provisional government council of defence in case of india egypt insurrectionary committee taking charge of re arming of population of making of battery gun pit of vehement manufacture of airship flying machine one see thing in glimpse in illuminated moment a if through driving reek of cloud going on over world be dissolution of age be collapse of civilisation have trusted to machinery instrument of destruction be machine while collapse of previous great civilisation that of rome have be matter of century have be thing of phase phase like ageing dying of man like killing by railway motor car be one swift conclusive smashing end early battle of aerial war be doubt determined by attempt to realise old naval maxim to ascertain position of enemy fleet to destroy there be first battle of bernese oberland in italian french navigables in flank raid upon franconian park be assailed by swiss experimental squadron supported a day wore on by german airship then encounter of british winterhouse dunn aeroplane with three unfortunate german then came battle of north india in entire anglo indian aeronautic settlement establishment fought for three day against overwhelming odds be dispersed destroyed in detail simultaneously with beginning of commenced momentous struggle of german asiatic be usually known a battle of niagara because of objective of asiatic attack passed gradually into sporadic conflict over continent such german airship a escaped destruction in battle descended surrendered to american be re manned in end became series of pitiless heroic encounter between american savagely resolved to exterminate enemy continually reinforced army of invasion from asia quartered upon pacific slope supported by immense fleet from first war in america be fought with implacable bitterness quarter be asked prisoner be taken with ferocious magnificent energy american constructed launched ship after ship to battle perish against asiatic multitude other affair be subordinate to war whole population be presently living dying for presently a will tell white men found in butteridge machine weapon must meet fight flying machine of asiatic swordsman asiatic invasion of america completely effaced german american conflict vanishes from history at first have seemed to promise quite sufficient tragedy in beginning a did in unforgettable massacre after destruction of central new york america have risen like one man resolved to die thousand death rather than submit to germany german grimly resolved upon beating american into submission following out plan developed by prince have seized niagara in order to avail of enormous powerworks expelled inhabitant made desert of environs a far a buffalo have also directly great britain france declare war wrecked country upon canadian side for nearly ten mile inland began to bring up men material from fleet off east coast stringing out to fro like bee getting honey be then that asiatic force appeared be in attack upon german base at niagara that air fleet of east west first met greater issue became clear one conspicuous peculiarity of early aerial fighting arose from profound secrecy with airship have be prepared power have have dimmest inkling of scheme of rival even experiment with own device be limited by need of secrecy none of designer of airship aeroplane have known clearly what invention might have to fight many have not imagined must have to fight anything in air have planned only for dropping of explosive such have be german idea only weapon for fighting airship with franconian fleet have be provided be machine gun forward only after fight over new york be men given short rifle with detonating bullet theoretically drachenflieger be to have be fighting weapon be declared to be aerial torpedo boat aeronaut be supposed to swoop close to antagonist cast bomb a whirled past indeed contrivance be hopelessly unstable not one third in engagement succeeded in getting back to mother airship rest be either smashed up grounded allied chino japanese fleet made same distinction a german between airship fighting machine heavier than air type in case be entirely different from occidental model be eloquent of vigour with great people took up bettered european method of scientific research in almost particular invention of asiatic engineer chief among be worth remarking be mohini k chatterjee political exile who have formerly served in british indian aeronautic park at lahore german airship be fish shaped with blunted head asiatic airship be also fish shaped not so much on line of cod goby a of ray sole have wide flat underside unbroken by window opening except along middle line cabin occupied axis with sort of bridge deck above gas chamber gave whole affair shape of gipsy hooped tent except that be much flatter german airship be essentially navigable balloon very much lighter than air asiatic airship be very little lighter than air skimmed through with much greater velocity if with considerably le stability carried fore aft gun latter much larger throwing inflammatory shell in addition have nest for rifleman on upper under side light a armament be in comparison with smallest gunboat that ever sailed be sufficient for to outfight a well a outfly german monster airship in action flew to get behind over german even dashed underneath

to of who fought in monstrously confused battle above american great lake side went into action against knew not what under novel condition with apparatus even without hostile attack be capable of producing most disconcerting surprise scheme of action attempt at collective manoeuvring necessarily went to piece directly fight began just a did in almost early ironclad battle of previous century captain then have to fall back upon individual action own device one must see triumph in what read a cue for flight despair be a true of battle of niagara a of battle of lissa that be not battle bundle of battlettes to such spectator a bert presented a series of incident immense trivial collectively incoherent never have sense of plain issue joined of point struggled for won lost saw tremendous thing happen in end world darkened to disaster ruin saw battle from ground from prospect park from goat island whither fled manner in came to be on ground need explaining prince have resumed command of fleet through wireless telegraphy long before zeppelin have located encampment in labrador by direction german air fleet whose advance scout have be in contact with japanese over rocky mountain have concentrated upon niagara awaited arrival have rejoined command early in morning of twelfth bert have first prospect of gorge of niagara while be doing net drill outside middle gas chamber at sunrise zeppelin be flying very high at time far below saw water in gorge marbled with then away to west great crescent of canadian fall shining flickering foaming in level sunlight sending up deep incessant thudding rumble to sky air fleet be keeping station in enormous crescent with horn pointing south westward long array of shining monster with tail rotating slowly german ensign now trailing from belly aft of marconi pendant niagara city be still largely standing then albeit street be empty of life bridge be intact hotel restaurant still flying flag inviting sky sign power

slowly over scene twice while prince surveyed from swinging gallery then rose towards centre of crescent transferred prince suite kurt included to hohenzollern have be chosen a flagship during impending battle be swung up on small cable from forward gallery men of zeppelin manned outer netting a prince staff left zeppelin then came about circled down grounded in prospect park in order to land wounded take aboard explosive for have come to labrador with magazine empty being uncertain what weight might need to carry also replenished hydrogen in one of forward chamber have leaked bert be detailed a bearer helped carry wounded one by one into nearest of large hotel faced canadian shore hotel be quite empty except that there be two trained american nurse negro porter three four german awaiting bert went with zeppelin doctor into main street of place broke into drug shop obtained various thing of stood in need a returned found officer two men making rough inventory of available material in various store except for wide main street of town be quite deserted people have be given three hour to clear out everybody seemed have done so at one corner dead man lay against wall shot two three dog be visible up empty vista towards river end passage of string of mono rail car broke stillness silence be loaded with hose be passing to trainful of worker who be converting prospect park into airship dock bert pushed case of medicine balanced on bicycle taken from adjacent shop to hotel then be sent to load bomb into zeppelin magazine duty called for elaborate care from job be presently called off by captain of zeppelin who sent with note to officer in charge of anglo american power company for field telephone have still to be adjusted bert received instruction in german whose meaning guessed saluted took note not caring to betray ignorance of language started off with bright air of knowing way turned corner so be only beginning to suspect that did not know where be going when attention be recalled to sky by report of gun from hohenzollern celestial cheering looked up found view obstructed by house on side of street hesitated then curiosity took back towards bank of river here view be inconvenienced by tree be with start that discovered zeppelin knew have still quarter of magazine to fill be rising over goat island have not waited for complement of ammunition occurred to that be left behind ducked back among tree bush until felt secure from after thought on part of zeppelin captain then curiosity to see what german air fleet faced overcame drew at last halfway across bridge to goat island from point have nearly hemisphere of sky got first glimpse of asiatic airship low in sky above glittering tumult of upper rapid be far le impressive than german ship must not judge distance flew edgeways to so a to conceal broader aspect of bulk bert stood there in middle of bridge in place that most people who knew remembered a place populous with sightseer excursionist be only human being in sight there above very high in heaven contending air fleet manoeuvred below river seethed like sluice towards american fall be curiously dressed cheap blue serge trouser be thrust into german airship rubber boot on head wore aeronaut white cap be trifle too large for thrust that back to reveal staring little cockney face still scarred upon brow gaw whispered stared gesticulated once twice shouted applauded then at certain point terror seized took to heel in direction of goat island for time after be in sight of other fleet attempted to engage german numbered sixty seven great airship maintained crescent formation at height of nearly four thousand foot kept distance of about one half length so that horn of crescent be nearly thirty mile apart closely in tow of airship of extreme squadron on wing be about thirty drachenflieger ready manned be too small distant for bert to distinguish at first only what be called southern fleet of asiatic be visible to consisted of forty airship carrying together nearly four hundred one man flying machine upon flank for time flew slowly at minimum distance of perhaps dozen mile from german eastward across front at first bert must distinguish only greater bulk then perceived one man machine a multitude of very small object drifting like mote in sunshine about beneath larger shape bert saw nothing then of second fleet of asiatic though probably be coming into sight of german at time in north west air be very still sky almost without cloud german fleet have risen to immense height so that airship seemed no longer of considerable size end of crescent showed plainly a beat southward passed slowly between bert sunlight became black outline of drachenflieger appeared a little fleck of black on wing of aerial armada two fleet seemed in hurry to engage asiatic went far away into east quickening pace rising a did so then tailed out into long column came flying back rising towards german left squadron of latter came about facing oblique advance suddenly little flickerings faint crepitating sound told that have opened fire for time effect be visible to watcher on bridge then like handful of snowflake drachenflieger swooped to attack multitude of red speck whirled up to meet be to bert sense not only enormously remote singularly inhuman not four hour since have be on one of very airship yet seemed to now not gas bag carrying men strange sentient creature moved about did thing with purpose of own flight of asiatic german flying machine joined dropped earthward became like handful of white red rose petal flung from distant window grew larger until bert must see overturned one spinning through air be hidden by great volume of dark smoke be rising in direction of buffalo for time be hidden then two three white number of red one rose again into sky like swarm of big butterfly circled fighting drove away out of sight again towards east heavy report recalled bert eye to zenith behold great crescent have lost dressing burst into disorderly long cloud of airship one have dropped halfway down sky be flaming fore aft even a bert looked turned over fell spinning over over vanished into smoke of buffalo bert mouth opened shut clutched tighter on rail of bridge for moment seemed long moment two fleet remained without further change flying obliquely towards other making what came to bert ear a midget uproar then suddenly from side airship began dropping out of alignment smitten by missile must neither see trace string of asiatic ship swung round charged into over be difficult to say from below shattered line of german who seemed to open out to give way to sort of manoeuvring began bert must not grasp import left of battle became confused dance of airship for minute up there two crossing line of ship looked so close seemed like hand to hand scuffle in sky then broke up into group duel descent of german air ship towards lower sky increased one of flared down vanished far away in north two dropped with something twisted crippled in movement then group of antagonist came down from zenith in eddying conflict two asiatic against one german be presently joined by drove away eastward together with others dropping out of german line to join one asiatic rammed collided with still more gigantic german two went spinning to destruction together northern squadron of asiatic came into battle unnoted by bert except that multitude of ship above seemed presently increased in little while fight be utter confusion drifting on whole to southwest against wind became more more series of group encounter here huge german airship flamed earthward with dozen flat asiatic craft about crushing attempt to recover here hung with screw fighting off swordsman from swarm of flying machine here again asiatic aflame at end swooped out of battle attention went from incident to incident in vast clearness overhead conspicuous case of destruction caught held mind be only very slowly that sort of scheme manifested between nearer more striking episode mass of airship eddied remotely above be however neither destroying destroyed majority of seemed to be going at full speed circling upward for position exchanging ineffectual shot a did so very little ramming be essayed after first tragic downfall of rammer rammed what ever attempt at boarding be made be invisible to bert there seemed however steady attempt to isolate antagonist to cut off from fellow bear down causing perpetual sailing back interlacing of shoaling bulk greater number of asiatic swifter heeling movement gave effect of persistently attacking german overhead evidently endeavouring to keep in touch with work of niagara body of german airship drew together into compact phalanx asiatic became more more intent upon breaking up be grotesquely reminded of fish in fish pond struggling for crumb must see puny puff of smoke flash of bomb never sound came down to flapping shadow passed for moment between bert sun be followed by whirring of engine click clock clitter clock smote upon ear instantly forgot zenith perhaps hundred yard above water out of south riding like valkyrie swiftly through air on strange steed engineering of europe have begotten upon artistic inspiration of japan came long string of asiatic swordsman wing flapped jerkily click block clitter clock machine drove up spread ceased apparatus came soaring through air so rose fell rose again passed so closely overhead that bert must hear voice calling to one swooped towards niagara city landed one after in long line in clear space before hotel did not stay to watch land one yellow face have craned over looked at for one enigmatical instant met eye be then idea came to bert that be altogether too conspicuous in middle of bridge that took to heel towards goat island thence dodging about among tree with perhaps excessive self consciousness watched rest of struggle when bert sense of security be sufficiently restored for to watch battle again perceived that brisk little fight be in progress between asiatic aeronaut german engineer for possession of niagara city be first time in whole course of war that have seen anything resembling fighting a have studied in illustrated paper of youth seemed to almost a though thing be coming right saw men carrying rifle taking cover running briskly from point to point in loose attacking formation first batch of aeronaut have probably be under impression that city be deserted have grounded in open near prospect park approached house towards power work before be disillusioned by sudden fire have scattered back to cover of bank near water be too far for to reach machine again be lying firing at men in hotel frame house about power work then to support came second string of red flying machine driving up from east rose up out of haze above house came round in long curve a if surveying position below fire of german rose to roar one of soaring shape gave abrupt jerk backward fell among house others swooped down exactly like great bird upon roof of power house caught upon from sprang nimble little figure ran towards parapet other flapping bird shape came into affair bert have not seen coming staccato of shot came over to reminding of army manoeuvre of newspaper description of fight of be entirely correct in conception of warfare saw quite number of german running from outlying house towards power house two fell one lay still other wriggled made effort for time hotel be used a hospital to have helped carry wounded men from zeppelin earlier in day suddenly ran up geneva flag town have seemed so quiet have evidently be concealing considerable number of german be now concentrating to hold central power house wondered what ammunition might have more more of asiatic flying machine came into conflict have disposed of unfortunate german drachenflieger be now aiming at incipient aeronautic park electric gas generator repair station formed german base landed aeronaut took cover became energetic infantry soldier others hovered above fight men ever again firing shot down at chance exposure below firing came in paroxysm now there must be watchful lull now rapid tattoo of shot rising to roar once twice flying machine a circled warily came right overhead for time bert gave body soul to cowering ever again larger thunder mingled with rattle reminded of grapple of airship far above nearer fight held attention abruptly something dropped from zenith something like barrel huge football crash smashed with immense report have fallen among grounded asiatic aeroplane lay among turf flower bed near river flew in scrap fragment turf tree gravel leapt fell aeronaut still lying along canal bank be thrown about like sack catspaws flew across foaming water window of hotel hospital have be shiningly reflecting blue sky airship moment before became vast black star bang second followed bert looked up be filled with sense of number of monstrous body swooping down coming down on whole affair like flight of bellying blanket like string of vast dish cover central tangle of battle above be circling down a if to come into touch with power house fight got new effect of airship altogether a vast thing coming down upon growing swiftly larger larger more overwhelming until house over way seemed small american rapid narrow bridge flimsy combatant infinitesimal a came down became audible a complex of shooting vast creaking groanings beating throbbing shout shot fore shortened black eagle at fore end of german have effect of actual combat of flying feather of fighting airship came within five hundred foot of ground bert must see men on lower gallery of german firing rifle must see asiatic clinging to rope saw one man in aluminium diver gear fall flashing headlong into water above goat island for first time saw asiatic airship closely from aspect reminded more than anything else of colossal snowshoe have curious patterning in black white in form reminded of engine turned cover of watch have hanging gallery from little opening on middle line peeped out men muzzle of gun so driving in long descending ascending curve monster wrestled fought be like cloud fighting like pudding trying to assassinate other whirled circled about other for time threw goat island niagara into smoky twilight through sunlight smote in shaft beam spread closed spread grappled drove round over rapid two mile away more into canada back over fall again german caught fire whole crowd broke away from flare rose about dispersing leaving to drop towards canada blow up a dropped then with renewed uproar others closed again once from men in niagara city came sound like ant hill cheering german burnt one badly deflated by prow of antagonist flopped out of action southward became more more evident that german be getting worst of unequal fight more more obviously be being persecuted le le did seem to fight with object other than escape asiatic swept by above ripped bladder set alight picked off dimly seen men in diving clothes who struggled against fire tear with fire extinguisher silk ribbon in inner netting answered only with ineffectual shot thence battle circled back over niagara then suddenly german a if at preconcerted signal broke dispersed going east west north south in open confused flight asiatic a realised rose to fly above after only one little knot of four german perhaps dozen asiatic remained fighting about hohenzollern prince a circled in last attempt to save niagara round swooped once again over canadian fall over waste of water eastward until be distant small then round back hurrying bounding swooping towards one gaping spectator whole struggling mass approached very swiftly growing rapidly larger coming out black featureless against afternoon sun above blinding welter of upper rapid grew like storm cloud until once more darkened sky flat asiatic airship kept high above german behind fired unanswered bullet into gas chamber upon flank one man flying machine hovered alighted like swarm of attacking bee nearer came nearer filling lower heaven two of german swooped rose again hohenzollern have suffered too much for lifted weakly turned sharply a if to get out of battle burst into flame fore aft swept down to water splashed into obliquely rolled over over came down stream rolling smashing writhing like thing alive halting then coming on again with torn bent propeller still beating air bursting flame spluttered out again in cloud of steam be disaster gigantic in dimension lay across rapid like island like tall cliff tall cliff came rolling smoking crumpling collapsing advancing with sort of fluctuating rapidity upon bert one asiatic airship looked to bert from below like three hundred yard of pavement whirled back circled two three time over great overthrow dozen crimson flying machine danced for moment like great midge in sunlight before swept on after fellow rest of fight have already gone over island wild crescendo of shot yell smashing uproar be hidden from bert now by tree of island forgotten by in nearer spectacle of huge advance of defeated german airship something fell with mighty smashing splintering of bough unheeded behind seemed for time that hohenzollern must need break back upon parting of water then for time propeller flopped frothed in river thrust mass of buckling crumpled wreckage towards american shore then sweep of torrent foamed down to american fall caught in minute immense mass of deflating wreckage with flame spurting out in three new place have crashed against bridge joined goat island niagara city forced long arm a be in heaving tangle under central span then middle chamber blew up with loud report in moment bridge have given way main bulk of airship like grotesque cripple in rag staggered flapping waving flambeau to crest of fall hesitated there vanished in desperate suicidal leap detached fore end remained jammed against little island green island used to be called form stepping stone between mainland goat island patch of tree bert followed disaster from parting of water to bridge head then regardless of cover regardless of asiatic airship hovering like huge house roof without wall above suspension bridge sprinted along towards north came out for first time upon rocky point by luna island look sheer down upon american fall there stood breathless amidst that eternal rush of sound breathless staring far below travelling rapidly down gorge whirled something like huge empty sack for meant what did not mean german air fleet kurt prince europe thing stable familiar force have brought force have seemed indisputably victorious went down rapid like empty sack left visible world to asia to yellow people beyond christendom to be terrible strange remote over canada receded rest of conflict vanished beyond range of vision chapter ix on goat island whack of bullet on rock beside reminded that be visible object wearing at least portion of german uniform drove into tree again for time dodged dropped sought cover like chick hiding among reed from imaginary hawk beaten whispered beaten done for chinese yellow chap chasing at last came to rest in clump of bush near locked up deserted refreshment shed within view of american side made sort of hole harbour for met completely overhead looked across rapid firing have ceased now altogether everything seemed quiet asiatic aeroplane have moved from former position above suspension bridge be motionless now above niagara city shadowing district about power house have be scene of land fight monster have air of quiet assured predominance from stern trailed serene ornamental long streaming flag red black yellow of great alliance sunrise dragon beyond to east at much higher level hung second consort bert presently gathering courage wriggled out craned neck to find still airship against sunset in south gaw said beaten chased gawd fighting seemed at first be quite over in niagara city though german flag be still flying from one shattered house white sheet be hoisted above power house remained flying through event followed presently came sound of shot then german soldier running disappeared among house then came two engineer in blue shirt trouser hotly pursued by three japanese swordsman foremost of two fugitive be shapely man ran lightly well second be sturdy little man rather fat ran comically in leap bound with plump arm bent up by side head thrown back pursuer ran with uniform dark thin metal leather head dress little man stumbled bert gasped realising new horror in war foremost swordsman won three stride on be near enough to slash at miss a spurted dozen yard ran then swordsman slashed again bert must hear across water little sound like moo of elfin cow a fat little man fell forward slash went swordsman slash at something on ground tried to save with ineffectual hand oh car cried bert near blubbering staring with starting eye swordsman slashed fourth time went on a fellow came up after better runner hindmost swordsman stopped turned back have perceived movement perhaps at rate stood ever again slashed at fallen body oo oo groaned bert at slash shrank closer into bush became very still presently came sound of shot from town then everything be quiet everything even hospital saw presently little figure sheathing sword come out from house walk to debris of flying machine bomb have destroyed others appeared wheeling undamaged aeroplane upon wheel a men might wheel bicycle sprang into saddle flapped into air string of three airship appeared far away in east flew towards zenith one hung low above niagara city came still lower dropped rope ladder to pick up men from power house for long time watched further happening in niagara city a rabbit might watch meet saw men going from building to building to set fire to a presently realised heard series of dull detonation from wheel pit of power house similar business went on among work on canadian side meanwhile more more airship appeared many more flying machine until at last seemed to nearly third of asiatic fleet have re assembled watched from bush cramped immovable watched gather range signal pick up men until at last sailed away towards glowing sunset going to great asiatic rendez vous above oil well of cleveland dwindled passed away leaving alone so far a must tell only living man in world of ruin strange loneliness almost beyond describing watched recede vanish stood gaping after gaw said at last like one who rous from trance be far more than personal desolation extremity flooded soul seemed to indeed that must be sunset of race did not at first envisage own plight in definite comprehensible term thing happened to so much of late own effort have counted for so little that have become passive planless last scheme have be to go round coast of england a desert dervish giving refined entertainment to fellow creature fate have quashed that fate have seen fit to direct to other destiny have hurried from point to point dropped at last upon little wedge of rock between cataract did not instantly occur

lit cigarette sat meditative for time wonder where grubb be said do wonder that wonder if of 'em wonder about reverted to own circumstance dessay will 'ave to stop on island for time tried to feel at ease secure presently indefinable restlessness of social animal in solitude distressed began to want to look over shoulder a corrective roused to explore rest of island be only very slowly that began to realise peculiarity of position to perceive that breaking down of arch between green island mainland have cut off completely from world indeed be only when came back to where fore end of hohenzollern lay like stranded ship be contemplating shattered bridge that dawned upon even then came with sort of shock to mind fact among number of other extraordinary unmanageable fact stared at shattered cabin of hohenzollern widow garment of dishevelled silk for time without idea of containing living thing be so twisted smashed entirely upside down then for while gazed at evening sky cloud haze be now appearing not airship be in sight swallow flew by snapped invisible victim like dream repeated then for time rapid held mind roaring keep on roaring splashin ' always always keep on at last interest became personal wonder what ought to do now reflected not idee said be chiefly conscious that fortnight ago have be in bun hill with idea of travel in mind now be between fall of niagara amidst devastation ruin of greatest air fight in world that in interval have be across france belgium germany england ireland number of other country be interesting thought suitable for conversation of great practical utility wonder 'ow can get orf said wonder if there be way out if not rummy further reflection decided believe got in bit of 'ole coming over bridge any'ow got out of way of japanesy chap must 'ave taken long to cut froat still resolved to return to point of luna island for long time stood without stirring scrutinising canadian shore wreckage of hotel house fallen tree of victoria park pink now in light of sundown not human being be perceptible in scene of headlong destruction then came back to american side of island crossed close to crumpled aluminium wreckage of hohenzollern to green islet scrutinised hopeless breach in further bridge water boiled beneath towards buffalo there be still much smoke near position of niagara railway station house be burning vigorously everything be deserted now everything be still one little abandoned thing lay on transverse path between town road crumpled heap of clothes with sprawling limb 'ave look round said bert taking path ran through middle of island presently discovered wreckage of two asiatic aeroplane have fallen out of struggle ended hohenzollern with first found wreckage of aeronaut too machine have evidently dropped vertically be badly knocked about amidst lot of smashed branch in clump of tree bent broken wing shattered stay sprawled amidst new splintered wood forepeak stuck into ground aeronaut dangled weirdly head downward among leaf branch yard away bert only discovered a turned from aeroplane in dusky evening light stillness for sun have gone now wind have altogether fallen inverted yellow face be anything tranquilising object to discover suddenly couple of yard away broken branch have run clean through man thorax hung so stabbed looking limp absurd in hand still clutched with grip of death short light rifle for time bert stood very still inspecting thing then began to walk away from looking constantly back at presently in open glade came to stop gaw whispered don ' like dead body some'ow 'd almost rather that chap be alive must not go along path athwart chinaman hung felt must rather not have tree round more that must be more comfortable to be quite close to sociable splash uproar of rapid came upon second aeroplane in clear grassy space by side of streaming water seemed scarcely damaged at looked a though have floated down into position of rest lay on side with one wing in air there be aeronaut near dead alive there lay abandoned with water lapping about long tail bert remained little aloof from for long time looking into gathering shadow among tree in expectation of chinaman alive dead then very cautiously approached machine stood regarding widespread van big steering wheel empty saddle did not venture to touch wish that other chap be there said do wish e be there saw few yard away something bobbing about in eddy spun within projecting head of rock a went round seemed to draw unwillingly towards must be blow said bert be of 'em held told that be other aeronaut have be shot in fight fallen out of saddle a strove to land tried to go away then occurred to that might get branch something push rotating object out into stream must leave with only one dead body to worry about perhaps might get along with one hesitated then with certain emotion forced to do went towards bush cut wand returned to rock clambered out to corner between eddy stream by time sunset be over bat be abroad be wet with perspiration prodded floating blue clad thing with wand failed tried again successfully a came round a went out into stream turned over light gleamed on golden hair be kurt be kurt white dead very calm there be mistaking there be still plenty of light for that stream took seemed to compose in swift grip a one who stretch to rest white faced be now colour gone out of feeling of infinite distress swept over bert a body swept out of sight towards fall kurt cried kurt did mean to kurt don ' leave 'ere don leave loneliness desolation overwhelmed gave way stood on rock in evening light weeping wailing passionately like child be a though link have held to thing have broken gone be afraid like child in lonely room shamelessly afraid

be creeping halting creeping again towards through dim dark grass night be electrical with horror for time everything be still bert ceased to breathe must not be no be too small advanced suddenly upon with rush with little meawling cry tail erect rubbed head against purred be tiny skinny little kitten gaw pussy frightened said bert with drop of perspiration on brow sat with back to tree stump night holding kitten in arm mind be tired talked thought coherently no longer towards dawn dozed when awoke be stiff in better heart kitten slept warmly reassuringly inside jacket fear found have gone from amidst tree stroked kitten little creature woke up to excessive fondness purring want milk said bert be what want must do with bit of brekker too yawned stood up with kitten on shoulder stared about recalling circumstance of previous day grey immense happening mu ' do something said turned towards tree be presently contemplating dead aeronaut again kitten held companionably against neck body be horrible not nearly so horrible a have be at twilight now limb be limper gun have slipped to ground lay hidden in grass suppose ought to bury 'im kitty said bert looked helplessly at rocky soil about got to stay on island with 'im be time before must turn away go on towards that provision shed brekker first said anyhow stroking kitten on shoulder rubbed cheek affectionately with furry little face presently nibbled at ear wan milk eh said turned back on dead man a though mattered nothing be puzzled to find door of shed open though have closed latched very carefully overnight found also dirty plate have not noticed before on bench discovered that hinge of tin locker be unscrewed that must be opened have not observed overnight silly of said bert 'ere be puzzlin whackin ' away at padlock never noticing have be used apparently a ice chest contained nothing now remains of half dozen boiled chicken ambiguous substance might once have be butter singularly unappetising smell closed lid again carefully gave kitten milk in dirty plate sat watching busy little tongue for time then be moved to make inventory of provision there be six bottle of milk unopened one opened sixty bottle of mineral water large stock of syrup about two thousand cigarette upwards of hundred cigar nine orange two unopened tin of corned beef one opened five large tin california peach jotted down on piece of paper 'ai much solid food said still fortnight say anything might happen in fortnight gave kitten small second helping scrap of beef then went down with little creature running after tail erect in high spirit to look at remains of hohenzollern have shifted in night seemed on whole more firmly grounded on green island than before from eye went to shattered bridge then across to still desolation of niagara city nothing moved over there number of crow be busy with engineer have seen cut down on previous day saw dog heard one howling got to get out of some'ow kitty said that milk wo last forever not at rate lap regarded sluice like flood before plenty of water said wo be drink will want decided to make careful exploration of island presently came to locked gate labelled biddle stair clambered over to discover steep old wooden staircase leading down face of cliff amidst vast increasing uproar of water left kitten above descended discovered with thrill of hope path leading among rock at foot of roaring downrush of centre fall perhaps be sort of way led only to choking deafening experience of cave of wind after have spent quarter of hour in partially stupefied condition flattened between solid rock nearly a solid waterfall decided that be after practicable route to canada retraced step a reascended biddle stair heard what decided at last must be sort of echo sound of one walking about on gravel path above when got to top place be a solitary a before thence made way with kitten skirmishing along beside in grass to staircase led to lump of projecting rock enfiladed huge green majesty of horseshoe fall stood there for time in silence must think said at last there be so much water roarin splashin ' get on one nerve at last sound like people talking sound like people going about sound like anything fancy retired up staircase again s'pose will keep on goin ' round blessed island said drearily round round round found presently beside le damaged asiatic aeroplane again stared at kitten smelt broke said looked up with convulsive start advancing slowly towards out from among tree be two tall gaunt figure be blackened tattered bandaged hind most one limped have head swathed in white foremost one still carried a prince must do for that left arm be in sling one side of face scalded livid crimson be prince karl albert war lord german alexander man behind be bird faced man whose cabin have once be taken from given to bert with apparition began new phase of goat island in bert experience ceased to be solitary representative of humanity in vast violent incomprehensible universe became once more social creature man in world of other men for instant two be terrible then seemed sweet desirable a brother too be in scrape with marooned puzzled wanted extremely to hear exactly what have happened to what mattered if one be prince be foreign soldier if perhaps have adequate english native cockney freedom flowed too generously for to think of surely asiatic fleet have purged such trivial difference ul lo said 'ow did get 'ere be englishman who brought butteridge machine said bird faced officer in german then in tone of horror a bert advanced salute again louder salute gaw said bert stopped with second comment under breath stared saluted awkwardly became at once masked defensive thing with whom co operation be impossible for time two perfected modern aristocrat stood regarding difficult problem of anglo saxon citizen ambiguous citizen who obeying mysterious law in blood must neither drill be democrat bert be by mean beautiful object in inexplicable way looked resistant wore cheap suit of serge now showing many sign of wear loose fit made seem sturdier than be above disengaging face be white german cap be altogether too big for trouser be crumpled up leg end tucked into rubber highlows of deceased german aeronaut looked inferior though by mean easy inferior instinctively hated prince pointed to flying machine said something in broken english that bert took for german failed to understand intimated a much dummer kerl said bird faced officer from among bandage prince pointed again with undamaged hand verstehen dis drachenflieger bert began to comprehend situation regarded asiatic machine habit of bun hill returned to be foreign make said ambiguously two german consulted be expert said prince reckon to repair said bert in exact manner of grubb prince sought in vocabulary be dat said goot to fly bert reflected scratched cheek slowly got to look at replied be rough usage made sound with teeth have also acquired from grubb put hand in trouser pocket strolled back to machine typically grubb chewed something bert must chew only imaginatively three day work in said teething for first time dawned on that there be possibility in machine be evident that wing lay on ground be badly damaged three stay held rigid have snapped across ridge of rock there be also strong possibility of engine being badly damaged wing hook on side be also askew probably must not affect flight beyond there probably be much matter bert scratched cheek again contemplated broad sunlit waste of upper rapid might make job of leave to surveyed intently again prince officer watched in bun hill bert grubb have developed to very high pitch among hiring stock method of repair by substituting substituted bit of other machine machine be too utterly obviously done for even to proffer for hire have still capital value became sort of quarry for nut screw wheel bar spoke chain link like mine of ill fitting part to replace defect of machine still current back among tree be second asiatic aeroplane kitten caressed bert airship boot unheeded mend dat drachenflieger said prince if do mend said bert struck by new thought none of ai to be trusted to fly vill fly said prince very likely break neck said bert after pause prince did not understand disregarded what said pointed gloved finger to machine turned to bird faced officer with remark in german officer answered prince responded with sweeping gesture towards sky then spoke seemed eloquently bert watched guessed meaning much more likely to break neck said 'owever 'ere go began to pry about saddle engine of drachenflieger in search for tool also wanted black oily stuff for hand face for first rule in art of repairing a be known to firm of grubb smallways be to get hand face thoroughly conclusively blackened also took off jacket waistcoat put cap carefully to back of head in order to facilitate scratching prince officer seemed disposed to watch succeeded in making clear to that must inconvenience that have to puzzle out bit before must get to work thought over shop experience have given something of authoritative way of expert with common men at last went away thereupon went straight to second aeroplane got aeronaut gun ammunition hid in clump of nettle close at hand be right said bert then proceeded to careful inspection of debris of wing in tree then went back to first aeroplane to compare two bun hill method be quite possibly practicable if there be nothing hopeless incomprehensible in engine german returned presently to find already generously smutty touching testing knob screw lever with expression of profound sagacity when bird faced officer addressed remark to waved aside with nong comprong shut be good then have idea dead chap back there want burying said jerking thumb over shoulder with appearance of two men bert whole universe have changed again curtain fell before immense terrible desolation have overwhelmed be in world of three people minute human world nevertheless filled brain with eager speculation scheme cunning idea be thinking of what did think of did mean to do hundred busy thread interlaced in mind a pottered studiously over asiatic aeroplane new idea came up like bubble in soda water gaw said suddenly have just appreciated a special aspect of irrational injustice of fate that two men be alive kurt be dead crew of hohenzollern be shot burnt smashed drowned two lurking in padded forward cabin have escaped suppose e think be 'be bloomin star muttered found uncontrollably exasperated stood up facing round to two men be standing side by side regarding be good said starin ' at only put out then seeing did not understand advanced towards wrench in hand occurred to a did so that prince be really very big powerful serene looking person said nevertheless pointing through tree dead man bird faced man intervened with reply in german dead man said bert to there have great difficulty in inducing to inspect dead chinaman at last led to then made evident that proposed that a common person below rank of officer must have sole undivided privilege of disposing of body by dragging to water edge there be heated gesticulation at last bird faced officer abased to help together dragged limp now swollen asiatic through tree after rest so for trailed very heavily dumped into westward rapid bert returned to expert investigation of flying machine at last with aching arm in state of gloomy rebellion brasted cheek said one 'd think be one of 'be beastly german slave prancing beggar then fell speculating what must happen when flying machine be repaired if must be repaired two german went away again after reflection bert removed several nut resumed jacket vest pocketed nut tool hid set of tool from second aeroplane in fork of tree right o said a jumped down after last of precaution prince companion reappeared a returned to machine by water edge prince surveyed progress for time then went towards parting of water stood with folded arm gazing upstream in profound thought bird faced officer came up to bert heavy with sentence in english go said with helping gesture und eat when bert got to refreshment shed found food have vanished except one measured ration of corned beef three biscuit regarded with open eye mouth kitten appeared from under vendor seat with ingratiating purr of course said bert why where be milk accumulated wrath for moment so then seized plate in one hand biscuit in went in search of prince breathing vile word anent grub intimate interior approached without saluting said fiercely whad devil entirely unsatisfactory altercation followed bert expounded bun hill theory of relation of grub to efficiency in english bird faced man replied with point about nation discipline in german prince having made estimate of bert quality physique suddenly hectored gripped bert by shoulder shook making pocket rattle shouted something to flung struggling back hit a though be german private bert went back white scared resolved by cockney standard upon one thing be bound in honour to go for prince gaw gasped buttoning jacket now cried prince vil go then catching heroic gleam in bert eye drew sword bird faced officer intervened saying something in german pointing skyward far away in southwest appeared japanese airship coming fast toward conflict ended at that prince be first to grasp situation lead retreat three scuttled like rabbit for tree ran to for cover until found hollow in grass grew rank there squatted within six yard of one sat in place for long time up to neck in grass watching through branch for airship bert have dropped of corned beef found biscuit in hand ate quietly monster came nearly overhead then went away to niagara dropped beyond power work when be near kept silence then presently fell into argument be robbed perhaps of immediate explosive effect only by failure to understand one be bert began talking talked on regardless of what understood failed to understand voice must have conveyed cantankerous intention want that machine done said first better keep 'ands off disregarded repeated then expanded idea spirit of speech took hold of think got 'old of chap can kick 'it like do private soldier be jolly well mistaken see have 'ad about enough of antic be thinking over war empire rot of rot be be german made trouble in europe first last for nothin jest silly prancing jest because have got uniform flag 'ere be did want to 'ave anything to do with jest did care 'eng at about then get 'old of steal practically be thousand of mile away from 'ome everything silly fleet smashed up to rag want to go on prancin ' now not if ' know look at mischief done look at way smashed up new york people killed stuff wasted ca

lickin ' have give must be happy until did a say 'ere be bird faced officer shouted to to be quiet then began conversation with prince british citizen said bert ai obliged to listen ai obliged to shut up for time continued dissertation upon imperialism militarism international politics talking put out for time be certainly merely repeating abusive term prancin nincompoop like old term new then suddenly remembered essential grievance look 'ere 'ere thing started talk about be where food there be in shed be what want to know where put paused went on talking in german repeated question disregarded asked third time in manner insupportably aggressive there fell tense silence for second three regarded one prince eyed bert steadfastly bert quailed under eye slowly prince rose to foot bird faced officer jerked up beside bert remained squatting be quaiat said prince bert perceived be moment for eloquence two german regarded a crouched there death for moment seemed near then prince turned away two of went towards flying machine gaw whispered bert then uttered under breath one single word of abuse sat crouched together for perhaps three minute then sprang to foot went off towards chinese aeronaut gun hidden among weed there be pretence after moment that bert be under order of prince that be going on with repairing of flying machine two german took possession of set to work upon bert with new weapon went off to neighbourhood of terrapin rock there sat down to examine be short rifle with big cartridge nearly full magazine took out cartridge carefully then tried trigger fitting until felt sure have use of reloaded carefully then remembered be hungry went off gun under arm to hunt in about refreshment shed have sense to perceive that must not show with gun to prince companion so long a thought unarmed must leave alone there be knowing what napoleonic person might do if saw bert weapon also did not go near because knew that within boiled reservoir of rage fear that wanted to shoot two men wanted to shoot thought that to shoot must be quite horrible thing to do two side of inconsistent civilisation warred within near shed kitten turned up again obviously keen for milk greatly enhanced own angry sense of hunger began to talk a hunted about presently stood still shouting insult talked of war pride imperialism other prince must have died with men ship cried two german at machine heard voice going ever again amidst clamour of water eye met smiled slightly be disposed for time to sit in refreshment shed waiting for then occurred to that so might get at close quarter strolled off presently to point of luna island to think situation out have seemed comparatively simple one at first a turned over in mind possibility increased multiplied men have sword have revolver also if shot might never find food so far have be going about with gun under arm sense of lordly security in mind what if saw gun decided to ambush goat island be nearly cover tree rock thicket irregularity why not go murder now car said bert dismissing got to be worked up be mistake to get right away from that suddenly became clear ought to keep under observation ought to scout then must be able to see what be doing whether of have revolver where have hidden food must be better able to determine what meant to do to if did scout presently must begin to scout seemed so eminently reasonable that acted upon forthwith thought over costume threw collar tell tale aeronaut white cap into water far below turned coat collar up to hide gleam of dirty shirt tool nut in pocket be disposed to clank rearranged wrapped letter pocket handkerchief about started off circumspectly noiselessly listening peering at step a drew near antagonist much grunting creaking served to locate discovered engaged in what looked like wrestling match with asiatic flying machine coat be off sword laid aside be working magnificently apparently be turning round be having good deal of difficulty
