to be treated a protected state finally professed unconvincing submission put mass of obstacle in way of transfer of national official to new government in thing be enthusiastically supported by subject still for most part illiterate peasantry passionately if confusedly patriotic so far with practical knowledge of effect of atomic bomb more particularly retained control of balkan aeroplane for once extreme navet of leblanc seems to have be mitigated by duplicity went on with general pacification of world a if balkan submission be made in absolute good faith announced disbandment of force of aeroplane hitherto guarded council at brissago upon approaching fifteenth of july instead doubled number upon duty on eventful day made various arrangement for disposition consulted certain expert when took king egbert into confidence there be something in neat explicit foresight brought back to ex monarch mind half forgotten fantasy of leblanc a fisherman under green umbrella about five oclock in morning of seventeenth of july one of outer sentinel of brissago fleet be soaring unobtrusively over lower end of lake of garda sighted hailed strange aeroplane be flying westward failing to get satisfactory reply set wireless apparatus talking gave chase swarm of consort appeared very promptly over westward mountain before unknown aeroplane have sighted como have dozen eager attendant closing in upon driver seems to have hesitated dropped down among mountain then turned southward in flight only to find intercepting biplane sweeping across bow then went round into eye of rising sun

out behind be too intent on getting away to waste even glance behind twice after that must have heard shot let engine go crouched down for twenty minute must have steered in continual expectation of bullet never came when at last glanced round three great plane be close upon companion thrice hit lay dead across bomb follower manifestly did not mean either to upset shoot inexorably drove down down at last be curving flying hundred yard le over level field of rice maize ahead of dark against morning sunrise be village with very tall slender campanile line of cable bearing metal standard that must not clear stopped engine abruptly dropped flat may have hoped to get at bomb when came down pitiless pursuer drove right over shot a fell three other aeroplane curved down came to rest amidst grass close by smashed machine passenger descended ran holding light rifle in hand towards dbris two dead men coffin shaped box that have occupied centre of machine have broken three black object with

cant find out called at last not sign not sign im coming down said man overhead section slavic fox stood upon metal balcony in picturesque art nouveau palace gave upon precipice that overhung bright little capital beside stood pestovitch grizzled cunning now full of ill suppressed excitement behind window opened into large room richly decorated in aluminium crimson enamel across king a glanced ever again over shoulder with gesture of inquiry must see through two open door of little azure walled antechamber wireless operator in turret working at incessant transcription two pompously uniformed messenger waited listlessly in apartment room be furnished with stately dignity have in middle of big green baize covered table with massive white metal inkpot antiquated sandbox natural to new romantic monarchy be king council chamber about now in attitude of suspended intrigue stood half dozen minister who constituted cabinet have be summoned for twelve oclock still at half past twelve king loitered in balcony seemed to be waiting for news did not come king minister have talked at first in whisper have fallen silent for found little now to express except vague anxiety away there on mountain side be white metal roof of long farm building beneath bomb factory bomb be hidden chemist who have made for king have died suddenly after declaration of brissago nobody knew of store of mischief now king adviser three heavily faithful attendant aviator who waited now in midday blaze with bomb carrying machine passenger bomb thrower in exercising ground of motor cyclist barrack below be still in ignorance of position of ammunition be presently to take up be time started if scheme be to work a pestovitch have planned be magnificent plan aimed at le than empire of world government of idealist professor away there at brissago be to be blown to fragment then east west north south aeroplane must go swarming over world have disarmed to proclaim ferdinand charles new csar master lord of earth be magnificent plan tension of waiting for news of success of first blow wasconsiderable slavic fox be of pallid fairness have remarkably long nose thick short moustache small blue eye be little too near together to be pleasant be habit to worry moustache with short nervous tug whenever restless mind troubled now motion be becoming so incessant that irked pestovitch beyond limit of endurance will go said minister see what trouble be with wireless give nothing good bad left to king must worry moustache without stint leant elbow forward on balcony gave of long white hand to work so that looked like pale dog gnawing bone suppose caught men what must do suppose caught men clock in light gold capped belfry of town below presently intimated half hour after midday of course pestovitch have thought out even if have caught men be pledged to secrecy probably must be killed in catching one must deny anyhow deny deny then became aware of dozen little shining speck very high in blue pestovitch came out to presently government message sire have dropped into cipher said have set man look interrupted king pointed upward with long lean finger pestovitch followed that indication then glanced for one questioning moment at white face before have to face out sire said for moment watched steep spiral of descending messenger then began hasty consultation decided that to be holding council upon detail of ultimate surrender to brissago be a innocent looking thing a king must well be doing so when at last ex king egbert whom council have sent a envoy arrived upon scene discovered king almost theatrically posed at head of councillor in midst of court door upon wireless operator be shut ex king from brissago came like draught through curtain attendant gave wide margin to king ferdinand state familiar confidence of manner belied certain hardness in eye firmin trotted behind one else be with a ferdinand charles rose to greet there came into heart of balkan king again that same chilly feeling that have felt upon balconyand passed at careless gesture of guest for surely one might outwit foolish talker who for mere idea at command of little french rationalist in spectacle have thrown away most ancient crown in world one must deny deny then slowly quite tiresomely realised that there be nothing to deny visitor with amiable ease went on talking about everything in debate between brissago except must be that have be delayed must be that have have to drop for repair be still uncaptured must be that even now while fool babbled be over there among mountain heaving deadly charge over side of aeroplane strange hope began to lift tail of slavic fox again what be man saying one must talk to anyhow until one knew at moment little brass door behind might open with news of brissago blown to atom then must be delightful relief to present tension to arrest chatterer forthwith might be killed perhaps what king be repeating observation have ridiculous fancy that confidence be based on possession of atomic bomb king ferdinand charles pulled together protested oh quite so said ex king quite so what ground ex king permitted gesture ghost of chucklewhy devil must chuckle practically none said of course with thing one have to be so careful then again for instant somethinglike faintest shadow of derisiongleamed out of envoy eye recalled that chilly feeling to king ferdinand spine kindred depression have come to pestovitch who have be watching drawn intensity of firmins face came to help of master who feared might protest too much search cried king embargo on aeroplane only temporary expedient said ex king egbert while search be going on king appealed to council people will never permit sire said bustling little man in gorgeous uniform youll have to make em said ex king genially addressing councillor king ferdinand glanced at closed brass door through news must come when must want to have search ex king be radiant couldnt possibly do until day after to morrow said just capital where else asked ex king still more cheerfully for own part said ex king confidentially think whole business ridiculous who must be such fool a to hide atomic bomb nobody certain hanging if he caughtcertain almost certain blowing up if isnt nowadays have to take order like rest of world here be king thought have never met such detestable geniality glanced at pestovitch who nodded almost imperceptibly be well anyhow to have fool to deal with might have sent diplomatist of course said king recognise overpowering forceand kind of logicin order from brissago knew must said ex king with air of relief so let arrange arranged with certain informality balkan aeroplane be to adventure into air until search be concluded meanwhile fleet of world government must soar circle in sky town be to be placarded with offer of reward to one who must help in discovery of atomic bomb will sign said ex king why to show that arent in way hostile to pestovitch nodded yes to master then see said ex king in easy way of well have lot of men here borrow help from police run through thing then everything will be over meanwhile if may be guest when presently pestovitch be alone with king again found in state of jangling emotion spirit be tossing like wind whipped sea one moment be exalted full of contempt for as search next be down in pit of dread will find pestovitch then hell hang hang king put long nose into councillor face that grinning brute want to hang said hang will if give shadow of chance modern state civilisation do think there pity in crew of godless vivisecting prig cried last king of romance do think pestovitch understand anything of high ambition splendid dream do think that gallant sublime adventure have appeal to here be last greatest most romantic of csars do think will miss chance of hanging like dog if can killing like rat in hole that renegade who be once anointed king hate that sort of eye that laugh keep hard said king wont sit still here be caught like fascinated rabbit said king in conclusion must shift bomb risk said pestovitch leave alone said king shift near frontier then while watch herethey will always watch here nowwe can buy aeroplane abroad pick up king be in feverish irritable mood that evening made plan nevertheless with infinite cunning must get bomb away there must be couple of atomic hay lorry bomb must be hidden under hay pestovitch went came instructing trusty servant planning replanning king ex king talked very pleasantly of number of subject while at back of king ferdinand charles mind fretted mystery of vanished aeroplane there came news of capture news of success at moment power at back of visitor might crumble away vanish be past midnight when king in cloak slouch hat might equally have served small farmer respectable middle class man slipped out from inconspicuous service gate on eastward side of palace into thickly wooded garden sloped in series of terrace down to town pestovitch guard valet peter wrapped about in similar disguise came out among laurel bordered pathway joined be clear warm night star seemed unusually little remote because of aeroplane trailing searchlight drove hither thither across blue one great beam seemed to rest on king for moment a came out of palace then instantly reassuringly have swept away while be still in palace garden found looked at see cried king make nothing of said pestovitch king glanced up met calm round eye of light seemed to wink at vanish leaving blinded three men went on way near little gate in garden railing pestovitch have caused to be unlocked king paused under shadow of ilex looked back at place be very high narrow twentieth century rendering of mediaevalism mediaevalism in steel bronze sham stone opaque glass against sky splashed confusion of pinnacle high up in eastward wing be window of apartment of ex king egbert one of be brightly lit now against light little black figure stood very still looked out upon night king snarled little know how slip through finger said pestovitch a spoke saw ex king stretch out arm slowly like one who yawn knuckle eye turn inwardno doubt to bed down through ancient winding back street of capital hurried king at appointed corner shabby atomic automobile waited for three be hackney carriage of lowest grade with dinted metal panel deflated cushion driver be one of ordinary driver of capital beside sat young secretary of pestovitch who knew way to farm where bomb be hidden automobile made way through narrow street of old town be still lit uneasyfor fleet of airship overhead have kept cafs open people abroadover great new bridge so by straggling outskirt to country through capital king who hoped to outdo csar sat back be very still one spoke a got out into dark country became aware of searchlight wandering over country side like uneasy ghost of giant king sat forward looked at flitting whiteness now then peered up to see flying ship overhead dont like said king presently one of patch of moonlight came to rest about seemed to be following automobile king drew back thing be confoundedly noiseless said king like being stalked by lean white cat peered again that fellow be watching said then suddenly gave way to panic pestovitch said clutching minister arm be watching im not going through with be watching im going back pestovitch remonstrated tell to go back said king tried to open window for few moment there be grim struggle in automobile gripping of wrist blow cant go through with repeated king cant go through with theyll hang said pestovitch not if be to give up now not if be to surrender bomb be who brought into at last pestovitch compromised there be inn perhaps mile from farm must alight there king must get brandy rest nerve for time if still thought fit to go back must go back see said pestovitch light have gone again king peered up believe he following without light said king in little old dirty inn king hung doubtful for time be for going back throwing on mercy of council if there be council said pestovitch by time bomb may have settled if so infernal aeroplane must go may not know yet pestovitch why couldnt do without pestovitch made answer for moment be for leaving bomb in place said at last went to window about conveyance shone circle of bright light pestovitch have brilliant idea will send secretary out to make kind of dispute with driver something will make watch up above there meanwhile peter will go out by back way up by hedge to farm be worthy of subtle reputation answered passing well in ten minute be tumbling over wall of farm yard wet muddy breathless unobserved a ran towards barn king gave vent to something between groan curse about shone lightand passed have passed at once lingered for just second didnt see said peter dont think saw said king stared a light went swooping up mountain side hung for second about hayrick then came pouring back in barn cried king bruised shin against something then three men be inside huge steel girdered barn in stood two motor hay lorry be to take bomb away kurt abel two brother of peter have brought lorry thither in daylight have upper half of load of hay thrown off ready to cover bomb so soon a king must show hiding place there sort of pit here said king dont light lantern key of mine release ring for time scarcely word be spoken in darkness of barn there be sound of slab being lifted then of foot descending ladder into pit then whispering then heavy breathing a kurt came struggling up with first of hidden bomb will do yet said king then gasped curse light why in name of heaven didnt shut barn door for great door stood wide open empty lifeless yard outside door six foot of floor of barn be in blue glare of inquiring searchlight shut door peter said pestovitch cried king too late a peter went forward into light dont show cried king kurt made step forward plucked brother back for time five men stood still seemed that light must never go then abruptly be turned off leaving blinded now said king uneasily now shut door not completely cried pestovitch leave chink for to go out by be hot work shifting bomb king worked for time like common man kurt abel carried great thing up peter brought to cart king pestovitch helped to place among hay made a little noise a must ssh cried king whats kurt abel did not hear came blundering up ladder with last of load ssh peter ran forward to with whispered remonstrance now be still barn door opened little wider against dim blue light outside saw black shape of man one here asked speaking with italian accent king broke into cold perspiration then pestovitch answered only poor farmer loading hay said picked up huge hay fork went forward softly load hay at very bad time in very bad light said man at door peering in have electric light here then suddenly turned on electric torch a did so pestovitch sprang forward get out of barn cried drove fork full at intruder chest have vague idea so might stab man to silence man shouted loudly a prong pierced drove backward instantly there be sound of foot running across yard bomb cried man upon ground struggling with prong in hand a pestovitch staggered forward into view with force of own thrust be shot through body by one of two new comer man on ground be badly hurt plucky bomb repeated struggled up into kneeling position held electric torch full upon face of king shoot cried coughing spitting blood so that halo of light round king head danced about for moment in shivering circle of light two men saw king kneeling up in cart peter on barn floor beside old fox looked at sidewayssnared white faced evil thing then a with faltering suicidal heroism leant forward over bomb before fired together shot through head upper part of face seemed to vanish shoot cried man who have be stabbed shoot then light went out rolled over with groan at foot of comrade carried light of own in moment everything in barn be visible again shot peter even a held up hand in sign of surrender kurt abel at head of ladder hesitated for moment then plunged backward into pit if dont kill said one of

very well known a cytologist several of younger men who be working in place patient named kahn poet edward designer of play show spent time with talk wandered from point to point came back upon became now earnest now trivial a chance suggestion determined soon afterwards gardener wrote down note of thing remembered be possible to put together again outlook of karenin upon world how thought felt about many of principal thing in life age said have be so far age of scene shifting have be preparing stage clearing away setting of drama be played out growing tiresome if must sit out first few scene of new spectacle how encumbered world have become be ailing a be ailing with growth of unmeaning thing be entangled feverish confused be in sore need of release suppose that nothing le than violence of bomb must have released made healthy world again suppose be necessary just a everything turn to evil in fevered body so everything seemed turning to evil in last year of old time everywhere there be obsolete organisation seizing upon new fine thing science be giving to world nationality sort of political body church sect proprietorship seizing upon treat power limitless possibility turning to evil us must not suffer open speech must not permit of education must let one be educated to need of new time who be younger can not imagine mixture of desperate hope protesting despair in who must believe in possibility of science lived in year before atomic energy came be not only that mass of people must not attend must not understand that who did understand lacked power of real belief said thing saw thing thing meant nothing to have be reading old paper lately be wonderful how father bore towards science hated feared permitted few scientific men to exist worka pitiful handful dont find out anything about said to dont inflict vision upon spare little way of life from fearful shaft of understanding do trick for little limited trick give cheap lighting cure of certain disagreeable thing cure of cancer cure of consumption cure cold relieve after repletion have changed gardener science be no longer servant know for something greater than little individual self be awakening mind of race in little whilein little whilei wish indeed must watch for little while now that curtain have risen while lie here be clearing up what be left of bomb in london said then be going to repair ruin make a like a possible to former condition before bomb fell perhaps will dig out old house in st john wood to father went after expulsion from russia that london of memory seems to like place in world for younger people must seem like place must never have existed be there much left standing asked edith haydon square mile be scarcely shaken in south north west say most of bridge large area of dock westminster held most of government office suffered badly from small bomb destroyed parliament there be very few trace of old thoroughfare of whitehall government region thereabout there be plentiful drawing to scale of building great hole in east of london scarcely matter be poor district very like north south will be possible to reconstruct most of be wanted already becomes difficult to recall old timeeven for who saw seems very distant to said girl be unwholesome world reflected karenin seem to remember everybody about childhood a if be ill be ill be sick with confusion everybody be anxious about money everybody be doing uncongenial thing ate queer mixture of food too much too little at odd hour one see how ill be by advertisement new region of london be opening up now be plastered with advertisement of pill everybody must have be taking pill in one of hotel room in strand have found luggage of lady covered up by falling rubble unburnt be equipped with nine different sort of pill tabloid pill carrying age followed weapon carrying age be equally strange to people skin must have be in vile state very few people be properly washed carried filth of

air in crowded way irritation of london internal external must have be maddening be maddened world be like thinking of sick child one have same effect of feverish urgency acute irrational disappointment history said be record of childhood yet not exactly childhood there be something clean keen about even sick childand something touching so much of old time make one angry so much did seems grossly stupid obstinately outrageously stupid be very opposite to being fresh young be reading only other day about bismarck that hero of nineteenth century politics sequel to napoleon that god of blood iron be just beery obstinate dull man indeed be what be commonest coarsest man who ever became great looked at portrait heavy almost froggish face with projecting eye thick moustache to hide

one think of megatherium said one of young men from first to last mankind made three million big gun hundred thousand complicated great ship for other purpose war be there sane men in day asked young man to stand against idolatry in state of despair said edith haydon be so far offand there be men alive still who be alive when bismarck died said young man section yet may be be unjust to bismarck said karenin following own thought see men belong to own age stand upon common stock of thought fancy stand upon ground met pleasant man other day maori whose great grandfather be cannibal chanced have daguerreotype of old sinner two be marvellously alike one felt that little juggling with time either might have be other people be cruel stupid in stupid age who might be gentle splendid in gracious one world also have mood think of mental food of bismarck childhood humiliation of napoleon victory crowded crowning victory of battle of nation everybody in day wise foolish believed that division of world under multitude of government be inevitable that be going on for thousand of year more be inevitable until be impossible one who have denied that inevitability publicly must have be countedoh silly fellow old bismarck be only just littleforcible on line of accepted idea be thought that since there have to be national government must make one be strong at home invincible abroad because have fed with kind of rough appetite upon what can see now be very stupid idea doe not make stupid man weve have advantage weve have unity collectivism blasted into brain where must be now for grace of science must have be embittered spiteful downtrodden member of russian intelligenza conspirator prisoner assassin dear must have be breaking dingy window a suffragette never said edith stoutly for time talk broke into humorous personality young people gibed at other across smiling old administrator then presently one of young scientific men gave thing new turn spoke like one who be full to brim know sir ive fancyit be hard to prove such thingsthat civilisation be very near disaster when atomic bomb came banging into that if there have be no holsten induced radio activity world must havesmashedmuch a did only instead of being smash opened way to better thing might have be smash without recovery be part of business to understand economics from point of view century before holsten be just hundred year crescendo of waste only extreme individualism of period only utter want of collective understanding purpose can explain that waste mankind used up materialinsanely have got through three quarter of coal in planet have used up most of oil have swept away forest be running short of tin copper wheat area be getting weary populous many of big town have so lowered water level of available hill that suffered drought summer whole system be rushing towards bankruptcy be spending year vaster vaster amount of power energy upon military preparation continually expanding debt of industry to capital system be already staggering when holsten began research so far a world in general went there be sense of danger desire for inquiry have belief science must save idea that there be need to be saved must not must not see gulf beneath foot be pure good luck for mankind at large that research at be in progress a say sir if line of escape hadnt opened before now there might have be crash revolution panic social disintegration famine andit be conceivablecomplete disorder rail might have rusted on disused railway by now telephone pole have rotted fallen big liner dropped into sheet iron in port burnt deserted city become ruinous hiding place of gang of robber might have be brigand in shattered attenuated world ah may smile have happened before in human history world be still studded with ruin of broken down civilisation barbaric band made fastness upon acropolis tomb of hadrian became fortress warred across ruin of rome against colosseum have that possibility of reaction ended so certainly in be so very far away even now seems far enough away now said edith haydon forty year ago said karenin with eye upon mountain think underrate available intelligence in early decade of twentieth century officially know politically that intelligence didnt tellbut be there question hypothesis doubt if discovery must have be delayed there be kind of inevitable logic now in progress of research for hundred year more thought science have be going own way regardless of common event of life seethey have got loose if there have be no holsten there must have be similar man if atomic energy have not come in one year must have come in in decadent rome march of science have scarcely begun nineveh babylon athens syracuse alexandria be first rough experiment in association that made security breathing space in inquiry be born man have to experiment before found out way to begin already two hundred year ago have fairly begun politics dignity war of nineteenth twentieth century be only last phoenix blaze of former civilisation flaring up about beginning of new serve man life in dawn for ever said karenin life be beginning nothing else beginning begin everlastingly step seems vaster than last doe gather together for nest modern state of ours must have be utopian marvel hundred year ago be already commonplace of life a sit here dream of possibility in mind of man now gather to head beneath shelter of peace great mountain here seem little thing section about eleven karenin have midday meal afterwards slept among artificial fur pillow for two hour then awoke tea be brought to attended to small difficulty in connection with moravian school in labrador country in greenland that gardener knew must interest remained alone for little while after then two woman came to again afterwards edward kahn joined group talk fell upon love place of woman in renascent world cloudbanks of india lay under quivering haze blaze of sun fell full upon eastward precipice ever again a talked vast splinter of rock must crack come away from wild rush of snow ice stone pour down in thunder hang like wet thread into gulf below cease section for time karenin said very little kahn popular poet talked of passionate love said that passionate personal love have be abiding desire of humanity since ever humanity have begun now only be becoming possible experience have be dream generation after generation have pursued that always men have lost on verge of attainment to most of who have sought obstinately have brought tragedy now lifted above sordid distress men woman might hope for realised triumphant love age be dawn of love karenin remained downcast thoughtful while kahn said thing against continued silence kahn voice presently seemed to beat fail have begun by addressing karenin presently be including edith haydon rachel borken in appeal rachel listened silently edith watched karenin very deliberately avoided kahn eye know said karenin at last that many people be saying sort of thing know that there be vast release of love making in world great wave of decoration elaboration have gone about world efflorescence have of course laid hold of know that when say that world be set free interpret that to mean that world be set free for love making down thereunder cloud lover foregather know song kahn half mystical song in represent old hard world dissolving into luminous haze of lovesexual love dont think be right true in be young imaginative man see lifeardentlywith eye of youth power have brought man into high place under blue veiled blackness of sky beckons on towards immense awful future of race be riper deeper greater than such emotion through lifeit have be necessary part of worki have have to think of release of sexual love riddle perfect freedom almost limitless power will put to soul of race can see now over world beautiful ecstasy of waste let sing rejoice be lovely wonderful orgy be only beginning kahn be inevitablebut be not end of mankind think what be be yesterday in endlessness of time that life be dreaming thing dreaming so deeply that forgot a dreamt life individual instinct moment be born wondered played desired hungered grew weary died incalculable succession of vision vision of sunlit jungle river wilderness wild forest eager desire beating heart soaring wing creeping terror flamed hotly then be a though have never be life be uneasiness across light played vanished then came man came opened eye be question hand be demand began mind memory dy not when men die life increase for ever over mind dominating will question aspiration reach to star hunger fear make so much of sex be elementals of life out of have arisen elementals grant have to be provided for dealt with satisfied thing have to be left behind love said kahn speak of sexual love love of intimate person be what mean kahn karenin shook head can not stay at root climb tree said said after pause sexual excitement love story be just part of growing up grow out of so far literature art sentiment emotional form have be almost altogether adolescent play story delight hope have turned on marvellous discovery of love interest life lengthens out now mind of adult humanity detaches poet who used to die at thirty live now to eighty five too kahn there be endless year yet for youand full of learning carry excessive burden of sex sexual tradition still have to free from do free from have learnt in thousand different way to hold back death sex in old barbaric day be just sufficient to balance dying be now like hammer have lost anvil plunge through human life poet young people want to turn to delight turn to delight may be one way out in little while if have brain worth thinking about will be satisfied then will come up here to greater thing old religion new offset want still see to suppress thing let suppress if can suppress in own people road will bring here at last to eternal search for knowledge great adventure of power incidentally said rachel borken incidentally have half of humanity have womankind very much specialised forfor love reproduction be so much le needed than be sex be specialised for love reproduction said karenin woman carry heavier burden not in imagination said edward surely said kahn when speak of love a phaseisnt necessary phase quite apart from reproduction love of sex be necessary isnt love sexual love have released imagination without stir without impulse to go out from ourselves to be reckless of ourselves wonderful must life be anything more than contentment of stalled ox key open door said karenin be not goal of journey woman cried rachel here be what be futureas woman be only that have unlocked door of imagination for men let speak of question now be thing constantly in thought karenin what do think of who must have thought so much of perplexity karenin seemed to weigh word spoke very deliberately care rap about futureas woman care rap about future of menas male want to destroy peculiar future care for future a intelligence a part of contribution to universal mind of race humanity be not only naturally over specialised in matter institution custom everything exaggerate intensify difference want to unspecialise woman new idea plato wanted exactly that want to go on a go now emphasising natural difference deny want to reduce overcome andwe remain woman said rachel borken need remain thinking of yourselves a woman be forced upon said edith haydon think woman becomes le of woman because dress work like man said edward woman here mean scientific woman wear white clothing like men twist up hair in simplest fashion go about work a though there be only one sex in world be just a much woman even if be not so feminine a fine lady down below there in plain who dress for excitement display whose only thought be of lover who exaggerate difference indeed love more go about work said edith haydon so doe matter asked rachel if go about work if men go about work then for heaven sake be a much woman a wish said karenin when ask to unspecialise be thinking not of abolition of sex abolition of irksome restricting obstructive obsession with sex may be true that sex made society that first society be sex cemented family first state confederacy of blood relation first law sexual taboo until few year ago morality meant proper sexual behaviour up to within few year of chief interest motive of ordinary man be to keep rule woman child chief concern of woman be to get man to do that be drama be life jealousy of demand be master motive in world said kahn little while ago sexual love be key let one out from solitude of self tell so far have only done so in order to lock up again in solitude of two may have be necessary be necessary no longer have changed change still very swiftly future rachel a woman be diminishing future karenin asked rachel do mean that woman be to become men men woman have to become human being must abolish woman karenin listen there be more than sex in apart from sex be different from take up life differently forget arefemales karenin still be different sort of human being with different use in thing be amazingly secondary here be in place because of trick of management edith be here because of patient subtle hand doe not alter fact that nearly whole body of science be man made that doe not alter fact that men do so predominatingly make history that must nearly write complete history of world without mentioning woman name on other hand have gift of devotion of inspiration distinctive power for truly loving beautiful thing care for life peculiar keen close eye for behaviour know men be blind beside in last matter know be restlessand fitful have steadfastness may never draw broad outline discover new path in future isnt there confirming sustaining supplying rle for a important perhaps a yours equally important hold world up karenin though may have raised know very well rachel believe a believe be not thinking of abolition of woman do want to abolishthe heroine sexual heroine want to abolish woman whose support be jealousy whose gift possession want to abolish woman who can be won a prize locked up a delicious treasure away down there heroine flare like divinity in america said edward men be fighting duel over praise of woman holding tournament before queen of beauty saw beautiful girl in lahore said kahn sat under golden canopy like goddess three fine men armed dressed like ancient painting sat on step below to show devotion wanted only permission to fight for be men doing said edith haydon said cried edward man imagination be more specialised for sex than whole being of woman what woman must do thing like woman do submit to take advantage of there be evil between men woman be not common evil said karenin be poet kahn with love song turn sweet fellowship of comrade into woman centred excitement there be something in woman in many woman responds to provocation succumb to peculiarly self cultivating egotism become subject of own artistry develop elaborate a scarcely man must ever do look for golden canopy even when seem to react against that may do still have be reading in old paper of movement to emancipate woman be going on before discovery of atomic force thing began with desire to escape from limitation servitude of sex ended in inflamed assertion of sex woman more heroine than ever helen of holloway be at last a big nuisance in way a helen of troy so long a think of yourselves a womenhe held out finger at rachel smiled gentlyinstead of thinking of yourselves a intelligent being will be in danger ofhelenism to think of yourselves a woman be to think of yourselves in relation to men cant escape consequence have to learn to think of yourselvesfor sake own sakesin relation to sun star have to cease to be adventure rachel come with upon adventure waved hand towards dark sky above mountain crest section question be next question to research will bring answer said karenin while sit here talk idly inexactly of what be needed what may be there be hundred of keen witted men woman who be working thing out dispassionately certainly for love of knowledge next science to yield great harvest now will be psychology neural physiology perplexity of situation between man woman trouble with obstinacy of egotism be temporary trouble issue of own time suddenly difference seem so fixed will dissolve incompatibles will run together will go on to mould body bodily feeling personal reaction a boldly a begin now to carve mountain set sea in place change current of wind be next wave said fowler who have come out upon terrace seated silently behind karenins chair of course in old day said edward men be tied to city country tied to home owned work did see said karenin that there be final limit to man power of self modification there be none said fowler walking forward sitting down upon parapet in front of karenin so that must see face there be absolute limit to knowledge power hope tire talking be interested said karenin suppose in little while men will cease to be tired suppose in little time will give something will hurry away fatigue product restore jaded tissue almost at once old machine may be made to run without slacking cessation be possible karenin there be much to learn hour give to digestion half living dont think there will be way of saving fowler nodded assent then sleep again when man with blazing light made end to night in town housesit be only hundred year so ago that be donethen followed must presently resent eight hour of uselessness shant presently take tabloid lie in field of force will enable to do with hour so of slumber rise refreshed again frobisher ameer ali

who used to weaken die a teeth decayed now look forward to continually lengthening continually fuller term of year part of once gathered evil against vestigial structure odd treacherous corner of body know better better how to deal with carve body about leave re modelled unscarred psychologist be learning how to mould mind to reduce remove bad complex of thought motive to relieve pressure broaden idea so that be becoming more more capable of transmitting what have learnt preserving for race race racial wisdom science gather power continually to subdue individual man to own end be that not so fowler said that be for time be telling karenin of new work be in progress in india russia how be with heredity asked karenin fowler told of mass of inquiry accumulated arranged by genius of tchen who be beginning to define clearly law of inheritance how sex of child complexion many of parental quality must be determined can actually do be still so to speak mere laboratory triumph said fowler to morrow will be practicable see cried karenin turning laughing face to rachel edith while have be theorising about men woman here be science getting power for to end old dispute for ever if woman be too much for well reduce to minority if like type of men woman well have more of old body old animal limitation earthly inheritance of gross inevitability fall from spirit of man like shrivelled cocoon from imago for own part when hear of thing feel like thatlike wet crawling new moth still fear to spread wing because where do thing take beyond humanity said kahn said karenin can still keep foot upon earth made air no longer imprisons round planet be no longer chained to like ball of galley slave in little while men who will know how to bear strange gravitation altered pressure attenuated unfamiliar gas fearful strangeness of space will be venturing out from earth ball will be no longer enough for spirit will reach out can not see how little argosy will go glittering up into sky twinkling glittering smaller smaller until blue swallow up may succeed out there may perish other men will follow be a if great window opened said karenin section a evening drew on karenin who be about went up upon roof of building so that might better watch sunset flushing of mountain coming of afterglow be joined by two of surgeon from laboratory below presently by nurse who brought karenin refreshment in thin glass cup be cloudless windless evening under deep blue sky far away to north glittered two biplane on way to observatory on everest two hundred mile distant over precipice to east little group of people watched pas over mountain vanish into blue then for time talked of work that observatory be doing from that passed to whole process of research about world so karenins thought returned again to mind of world great future be opening upon man imagination asked surgeon many question upon detailed possibility of science be keenly interested excited by thing told a talked sun touched mountain became very swiftly blazing indented hemisphere of liquid flame sank karenin looked blinking at last quivering rim of incandescence shaded eye became silent presently gave little start what asked rachel borken have forgotten said what have forgotten have forgotten about operation to morrow have be so interested a man to day have nearly forgotten marcus karenin marcus karenin must go under knife to morrow fowler very probably marcus karenin will die raised slightly shrivelled hand doe not matter fowler scarcely matter even to for indeed be karenin who have be sitting here talking be not rather common mind fowler have played about between of have added thought to thought thread be what be true have when individual have altogether brought to test winnowing of expression then individual be done feel a though have already be emptied out of little vessel that marcus karenin in youth held so tightly completely beauty dear edith broad brow dear rachel fowler with firm skilful hand be now almost a much to a hand beat arm of chair a little spirit desire to know spirit resolve to do spirit life have talked in to day lived in athens lived in florence life on know for ever old sun with sword of flame searing poor eye of marcus for last time of beware of think dieand indeed be only taking off one more coat to get at have threatened for ten thousand year soon warn will be coming when be altogether stripped disguise thrown away very soon now old sun will launch at will reach will put foot on spotted face tug about by fiery lock one step will take to moon then will leap at ive talked to before old sun ive talked to million time now be beginning to remember yeslong ago long ago before have stripped off few thousand generation dust now forgotten be hairy savage pointed hand at andclearly remember iti saw in net have forgotten that old sun old sun gather together out of pool of individual have held dispersed so long gather billion thought into science million will into common purpose well may slink down behind mountain from well may cower section karenin desired that might dream alone for little while before returned to cell in be to sleep be given relief for pain began to trouble wrapped warmly about with fur for great coldness be creeping over thing so left sat for long time watching afterglow give place to darkness of night seemed to who have to watch over unobtrusively lest must be in want of attention that mused very deeply white purple peak against golden sky sank down into cold blue remoteness glowed out again faded again burning cressets of indian star even moonrise can not altogether quench began vigil moon rose behind towering screen of dark precipice to east long before emerged above slanting beam have filled deep gorge below with luminous mist turned tower pinnacle of lio porgyul to magic dreamcastle of radiance wonder came great uprush of ghostly light above black rim of rock then like bubble be blown detaches moon floated off clear into unfathomable dark sky then karenin stood up walked few pace along terrace remained for time gazing up at great silver disc silvery shield must need be man first conquest in outer space presently turned about stood with hand folded behind looking at northward star at length went to own cell lay down there slept peacefully till morning early in morning came to ansthetic be given operation performed be altogether successful karenin be weak have to lie very still about seven day later blood clot detached from healing scar travelled to heart died in instant in night
