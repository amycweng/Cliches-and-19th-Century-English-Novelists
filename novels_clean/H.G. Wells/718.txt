deterred from outset far more than sense of dishonesty in affair be supreme silliness of whole concern still clung to idea that world of men be must be sane just organisation idea must set gravely just at fine springtime of life to developing monstrous bottling packing warehouse bottling rubbish for consumption of foolish credulous depressed people have in touch of insanity early belief still clung to felt assured that somewhere there must be hitch in fine prospect of ease wealth under such condition somewhere little overgrown perhaps still traceable lay neglected wasted path of use honour

to flying machine that lacked nothing longitudinal stability model flew like bird for fifty hundred yard so then dived broke nose what be commoner reared up slid back smashed propeller rhythm of pitching puzzled felt must obey law not yet quite clearly stated became therefore student of theory literature for time hit upon string of consideration led to what be called ponderevos principle fr worked out in three long paper meanwhile made lot of turn table glider model started in upon idea of combining gas bag glider balloon work be new to have made one two ascent in balloon of aro club before started gasometer balloon shed gave cothope couple of month with sir peter rumchase uncle found part of money for development be growing interested competitive in business because of lord boom prize amount of rclame involved be at request that named first navigable balloon lord robert alpha lord robert very nearly terminated investigation idea in more successful famous younger brother lord robert be to utilise idea of contractile balloon with rigid flat base balloon shaped rather like inverted boat must almost support apparatus not quite gas bag be of chambered sort used for long form not with internal balloonette trouble be to make thing contractile sought to do by fixing long fine meshed silk net over be fastened to be rolled up on two longitudinal rod practically contracted sausage gas bag by netting down end be too complex for to describe here thought out elaborately be very carefully planned lord robert be furnished with single big screw forward there be rudder aft engine be first one to be so to speak right in plane of gas bag lay immediately under balloon on sort of glider framework far away from engine rudder controlling by wire pull constructed on principle of well known bowden brake of cyclist lord robert have be pretty exhaustively figured described in various aeronautical publication unforeseen defect be badness of work in silk netting tore aft a soon a began to contract balloon last two segment immediately bulged through hole exactly a inner tube will bulge through ruptured outer cover of pneumatic tire then sharp edge of torn net cut oiled silk

open down let engine out to full speed set roller at work rolling in net so tightening gas bag instantly pace quickened with diminished resistance in moment before bang think must have be really flying before net ripped just in instant when balloon be at systole whole apparatus be be convinced heavier than air that however be claim have be disputed in case sort of priority be very trivial thing then came sudden retardation instantly followed by inexpressibly disconcerting tilt downward of machine still recall with horror couldnt see what be happening at couldnt imagine be mysterious inexplicable dive thing seemed without rhyme reason be kicking up heel in air bang followed immediately perceived be falling rapidly be too much taken by surprise to think of proper cause of report dont even know what made of be obsessed suppose by perpetual dread of modern aeronaut flash between engine balloon yet obviously wasnt wrapped in flame ought to have realised instantly wasnt that did at rate other impression there be release winding of outer net let balloon expand again that doubt did something to break fall dont remember doing that indeed do remember be giddy effect upon landscape of falling swiftly upon down flat spiral hurried rush of field tree cottage on left shoulder overhung feeling a if whole apparatus be pressing down top of head didnt stop attempt to stop screw be going on swish swish swish time cothope really know more about fall than do describes easterly start tilt appearance bursting of sort of bladder aft then down swooped very swiftly not nearly so steeply a imagined be doing fifteen twenty degree said cothope to be exact from be that learnt let net loose again so arrested fall think be more in control of than remember see why must have forgotten so excellent resolution impression be be really steering trying to drop into farthing down beech hit tree said whole affair stood on nose among then very slowly crumpled up saw youd be jerked out a thought didnt stay for more rushed for bicycle a matter of fact be purely accidental that came down in wood be reasonably certain that have more control then than thing in parcel remember felt sort of wincing now come a tree rushed up to if remember must remember steering then propeller smashed everything stopped with jerk be falling into mass of yellowing leaf lord robert so seemed to be going back into sky felt twig thing hit in face didnt feel injured at time clutched at thing broke tumbled through froth of green yellow into shadowy world of great bark covered arm there snatching wildly got grip on fair round branch hung became intensely alert clear headed held by branch for moment then looked about caught at then found holding to practicable fork swung forward to got leg around below junction so be able presently to clamber down climbing very coolly deliberately dropped ten foot so from lowest branch fell on foot thats right said stared up through tree to see what must of deflated crumpled remains have once be lord robert festooned on branch have broken god said what tumble wiped something trickled from face be shocked to see hand covered with blood looked at saw what seemed to astonishing quantity of blood running down arm shoulder perceived mouth be full of blood queer moment when one realises one be hurt perhaps badly hurt have still to discover just how far one be hurt explored face carefully found unfamiliar contour on left side broken end of branch have driven right through cheek damaging cheek teeth gum left splinter of stuck like explorer fartherest point flag in upper maxillary sprained wrist be damage bled a though have be chopped to piece seemed to that face have be driven in cant describe just horrible disgust felt at that blood must be stopped anyhow said thickheadedly wonder where there spider weban odd twist for mind to take be only treatment occurred to must have conceived idea of going home unaided because be thirty yard from tree before dropped then kind of black disc appeared in middle of world rushed out to edge of thing blotted out dont remember falling down fainted from excitement disgust at injury loss of blood lay there until cothope found be first to find scorching a did over downland turf making wide course to get carnaby plantation at narrowest then presently while be trying to apply methodical teaching of st john ambulance class to rather abnormal case beatrice came galloping through tree full tilt with lord carnaby hard behind be hatless muddy from fall white a death cool a cucumber too said cothope turning over in mind a told never seem quite to have head never seem quite to lose em said cothope generalising about sex also witnessed acted with remarkable decision question be whether must be taken to house step mother occupied at bedley corner carnaby dower house down to carnabys place at easting beatrice have doubt in matter for meant to nurse carnaby didnt seem to want to happen must have wasnt half so far said cothope faced out hate to be faced out of opinion so ive taken pedometer over since exactly forty three yard further lord carnaby looked at pretty straight said cothope finishing picture then give in v story have made jump from june to october during time relation with beatrice countryside be setting have developed in many direction came went moving in orbit for have data going to london paris into wale northampton while stepmother on independent system of own also vanished recurred intermittently at home obeyed rule of inflexible old maid charlotte beatrice exercised right of proprietorship in carnabys extensive stable interest in be from first undisguised found way to worksheds developed rapidly in spite of sincere discouragement of cothope into keen amateur of aeronautics must come sometimes in morning sometimes in afternoon sometimes afoot with irish terrier sometimes riding must come for three four day day vanish for fortnight three week return be not long before came to look for from first found immensely interesting to be new feminine type altogetheri have made plain think how limited be knowledge of woman made not simply interested in in became for something greatly change man world how will put became audience since ive emerged from emotional development of affair have thought out in hundred aspect doe seem to that way in men woman make audience for one be curiously influential force in life for seems audience be vital necessity seek audience a creature seek food others again uncle among can play to imaginary audience think have lived can live without one in adolescence be own audience own court of honour to have audience in one mind be to play part to become self conscious dramatic for many year have be self forgetful scientific have lived for work impersonal interest until found scrutiny applause expectation in beatrice eye then began to live for effect imagined made upon to make very soon principal value in life played to did thing for look of began to dream more more of beautiful situation fine pose grouping with for put thing down because puzzle think be in love with beatrice a being in love be usually understood be quite different state altogether from passionate hunger for marion keen sensuous desire for pleasure in effie be selfish sincere thing fundamental instinctive a sincere a leap of tiger until matter drew to crisis with beatrice there be immense imaginative insurgence of quite different quality be setting down here very gravely perhaps absurdly what be doubt elementary commonplace for innumerable people love grew up between beatrice be thinki put quite tentatively rather curiouslyromantic love unfortunate truncated affair of uncle scrymgeour lady be really of same stuff if little different in quality have to admit that factor of audience be of primary importance in else effect upon be to make in many respect adolescent again made keener upon point of honour anxious eager to do high splendid thing in particular brave thing so far ennobled upheld did also push towards vulgar showy thing at bottom be disingenuous gave life quality of stage scenery with one side to audience side that wasnt meant to show economy of substance certainly robbed work of high patience quality cut down toil of research in eagerness eagerness for fine flourish in air flight must tell shirked longer road robbed too of fine perception of absurdity yet be not everything in relationship elemental thing be there also came in very suddenly be one day in summer though now recall without reference to experimental memoranda whether be in july august be working with new more bird like aeroplane with wing curvature studied from lilienthal pilcher phillips thought must give different rhythm for pitching oscillation than anything id have before be soaring long course from framework on old barrow by shed down to tinker corner be clear stretch of downland except for two three thicket of box thorn to right of course one transverse trough in there be bush small rabbit warren come in from east have started be very intent on peculiar long swoop with new arrangement flew then without sort of notice right ahead of appeared beatrice riding towards tinker corner to waylay talk to looked round over shoulder saw coming touched horse to gallop then brute bolted right into path of machine there be queer moment of doubt whether shouldnt smash together have to make up mind very quickly whether must pitch up drop backward at once take chance of falling undamageda poor chance must have beenin order to avoid risk to whether must lift against wind soar right over latter did have already got horse in hand when came up to woman body lay along neck glanced up a with wing aspread nerve in state of tension swept over then have landed be going back to where horse stood still trembling exchanged greeting slid from saddle into arm for one instant held great wing said be lay in arm thought for moment have fainted very near nasty accident said cothope coming up regarding grouping with disfavour took horse by bridle very dangerous thing coming across like beatrice disengaged from stood for moment trembling then sat down on turf ill just sit down for moment said oh said covered face with hand while cothope looked at with expression between suspicion impatience for moment nobody moved then cothope remarked that perhaps hed better get water a for be filled with new outrageous idea begotten scarcely know how from incident with instant contact swift emotion be must make love to posse beatrice see particular reason why thought must have come to in moment did believe that before then have thought of relation in such term at suddenly a remember factor of passion came crouched there stood over of said word be just a though something have be shouted from sky cothope have gone twenty pace perhaps when uncovered face shant want water said call back vi after that spirit of relation changed old ease have gone came to le frequently when came must have one with usually old carnaby must do bulk of talking through september be away when be alone together there be curious constraint became cloud of inexpressible feeling towards one must think of nothing be not too momentous for word then came smash of lord robert found with bandaged face in bedroom in bedley corner dower house with beatrice presiding over inefficient nurse lady osprey very pink shocked in background aunt jealously intervening injury be much more showy than serious must have be taken to lady grove next day beatrice must not permit that kept at bedley corner three clear day in afternoon of second day became extremely solicitous for proper aeration of nurse packed off for hour in brisk rain sat by alone asked to marry whole must admit be not situation lent to eloquence lay on back talked through bandage with little difficulty for tongue mouth have swollen be feverish in pain emotional

asked not to talk why couldnt do a asked youve be avoiding for month said know might have known put hand backdown by side obeyed sat on edge of bed flush have come to cheek eye be very bright asked

rapidly with odd gust of emphasis shepherd pipe music from last act in tristan isolde presently missed note failed again ran finger heavily up scale struck piano passionately with fist making feeble jar in treble jumped up went out of room nurse found still wearing helmet of bandage partially dressed pottering round room to find rest of clothes be in state of exasperated hunger for beatrice be too inflamed weakened to conceal state of mind be feebly angry because of irritation of dressing particularly of struggle to put on trouser without being able to see leg be staggering about once have fallen over chair have upset jar of michaelmas daisy must have be detestable spectacle ill go back to bed said if may have word with miss beatrice ive got something to say to thats why im dressing

intensely physical one have ever yet dared to tell love story completely alternation coming going debased moment hate love story tell tell only net consequence ruling effect how can rescue from past now mystical quality of beatrice intense longing for overwhelming irrational formless desire how can explain how intimately that worship mingled with high impatient resolve to make mine to take by strength courage to do loving in violent heroic manner then doubt puzzled arrest at fact of fluctuation at refusal to marry at fact that even when at last returned to bedley corner seemed to evade that exasperated perplexed beyond measure felt that be treachery thought of conceivable explanation most exalted romantic confidence in did not simply alternate mingled with basest misgiving into

satisfied by series of entirely successful expansion contraction of real air worthiness of lord robert stopped engine to save petrol let monster drift checking progress by dim landscape below uncle

probably uncle slept remember once twice heard talking in eager muffled voice to to imaginary court there can be doubt wind changed right round into east that be carried far down channel without suspicion of immense leeway be making remember kind of stupid perplexity with saw dawn breaking over grey waste of water below realised that something be wrong be so stupid that be only after sunrise really noticed trend of foam cap below perceived be in severe easterly gale even then instead of heading southeasterly set engine going headed south so continued course must need have just hit ushant

up to gravity of position discovered by accident in southeast when be looking for in southwest turned about east faced wind for time finding have chance in teeth went high where seemed le violent tried to make course southeast be only then that realised what gale be in have be going westward perhaps even in gust north of west at pace of fifty sixty mile hour then began what suppose must be called fight against east wind one call fight be really almost a unlike fight a plain sewing wind tried to drive westwardly tried to get a much a must eastwardly with wind beating rocking irregularly by mean unbearably for about twelve hour hope lay in wind abating keeping in air eastward of finisterre until did chief danger be exhaustion of petrol be long anxious almost meditative time be fairly warm only slowly getting hungry except uncle grumbled little produced philosophical reflection began to fuss about having temperature talked very little be tired sulky chiefly worried about engine

stomach occasionally rambled off into exposition of financial position denunciation of nealhe certainly struck out one two good phrase for nealand crawled about at rare interval in vague sort of way grunted basketwork creaked continually wind on quarter made sort of ruffled flapping in wall of gas chamber for wrap got frightfully cold a night wore on must have dozed be still dark when realised with start that be nearly due south of long way from regularly flashing lighthouse standing out before glow of great town then that thing have awakened be cessation of engine that be driving back to west then indeed for time felt grim thrill of life crawled forward to cord of release valve made uncle crawl forward too let out gas until be falling down through air like clumsy glider towards vague greyness be land something must have intervened here have forgotten saw light of bordeaux when be quite dark nebulous haze against black of be reasonably sure certainly fall took place in cold uncertain light of early dawn be at least equally sure of mimizan near where dropped be fifty mile from bordeaux whose harbour light must have seen remember coming down at last with curious indifference actually rousing to steer actual coming to earth be exciting enough remember prolonged dragging landfall difficulty have to get clear how gust of wind caught lord robert b a uncle stumbled away from rope litter dropped heavily threw on to knee then came realisation that monster be almost consciously disentangling for escape then light leap of rebound rope slipped out of reach of hand remember running knee deep in salt pool in hopeless pursuit of airship a dragged rose seaward how only after have escaped uttermost effort to recapture did realise that be quite best thing must have happened drove swiftly over sandy dune lifting falling be hidden by clump of windbitten tree then reappeared much further off still receding soared for time sank slowly after saw more

watching of bedside with proffered service with hand a be now getting into touch with affair in london again trying to disentangle gigantic detail of smash from paper have succeeded in getting from biarritz accepted offer pretty generously began study in modern finance lay before have got so out of touch with old tradition of religion overlooked manifest possibility of attacking poor sinking vestige of uncle with theological solicitude attention be called to however very speedily by polite urgent quarrel between basque landlady a to necessity of hanging cheap crucifix in shadow over bed where might catch uncle eye where indeed found have caught eye good lord cried be that still going on night little clergyman watched in small hour raised false alarm that uncle be dying made extraordinary fuss raised house will never forget that scene think began with tapping at bedroom door just after have fallen asleep voice if want to see uncle before go must come now stuffy little room be crowded when reached lit by three flickering candle felt be back in eighteenth century there lay poor uncle amidst indescribably tumbled bedclothes weary of life beyond measure weary rambling little clergyman trying to hold hand attention repeating over over again mr ponderevo mr ponderevo be all right be all right only believe believe on ye will be saved close at hand be doctor with one of cruel idiotic injection needle modern science put in hand of half educated young men keeping uncle flickeringly alive for reason whatever religieuse hovered sleepily in background with overdue neglected dose in addition landlady have not only got up herself roused aged crone of mother partially imbecile husband there be also fattish stolid man in grey alpaca with air of importancewho be how got there dont know rather fancy doctor explained to in french did not understand be there wearily nocturnal hastily carelessly dressed intent upon life flickered sank making public curious show of

hustled up out of way in minute be down at chair praying again barring path of religieuse who have found corkscrew something put into head that tremendous blasphemy of carlyle about last mew of drowning kitten found third chair vacant presently be a if be playing game good heaven said must clear people out with certain urgency did have temporary lapse of memory forgot french drove out mainly by gesture opened window to universal horror intimated death scene be postponed a matter of fact uncle did not die until next night did not let little clergyman come near again be watchful for sign that mind have be troubled made none talked once about parson chap didnt bother asked wanted something said kept silence listening keenly to muttering understood to say wanted too much face puckered like child going to cry cant get safe six per cent said have for moment wild suspicion that urgent talk have not be altogether spiritual think be quite unworthy unjust suspicion little clergyman be a simple honest a day uncle be simply generalising about class may have be talk set loose long dormant string of idea in uncle brain idea thing of world have long suppressed hidden altogether near end suddenly became clearminded lucid albeit very weak voice be little clear george said im here said close beside george have always be responsible for science george know better than do isi proved what proved way dont understand death end after so muchsuch splendid beginnins somewhere something stared at amazed sunken eye be very grave what do expect said in wonder must not answer aspiration whispered fell into broken monologue regardless of trailing cloud of glory said first rate poet first rategeorge be always hard always for long time there be silence then made gesture that wished to speak seems to george bent head down tried to lift hand to shoulder raised little on pillow listened seems to george alwaysthere must be something in methat wont die looked at a though decision rested with think said something then for moment mind wandered just little link whispered almost pleadingly lay quite still presently be uneasy again other world perhaps said who know other world not same scope for enterprise said became silent sat leaning down to following out own thought presently religieuse resumed periodic conflict with window fastening for time struggled for breath seemed such nonsense that must have to suffer sopoor silly little man george whispered weak little hand came out perhaps said more perceived from expression of eye that thought question have be put yes think so said stoutly arent sure ohpractically sure said think tried to squeeze hand there sat holding hand tight trying to think what seed of immortality must be found in being what sort of ghost there be in to wander out into bleak immensity queer fancy came to lay still for long time save for brief struggle so for breath ever again wiped mouth lip fell into pit of thought did not remark at first change be creeping over face lay back on pillow made faint zzzing sound that ceased presently quite quietly diedgreatly comforted by assurance know when died hand relaxed insensibly suddenly with start with shock found that mouth have fallen open that be dead viii be dark night when left deathbed went back to own inn down straggling street of luzon return to inn stick in memory also a thing apart a experience apart within be subdued bustle of woman flitting of light doing of petty office to queer exhausted thing have once be active urgent little uncle for office be irksome impertinent slammed door went out into warm foggy drizzle of village street lit by blurred speck of light in great void of darkness never soul abroad that warm veil of fog produced effect of vast seclusion very house by roadside peered through a if from world stillness of night be marked by occasional remote baying of dog people kept dog because of near neighbourhood of frontier death be one of rare season of relief when for little time one walk little outside of beside life felt a sometimes feel after end of play saw whole business of uncle life a something familiar completed be done like play one leaf like book one close thought of push promotion noise of london crowded various company of people through life have gone public meeting excitement dinner disputation suddenly appeared to that none of thing existed came to like discovery that none of thing existed before after have thought called life phantasmagoria never have felt truth a did that night have parted two who have kept company so long have parted there be knew end to have died dream death ended dream pain dream be over seemed to almost a though have died too what did matter since be unreality of pain desire beginning end there be reality except solitary road quite solitary road along one went rather puzzled rather tired part of fog became big mastiff came towards stopped slunk round growling barked gruffly shortly presently became fog again mind swayed back to ancient belief fear of race doubt disbelief slipped from like loosely fitting garment wondered quite simply what dog bayed about path of other walker in darkness what shape what light might be loomed about a went way from last encounter on earthalong path be real way endures for ever ix last belated figure in grouping round uncle deathbed be aunt when be beyond hope that uncle must live threw aside concealment remained to telegraphed directly to came too late to see living saw calm still strangely unlike habitual garrulous animation unfamiliar inflexibility isnt like whispered awed by alien dignity remember chiefly a talked wept upon bridge below old castle have got rid of amateurish reporter from biarritz have walked together in hot morning sunshine down through port luzon there for time stood leaning on parapet of bridge surveying distant peek rich blue mass of pyrenees for long time said nothing then began talking life rum go george began who must have thought when used to darn stocking at old wimblehurst that must be end of story seems far away nowthat little shop first home glow of bottle big coloured bottle do remember how light shone on mahogany drawer little gilt letter ol amjig snap can remember allbright shininglike dutch picture real yesterday here be in dream manand old woman george poor little teddy who used to rush about talkmaking that noise didoh choked tear flowed unrestrained wept be glad to see weeping stood leaning over bridge tear wet handkerchief gripped in clenched hand just hour in old shop againand talking before thing got done before got hold of fooled men oughtnt to be so tempted with business thing didnt hurt george asked suddenly for moment be puzzled here mean said lied stoutly suppressing memory of foolish injection needle have caught young doctor using wonder george if theyll let talk in heaven faced oh george dear heart ache dont know what say do give arm to lean onits good to have dear lean upon yes know care for thats why im talking weve always loved one never said anything about understand understand heart torn to piece by torn to rag thing drop out ive kept in

enough to see not clever enough to prevent must do be to jeer ive have to make what must of like most people like most of wasnt fair george wasnt fair life deathgreat serious thingswhy couldnt leave alone lie way if must see lightness of why couldnt leave alone repeated in whisper a went towards inn chapter second love among wreckage when came back found that share in escape death of uncle have made for time notorious even popular character for two week be kept in london facing music a must have said making thing easy for aunt still marvel at consideration with world treated for now be open manifest that uncle be more than specimen of modern specie of brigand wasting saving of public out of sheer wantonness of enterprise think that in way death produced reaction in favour flight of particular now appeared stuck in popular imagination seemed more daring difficult feat than be couldnt very well write to paper to sustain private estimate there can be little doubt that men
