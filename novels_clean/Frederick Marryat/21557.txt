certainly forster can navigate continued captain addressing newton yes sir can work up dead reckoning take sun altitude very well that will do mr pittson may dismiss be put into mess sir be twelve o'clock sir said master touching hat with quadrant in hand make so pipe to dinner newton be stationed in foretop in few day awkwardness arising from novelty of scene from superior dimension of variety of equipment on board of frigate compared to small craft to have be accustomed passed away order be exacted to preserve discipline precision with time be regulated knowledge of duty allotted to soon made feel that more be exacted than what must easily be performed that there be hardship in serving on board of man of war only hardship be manner in have be brought there although often sighed a thought of father mother did duty cheerfully be soon distinguished a most promising young sailor captain northfleet be humane good officer first lieutenant followed in step equally deserved character before ship company have be six week together be in tolerable state of discipline proved such to be case by acknowledging that be happy added to constant excitement of chasing capturing vessel of enemy with anticipation of prize money soon made most of who have be impressed forget what have occurred cease to lament a hardship continual exercise of gun be invariably followed up by general wish that might fall in with enemy of equal force to ascertain whether such constant drilling have be thrown away upon terpsichore received supply of provision water from other ship for nine month continued successful cruise several prize have already be captured sent home to england complement of frigate be materially reduced by so many absentee although of men have be brought out to by other

quarterdeck a one of mate of frigate newton thanked captain northfleet for good intention requesting permission to reflect upon proposal took leave in few minute be on board of estelle there be buoyancy of spirit in newton when once more found clear of frigate acknowledged that have be well treated that have not be unhappy still be emancipation from forced servitude be hard to please where there be so many master petty tyranny will exist cause much discontent before be discovered even where best discipline prevails imperious behaviour of young midshipman who assume same despotic sway be exercised over a soon a superior be out of sight hearing be often extremely galling to newton forster frequently required much forbearance not to retort however in strict justice might be warranted discipline must not permit must have be attended with severe punishment be therefore with feeling of delight that newton found own master watched hull canvas of terpsichore a gradually sunk below horizon estelle be fine vessel cargo not being composed of heavy material be sufficiently light on water to sail well at time of capture be by reckoning of frigate about fourteen hundred mile from lizard in fortnight therefore with wind at propitious newton hoped to set foot upon native land crowded sail prudence must allow with wind upon quarter steered course for england men sent with in brig

generally in favour brig be not far off from chop of channel when low raking vessel be perceived bearing down upon from north west newton have glass a neared to within three mile vessel wore appearance of privateer schooner whether enemy not be impossible to decide estelle have two small brass gun on forecastle newton to ascertain nation to privateer belonged hoisted french ensign fired gun in minute privateer hoisted english colour a continued to bear down upon newton not feeling secure rove studding sail gear made preparation for running before wind knew to be brig best point of sailing privateer have approached to within two mile when robert one of seaman gave decided opinion that be french vessel pointing out slight variety in rigging build of vessel must not have be apparent to one thorough bred seaman 'd better up helm get sail upon if be french will soon show by firing at be of same opinion brig be put before wind gradually canvas be spread privateer immediately shook out reef set lofty sail hoisted french colour in few minute shot whizzed through rigging of estelle pitched into water ahead of thought so cried robert be johnny crapeau starn chase be long chase anyhow brig sail well there ai more than two hour daylight so monsieur must be quick will give slip yet privateer be now within mile of vessel have got way respective power of sailing be to be ascertained in hour privateer have neared to three quarter of mile think little gun will soon reach observed newton williams give helm go forward with robert men rouse aft be smart lad for have

one gun while robert took charge of other privateer have continued to near be now within range smart fire be kept up on returned with superior metal after firing have commenced approach of privateer be in degree checked gun fired from stern of estelle assisted velocity through water while on contrary privateer being obliged to yaw from course that gun might bear firing from bow impetus be checked still privateer have advantage in sailing slowly neared brig there be need of coming aft so close upon said robert to two frenchman who have be sent on board go forward keep out of way that 'ere chap be after mischief have eye upon amminition continued sailor to newton go forward d 'ye hear will split damned french skull with handspike touch robert said newton wo touch if keep out of way do hear

slapping gun familiarly on breech only get out of scrape will polish a bright a silver whether gun understood not what be more probable short distance between brig privateer made more effective more mischief took place in sail rigging of schooner topsail sheet be however soon re bent sail reset other casualty made good ceased firing long gun at dusk have crept up to within quarter of mile commenced heavy fire of musketry upon brig be rather warm work observed williams at helm pointing to bullet hole through jacket rather too warm observed collins convict see why be to risk life for paltry share of prize money vote for hauling down colour not yet said newton not yet lad let try few shot more try to be sure rejoined robert did say before starn chase be long one only make matter worse replied collins for while be to be peppered way think shorter chase better however may do a please be not so fond of so here be down below to fore peak ben be sensible chap give good advice will just follow said hillson bird of feather always flock together so ben be of party added thompson convict then descended forward out of fire of musketry while newton robert continued to load fire

human life will not venture farther remark upon subject for be even new must never have credit of be certain that instead of finding a anticipated to be in next twenty four hour safely moored in port of plymouth newton comrade found before time have elapsed safely locked up in prison of morlaix must not proceed so fast although estelle have squared mainyard a signal of submission privateer men a

liverpool to ascertain condition of father will pas over difficulty experienced on journey there be country where travelling be more easy more rapid than in england provided that have plenty of money when travel in forma pauperis there be country in get on so badly parish rate poor law have dried up source of benevolence a newton did not apply to overseer for three half penny mile got on how must be badly enough when at last did arrive at liverpool found stone two lighter must have be pronounced by captain barclay to have be in excellent training newton have written to father acquainting with

yesterday will feed for time sailor came into shop asked if have watch to sell told that only repaired at present that when improvement in duplex here nicholas forgot thread of narrative be commencing calculation upon intended improvement when newton interrupted well sir what did sailor reply oh forgot told that have watch of own must part with went very well that must be cheaper to than new one cost fifteen pound be in want of money must take five pound for saw how sorry be to part with so be here nicholas thought of watch forgot story well dear father said newton what did give for oh why be

respectable appearance than what privateer people have hitherto permitted in few day felt quite recovered from fatigue sallied forth in search of employment on day after arrival at liverpool have written to asylum to inquire fate of mother answer received be that mr forster have recovered remained many month in establishment a nurse that ten day back have quitted asylum that address be not known newton who have mean of prosecuting further inquiry be obliged to be satisfied with intelligence that mother be alive well communicated information to nicholas who observed poor thing be looking for depend upon will be here very soon expectation be revived whenever nicholas thought of wife continued satisfied must allow many month to pas away in one paragraph month of ineffectual struggle against poverty want of employment newton made exertion to obtain a mate of merchant vessel way in have be impressed have caused dread of king service must not overcome although have to choose ship a sailor before mast must not prevail upon to accept berth be not protected from impress without recommendation must not obtain situation of mate continued to work a rigger in dock until hand be unfortunately severely jammed by heel of topmast be laid up for many week day fare became scantier be reduced to last shilling when newton be again able to go out seek employment be rough day blowing hard from south east when newton who have tried fortune on board of vessel crowded a be in dock without success walked in melancholy disappointed mood along splendid pier line river side few people be out for gust of wind be accompanied by smart driving shower of rain here there be to be seen boat pulling up in shore to fetch shipping in stream who with heavy strain on cable be riding to south east gale strong ebb tide newton have made up mind to enter on board of one of vessel about to sail provided must advance part of wage for father support when a heavy squall cleared away perceived that boat have broken adrift from outermost vessel large brig with only one man in who be carried away by rapid current assisted by gale blowing down river so a to place in considerable risk man in boat tossed out oar pulling first on one side then on other tried to make for shore in vain be swept away with rapidity threatened in le than hour to carry out to sea unless assistance be afforded heavy squall again hid boat from sight of newton who have be anxiously watching to ascertain if relief be sent from shipping who be now convinced that disaster have not be perceived therefore ran down bank of river waiting until squall must blow over enable to discover boat in about ten minute squall passed over boat be again presented to sight be still in centre of stream about three hundred yard from shore man who be in finding attempt futile have lain on oar be kneeling in stern sheet apparently in supplication newton must not resist appeal appeared to point out to that be summoned to answer call made upon providence boat be now quarter of mile farther down river than where stood about three mile from town shipping of be longer discernible from thickness of weather newton threw off coat plunging into agitated water cold of nearly checked respiration swam off into stream in direction so a to allow to fetch to windward of boat be soon carried down to by rapidity of tide a approached shouted to announce presence man in boat started up at sound of human voice perceiving newton close to bow lent over extended hand towards newton seized hold of then be whirled round by tide fore aft with side of boat with such violence a nearly to drag other man out half fill boat with water be with great difficulty although assisted by occupant that newton contrived at last to get in when exhausted with effort have made remained few second without motion man whom have thus risked life to save perceiving condition not speaking to have time to lose said newton at last take oar let pull in for shore if once be swept down to narrow there will be little chance for other complied without speaking after few minute exertion boat be safely landed on liverpool side of river lord be praised ejaculated newton companion a laid on oar did not call upon in vain accident have be mean of preservation how do mean inquired why did not fall overboard replied other newton then explained to companion what have already related to reader ending narrative with observation that when perceived praying for assistance in peril must not resist appeal god will reward young man continued now will explain to how be be adrift like bear in washing tub first mate be below have just relieved deck for in blowing weather must keep watch in men be at dinner when boat thumping under main channel got into to ease off fathom two of painter a hauled ahead to get at bend appears that monkey of boy who made fast have be few month at sea have made slippery hitch ' so away went be adrift hailed on board did not hear although first mate might have for be in cabin stern window be up hailing to windward be hard work such weather a word be blown back again down own throat now let know little about lad see whether can not in return be of use to newton history be soon told at conclusion have satisfaction of finding that have obtained very situation have be in search of have second mate on board observed captain of brig intended to have shipped one to morrow be only divided between to take of two who have offered with equally good recommendation fortunately must promise neither a think own recommendation stronger than theirs berth be at service only wish for sake that be that of first mate be sure must prove fit for situation can not say that be very partial to one have at present be relation of owner arrangement be soon made mr berecroft master of vessel advanced newton sum to fit out agreed with owner at liverpool that one half of newton wage must be allotted monthly to father next morning a vessel have pilot on board weather have moderated newton took leave of father with light heart accompanied new acquaintance on board of vessel be early in morning when embarked in hired boat one belonging to brig still remaining down river where have landed first mate a appeared be in cabin shaving previous to going on shore to owner to report supposed loss of superior sailor be either busy down below so that notice be taken of boat coming alongside newton with master be on deck before circumstance be known to first mate so happened that at very same moment that came on board first mate be ascending companion hatch to order boat to be lowered down manned when perceived mr berecroft fell back with astonishment turned pale thought be gone said why what must have saved did not drift out to sea appears then mr jackson that knew be adrift replied master seriously looking steadfastly in face be replied mate confused thought of course seeing boat be not alongside that have drifted away in how happened of course know not must trust for conscience sake mr jackson that did not however here be again a see by blessing of providence exertion of young man whom must introduce to a second mate jackson cast angry glance at newton upon conclusion of speech master have truly observed that be strange first mate did not hear when have hailed brig for assistance fact be that jackson have heard seen be wretch devoid of feeling who consulted nothing except own interest have made sure that master must be carried out to sea there to perish by most miserable death that must succeed in command of vessel be then going on shore to report supposed falling overboard of master a brig be to sail a weather moderated must have secured to command at same time have put end to search must have reported truth must immediately have taken place for boat in master have be adrift foiled in hope by courage of newton jackson have already formed towards deadly hatred determination of revenge that evening wind abated vessel sailed ensuing morning be clear of sand pilot vessel off holyhead having received pilot steered down irish channel to join convoy for west indie collecting at falmouth mr berecroft master of vessel who have not hitherto be described be spare light built person of about sixty year of age still active thorough seaman have crossed ocean for forty five year occasional narrative a walked deck sat over evening glass of grog proved that life must have be one of ordinary variety interest be serious rationally devout checked swearing from men under command rebuked although must not prevent in first mate who to annoy seldom made appearance on deck without making use of execration be mr berecroft custom to call down seaman into cabin evening read to short prayer although unusual ceremony often caused leer in of newly entered men be not only unattended ridiculed by jackson still whole conduct of berecroft be so completely in unison even most idle thoughtless acknowledged that be good man quitted ship with regret such be mr berecroft have little further to add except that be very superior to generality of master of merchant vessel family be reported be strict quaker jackson first mate be bull headed sandy haired northumbrian a before stated relation of owner never must have be permitted to remain in ship reader have already have insight into diabolical character will be sufficient to add that be coarse blustering in manner that never forgot never forgave injury gratitude be not in composition to gratify revenge must stop at nothing on third day brig be named eliza jane after two daughter of owner arrived at falmouth where anchored in outer road in company with thirty forty more who have assembled at appointed rendezvous on second day after arrival fifty gun ship frigate two corvette made appearance off mouth of harbour after due proportion of gun shotted not whole convoy be under weigh hove to round protector first step

remained behind made voyage how must be taken by enemy privateer who followed in wake of convoy few be carried into french port underwriter of policy eat little dinner on day brought intelligence of capture others be retaken by english blockading squadron who received then one eighth for salvage at last men of war be fairly running down trader with about twenty five of best sailor in company commodore deemed advisable to take particular care of few remained lest must be hauled over coal by admiralty nothing worth comment occurred during remainder of passage arrived safe at barbadoes when commodore brought in return to admiral complained bitterly of obstinacy of master of merchant vessel who must part company with in defiance of injunction in spite of powder fired away to enforce signal there certainly be fault somewhere during passage lasted seven week newton have ample opportunity of ascertaining situation master invariably treated with kindness consideration before voyage be completed treated a if be own son jackson lost opportunity of annoying insulting support of patron indemnified newton for conduct of first mate resolved to take notice of must not well be prevented on arrival at barbadoes mr berecroft went on shore to house of consignee then be that malignity of jackson broke out in violence brig have discharged cargo be lying in carlisle bay waiting for sugar be to be shipped for liverpool one morning when newton who for time have submitted to tyranny of jackson without complaint be standing at main hatchway giving direction to men below who be arranging dunnage at bottom of vessel first mate came on deck watching opportunity staggered with rope in hand against newton a if by accident so a to throw over coombings newton who must have immediately fallen to bottom of hold upon ballast at risk of life suddenly seized hold of first mate not in sufficient time to recover own balance so firmly a to drag jackson with down be precipitated together first mate having hold of one of rope leading down main mast clung fast to save in so doing also broke fall of newton weight of body dragged rope through jackson hand be lacerated to bone party be much hurt by fall so that treachery of jackson recoiled upon after specimen of animosity be duly reported to mr berecroft on return on board by seaman who detested jackson thing like foul play protector determined that newton must no longer be subjected to further violence at request of mr berecroft newton be invited to stay at house of mr kingston gentleman to whom vessel have be consigned offer be gladly accepted newton have not be many day on shore when mr kingston who have taken strong interest in proposed in answer to many question relative to slave trade that must make party to visit plantation proprietor of have be resident since youth judge for a to truth of report so industriously circulated by who be so inimical to employment of slave population volume one chapter

wafted to scene must little have imagined that be under torrid zone how different be from idea generally formed of climate in west indie observed newton in england couple with insufferable heat yellow fever report be from who seldom leave harbour town where such indeed prevail replied kingston there be island in caribbean sea where early riser may not enjoy delightful bracing atmosphere at jamaica

nothing swizzle here be health sir will show way large goblet be fixed to lip for upwards of minute at last unwillingly separated old planter recovered respiration with deep sigh now then gentleman do take little be afraid there be nothing may do in climate only be temperate check perspiration at moment newton be startled looked under table thought be dog be little black child oh there be one out

amused with distributing to child content of dish on table elder one nestling alongside of planter friend with greatest familiarity while youngest sat upright on floor laughing a devoured respective portion of course be slave observed mr berecroft yes bred replied planter indeed out of two hundred fifteen have on estate think that there be not more than twelve who be not born on property during father time mine perhaps a breakfast be over will like to inspect nursery planter led way into yard from child have entered be square of about two rood of ground three side of be enclosed by row of small house of two room most of be occupied by female slave nursing child at breast expecting very soon to have duty to perform received master with smiling face a addressed question to of when

inclined will go round work old planter in few minute walk brought to extensive row of detached cottage centred in piece of garden ground well stocked with yam sweet potato banana other tropical production poultry of description be scattered in profusion about place pig appeared to be abundant now captain be cottage of working slave garden ground be allowed to whatever can make by produce by pig poultry be own how be subsisted by ration a regularly served out a yours be on board of vessel have a much a can consume be single men mostly married to slave girl on estate wife live with unless breed then be removed up to nursery what work do exact from eight hour day except in cropt time then be very busy so that have plenty of leisure to look after own interest if choose do ever lay up much money very often enough to purchase freedom if wished if wished replied mr berecroft with surprise yes without explanation may appear strange to still more strange fact that freedom offered have often be refused man who be clever workman a carpenter other trade will purchase freedom if can because artisan can obtain very high wage here slave who if may use term be only common labourer must hardly support lay by nothing for old age be aware of have offered emancipation to one two who have grown old have refused now remain a heirloom on estate provided with thing doing little work if please saw that old man sweeping under portico well doe that day be have done for five year now if please will go through plantation visit sugar mill passed slave who be at work hoeing between cane certainly if estimate of condition be to be taken by noise laughter with beguiled labour be far from demanding pity must confess that there be something in cart whip like observed newton grant custom be not easily broken through do know substitute be badge of authority noise of be requisite to summon to labour with be seldom used for be not required if be captain of man of war must answer a did captain c to wit question much whether noisy whip be so mischievous a silent cat sugar mill stable of mule boiler cooler etcetera be examined party returned to plantation house well captain now have witnessed what be termed slavery what be opinion be philanthropist justified in invective against first assure that other plantation be a well regulated a own replied mr berecroft if not soon will be be interest of planter that must by like rest of world will be guided still there have be great act of cruelty committed quite enough to prepossess against a body grant that such have be case may occasionally be so now newspaper of england teem with act of barbarity men be same where sir be misfortune of world that never know when to stop abolition of slave trade be act of humanity worthy of country acting upon extended scale like england philanthropist not content with relieving black look forward to extermination of own countryman white who upon faith promise of nation be induced to embark capital in island doubtless wish to abolish slavery altogether replied berecroft must be content with having abolished horror of sir continued planter at time when mart be open must purchase slave to replace one have died from ill treatment disease life of slave be not of such importance to proprietor a be now moreover slave imported be adult who have be once free torn a be from natural soil home where slept in idleness throughout day be naturally morose obstinate sulky unwilling to work occasioned severe punishment heart of master being indurated by habit often led to act of barbarity slavery since abolition have assumed milder form be specie of bond slavery there be few slave in existence who have not be born upon estate consider that be more lawfully ours will explain what mean by more lawfully mean captain for instance that father of boy pointing to one of negro lad who waited at breakfast be slave that worked for until be old man then supported for many year until died mean that took care of boy mother who a bore child never did work after marriage have since be only expense to probably will continue to be so for year mean that boy be taken care of fed by until be ten year old without receiving return for expense incurred therefore consider that be indebted to a bond slave that be entitled to service in like manner when grows too old to work will become pensioner a father be before perceive drift of argument defend slavery generally consider man born free made slave be justified in resorting to mean to deliver slave have reared be lawfully slave bound to remain so unless can repay expense have incurred dinner be ready captain if wish to argue matter further must be over bottle of claret dinner be well dressed madeira claret only wine produced of best quality host did honour of table with true west indian hospitality circulating bottle after dinner with rapidity must soon have produced effect upon le prudent visitor when mr berecroft refused to take more wine ordered ingredient for arrack punch now mr forster must take tumbler of think that will pronounce excellent indeed replied newton nay will take denial be afraid may do thing please in climate only be temperate check perspiration well observed newton who placed tumbler of punch before promised to renew argument after dinner must like to hear what have to urge in defence of system never have heard defended before well replied host upon whom wine punch have begun to take effect just let fill tumbler again to keep lip moist then will prove to that slavery have existed from earliest time be not at variance with religion profess that have existed from earliest time need only refer to book of genesis that be not at variance with religion must refer to fourth commandment how can that part of commandment be construed stranger be within thy gate to whom can possibly apply to slave after directing that labour of household man servant maid servant must cease then proceeds to ox as stranger be within thy gate now gentleman can not be applied to stranger in literal sense of word hospitality of age forbidding that labour must be required of at time slave be brought from foreign land be source of traffic a may be inferred by readiness with ishmaelites purchased joseph of brother resold in egypt nay that slavery be permitted by almighty be fully proved by state of jewish nation until thought proper to bring out of house of bondage if then law of god provided against ill treatment of slave slavery be virtually acknowledged a not being contrary to divine will have further proof subsequent to mission of saviour that apostle considered slavery a lawful remember refer to paul sending back runaway slave onesimus well will admit replied mr berecroft who have great dislike to point of scripture being canvassed after dinner wish to know what inference must draw from be just coming to assert that property in slave be therefore a legally mine a property in land money that attempt to deprive of be equally robbery whether be made by nation by individual now sir allow to ask question show where liberty be run over class of society point out one man who be free mr berecroft who perceived effect of arrack punch must not refrain from laughing a replied well friend mr kingston be not free free not so free a slave boy who stand behind chair why be merchant whether life upon scale of princely expenditure whether wholesale retail banker proprietor of chandler shop be speculator anxious day sleepless night await upon speculation man with capital embarked who may be beggar on ensuing day can not lie down upon rose be slave of mammon who be greater slave than sailor so be soldier who hold employ under government so be politician be slave to tongue for opinion once expressed party once joined at age when reason be borne down by enthusiasm be fixed for life against conscience be unable to follow dictate without blasting character courtier be slave must acknowledge beg pardon interrupted kingston perceive that make distinction between enthralled by own consent against be distinction without difference replied planter even if be so be not in particular case fact be society enthralls be forced to obey law to regard custom to follow fashion of day to support worthless by poor rate to pay tax interest of debt others have contracted must go to prison prince ruler of land do include inquired newton be greatest of for meanest peasant have advantage over prince in point on most desire to be free that of choice in partner in life have none must submit to wish of people trammelled by custom must take to bed one whom can not take to heart well by account there be nobody free unless be liberty why sir rejoined planter to prove to be correct when asserted that there be such thing in world a liberty paradoxical a may appear liberty be liberty when in bondage release cease to exist have changed nature character for liberty unrestrained becomes licentiousness well said mr kingston laughing with rest at curious remark a have now arrived at climax with leave will go to bed have convinced demanded planter taking tumbler from lip at least have silenced now if please will put on coat retire to apartment yes do replied other who be not very steady do may check perspiration boy jack where be light good night gentleman negro led way to large room with two bed in for newton master of brig having first pointed out to that there be jug of sangoree suppose gentleman thirsty wished good night left room well newton said mr berecroft a soon a be alone what do think of planter think that considering constant advice to be temperate swallowed very large quantity of arrack punch did indeed what think of argument hardly can say except none of be sufficiently convincing to induce to be slave proprietor may perhaps a asserts have contented ourselves with shadow instead of substance even shadow of liberty be to be venerated by englishman agree with boy discourse did however bring one idea into head be that there be remarkable connection between religion slavery be in state of bondage that jew be prepared to receive promised land whenever fell off from true worship be punished by captivity be through mean of slavery that light of true faith be first brought to island where have burnt with purer flame than elsewhere for if recollect beauty of english child exposed for sale at rome assisted by latin pun caused introduction of christianity into great britain who know that traffic so offensive to humanity have be permitted by wise power with intent that day will be mean of introducing christianity into vast region of african idolatry true observed newton time may not be far distant that be impossible to calculate upon worketh by own mean be inscrutable be not cause of virtue desire vice might be le trammelled introduced reformation in more attempt to interfere with arrangement of almighty more will make evident own folly blindness unsearchable immutable wisdom good night boy newton forster by captain marryat volume one chapter fifteen lucy be wretch slave stanley sold posterity slave lucy o miserable fortune bland most of know better be born so only change master oroonoko party be up at early hour on ensuing morning that might enjoy delightful freshness of air so soon evaporates before

that yes sar that so then mean to say that if must go back to ashantee now must remain there yes sar stay there do work sleep day make woman feed how inveterate be early habit observed mr berecroft man although free in civilised country must return to idleness resume former ignorance so must slave not born in country requires one two generation to destroy savage nature replied kingston believe idleness like gout to be hereditary disease either in black white have often observed in latter now until man labour there be chance of civilisation improved a race of africa have be in island still think that if manumitted must starve in own country nature be so bountiful that little labour be required for support of life in island soil although luxuriant must be nurtured do then look forward to ultimate freedom inquired newton most assuredly already much have be done if not persecuted must be able willing to do much more public mind in england be certainly much inflamed against said berecroft be rather must say more numerous public composed of person unable to think for in consequence led by others styling philanthropist appearing to have very jesuitical idea with regard to truth have hesitation in asserting that if philanthropy have not be found to have be so very profitable never must have have so many votary true philanthropy like charity begin at home observe how paper teem with misery of lower class in england yet affect not west india philanthropist perceive not voice raised in behalf of suffering countryman pas beggar in street heed not cry of starvation at home where raise petition for emancipation in fact for destruction of property of others that be invidious property grant wish must dispose of mine be not so easy ancestor embarked capital in island upon faith promise of country when opinion be very different from what be now can not help myself how time will come when england will bitterly rue having listened to suggestion outcry of interested people understand how do mean said before that be on faith of country that embarked property in island be not perhaps aware that when in reign of queen anne assiento treaty be made by obtained privilege of supplying island with slave be considered a one of most important acquisition must be obtained public opinion have now changed if nation change opinion must at same time be just let country take estate negro at fair valuation will be most happy to surrender if free slave without so doing be guilty of robbery injustice infringes on constitution of country protects property will of course allow to decide upon own measure may inquire what must be throwing off yoke declaring independent putting under protection of america who will gladly receive aware that will be source not only of wealth of security must america risk war to obtain island must be foolish not to do so england must be more than foolish to engage in one be true that if not immediately supported by america england might create scene of confusion bloodshed in colony world have too often have severe lesson colony once detaching be never to be regained england must therefore be only entailing useless expense however gratifying might be to feeling of revenge do think that be likely to occur do most certainly if who govern continue to listen to insidious advice of party denominated saint afraid that will not be until island be separated from mother country that will appreciate value resolution once formed white slave for slave be will not flinch island of caribbean sea will be enrolled a star add stripe to independent flag be natural protector trust will never come to pas so do mr berecroft for be englishman love country loss of colony must be blow from england must never recover forget extensive colony in east west indie add to wealth commercial prosperity to nursery of seaman exhausted revenue on contrary add only to grandeur for cost country three million year doubt whether at expense be worth while to retain colony however vast extensive may be consider if east india port be open to world territory governed by former prince england with competition must take place must yet be gainer on other hand know that by loss of island must find decrease of million in revenue then philanthropist must pay national debt observed newton laughing be damned replied kingston who be warm with argument must not pay farthing volume one chapter sixteen sea breach vessel can no longer bear flood o'er burst in dread career labouring hull already seems half fill 'd with water through hundred leak distill 'd thus drench 'd by wave riven deck stript defenceless float naked wreck falconer newton remained at bridgetown under roof of mr kingston for more than three week by time brig be laden waiting for convoy to proceed to england mr berecroft have made preparation for voyage when unexpected circumstance occurred eventually proved occasion of great hardship danger to newton be master of large ship belonging to same owner then lying in carlisle bay to proceed homeward by same convoy have so ingratiated with wealthy widow residing upon island that rather than must again trust to fickle element have be induced to surrender up to plantation negro fair self equally bound to honour obey through future life mr berecroft in consequence of resignation of brother captain be appointed to command of larger vessel jackson first mate ordered to take command of eliza jane be sad blow to newton one must not avoid a mr berecroft must not take in new ship sub ordinate situation being already filled up at first be inclined to quit brig by advice of mr berecroft kingston be persuaded to go passage home a be now first mate of vessel must incur forfeiture of wage if broke article have signed at liverpool unpleasant a prospect be be further induced by berecroft assurance now jackson be provided for must arrange with owner that newton must be appointed first mate of own ship a soon a arrived in england in few day men of war made appearance newton who have remained on shore until last moment shook hand with friendly patron thanking mr kingston for kindness went on board of vessel with sorrowful foreboding heart be at inclined to cheer up a stepped on deck of brig beheld jackson with handspike still brandishing over head standing across body of one of seaman whom have just dashed to deck with implement in hand at sight of wrath of new captain appeared to be increased eyed malevolently then observed with sneer be what skulker may expect on board of vessel newton made answer jackson went forward where remainder of crew be heaving up anchor with windlass newton walked up to seaman who appeared still insensible examined iron plate at end of handspike have cut deep into skull there be appearance of contusion of brain calling boy who attended cabin newton with assistance carried man below laid in berth then repaired on deck took helm anchor of brig being trip in quarter of hour sail be on followed course steered by men of war who be about to run through other island pick up several vessel who be for protection if expect easy berth a first mate be mistaken joker said jackson to newton a steered vessel have skulked long enough will now work double tide take consequence if will be damned will do duty mr jackson replied newton fear consequence indeed saw how settled skulk just now beware of fate anticipate fear jackson if come to hand spike two can play at game rather think that before many hour be over will be sorry for violence for believe man to be in considerable danger even now must recommend to demand surgical assistance from frigate demand if dare be captain of ship sir rascal may die be damned to disgusting speech newton made reply have made up mind to put up with thing short of downright aggression for three day more obeyed order however arbitrary however annoying during period man who have be injured became gradually worse illness increased rapidly on fifth day became delirious in state of high fever when newton again pointed out propriety of asking surgical aid from one of men of war suggestion be answered by jackson who be now really alarmed with volley of oath execration ending with fiat refusal crew of brig murmured collected together forward looking occasionally at men of war a spoke in whisper to other be afraid of jackson violence none ventured to speak out jackson paced deck in state of irritation excitement a listened to raving of victim be loud enough to be heard over vessel a evening closed men taking opportunity of jackson going below went up to newton who be walking aft stated determination that next morning whether master consented to not must hail frigate demand surgical assistance for shipmate in midst of colloquy jackson who hearing noise overhead of people coming aft have suspicion of cause have be listening at bottom of ladder to what be said came up hatchway accusing newton of attempting to raise mutiny ordered immediately to cabin stating intention of sending on board of frigate next morning to be placed in confinement will obey order replied a be in command of vessel only hope that will adhere to resolution of communicating with frigate so saying descended companion hatch jackson who from information of cabin boy fact that incoherent raving of victim became hourly more feeble thought in jeopardy have such intention a night closed in remained on deck gradually taking off first one sail then until brig be left far astern of rest of convoy next morning there be other vessel in sight then on pretence of rejoining made sail at same time changing course so a to pas between two of island newton be only one on board who understood navigation besides jackson therefore only one who must prove that be escaping from convoy be in confinement below men may have be suspicion must not prove that be not steering a ought about twelve o'clock on day poor sailor breathed last jackson who be prepared for event have already made up mind how to proceed men murmured proposed securing jackson a prisoner offering command to newton went below made proposal to refused observing that until be proved by law of land that jackson have murdered shipmate be not guilty therefore have right to dispossess of command until evidence must be taken by of authority must remain further pointing out to that a must be seized immediately upon arrival at english port falling in with man of war during passage end of justice must be equally answered a if committed by taking law into own hand men although not satisfied acquiesced returned to duty on deck jackson conduct towards be now quite altered not only treated with lenity supplied with extra liquor other indulgence a captain must command newton however still detained under arrest watching most carefully time that be necessitated to come on deck fact be jackson aware that life must be forfeited to law of country have resolved to wreck brig upon one of reef to northward then take to boat escape to one of french island at instigation body of man have be thrown overboard by of crew when be in state of half intoxication newton who have be below four day have retired a usual to hammock when sudden shock accompanied by fall of mast by board woke from sound sleep to horror of shipwreck water pouring rapidly through side of vessel proved to that there be chance of escape except by boat shriek so awful when raised in gloom of night by seaman anticipating immediate death hurried footstep above confusion of many voice with heavy blow from wave against side of vessel told that danger be imminent even if escape be possible drew on trouser rushed to door of cabin merciful heaven what be surprise horror to find that be fastened outside moment thought at malignity of wretch for be indeed jackson who during night have taken such step for destruction be followed by exertion to escape placing shoulder against sea chest foot against door body in nearly horizontal position made violent effort to break open door lock gave way door did not open more than one two inch for jackson to make sure have coiled down against hawser lay few yard further forward in steerage weight of strength of five men must remove maddened with idea of perishing by such treachery newton again exerted frantic effort again again without success between pause voice of seaman asking for oar other article belonging to long boat proved to that moment of delay be nail in coffin again again be effort repeated with almost superhuman strength door remained fixed a ever at last occurred to that hawser have previously ascertained by passing hand through small aperture have made might only lay against lower part of door that upper part might be free applied strength above found door to yield by repeated attempt at last succeeded in kicking upper panel to piece having forced body through aperture newton rushed on deck with little strength have remaining men boat be not there hailed heard not strained eye have disappeared in gloom of night newton overcome with exhaustion disappointment fell down senseless on deck volume one chapter seventeen paladore have heard have read bold fable of enormity devised to make men wonder confirm abhorrence of nature hardness transcends fiction law of lombardy must now relate what have occurred on deck during struggle of newton to escape from prison at one o'clock jackson have calculated that in hour le brig must strike on reef took helm from man who be steering told that might go below previous to have be silently occupied in coiling hawser before door of newton cabin being intention to desert brig with seaman in long boat leave newton to perish when brig dashed upon reef did with great violence crew hurried upon deck jackson who be calm immediately proceeded to give order have already arranged in mind coolness with be given quieted alarm of seaman allowed time to recall scattered sens however proved unfortunate to jackson have hurried in boat at once shoved off must in probability have be permitted to go with newton in hurry of self preservation must have be forgotten cool behaviour restored confidence unhappily for gave seaman time to reflect one be in boat for jackson have quietly prepared put into what considered requisite when one of men called out for newton damn newton now save own life lad quick in boat of not without mr newton cried men unanimously jump down tom williams see where be must sleep devilish sound sailor sprung down companion hatch where found hawser coiled against door heard newton struggling inside be enough hastened on deck told companion adding that must take hour to get poor fellow out be longer than dare stay for in ten minute brig will be to piece be murdering rascal who did cried man to jackson tell what lad if poor mr newton be to die let scoundrel keep company general shout proclaimed acquiescence of other seaman in act of retributive justice jackson with loud oath attempted to spring into boat be repelled by seaman again made attempt with dreadful imprecation be on plane sheer of brig about to make spring when blow from handspike same handspike with have murdered unfortunate seaman struck senseless fell back into lee scupper boat then shoved off have not gained more than two cable length from vessel when newton effected escape ran on deck a narrated in last chapter brig have now beat up so high on reef that remained firmly fixed upon tide having ebbed considerably be le exposed to beating of wave sun be also about to make appearance be broad daylight when jackson first came to recollection brain whirled idea be confused have faint reminiscence of what have occurred felt that water washed foot with sort of instinct rose staggered up to windward in so doing without perceiving stumbled over body of newton who also be roused up by shock few moment passed before must regain scattered sens at same time sitting up on deck at about yard distant discovered recognised other newton be more collected of two for jackson insensibility have be occasioned by bodily by mental concussion effect of blow be still felt by jackson although recovered from stupor dull heavy sensation affected eyesight confused idea sight of newton went far to recover jackson who started up a if to grapple with object of hatred newton be on leg at same moment retreating seized upon handspike lay on deck close to where jackson have be struck down placed in attitude of defence not word be exchanged between remained few minute in position when jackson whose brain be affected by violence of feeling dropped down upon deck in renewed state of insensibility newton have now time to look about prospect be thing cheering be almost low water in direction perceived reef of coral rock large bank of sand with deep channel between through tide flowed rapidly reef upon brig have be grounded be of sharp coral in deeper part tree must be discerned extending submarine forest of bough be evident that reef upon vessel lay be a well a most of others covered at high water a mean of escape small boat be still hanging over stern newton be able to manage either with sail oar a might be required a there be time to be lost only chance of escape remained with boat newton commenced arrangement mast sail be found latter bent keg be filled with water compass taken out of binnacle few piece of beef bread collected in bag thrown in also procured bottle of wine cider from cabin stowed away carefully in little locker be fitted under stern sheet of boat in hour thing be ready throwing into piece of spare rope small grapnel to anchor with there being still sufficient water alongside to float newton gradually lowered one tackle then until boat be safe in water then hauled up alongside made fast by painter stepped mast be now ready to leave jackson to be washed away by returning tide when brig must unquestionably go to piece newton must not do true have sought life still displayed most inveterate rancour towards newton felt convinced that future opportunity must occur that enemy must not profit by to insure destruction yet to leave murderer with sin upon soul to be launched so unprepared into presence of offended creator be impossible be contrary to nature to religion professed how must hope for divine assistance in perilous undertaking when embarked on regardless of precept to forgive enemy newton ascended to part of deck where jackson laid roused jackson awoke a from deep sleep then stared at newton who a precaution held handspike in hand mr jackson said newton have roused to let know that boat be now ready that be going to shove off jackson who recollected scene of previous night perceived newton standing over with handspike appeared wholly unnerved in point of muscular power newton be superior independent of weapon in possession not without not without cried jackson raising upon knee for mercy sake mr newton leave to horrid death must have left to one even more dreadful replied newton beg pardon pardon mr be drunk at time indeed be know what do when be in liquor leave will obey order do thing wish will wait upon a servant will indeed mr newton ask that will obey order wait upon replied newton request be that will lay aside wanton animosity exert to save life for what have already attempted against may god forgive a do for what may hereafter attempt will find prepared now follow into boat without further exchange of word newton followed by jackson went into boat shoved off weather be moderate wind light there be two islet newton have marked apparently be not covered at high water one about ten mile distant in supposed direction of land for newton have shrewdly guessed locality of reef other about two mile from first further out with tree growing to water edge to latter newton proposed pulling waiting there until next morning when be in boat newton finding that wind be contrary unshipped mast taking foremost oar that jackson might not sit behind desired to take other tide be now flood swept out to southward obliged to pull at angle to reach intended destination be not until sunset that with great exertion fetched island nearest to land not one be covered with tree a have tended a soon a boat be secured exhausted with fatigue threw down on sand where remained for time having recovered little newton procured from boat of supply required after satisfying hunger in silence lay down to repose newton who be still afraid of jackson diabolical enmity silence implied to be again at work closed eye pretended for time to be asleep a soon a be dark rose first listening to breathing of comrade who appeared to be in sound slumber walked away from about one hundred yard so that must be difficult to find placed handspike under head for pillow worn out with mental bodily fatigue be soon in state of oblivion sleep although profound for three four hour be subsequently restless mind when agitated watch for body wake at time when must be on alert newton woke up be not yet daylight be hushed turned round intending to get up immediately yet yielding to impulse of wearied nature again slumbered once thought that heard footstep roused listened be quiet still except light wave rippling on sand again be roused by sort of grating noise listened be quiet third time be roused by sound like flapping of sail listened be sure of sprung upon foot be dawn of day a turned eye towards beach perceived to horror that boat be indeed under sail jackson who be in then just hauling aft mainsheet steering away from island newton ran to beach plunged into sea attempted to regain boat be soon out of depth boat running away fast through water shouted to jackson a last attempt scoundrel waved hand in ironical adieu continued course treacherous villain mentally exclaimed newton a eye followed boat be for preserved life in return for attempt on mine here then must die of starvation god will be done aloud a sat down on beach covered face with hand volume one chapter eighteen for now stand a one upon rock environed with wilderness of sea who mark waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when envious surge will in brinish bowel swallow shakespeare tide be on ebb when newton be left in desolate situation after minute passed in bitterness of spirit natural courage returned although chance of preservation be next to hopeless newton rose up resolved that must use best effort trust to providence for success first idea be to examine beach see if jackson have left portion of provision have put into boat there be nothing then walked along beach following receding tide with hope of collecting shell fish might be left upon sand here again be disappointed be evident therefore that to stay on islet be to starve only chance appeared to remain in capability of reaching islet next to a have before mentioned be covered with tree there at least might find mean of sustenance be able with wood to make raft if nothing better must turn up in favour tide swept down towards islet ran so strong that there be chance of being carried past therefore determined to wait for hour two until strength of current be diminished then make attempt interval be passed in strengthening mind against horror of almost positive death stared in face be about hour before low water newton walked into sea commending to providence struck out for islet keeping course well to windward to allow for tide sweeping down to use nautical phrase held own extremely well until reached centre of channel where water ran with great velocity bore down rapidly with stream newton struggled hard for be aware that strength of current once passed labour must be comparatively easy so proved a neared shore of islet made good way have be carried down so far when in centre of stream that became nice point even to calculation of hope whether must fetch extreme point of islet newton redoubled exertion when within thirty yard of shore eddy assisted made sure of success when within ten yard counter current again caught swept down be now abreast of very extreme point of islet bush hung over water be only hope with three four desperate stroke exhausted remaining strength at same time that seized hold of small bough be decayed snapped asunder newton be whirled away by current into broad ocean how constantly do find people running into real danger to avoid imaginary evil mother will not permit child to go to sea lest must be drowned few day afterwards be kicked to death by horse have child be permitted to go afloat might have lived run through usual term of existence wherever be wherever may go there be death

angry surge swallow up in wrath believe after that a many sailor in proportion run out allotted span a rest of world be engaged in other apparently le dangerous profession although must be acknowledged that occasionally do become food for fish there be tide in affair of men say shakespeare certainly of tide that ever interfered in man prospect swept away newton forster appeared to be least likely to lead to fortune such however be case have newton gained islet coveted must have perished miserably whereas will soon appear that although suffering be not yet ended being carried away be most fortunate circumstance must have occurred proved mean of ultimate preservation newton have resigned to fate ceased from further exertion except such a be necessary to keep above water little longer throwing on back appealed to heaven for pardon a floated away with stream that newton have a few error folly to answer for a most people be most certain yet even most perfect soon run up long account during life sin be forgotten a be time at be committed when death be certain appears to be so be then that memory becomes most horribly perfect item of monstrous bill requires few second to be read to be acknowledged a too correct be horror of death be make body struggle to retain soul already pluming rustling wing impatient for flight be constitutes pang of separation a enfeebled body gradually relaxes hold be over at least on side of grave newton strength be exhausted eye be fixed on clear blue sky a if to bid farewell resigned to fate be about to give over last few painful effort be aware must only prolong not save life when received blow on shoulder under water imagining that proceeded from tail of shark of other of ravenous monster of deep abound among island that next moment body must be severed in half uttered faint cry at accumulated horror of death next moment leg be swung round by current perceived to astonishment that be aground upon one of sand bank abounded on reef over tide be running with velocity of sluice floundered then rose found in about one foot of water ebb tide be nearly finished be one of bank never showed above water except during full change of moon be now about nine o'clock in morning sun shone with great power newton faint from want of sustenance hardly knew whether to consider temporary respite a advantage knew that tide must soon flow again felt that strength be too much spent to enable to swim back to islet have missed when have attempted to reach be more than two mile from bank upon then stood what chance have then to be swept away by return of tide almost regretted that have not be shark instead of sand bank have struck must then have be spared few hour of protracted misery a newton have foreseen ebb tide be soon over short pause of slack water ensued there be evident rapid increase of water around wind too freshened surface of ocean be in strong ripple a water deepened so did wave increase in size moment added to despair have now remained about four hour on bank water have risen to underneath arm wave nearly lifted off foot be with difficulty that must retain position hope deserted sens became confused thought that saw green field city inhabitant reason be departing saw father coming down to with tide called to for help when actual sight of something recalled from temporary aberration there be dark object upon water evidently approaching respiration be almost suspended a watched coming at last distinguished that must either be whale asleep boat bottom up fortunately for newton proved to be latter at last be brought down by tide to within few yard of appeared to be checked newton dashed out towards boat in minute be safely astride upon a soon a have recovered little from agitation perceived that be very boat belonging to brig in jackson have so treacherously deserted left on island at three o'clock be high water at five water have again retreated so that newton must quit station on bottom of boat walk round then righted discovered that mast have be carried away close to step with sail still remained fast to boat by main sheet have jammed on belaying pin so that still be serviceable thing else have be lost out of boat except grapnel have be bent hanging down in water from boat being capsized have brought up when be floated on sand bank newton who have eaten drank since night before be again in despair tormented a be by insufferable thirst when observed that locker under stern sheet be closed hastened to pull open found that bottle of wine cider have deposited there be remaining bottle of latter be soon poured down throat newton felt a if restored to former vigour at seven o'clock in evening boat be nearly high dry newton baled out fixing grapnel firmly in sand lay down to sleep in stern sheet covered over with sail sleep be so sound that did not wake until six o'clock next morning when boat be again aground refreshed with wine meditated upon prospect thanking heaven for renewed chance of escape lamenting over fate of unprepared jackson who have evidently be upset from main sheet having be jammed newton resolved to make for one of english isle knew to be about two hundred mile distant oar have be lost rudder of boat be fortunately made fast by pennant in afternoon drew up grapnel made sail in direction a well a must judge from position of sun to english isle a night closed in watched star steered course by next day came although boat sailed well went fast before free wind land be in sight newton have again recourse to cider wine second night must hardly keep eye open yet wearied a be still continued course never quitted helm day again dawned newton strength be gone from constant watching still bore up against until sun have set land be yet to be seen sleep overpowered took hitch of main sheet round finger must breeze freshen might be roused in case must go to sleep having taken precaution in few minute boat be steering end of first volume volume two chapter one man proud man dress 'd in little brief authority most ignorant of what be most assured glassy essence like angry ape play such fantastic trick before high heaven shakespeare reef upon brig have be wrecked be one of extending along southward of virgin isle newton have intended to steer well to eastward with view of reaching one of northernmost english colony not having compass naturally be not very equal in course fact be that steered well to southward of after fell asleep boat ran away still farther off course for be on larboard tack having weight in except newton who be aft in stern sheet did not feel inclined to keep wind newton sleep be so profound that pulling of main sheet held with round turn round hand dancing of boat during night have run fast before increasing breeze roused from lethargy on sailed boat left to steerage of providence on slept newton a if putting firm reliance on same be not until break of day that repose be very abruptly broken by shock threw from stern sheet of boat right over aftermost thwart newton recovered leg sens found alongside of vessel have run stem on to small schooner be lying at anchor a boat be drifting fast by newton made spring gained deck of vessel ah mon dieu le anglois le anglois nous somme prisonniers cried out only man on deck jumping on foot making precipitate dive below vessel of newton have thus taken possession be one employed in carrying sugar from plantation round to basseterre port of guadaloupe there to be shipped for europe newton boat having run away so far to southward a to make island be lying at anchor off mouth of small river waiting for cargo happened that crew of schooner who be slave be exactly in same situation a newton when vessel came in contact viz fast asleep shock have wakened be below except one who have kept remarkably good watch exhausted a newton be must not smile at uninterrupted possession of vessel deck anxious to have communication with people on board sat down awaiting coming up from below in minute two black head be seen to rise slowly fearfully out of fore scuttle then disappeared rose up went down again a before thus went on until newton reckoned ten different face having individually ascertained that there be one man one not provided with weapon negro assumed degree of courage first head have made appearance woolly hair of be of grizzly grey from age be again popped up fore scuttle with interrogatory to newton in french who be what wanted newton who did not understand word of language shook head opening hand extending arm to show that have mean of defence beckoned to to come up man head have again disappeared after little demur nine ten negro crawled up out of fore scuttle one after with weapon by way of security remained on forecastle of vessel until last be up then at nod given by grizzle headed leader advanced aft in body towards newton newton rose pointed to boat have now drifted about quarter of mile astern then made sign to give to understand that have be wrecked apparemment c'est un pauvre miserable qui fait naufrage observed old negro who appeared to have charge of vessel gustave adolphe tu parles bien l'anglois demandez lui le nouvelles continued old man folding arm across looking very big indeed a reclined against mainmast of vessel gustave adolphe stood forward from rest of negro be short fat shiny faced fellow with hair platted into about fifty little tail first bowed to old commander then placing arm akimbo walked up to newton looking full in face commenced duty of interpreter a follows say god dam newton smiled oui monsieur c'est un anglois continuez gustave adolphe replied old negro with majestic air gustave adolphe with bow resumed say where com barbadoes replied newton monsieur il vient de barbadoes continuez gustave adolphe replied superior with wave of hand say where go where go replied newton go to bottom monsieur il alloit au port de bo tom bo tom repeated old negro ou diable est ca here general consultation be held by appeared that port have never be heard of in west indie gustave adolphe demandez lui si c'est un port anglois say bo tom english port replied newton amused with mistake must rather call neutral c'est un port neutral monsieur gustave adolphe demandez lui de quelle ile say what isle bo tom newton who be faint with hunger thirst be not inclined at moment to continue conversation otherwise must have be source of amusement replied by making sign that wished to eat drink monsieur said gustave adolphe to old negro le prisonnier refuse de faire reponse et demande manger et boire va l'en chercher gustave adolphe replied old man allons monsieur continued addressing other negro il faut lever l'ancre de suite et amener notre prisonnier aux autorites charles philippe va chercher mon porte voix negro captain walked up down deck of schooner vessel about thirty foot long until charles philippe made appearance with speaking trumpet then proceeded to get vessel under weigh with more noise fuss than be to be heard when proudest three decker in english navy expands lofty canvas to gale gustave adolphe in obedience to command have received brought up to newton bunch of banana large piece of salt fish calabash of water latter be immediately applied to lip never removed while drop remained much to astonishment of negro who again

source of amusement amply repaid for trouble kindness have shown to be in fact general favourite with one on plantation from highest to lowest presence received same smile of welcome at cottage of slave a at boudoir of madame de fontanges may have be result of newton observation relative to slavery in english colony feeling of dislike insensibly wore away during residence at lieu desiree there be at least convinced that slave might be perfectly happy must be acknowledged that french have invariably proved kindest most considerate of master state of bondage be much mitigated in island appertain to nation reason be obvious in france there be bonhommie degree of equality established between different grade of society by universal politeness french servant be familiar with master at same time that be respectful master in return condescends to inferior without forgetting relative position run through society in general a one can well be polite without good nature for politeness frivolous a may appear be strong check upon feeling of selfishness too apt to be indulged in lead to general feeling of good will towards others have naturally be practised by frenchman wherever may be consequence be that slave be treated with more consideration in return have warmer feeling of attachment towards owner than be to be found in colony belonging to other nation newton perceived acknowledged comparing condition of people at lieu desiree with of most of peasantry of europe be unwillingly obliged to confess that former be in respect more fortunate more happy of two one morning soon after newton have breakfasted with monsieur de fontanges have be summoned to boudoir letter be brought in be from governor to monsieur de fontanges stating that have heard with great surprise

have incurred heavy debt of gratitude to for having preserved so long from prison that remembrance of kindness must tend to beguile tedious hour of captivity from may appear that newton in point of expressing be frenchman already then kissed hand of madame de fontanges tried to console little slave girl who be au desespoir patted cupidon on head by way of farewell quitted boudoir in have passed so many happy hour when be outside again expressed obligation to monsieur de fontanges who then stated determination to call upon brother governor try to alleviate hardship of lot a much a be possible in le than hour newton in company with host be on road to basse terre leaving corporal two file of men to walk back a fast a must corporal having sufficient savoir vivre not to refuse pledge of governor brother for safe delivery of prisoner be not until late in evening that arrived at basse terre when immediately proceeded to house of governor be admitted to presence governor who have be much displeased at circumstance of newton having remained so long on island be more pacified when monsieur de fontanges explained to way in have be made prisoner hardship have previously endured monsieur de fontanges accounted for long detention at lieu desiree by stating real fact viz pertinacity of madame de fontanges although might have be considered very poor argument in england have due weight in french colony governor entered into conversation with newton who detailed to horror of shipwreck have undergone narrative appeared to affect much told newton that under such circumstance must hardly consider a prisoner must take first opportunity of releasing must accept parole for not quitting island newton returned thanks for so much courtesy withdrew in company with monsieur de

successor being hourly expected frigate in new governor have embarked be taken by english squadron brother be forced to remain here then property must undoubtedly belong to marquis replied newton only wish must have be able to assure that wife child be equally safe be afraid be impossible a there can be doubt that be lost do mean to communicate what have told to marquis by mean will only tear open wound have partially healed if will send particular when return will feel much obliged not that effect be of consequence marquise child be undoubtedly lost must be consolation to brother to ascertain that trunk of effect have be saved here conversation dropped be never again renewed newton be heartily welcomed again at lieu desiree where remained three week when note from governor informed that cartel be about to sail be with mutual pain that newton kind friend took farewell of other in instance monsieur de fontanges did not accompany to basse terre bade adieu at own door newton soon after be on road perceived that monsieur de fontanges have acted from motive of delicacy that might not receive thanks of newton for two valise well furnished overtook newton about quarter of mile from plantation slung on side of horse under guidance of little negro perched on middle newton made acknowledgment to governor for kind consideration then embarked on board of marie therese schooner in three day once more found on shore in english colony with piece of information conclude chapter volume two chapter four mercy on bairn very pretty bairn boy child shakespeare when newton be landed from cartel at jamaica found advantage of not being clad in garb of sailor a who be in such costume be immediately handed over to admiral of station to celebrate restoration to liberty on board of man of war clothes supplied to by generosity of monsieur de fontanges have thing maritime appearance newton be landed with portmanteau by one of man of war boat whose crew have little idea of being person so peculiarly suited to view possessing a did necessary qualification of youth activity thorough knowledge of profession newton be so anxious to return home that after few day expensive sojourn at hotel frequented chiefly by officer of man of war in port resolved to apply to captain of frigate ordered home with despatch to permit to take passage have formed slight intimacy with of officer who assured that must experience difficulty in obtaining request application be made in person after statement that have be released in last cartel have come from guadaloupe request be immediately granted without farther question being put relative to profession manner in have be captured captain very civilly gave to understand that might mess with gun room officer if must arrange with that expected to sail on evening of ensuing day newton immediately repaired on board of frigate to ascertain if officer must receive a messmate further whether amount of mess money must be more than must in prudence afford at bottom of one of portmanteau have found bag of two hundred dollar supplied by generous host in same bag there be also deposited small note from madame de fontanges wishing success enclosing a souvenir ring have often perceived on finger adequate a be supply to own want newton did not forget that father be in probability in great distress must require assistance on return be therefore naturally anxious not to expend more than be absolutely necessary in defraying passage old first lieutenant to whom upon arrival on board be introduced a commanding officer received with much urbanity when newton stated that have obtained captain permission to make application immediately acceded to wish on part of messmate a well a of when newton followed up application by requesting to know expense must incur a in case of being greater than finance must meet must request permission to choose le expensive mess be aware replied veteran that who have be shipwrecked in french prison be not likely to be very flush of cash be however point on must consult messmate excuse one moment will bring answer have doubt that will be satisfactorily arranged there be nothing like settling point at once mr webster see that lighter shove off moment that be clear continued first lieutenant to one of midshipman a descended quarter deck ladder leaving newton to walk quarter deck in few minute first lieutenant reappeared with one two others of gun room mess who greeted most cordially have seen be requisite said to newton two have not spoken to master purser be poor men with family if therefore will not be too proud to accept be requested to offer free passage from other officer of mess a feel convinced that company will more than repay proportion of expense of passage to other two will be one two pound trifle indeed still of consequence to be only expense will incur if can afford to pay that time after arrival in england will be most happy to receive make passage a comfortable pleasant a circumstance will permit to most liberal proposition newton most gladly acceded officer who have come on deck with first lieutenant invited newton below where be introduced to remainder of mess who be most of fine young men a happy careless a if youth be to last for ever having pledged other in glass of grog newton returned on shore next morning made arrangement paid bill at hotel before twelve o'clock be again on board of frigate lay with blue peter hoisted fore topsail loose waiting for captain who be still detained on shore while admiral governor made up despatch when newton have applied to captain of frigate for passage home must hardly believe possible that person to whom be introduced must be entrusted with command of so fine vessel be slight made fair complexioned lad of nineteen twenty year at most without incipient mark of manhood on chin appeared lively active good natured be other qualification possessed to discover mark of confidence be to newton enigma requiring solution be however to be explained in very few word be son of admiral of station a at period there be regulation with respect to age to check most rapid promotion after have served time a midshipman in le than two month have be raised through different rank of lieutenant commander post captain on receiving latter step be at same time appointed to frigate in question one of finest belonged to majesty service in order however that must to certain degree be in leading string very old efficient officer have be selected by admiral a first lieutenant whether in common justice captain subordinate ought not to have changed place leave reader to guess be more unfair towards worthy old first lieutenant a if admiral have not entertained high opinion of ability judgment a to confide to charge of son must long before have be promoted to one of many vacancy so repeatedly occurred captain carrington have fault if not inherent will naturally be acquired by who be too early intrusted with power be

farce used to be york be wanted about hour before sunset juvenile captain made appearance on board rather fresh from taking leave of companion acquaintance on shore frigate be got under weigh by first lieutenant before sun have disappeared be bounding over foaming sea in direction of country have nurtured to maturity gnarled oak selected for beautiful frame newton joined new messmate in drinking prosperous passage to old england with heart grateful for improved prospect retired to hammock have be prepared for when newton rose in morning found that wind have shifted contrary during night that

country at stake running small risk of being tarnished if frigate met with vigorous opponent be true that officer must now serve certain time in various grade before promotion time a supposed to be sufficient for to acquire knowledge of profession whether knowledge be obtained depends a before upon young officer prospect in life if from family interest be sure of promotion be not quite so sure of being seaman thank god be now over judicious regulation have put stop to such selfish short sighted patronage selfish because who be guilty of risked honour of nation to advance interest of protege

for instruction must in probability be read always make rule to skip over part introduced in light work be of denser material than rest can not expect that others will do same there be time place for thing like master of ravenscourt bide time frigate dashed gallantly through water at one time careening to adverse wind at rolling before favouring gale to judge from rapid motion be not in such very

overboard echoed round deck while of officer men jumped into quarter boat off gripe lashing captain carrington who be immediately sobered by catastrophe felt have be occasioned by own wilfulness ran aft to taffrail when saw poor sailor struggling in wave impelled by really fine nature darted overboard to save be not by mean powerful swimmer encumbered with apparel be soon evident that must do more than keep afloat newton who perceived how matter stood with great presence of mind caught up two of oar from boat hanging astern darted over to assistance of one oar first carried to seaman who be exhausted sinking placing under arm then swam with other to captain carrington who must not have remained above water few second more without timely relief then quietly swam by side of captain carrington without attempt at extra exertion boat be soon lowered down in few minute be three again on board in safety captain carrington thanked newton for assistance acknowledged error to first lieutenant officer men looked upon newton with respect increased goodwill sailor declared that captain be prime little fellow although have have edication nothing worthy of remark occurred during remainder of passage ship arrived at plymouth newton took leave of friendly shipmate captain carrington requesting that newton must command interest that have if ever must be required be with throbbing heart that newton descended from outside of coach conveyed to liverpool hastened towards obscure street in left father residing be about four o'clock in afternoon when newton arrived at father door to delight perceived through shop window that father be sitting at bench joy be checked when perceived haggard countenance old man appeared to be absorbed in deep thought cheek resting upon hand eye cast down upon little bench to vice used to be fixed from be now removed door be ajar newton entered with portmanteau in hand noise might have made be not sufficient to rouse nicholas who continued in same position with one glance round shop newton perceived that be bare of thing even glazed case on counter contained spectacle etcetera have disappeared bespoke same tale a did appearance of father misery starvation dearest father cried newton unable to contain longer how what cried nicholas starting at voice not looking round pho nonsense be dead continued old man communing with a again settled into former position dearest father be not dead look round 't be newton alive well newton replied old man rising from stool tottering to counter be between on laid hand to support a looked into son face 't be newton sure enough dear dear boy then dead indeed father be alive well thank god thank god too said nicholas dropping face on counter bursting into tear newton sprung over to side where father be embraced for time be locked in other arm when nicholas who have recovered composure looked at newton said be hungry dear boy yes indeed be replied newton smiling a tear coursed down cheek for have have nothing since breakfast have have nothing for two day replied nicholas leaning back to wall in evident exhaustion good god say so cried newton where can buy something ready cooked at shop round corner there be nice piece of boiled beef there saw yesterday offered improvement on duplex for slice must not trust even for newton ran out in few minute re appeared with beef in question bread pot of porter with two plate knife fork people have lent upon putting down deposit laid on counter before father who without saying word commenced repast beef disappeared bread vanished porter pot be raised to mouth in moment be dry never made better dinner newton observed nicholas wish there have be little more of newton who have only be spectator immediately went out for supply on return assisted father in demolition newton said nicholas who for few moment have relinquished task have be thinking must like slice of beef newton a said before will trouble for porter volume two chapter five orlando then forbear food little while while like doe go to find fawn give food there be poor old roan oppressed with two weak evil age hunger shakespeare reader be ever really hungry mean common hunger arising from health exercise have mean of appeasing at moment when may be considered source of pleasure rather than of pain refer to gnawing of starvation because if have not can form conception of agony of suffering fortunately very few of reader can have knowledge of general sympathy creates be from ideal not practical knowledge have be lot during vicissitude of maritime life to have suffered hunger to extremity although impossible to express corporeal agony yet notion of may be conceived from effect have upon mind felt that hated whole world kin kin that theft be virtue murder excusable cannibalism thing disgusting from inference may be safely drawn viz be devilish hungry mention because nicholas forster although have be two day without food have disposed of article be saleable be endued with so much strength of principle a not to have thought if have thought of immediately to have dismissed thought of vending property found in trunk by son have remained so long in possession that few must have be so scrupulous will acknowledge whether nicholas be over scrupulous be question leave to be debated by who be fond of argument only state fact until arrival of ship brought home by mr berecroft allotment of newton wage have be regularly paid to father when owner discovered that brig have parted company with convoy have not since be heard of chance of capture be considered so great that owner refused to advance more on newton account nicholas be thus thrown upon own resource be a small a well must be crew of brig who quitted in boat be picked up by homeward bound vessel brought what be considered certain intelligence of jackson newton having perished on wreck nicholas who have frequently called at owner since allowance have be stopped to obtain tidings of son be overwhelmed with intelligence of death returned to own house never called there again mr berecroft who wished to find out relieve must not ascertain in what quarter of town resided shortly after be obliged to proceed upon voyage thus be poor optician left to fate be probable that for fortunate return of newton must soon have be miserably decided newton be much pleased when learnt from father that have not disposed of property have picked up at sea for now felt assured that have discovered owner at guadaloupe intended to transmit to monsieur de fontanges a soon a must find safe conveyance at present be not practicable a soon a father have be re established in several necessary comfort aware that purse must not last for ever applied to owner of brig for employment be decidedly refused loss of vessel have soured temper against one who have belonged to replied that considered newton to be unlucky person must decline sailing in of vessel even if vacancy must occur to other application made elsewhere newton met with same ill fortune mr berecroft be not there to recommend to assist month passed away in anxious expectation of patron return when intelligence be brought home that have be carried off by yellow fever that year have be particularly malignant fatal loss of only protector be heavy blow to poor newton bore up against fortune redoubled exertion a before must always obtain employment before mast refused knowing that if again impressed however well might be off however fortunate in prize money father must be left destitute in probability be starved before must return recollection of situation in have found on return from west indie made newton resolve not to leave father without surety of being provided with mean of subsistence be not without employment earned sufficient for mutual maintenance by working a rigger on board of ship fitting for sea adhered to mean of livelihood until something better must present have newton be alone in world father able to support must have immediately applied to captain carrington to receive in capacity on board of frigate have entered on board of other man of war newton heart be too generous mind too truly english not to bound when read heard of gallant encounter between vessel of rival nation longed to be one of many thousand so diligently employed in twining wreath of laurel round country brow nearly one year of constant fatigue constant expectation constant disappointment be thus passed away affair grew daily worse employment scarce money scarcer newton who have be put off

of woe milton know spot on globe astonishes delight upon first landing a island of madeira voyager embarks be in probability confined to cabin suffering under dreadful protraction of seasickness perhaps have left england in gloomy close of autumn frigid concentration of english winter in week even in shorter period again view that terra firma have quitted with regret in suffering must have

temperate zone for profusion magnificence of tropic fruit have never before seen supply for table unknown to bright sky glowing sun hill covered with vine deep blue sea picturesque novel costume meet delight eye just at precise moment when to have be landed even upon barren island must have be considered a luxury add to unbounded hospitality of english resident sojourn too short to permit satiety then be to be wondered that island of madeira be green spot in memory of who land there that quit with bombay castle have not be two hour at anchor before passenger have availed of invitation from one of english resident be quartered in splendid house hooked upon square one of principal church in city of funchal while gentleman amused at extensive range of window with novelty of scene lady retired to apartment to complete hasty toilet of disembarkation captain drawlock be very busy in counting house below with master of house there be so many pipe of madeira for honourable company so many for director private cellar besides many other commission for friend captain drawlock have undertaken to execute for at period madeira wine have not be so calumniated a latterly have be word upon subject be mortal enemy to description of humbug believe there be a much in medical world a in other madeira wine have for century be in high deserved reputation when on sudden fashionable physician discovers that contained more acid than sherry whether be sleeping partner in spanish house whether have received present of few pipe of sherry that might turn scale of public favour towards wine know not certain be that became fashionable with medical gentleman to prescribe sherry when once thing becomes fashionable c'est une affaire decide pretend to be much of pathologist on reading mr f analysis on component part of wine observed that in one hundred part there be perhaps twenty two part of acid in madeira nineteen in sherry so that in fact if reduce glass of madeira wine just one sip in quantity will imbibe more acid than in full glass of sherry when consider variety of acid in sugar other compound abound in culinary preparation fractional quantity upon have be grounded abuse of madeira wine appears to be most ridiculous if not pathologist have most decided knowledge of what be good wine if gout must day honour with visit will at least have consolation to know have by potation most honestly earned allowing that medical gentleman be correct still good intention be frustrated by knavery of world result of prescription be that people drink much more acid than did before do justice to good old sherry when doe make appearance at table be noble wine when aged unsophisticated from youth for once that meet with genuine be twenty time disappointed when madeira wine be in vogue island must not produce quantity required for consumption vintage from north side of island of teneriffe be substituted adulteration doubt be one cause of losing well established reputation madeira wine have quality in prof superiority over other wine namely that although other wine can be passed off a madeira yet with madeira wine merchant may imitate other wine be in demand what be consequence madeira not being longer in request a madeira now that sherry be correct thing there not being sufficient of latter to meet increased demand most of wine vended a sherry be made from inferior madeira wine

remain proper time although public refuse to drink madeira a madeira be in fact drinking in way disguised a port a sherry etcetera be well known fact that poorer wine from north side of island be landed in london dock shipped off to continent from whence reappear in bottle a peculiarly fine flavoured hock now a be only indifferent wine be thus turned into sherry more inferior wine more acid contains think have made out clear case that people be drinking more acid than did before wonderful discovery of medical gentleman who have for year led public by nose there be however elderly person of acquaintance who be not to be dissuaded from drinking madeira who continue to destroy by use of acid perfume room when cork be extracted did represent to one of that be specie of suicide after what doctor have discovered replied in very gruff tone of voice may be sir ca teach old dog new trick consider that public ought to feel very much indebted to for expose madeira wine be very low while sherry be high in price have only to purchase cask of madeira flavour with wellington boot lady shipper a may suit palate former will produce high coloured latter pale sherry further consider that merchant of madeira be bound to send letter of thanks with pipe of bual to prove sincerity now recollect stoddart did promise wine when be last in england suppose have forgotten from produce must

advantageous offer for speculation commences with voyage lady be selected at madeira since cape have be in possession several have be induced to stay in colony very often ship arrive with only refuse of cargo for intended market in east isabel revel have consented to embark on score of filial duty not to obtain husband unless liked gentleman who proposed captain carrington did not happen to come up to fanciful idea of person to be chosen for life captain carrington did not impart intelligence of ill success to one newton who be employed to carry farewell message secret be faithfully kept by isabel revel be not one of young lady who must make use of such unworthy advantage to heighten consequence in eye of others there be reason not exactly known to isabel at time prevented from listening

with sneer certainly be sir be not admiration of beauty occasioned remark if knew sir must be a sorry to part with a now appear to be to receive colonel continued to pace room with le violence than before newton observed therefore be silent hoping that reflection must induce to alter resolution in few minute apparently forgetting presence of newton colonel commenced talking to aloud muttering out following detached phrase must take in by god must show face nowhere damned scoundrel keep here till next ship till be a yellow a gamboge then send home revenge in thus did old gentleman mutter loud enough for newton to overhear few minute more be spent in perambulation when threw into chair think young acquaintance appear to be interested for relation of mine at least for one of certainly

not fond of society of woman will be delighted with young lady may be brought on shore to hotel will send carriage for good bye what be name forster sir good bye then mr forster for present colonel quitted room volume three chapter two then there be sigh deeper for suppression stolen glance sweeter for theft burning blush though for transgression trembling when met restlessness when left be little prelude to possession of young passion can not be bereft merely tend to show how greatly love be embarrassed at first starting with novice byron be in very happy frame of mind that newton quitted colonel house to execute mission to miss revel that two eldest provided be admitted must not much take to heart conduct of father coolness of relation be pretty well assured be too well acquainted with isabel character not to know that must deeply feel humiliating situation in be placed that must prey upon generous sensitive mind a however there be remedy almost congratulated that a colonel message be to be delivered commission have be placed in trust captain drawlock tired of waiting have escorted young lady on shore to hotel anxiously expecting arrival of newton who be conducted there by messenger despatched to intercept well mr forster be right said captain drawlock on appearance colonel carriage will be here for lady in le than hour replied newton evasively then miss revel a be extremely busy will wish good morning will have pleasure of paying respect before sail allow to offer best thanks for company during voyage to assure how much presence have contributed to enliven forster will of course remain with miss revel see safe in carriage captain drawlock who appeared to consider responsibility over with voyage shook hand with quitted hotel mr forster said isabel a soon a captain drawlock be out of hearing be sure by countenance that there have be something unpleasant be not so be sorry to answer in affirmative more sorry to be forced to impart cause newton then entered into detail of what have passed at colonel house isabel listened to with attention sister with impatience miss charlotte with air of consternation inquired whether colonel have refused to receive on being informed to contrary appeared to be satisfied laura simpered observed how very odd of papa then seemed to think more about isabel made observation remained on chair apparently in deep painful thought few minute after communication colonel carriage made appearance newton proposed that must quit hotel charlotte laura be ready impatient isabel remained seated by table come isabel cried charlotte can not go dear charlotte replied isabel let prevent laura from deciding for yourselves not go cried two sister at once isabel be firm newton who did not think authorised to interfere be silent witness to continued persuasion expostulation of two elder refusal of younger sister nearly hour thus passed away when charlotte laura decided that must go send back carriage for isabel who by time must have come to sens heartless unthinking girl tripped gaily down to carriage drove off newton who have escorted retraced step with beating heart to room where have left isabel be in tear do intrude miss revel said newton who must not repress emotion at sight oh expected wished that must return mr forster do think that must find captain drawlock must feel much obliged if must take trouble for will immediately go in search of if wish believe miss revel feel most sincerely for situation if be not considered impertinent question must ask what may be present intention acquainted a be with circumstance mr forster question be not impertinent kind god know that require adviser must if possible conceal fact from captain drawlock be not for daughter to publish father error know can therefore have scruple in consulting with see why must resolution be at best hasty one be never to enter house of relation under such humiliating circumstance be decided how to act what to do be where require advice be in cruel situation what helpless creature be woman be man must have worked passage home have honestly obtained bread in place woman young unprotected woman in distant clime without friend say that be without friend one who have at least will if not power to serve replied newton not without friend what avail friend whose assistance must not accept be to captain drawlock therefore must apply painful a may be throw upon generosity for reason wished to see may advise mean by may obtain passage home will return in capacity a nurse to child a attendant thing be creditable must watch over couch of fever pestilence plague for month rather than appear to be party to father duplicity oh mr forster what must think of daughter after what have heard of

can only lament dare not offer to assist mean of returning to own country can easily procure from captain drawlock must accept from know can not expect that must that under such circumstance must be insulting in to offer think then what pain must feel to witness distress yet dare not offer to assist one for whom oh god ended newton checking feeling feel kindness delicacy of conduct mr forster will candidly acknowledge must accept there be one to whom must more cheerfully be under obligation world will not permit what will do miss revel will go for captain drawlock stay little while wish to reflect what must advise a friend tell candidly mr forster be indeed proud that allow that title be that ever dare hope for isabel beg pardon miss revel must have said nay nay be not displeased why not isabel have known one long enough deserted a feel kind word now isabel covered face with hand newton who be standing by be overcome by intensity of feeling gradually approached nearer until by suppose same principle hold universe together attraction of cohesion newton arm encircled waist of isabel sobbed upon shoulder be with difficulty that newton refrained from pouring out soul expressing ardent love have so long felt for be taking advantage of situation have nothing to offer beggary did refrain word be not spoken yet isabel divined thought appreciated forbearance loved more for resolution isabel said newton at length with sigh never valued wished for wealth till now till hour never felt misery of being poor believe mr forster be grateful a know that be for sake that feel continued recovering cry will do good asked for advice have only given arm be afraid be will ever have to offer replied newton isabel allow to ask one question be resolved never to enter relation house not on humiliating term have proposed let colonel come here for take home with then will remain there until can return to england if not will submit to privation to honest humiliation rather than enter under roof indeed mr forster be necessary that captain drawlock must be summoned be here alone be not correct must feel that be not do feel that be not isabel be morning of trifling service to colonel may have little weight with will allow to return to try what can do will not be dark for two hour will soon be back isabel assented newton hastened to colonel who have already be much surprised when have be informed by domestic for have not seen that only two lady have arrived old gentleman be now cool explanation strong persuasion of newton coupled with spirited behaviour of isabel whose determination be made known to be so different from general estimate have formed of sex at last prevailed colonel ordered carriage in company with newton drove to hotel made sort of apology wonderful effort on part requested grand niece to accept of hospitality in few minute isabel colonel be out of sight newton be left to own reflection few day afterwards newton accepted colonel invitation to dine when found that affair be going on better than expected old gentleman have be severely quizzed by who be intimate with at addition to establishment have winced not little under lash

water intrusted to skill of merchant seaman to convey home in safety to courage to defend from enemy have long be lying in wait to intercept by very unusual chance oversight there have be men of war despatched to protect property of such enormous value indian fleet have just entered strait of malacca be sailing in open order with fresh breeze smooth water hammock have be stowed deck washed awning spread shoal of albicore be darting across bow of different ship seaman perched upon cat head spritsail yard have succeeded in piercing with harpoon many be immediately cut up in frying pan for

flag be up be not pennant be order to four ship of fleet to run down examine strange vessel hour elapsed during time glass be at mast head captain drawlock although not much given to climbing having probably have enough of during long career in service be to be seen in main top doubt suspicion declaration surmise positive assertion be bandied about until be dispelled by reconnoitring ship telegraphing french squadron consisting of one line of battle ship three frigate brig be in fact well known squadron of admiral linois who have scoured indian sea ranging up down with velocity a well a appetite of shark force consisted of marengo of eighty gun famed belle poule forty gun frigate outstripped wind semillante of thirty six gun berceau ship corvette of twenty two brig of sixteen have sailed from batavia on purpose to intercept china fleet having received intelligence that be unprotected anticipating easy conquest if not immediate surrender to overpowering force recall be up on board of commodore said first mate to captain drawlock very well keep good look out intends to fight will answer for must not surrender up million to french scoundrel without tussle must hope not replied mathews big fellow will make general average among tea canister expect when do come to scratch there go flag sir continued mathews repeating number to captain drawlock who have signal book in hand form line of battle in close order prepare for action read captain drawlock from signal book cheer resounded through fleet when signal be made known ship be already near enough to other to hear shouting confidence of others added to own if only have english seaman on board instead of lascar chinaman who look so blank observed newton to mathews think must show play yes growled mathews john company will day find out truth of old proverb penny wise pound foolish ' french squadron have continued on wind to leeward until must fetch india fleet now tacked laid up directly for in meantime english vessel be preparing for action clearing of lumbered deck be occasion of many coop of fowl pig of true china breed exchanging destiny for watery grave fortunately there be passenger homeward bound china ship be not encumbered in way unless to astonish metropolis with such monstrosity a mermaid a siamese twin coupled by nature like two hound separated lately indeed by lytton bulwer who have satisfactorily proved that unity between brother so generally esteemed blessing on contrary be bore in short time be ready india fleet continued course under easy sail courting avoiding conflict at french squadron hauled to wind conduct of china fleet rendered cautious french admiral considered advisable to ascertain by broad daylight whether portion of english ship be not men of war cool determined behaviour certainly warranted suspicion be now to be decided whether indiaman must take advantage of darkness of night to escape wait result of ensuing day force opposed to be formidable concentrated own on contrary be weak from division ship not having more than sixty english seaman on board country ship none at few belonging to having volunteered on board indiaman in decision commodore dance proved judgment a well a courage in attempt to escape fleet must separate from well known superior sailing of french squadron most of must be overtaken being attacked single handed fall easy prey to enemy in opinion captain of indiaman who have communicated during night be unanimous equally so in resolution founded upon to keep together fight to last india fleet lay to for night keeping light up men at quarter most of english seaman sound asleep lascar chinese sitting up in group expressing in own tongue fear of approaching combat in whether risked for national honour individual property must have interest morning broke discovered french squadron about three mile to windward admiral linois have calculated that if fleet consisted only of merchant vessel must have profited by darkness to have attempted to escape have worked to windward during night that might be ready to pounce down upon quarry when perceived that english ship did not attempt to increase distance be sadly puzzled french tricolour hardly have time to blow clear from taffrail when english union waved aloft in defiance that admiral linois might be more perplexed by arrangement of night three of most warlike indiaman displayed red ensign while remainder of ship hoisted up blue ruse led french admiral to suppose that three vessel be men of war composing escort of fleet at nine o'clock commodore made signal to fill french squadron not bearing down india fleet continued course under easy sail french admiral then edged away with squadron with intention of cutting off country ship have be stationed to leeward since british fleet have hauled wind have be left in rear be now requisite for british commander to act decidedly firmly captain timmins officer for courage conduct not surpassed by in naval service who commanded royal george edged to within hail of commodore recommended that order must be given to tack in succession bear down in line head engage enemy spirited advice be acted upon royal george leading into action followed by other ship in such close order that flying jib boom be often pointed over taffrail of predecessor in quarter of hour be to be witnessed unusual spectacle of fleet of merchant ship exchanging broadside with best equipped highest disciplined squadron ever sailed from france in le than hour be presented more unusual sight of squadron flying from merchant ship signal for general chase answered with enthusiastic cheer that admiral linois might have supposed previous to engagement that of british ship be men of war be probable that knew otherwise after have commenced action must also have be case fact be be frightened at determined courage decided conduct fled not from gun from men know on record greater instance of heroism on part of british seaman be delighted that newton forster be in conflict of course must not have introduced in work now who read for amusement may if please skip over next chapter there be point connected with india service intend to comment upon a wisdom of age be confined to novel nobody read pamphlet introduce here when one man be empowered to hold in check to insist upon obedience of large proportion of fellow can only be by opinion that authority can be supported by opinion mean knowledge that be so empowered by law of country to belong by law will be punished if act in opposition to authority fiat of individual commanding be in case fiat of nation at large to contend with fiat be not contending with individual with nation to whose law must submit to return to country more commander of vessel therefore armed with martial law be in fact representing executing not own will that of nation who have made law for be amenable a well a inferior if act contrary to misuse in merchant service martial law be not permitted bye law relative to shipping common law of country be supposed to be sufficient certainly present system be more advisable than to vest such excessive power in hand of men who generally speaking require be fit to be entrusted with where a in greater number of merchant vessel master subordinate officer compose one third if not one half of complement on board nothing most flagrant conduct be likely to produce insubordination in east india service case be different vessel be of dimension equal if not superior to largest class of frigate carry from thirty to forty gun property embarked in be also of such extent that loss almost becomes national commander be men of superior attainment a gentleman a officer finally complement of seaman under command be larger than on board of many of king ship above consideration will at once establish that bye law afford protection to well governing of merchant service in general be not sufficient to maintain necessary discipline on board of east india ship greater disproportion between unit who command number who obey greater chance of mutiny sedition be progeny of assembly even where grievance may be real if there be contact discussion there will be insubordination imaginary grievance canvassed discussed in assembly swell into disaffection mutiny when therefore number be collected together a in vessel of east india service martial law becomes indispensable proof of be that commander of vessel have be forced to exercise upon own responsibility letter of marque must be granted to vessel carrying certain number of men empowering commander under certain surety penalty to exercise power must be boon to east india ship ultimately benefit to navy to proceed merchant ship of company be men of war men of war of company be what will call by right name be bombay marine let at once assert in applying own name to a reproach that officer commanding be not included in stigma have served with have pleasure in stating that taking average vessel be a well officered a in own service let describe vessel crew most of vessel be smaller in scantling than run down constantly going down ten gun brig in own service built for light draft of water a be originally intended to act against pirate occasionally infest indian sea unfit to contend with anything like heavy sea many of be pierced for actually carry fourteen sixteen gun a effective fighting vessel ought not to have be pierced for more than eight have hesitation in asserting that english cutter be match for of french privateer have before now proved that be superior crew be composed of small proportion of english seaman small proportion of portuguese sea cunnies proportion of lascar proportion of hindoo bombay marine requires two three language to carry on duty custom religion provision different living messing separate how be possible that officer can discipline ship company of incongruous description so a to make pull together in short vessel crew be equally contemptible officer in case of difficulty must be sacrificed to pride meanness of company reason for taking notice of bombay marine arises from order lately promulgated in officer of service be to take rank precedence with of navy now a far a officer be concerned so far from having objection to wish for own merit good will bear that be incorporated into navy list a long a command vessel of above description in event of war will put case to prove absurdity danger may result there be not one vessel at present time in service must not be sunk by one well directed broadside from large frigate yet a many of officer be of long standing be very probable that squadron of english frigate may fall in with one of vessel captain of must be authorised by seniority to take command of whole of will suppose that squadron fall in with enemy of equal superior force can officer in command lead on attack if so will be sent down by first broadside if doe not from whom be order to proceed during action consequence must be a injurious a arrangement be ridiculous charter of east india company will soon expire if be to be renewed country ought to have indemnification for three million colony conquest please annually draw from now there be one point deserves consideration constitutional protection of property be by nation a naval force be required in india that force must be supplied by armament of nation at expense of company have already proved that bombay marine be useless incompetent service let be abolished altogether men of war be sent out to supply place be most important that navy must be employed in time of peace officer gain that practical knowledge without theoretical be useless be insisted upon considerable force must be actively employed at expense to country many officer become valuable who now be remaining inactive forgetting what previous knowledge may have acquired of nautical duty at same time east india ship must be compelled to take on board whole complement of english seaman not be half manned by lascar chinaman presume must be careful how attempt to legislate for country will have two tame

nicholas truly reformed wife newton uncle amber body in household while narrate event have brought about singular denouement reader may recollect that left mr forster in lunatic asylum slowly recovering from attack of brain fever have be attended with relapse for many week continued in state of great feebleness during time when in garden in company with other denizen of melancholy abode wishing to be usefully employed greatly assisted keeper in restraining in short time established that superiority over be invariably result of pane intellect be soon perceived by doctor beddington who aware of destitute condition offered situation a nurse in establishment until inspecting magistrate must make appearance with promise that might continue in afterwards if thought proper proposal be accepted by mr forster until might resolve what course to take soon became most invaluable person in establishment effecting more by lenient kind treatment than keeper be able to do by violence so completely changed be mr forster in disposition so far from feeling resentment against who have be mean of confinement acknowledged to herself that own conduct have be occasion of misfortune that who have contributed to open eye to former insanity be best friend be humbled unhappy kissed rod that now wished be to find out husband by future conduct to make reparation for past one of gaoler at request made inquiry a to part of england nicholas have removed be without success trace be lost mr forster accepted situation of nurse until might be enabled to prosecute search obtain intelligence desired for nine month mr forster remained on establishment during time have saved sum of money sufficient for support travelling expense then resolved to search after husband whose pardon for previous conduct seemed to be sine qua non for continued to exist took leave of doctor strange to say be with feeling of regret that quitted abode once source of horror disgust time reconciles to thing made half promise to dr beddington that if must not hear tidings of husband must discover that be more that must return to situation mr forster directed course to london why wherefore hardly knew have imbibed idea that metropolis be most likely place to meet with first inquiry be about family of name of forster directory gave enormous list of forsters of trade calling in situation in life that closed with despair have faint recollection that husband who be not very communicative least of to have stated that have brother alive somewhere be that knew nevertheless set about task in good

to question servant answer be unsatisfactory mr forster whose money be nearly expended have serious thought of returning to lunatic establishment when advertisement in newspaper of mr scratton for housekeeper mr john forster have desired to procure met eye unwilling to leave london applied for obtained situation having received excellent character from doctor beddington to whom have written

to have recourse to patience resignation have be so severely inculcated charge of amber soon proved source of delight control have over household source of gratification not a before for pleasure of domineering for sake of exercising kindness forbearance mr forster be happy resigned may be surmised a strange that during period remained in capacity have never heard mention made of husband son must

newton forster too happy a for few second held hand not withdrawn looked in beaming eye quite forgot presence of colonel glance from eye of isabel in direction where old gentleman be seated brought newton to recollection walked up to colonel who shook hand declared that be most glad to see take up quarter here of course mr forster will have great pleasure in availing of kind offer for day two

a own daughter say again god bless be with delight that newton encomium upon isabel resolution not to marry whether be wholly on account of not wishing to leave colonel not still delay gave more chance of ultimate success isabel who have stayed away that colonel might have time to make communication to newton now returned conversation became general newton entered into narrative of what have occurred during passage home amused with anecdote conversation in about hour colonel rose from chair that might prepare for dinner then be that newton perceived great change have taken place be no

inquired newton to change painful subject yes very ill last account be very distressing say that complaint be incurable newton regretted having brought up so painful subject few word of condolence sympathy be offered separated to prepare for dinner newton remained four day under roof of colonel during time be constantly in society of isabel when period of departure arrived have just ground to imagine that be obstacle in other point removed isabel revel must not on part have raised against accomplishment of wish mutual dependent situation chased away idea of kind for present although parted with unconcealed emotion not word must be construed into declaration of attachment be permitted to escape lip windsor castle sailed for calcutta in few day anchored at kedgeree to wait for pilot to

information of best cabin of windsor castle not having be hitherto engaged colonel will have be opened have bequeathed property whole of with exception of establishment in india be invested in english fund to grand niece isabel revel amounted to nearly seventy thousand pound must be difficult to say whether newton forster felt glad sorry at intelligence for isabel sake undoubtedly be glad must not feel that increased distance between on account on alone reflection be painful have thought be five thousand even ten thousand pound must have be different in course of few year might have be able to produce equivalent to fortune have raised above hope even if have prepossession in favour must be dishonest to take advantage of isabel revel have very different feeling on subject be own mistress

oughton showing white teeth look out again here come corvette again attempted to rake a ranged up after tacking by throwing up in wind captain oughton watching slightest variation of adversary career gradually edging away then putting helm up manoeuvred that broadside must again be exchanged second exchange be more effectual than first stomacher down cried captain oughton a surveyed deck be quick

breeze freshening fast be necessary that remaining mast of windsor castle must be properly secured gun be therefore abandoned during time seaman be employed in knotting rigging bending spare sail newton consulted with brother officer who be unanimous in agreeing that have be done must be expected that to wait till ensuing day when corvette must have repaired damage must be attended with risk of capture valuable property entrusted to charge must never authorise be not until past midnight that windsor castle be in condition to make sail long before newton have contrived to leave deck for few minute to communicate with isabel with most of particular with death of captain oughton have already be made acquainted if there must be reward to newton for gallantry prudence more coveted than be affectionate greeting with be welcomed congratulated by isabel eye beaming with tear of delight a glanced from face be shrouded on deck love murder make pretty mixture although a antithetical a

before must have ascended to summit of ladder of promotion during time remained in situation what chance have of making independence proposing for hand of isabel revel now that by chain of circumstance peculiarly fortuitous be in command of east indiaman returning home after having beat off vessel of equal if not superior force preserved cargo of immense value felt confident that not only must be confirmed to rank be now called upon to assume that have prospect of being employed a captain of indiaman be aware that reception into society wealth consideration awaited what made heart to swell with gratitude exultation be feeling soon must be enabled to aspire to hand of one to whom have so long be ardently attached a windsor castle plunged through roaring complaining sea with impetus of weight in motion newton eye be radiant with hope although demeanour towards isabel be from peculiar circumstance attending situation more delicately reserved than before when windsor castle touched at st helena newton have good fortune to obtain supply of able seaman more than sufficient for remanning of ship have be sent there in empty brig by french privateer who have captured many vessel have be embarrassed with number of prisoner having obtained store be required newton lost time in prosecuting voyage to england be about fortnight after have quitted st helena that strange sail be reported on starboard bow a neared be evident that foremast be gone that be otherwise in disabled state when indiaman be within mile stranger threw out neutral colour hoisted whiff half mast down a signal that be in distress newton ordered ship to be kept away when alongside of vessel lowered down boat sent third mate to ascertain what assistance must be afforded with sailor thank god distress be sufficient to obtain assistance nation country be at once merged in feeling of sympathy for misfortune may perhaps next hour befall ourselves boat returned officer informed newton that vessel be from island of bourbon bound to hamburgh that have be dismasted severely injured in gale off cape of good hope that when mast went over side one half of crew who be up at time on fore yard have be cast overboard drowned that from want of men material have be unable to rig effective jury mast have in consequence be so long on passage that provision water be nearly expended officer concluded by stating that there be french lady two gentleman with attendant who have taken passage home in vessel newton immediately went down side pulled on board of vessel to ascertain what assistance must be afforded when arrived on board be met by flemish captain who commenced statement of misfortune difficulty when french lady who unobserved by newton have come up companion ladder screamed out a ran into arm ah mon dieu c'est monsieur nu tong newton looked at lady who have burst into tear a face laid upon shoulder immediately recognised former kind affectionate friend madame de fontanges close to with hand extended be generous husband meeting be joyful newton be delighted that circumstance have enabled to render assistance to who have be so kind to in former distress oh monsieur nu tong nous avon tant soufferts ah mon dieu point de l'eau rien manger cried madame de fontanges then smiling through tear mais ce rencontre est charmant n'est ce pa mon ami continued lady appealing to husband remember monsieur le marquis said monsieur de fontanges to newton newton turned head recognised governor of guadaloupe who have expressed such sympathy at shipwreck have sent away in cartel instead of detaining a prisoner vessel be indeed in deplorable condition have not received timely assistance now afforded must in probability have soon be scene of horror of suffering have not more than three day water remaining on board provision barely sufficing for three day newton hastened to send back boat with order for immediate ample supply of necessary in case of bad weather coming on preventing further communication satisfied that immediate want be relieved newton took leave of friend for present returned on board of own ship despatching carpenter part of crew to immediate refit of vessel then selecting part of thing that windsor castle contained in store room on deck thought must administer to comfort luxury of passenger on board of neutral in two hour who be in state bordering upon famine found revelling in plenty before night english seaman have jury mast up sail set hollander on board must have given assistance be told to remain on deck make up for lost time acquiesced in very readily eating drinking a if be determined to lay in stock for remainder of voyage newton who have returned on board of neutral to superintend repair enjoy society of old friend received from long account of what have occurred since separation at nightfall took leave promising to continue under easy sail remain with for day two until be satisfied that be right that longer required assistance narrative obtained by newton may be thus condensed for information of reader marquis de fontanges have be appointed from government of guadaloupe to of island of bourbon be considered of more importance monsieur madame de fontanges accompanied to new command have remained there for two year when ruling power without ground except that marquis have received appointment from former government thought proper to supersede frigate be not so plentiful a to spare one for return of ex governor marquis being permitted to find way home how must have taken advantage of sailing of hamburgher to return to europe to france a might find advisable for two day during weather be so fine that madame de fontanges gentleman went on board of windsor castle be introduced to lady newton continued under easy sail day despatching to neutral thing gratitude must suggest a newton be most anxious to proceed on voyage be agreed that next morning must part company at close of evening strange sail be observed on weather beam a carried foretop gallant sail appeared to be steering same course a windsor castle excited momentary observation supposing that be homeward bound neutral merchant vessel have separated from convoy during night be dark moon being in first quarter officer of middle watch lost sight of protegee be to be expected a did not carry light before morning wind fell when sun arose be perfect calm officer of watch a day dawned went on poop surveying horizon for companion discovered six seven mile astern lying alongside of strange vessel have seen day before vessel a well a windsor castle be becalmed immediately went down to newton acquainting with circumstance bore very suspicious appearance newton hastened on deck with glass must plainly distinguish that stranger be vessel of low raking description evidently merchant man built for sailing fast in probability privateer man at mast head reported that boat be constantly passing between two vessel newton who felt very anxious for safety of friend accepted offer of second mate to take gig ascertain what be going on in little more than hour gig be seen from mast head to arrive within mile of vessel shortly afterwards smoke from gun followed by distant report gig then winded pulled back towards windsor castle be in state of great excitement that newton waited for return when second mate informed that on approach discovered that be flush vessel pierced for fourteen gun painted black apparently well manned that evidently to use nautical term be gutting neutral that a have witnessed on boat coming within range vessel have fired round of grape fortunately fell short of have shown colour from appearance behaviour a privateer respect neutral have doubt that be pirate vessel stated when be at st helena to be cruising in latitude newton be of same opinion be with heavy heart that returned to cabin to communicate unpleasant intelligence to mr enderby isabel there be nothing more annoying in world than will without power at time vessel becalmed be considered very sufficing reason for swearing by who be on board of what then must have be feeling of newton lying on water in state of compelled inaction while friend be being plundered perhaps murdered by gang of miscreant before eye how eagerly repeatedly did scan horizon for coming breeze how did hope raise head at slightest cat paw ruffled surface of glassy water three successive gale of wind be bad enough three gale blowing hard enough to blow devil horn off be infinitely preferable to one idle stagnant

isabel by denying that be distressed at uncle decision to say will never enter into family without having received consent be saying more than feeling will bear out must will say that will be most unwilling so to do must therefore a madame de fontanges did with pirate captain temporise trust will be a successful newton more rational than most young men in love agreed with isabel on propriety of

indebted to generosity of own relative own feeling disposition have not monsieur madame de fontanges protected assisted in distress have not instead of throwing into prison set at liberty never must have known where daughter be to be found have not one of uncle hastened to relief of vessel in distress other protected little girl after death must not have be now in existence gratitude for kindness induced to remain by ship subsequently to rescue from pirate must not have now be prisoner in country evil under divine providence have be changed to blessing by restoring to daughter have trust done duty happy issue be full reward humph observed old lawyer volume three chapter sixteen thus far chronicle now pause though not for want of matter 't be time byron amber julie de fontanges a must now call quitted abode of kind protector in such distress that be evident regretted discovery have be made be too young to be aware of advantage of high birth removal be for time source of unfeigned regret appeared to that nothing must compensate for separation from supposed father who doated on from mr forster who have watched over from nicholas who amused from newton whom loved a brother idea of going to foreign country never seeing william aveleyn again though last not least to find that be not englishwoman in future must not rejoice at victory over own nation occasioned many burst of tear when left alone to own meditation be long before devotion of father fascinating attention of monsieur madame de fontanges must induce to be resigned to new condition mr john forster felt bereavement more deeply than must have be supposed for many day after departure of julie seldom spoke never made appearance except at dinner time a soon a meal be finished hastened to chamber where remained very late intense application be remedy have selected to dispel care fill up vacuum created by absence of darling child newton said one evening a discussed bottle of port have considered what

forster family be a well descended quite well enough for frenchman let be marquis even duke be that only obstacle intend to raise if be removed will again plead attachment to be only one mean to raise at present sir acknowledge julie de fontanges to be sweet girl a relation have long be much attached to humph replied old lawyer always thought sensible lad will see now be observed that there be certain degree of jesuitical on part of friend newton on occasion excusable only from wish that mortification of uncle at disappointment of hope must not be occasioned by further resistance on part to monsieur de fontanges who be aware of newton attachment to isabel have previous to discovery have taken place communicated obstacle to union raised by pertinacity of uncle after removal of julie monsieur de fontanges acquainted brother with wish of mr john forster explained to how much be at variance with of first time that newton called upon marquis latter shaking warmly by hand said have be informed dear newton by brother of awkward predicament in be placed by wish of uncle that must marry julie when grows up believe when say there be man to whom must sooner confide happiness of daughter that consideration must induce to refuse if really sought hand know wish attachment to miss revel therefore be quite easy on subject uncle made proposition when julie have father to be consulted case be now different for sake intend for time to injure in opinion of good relation will assume trust what if ever have must be immediately sacrificed to gratitude mean high aristocratical pride must uncle make proposal refuse upon ground that be not noble by descent one will deny nobility on other point do understand newton will so doing be conformable to wish will monsieur le marquis thank most sincerely then make objection when proposes match second time leave obloquy on shoulder said marquis smiling arrangement having be made be not surprising that newton heard uncle renewal of proposition
