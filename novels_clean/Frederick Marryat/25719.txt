about hour before dark be well to windward a wind be from northward must probably sail faster than must a schooner doe not sail so well free a on wind have run out about four hour be steering course for holyhead when suddenly perceived ship of war close to to leeward have be lying with mainsail to mast evidently have made out for filled set top gallant sail immediately hauled wind a soon a have way tacked followed in pursuit being then right astern of about mile off be very dark knew that a sail be set bore from must be difficult for to keep in sight a only presented what call feather edge of sail to therefore steered on under sail finding that schooner weathered on kept away little so a to retain same bearing to leave faster in hour must not make out ship be therefore certain that must not see so a wanted to get clear of be at holyhead a soon a possible lowered down sail put helm up so a to cross run to leeward under bare pole while continued windward chase stratagem answered saw more of for two hour afterwards fell in with arrow hailing made sail down bristol channel a fast a must at daybreak there be vessel in sight of course have nothing more to fear from liverpool cruiser a now sailed rapidly along in company with wind on quarter be high time for to look to passenger who have remained on deck in perfect silence from time that have come on board therefore went up to

with hardly need say that object be to escape that falling in with being captured by ship of war there be many out in pursuit of other unfortunate adherent to house of stuart must be extremely disagreeable a head body must certainly part company if be taken now port do think must be most likely to reach with least chance of interruption think replied a pay compliment to ask opinion that must be better to run down bay of biscay then put in port of bordeaux other where must be landed in safety reason be channel be full of cruiser looking after of party who be attempting to escape vessel will be chased searched now although might sail faster than one vessel in channel yet be very possible that in running away from one may fall into jaw of besides be two privateer cruising off bordeaux will excite suspicion a be favourite cruising ground so that if be boarded there must be little danger of discovery of course a long a can prevent that by taking to heel will not be boarded by one only objection to what propose be that will be confined longer in vessel than may like than must be if be to gain nearer port agree with captain of vessel said grave looking personage who have not yet spoken whom afterwards discovered to be catholic priest stanchest adherent to cause must not have given better advice must recommend that be followed others be of same opinion in consequence

knew that coast be not clear now will part company with in hour make sail for england a may suppose without fail to morrow night will be off here again about five league from port with sail furled

following close be not more than four mile from to avoid mistake have agreed with captain levee must be coming out after dark must carry light at peak light now hoisted enabled french privateer to follow appeared only a mark of contempt towards stood on in direction where be to find captain levee must make out frenchman following gradually nearing a became dark made more sail to keep further off till have joined arrow light at peak pointed out to where be seemed mystery to officer men until having run out about four league desired to keep sharp look out for arrow about half past eight o'clock perceived lying to have furled sail after dark a usual light bore told who be ran close to hailing captain levee desired to prepare for action must come on board to speak to of course created great bustle on board of arrow hastened on board that might not show light then informed captain levee of have passed that frenchman be not more than five mile from agreed must still keep up light bear away little to draw frenchman to leeward of port also to leeward of arrow that arrow must lower sail again so a not to be perceived until have drawn frenchman past that then must commence action under sail fight till arrow came up to assistance being arranged hastened on board of schooner keeping away four point waited for coming up of antagonist in hour must perceive through gloom not more than mile from under sail standing steadily for light carried at peak a have already discovered that little schooner sailed faster than opponent allowed to come up within quarter of mile of when rounded to desiring men to aim at rigging so a to dismantle poured in broadside of grape langridge then shifted helm resumed course putting more sail on so a to increase distance to what be before manoeuvre executed three time with success have satisfaction of perceiving that foretop mast be shot away when rounded to fourth time did same exchanged broadside effect of superior artillery be evident for rigging sail be much damaged happily nothing so serious a to impede speed again put before breeze a before increased distance previous to again rounding to for a water be very smooth knew that if be crippled must lay by board immediately might be taken hanged before arrow must come up to assistance therefore continued running fight at distance a rendered le liable to suffer from gun be true that distance made gun even more ineffective be decoying frenchman off from land placing arrow between port so that return must be intercepted continued for about hour when perceived that frenchman have got up new foretop mast have set sail upon now ran out bow chaser continued to fire upon with alone not choosing to lose ground by rounding to to give broadside a canvas be out be occasionally rounding to to dismantle retained much same distance from one at last shot from bow chaser struck off head of mainmast gaff came down be serious hastened to reef mainsail hoist up again upon remainder of mast having gaff topsail speed be necessarily decreased enemy appeared to be gradually closing with looked out for arrow must perceive sign of indeed be too dark to see farther than mile finding on point of sailing be on have chance determined to alter course put schooner right before wind so might set square mainsail must give time for arrow to arrive indeed at time be in state of great anxiety however have made up mind not to be taken alive to sell life a dearly a must when enemy perceived that have put before wind did same a be about mile from other continued to exchange broadside a ran gradually nearing so a to make heavy artillery more effective portion of contest continued for hour during little schooner have received much injury be constantly repairing damage at last much to delight day began to dawn then discovered arrow about mile half from right astern under press of sail pointed out to officer men who be inspired with fresh courage at sight enemy also perceived appeared determined to bring combat to issue previous to coming up feared that at event might swing at yard arm let issue of coming combat be what might neared steering course so a to cut off continued to pour in broadside to cripple if possible a did not now fire ran steadily for chance be bad anxious that arrow must close a soon a possible hauled down square mainsail that might not run from prepared for obstinate resistance if boarded at last frenchman be within cable length at critical moment arrow be about mile to windward poured in last broadside hastened to seize pike cutlass to repel boarder when to satisfaction found that one of shot have cut gaff in two immediately rounded to wind a antagonist be within pistol shot of with men ready for leap on board put helm down went round in stay crossed so near to windward that might have thrown biscuit on board manoeuvre prevented boarding may say saved life for gaff being shot away must not heave in stay to follow be obliged to wear round after increased distance at least cable length to leeward furious broadside however poured in crippled altogether thing came running down upon deck be left complete wreck be to windward of although might sink must not board take possession until have refitted after sail now time be come fresh antagonist with equal weight of metal be close to have to decide whether must fight run whether conceived that running be useless certainly be be determined to take die know not certain be that did not put vessel before wind waited with determination coming up of arrow captain levee passed under frenchman stern raking with broadside almost unrigged then engaged to leeward so a to cut off chance of escape frenchman returned fire with spirit took men from gun that might set sail upon vessel for after arrow commenced fire further notice be taken of by frenchman after contest well maintained for hour mainmast of frenchman went by board almost settled question a must not keep vessel to wind consequently fell off received raking fire from arrow at last bowsprit be between main fore rigging of arrow deck be swept by arrow raking fire have got sail up forward be anxious to be at close of action perceived that frenchman be attempting to board lugger be pouring people on forecastle therefore edged down to might with people board on quarter must place a say between two fire conflict be at highest french attempting arrow crew repelling when laid schooner on quarter leaped on board of with few remaining men frenchman turned to repel attack thus weakened party opposed to arrow men consequence be that be first beaten back then boarded by captain levee crew a soon a have gained deck of frenchman thought of nothing to single out french captain at first must not see a crew retreated from captain levee men perceived pale exhausted still attempting to rally a object be to take alive rushed in advance at wrestled threw on back on deck there held while combatant fighting retreating tumbled over one after bruised severely with weight at last french be beaten below have time to breathe calling to two of men desired to take charge of french captain a valued life not to let escape destroy to take into vessel guard carefully in cabin having done went to captain levee embraced did not come minute too soon said wiping blood from face indeed for clever manoeuvre

a have idea that be here a soon a have refitted vessel will remain where be will run into mouth of garonne with colour flying english jack over french flag on board of prize will lead to suppose that have taken vessel without assistance when just out of gun shot heave to fire gun then swing effigy to yard arm remain there to make suppose that have hung french captain at can make sail rejoin will punish annoy generally will do so be excellent device will never know truth for long time to come remained day refitting in evening made sail in company with french schooner be manned by captain levee

wheel that have conception of in troubled time what most fear be that may arrive too late priest took leave of be left to own thought when considered that address of lady have be given to by very man whom be so anxious to secure a traitor at once decided that benefit must arrive from interference on part therefore after quarter of hour dismissed whole subject from thought commenced reading of sacred writing following morning when gaoler came in must not help observing to that a have be condemned so many day felt much surprise at delay of execution reply be that heard that others be in custody upon same charge that waited for conviction that might suffer at same time for order for execution have come on friday last have be countermanded on afternoon of same day although satisfied that have hope of escape yet be pleased that have obtained more time for preparation renewed reading with ardour week passed when gaoler with solemn face much apparent concern came in informed that other party arrested have be tried before commission have be condemned that be expected that execution must take place either on morrow day after announcement did not affect much have made up mind must suffer have to degree weaned from life considered how hope of ever enjoying delight of family kindred tie have flown away looked with disgust upon career a privateer man career of recklessness blood so denounced by sacred writing have before reflected that if be to leave prison must have other mean of sustenance must probably return to former life load soul with still heavier weight of crime although felt occasional bitter pang at idea of leaving world so young world must not hate still be after few hour communing reflection resigned to fate exclaimed with sincerity thy will be done

peril have be in will influence future life that severe trial will not be thrown away upon trust not sir replied feel that have be good for to have be afflicted believe have be indebted to exertion for deliverance further than having seen letter duly speedily delivered must do more for with will have power be little to do for one who so generously assisted friend in distress be then to believe that be indebted to interest of french lady residing at court of versailles for deliverance even so may appear strange to captain elrington such be case understand that in troubled time ruling monarch of country can not distinguish friend from enemy can only trust to profession be not always sincere there be many in council at time who if pretender a be called have succeeded must long before have joined who have wished success although dared not venture to assist interest of lady in question with people have prevailed over true adherent of hanoverian king thus through lady have obtained release state to in confidence to publish what have told must be to betray friend can be of further service to for can leave prison a soon a please none thank good sir replied have money more than

must give well grounded excuse in next what other mean of gaining livelihood must substitute in stead restlessness induced to get up earlier than usual went out for hour walk upon wharf saw little schooner riding on stream a gently rose dipped to swell ran in with tide looked so beautiful that resolution be already giving way must look at longer so turned from river walked back to owner house be still early when went into eating hall where found miss trevannion alone chapter xii state newly awakened scruple a to lawfulness of privateer man life to mr trevannion nevertheless undertake cruise save youth from drowning who prof to be conflict with french privateer take deliver prize return to liverpool resign command of sparrow hawk agree to superintend mr trevannion business miss trevannion dear madam be taller than sex usually be figure slight still unformed to certain degree promising perfection hair be very dark feature regular handsome complexion very pale skin fair a snow a stood in silence reminded of classical antique statue hardly appeared to breathe through delicate lip when be animated with conversation almost reminded of promethean fire poet state be stolen from heaven to animate piece of marble then colour came in cheek intelligence played on countenance thing at first sight appeared wanting be like magic found to light up face smile be sweetest ever beheld one of smile bestowed upon a entered room paid obeisance night before have not observed much be too busy with father captain levee sat remote from table distant from light never spoke when took hand thanked a mentioned before thought then that voice be like silver bell made other remark upon have however exchanged few word before father came in accompanied by captain levee sat down to morning repast of chocolate after have broken fast captain levee hastened away on board of vessel imprisonment have detained from sailing mr trevannion be anxious that must be off a soon a possible to make up for lost time a expense of vessel be heavy farewell elrington for present said will come to on board of schooner time during day when captain levee be gone for to tell truth be afraid of ridicule thought good opportunity to give thought to owner a have nothing to say daughter might not hear began a follows mr trevannion think right to state to that during imprisonment great change have come over feeling upon certain point be not ashamed to acknowledge that have be occasioned by death stared in face from having seriously communed with examined more than perhaps have done during whole of former life sacred writing be given a guide point to refer be have come to conviction that privateering be not lawful honourable profession with feeling must wish to resign command of schooner have have kindness to give indeed elrington replied mr trevannion well must not have thought to have heard from confess much a respect scruple be too scrupulous can hardly imagine that have turned to sect of quaker think fighting be contrary to scripture sir not so far a consider war a profession necessary honourable nation be bound to be prepared for foreign attack to act upon defensive on offensive if be necessary be not that consider soldier who fight for country be not doing duty seaman who be employed by state be not equally justified in profession what refer to be privateering be vessel fitted out for purpose of aggression by private merchant merely for sake of profit be not fitted out with patriotic motif merely for gain be speculation in life of people on side be sacrificed for sake of lucre have witnessed such scene of bloodshed cruelty a have during career such dreadful passion let loose defying restraint must agree with that who lead such miscreant to quarry have much to answer for be possible to control men on board of privateer a men be controlled in king service might be more excusable manned a privateer always will be with most reckless character when once be roused by opposition stimulated by sight of plunder drunken with victory power on earth can restrain barbarity vengeance captain of privateer who attempted must in most case if stood between will unless be supported victim to rashness have seen now express have long felt even when younger more thoughtless know that did give up privateering at one time because be shocked at excess to be party since have accepted command of vessel for idea of being captain be too flattering to vanity to permit to refuse reflection have again decided not to engage in further hope communication will not displease mr trevannion if be wrong in opinion at event be sincere for be giving up only source of livelihood from sense of duty know that be sincere elrington replied mr trevannion at same time think that be much too strait laced in opinion when nation be at war mutually do mischief that can to other can not see what difference there be between fitting out privateer under king authority king having vessel men for national service government fit out vessel that can when own fund be exhausted encourage individual to employ capital in adding to mean of distressing enemy if have property on high sea must be respected more than other english property by enemy certainly not therefore be not bound to respect theirs end of war be to obtain honourable peace more enemy be distressed sooner be likely to obtain one therefore consider that privateering be worse than other specie of warfare that privateer man be whit more reckless brutal than soldier men of war men in hour of victory in king service there be difference sir replied first in officer commanding although glad to obtain prize money be stimulated by nobler feeling a well look to honour distinction have feeling that be defending king country to support throw halo on exertion have such control over men that although admit be equally inclined to excess a privateer man be held in check by authority dare not resist now mr trevannion privateer men seek not honour be not stimulated by desire to serve country look to be how to obtain property of others under sanction must without risk do so must care little whether be english property not provided that put money into pocket if held opinion a seaman on board of privateer what must feel now when be leader of such people responsibility of act be thrown upon shoulder for such feel be case think replied mr trevannion that have better not discus question further just now of course must decide for have favour to ask of trusting to resuming command of vessel have one to replace at present hope will not refuse to take command of for one more cruise must on return on mature reflection be of same opinion a be now certainly will no longer press to remain will do can to assist in other view may have to sir can have objection replied must be unfair of to leave without captain to vessel be therefore ready to sail in a soon a please upon understanding may quit if be of same opinion a be now upon return to port thank dear sir said mr trevannion rising be request must now go to counting house so saying left room countenance showed that be far from pleased miss trevannion who have be silent listener to conversation a soon a father have closed door after thus spoke captain elrington opinion of young maiden like can be of little value know not how much pleasure have given by sentiment have expressed ala that man so good so generous so feeling in other respect must be led away by desire of gain to be owner of such description of property in town wealth be thing way by be obtained be not thought of father father left large property in vessel employed wholly in slave trade be through persuasion of poor mother that father be induced to give up nefarious traffic since capital have be chiefly employed in privateering if not so brutal disgraceful be certainly nearly a demoralizing have be home short time have already ventured to express opinion certainly not so forcibly so well a have upon subject be laughed at a tender hearted girl who must not be fit judge of such matter now that captain of one of vessel have expressed dislike to profession think good may arise if father be poor man must be more excusable if excuse there can be such be not case be wealthy to whom have to leave wealth to only child captain elrington be right be firm father obligation to be very great opinion will have influence be daughter only daughter love for be great know also have power over supported a have be by will now exert to utmost to persuade to retire from further employment of mean in such speculation thanked yesterday when first saw for noble behaviour little thought must have again in so short time to express thanks miss trevannion did not wait for reply from then quitted room must say that although so young person be much pleased at miss trevannion approval of sentiment appeared from very short acquaintance have have with to be person of firm decided disposition very different from insipid class of female generally met with approval strengthened resolution still a have promised father must go cruise in privateer left house went on board to resume command return be joyfully hailed by officer men be not always case found a may be supposed ready for sea at minute warning so that have nothing to do to embark effect did before noon be passed then went on shore to mr trevannion to receive order found with captain levee in back room told mr trevannion have resumed command be ready to sail a soon a pleased must make up for lost time elrington replied have ordered captain levee to cruise to northward of western isle occasionally working up a far a scilly isle now think have better take ground in channel between dunkirk calais there be a much to be made by salvage in recapturing english vessel in quarter a there be in taking enemy vessel be sure added mr trevannion smiling will think that legitimate warfare at captain levee laughed said have be told what said to mr trevannion elrington said that be effect of being condemned for high treason must wear off in three month cruise good impression do wear off very soon fear replied hope that will not be case in instance will see good fellow replied captain levee for part hope will for otherwise will lose best privateer man ever fell in with however be use bringing up question now let wait till cruise be over meet again good bye elrington may be fortunate anchor be short stay apeak will be under sail in hour captain levee sailed at time that mentioned remained at anchor till next morning then once more be running down irish channel before stiff breeze forgot to mention while at mr trevannion have looked at address of catholic priest who have announced to release from prison have left copy of a well a of of lady at paris in care of mr trevannion be now cold autumnal weather channel be rough sailing ground during first fortnight be fortunate enough to make two recapture of considerable value arrived safely in thames after have succession of gale front southward being time of equinox drove close to sand of yarmouth even have difficulty in clearing getting into sea room by standing to eastward weather still continued very bad be lying to under storm sail for several day at last found degree half to northward off coast of norfolk when weather moderated wind changed to northward be fine clear night with moon be running before wind to regain cruising ground wind again shifted baffled at last fell light being on wind did not make more than four mile hour although there be very little sea about one o'clock in morning have gone on deck be walking to fro with first officer mr james when thought heard faint hallo from to windward stop said silence there forward listened thought that heard cry again mr james said did not hear one shout sir replied wait then listen did so must not hear repeated be certain that heard voice a if on water said perhaps one have fallen overboard turn hand up to muster haul fore sheet to windward men be mustered one be missing be fancy sir observed first officer may have be replied be still in own mind persuaded that such be case perhaps be mistaken will let draw fore sheet sir said mr james yes may a well wind be lighter than be think will have calm will be a much a can do to stem tide hold own observed mr james let draw fore sheet lad somehow have feeling must not surmount that certainly have heard faint shout although admitting such to be case there be little chance of being of service to one felt reluctance to leave spot a walked deck silent alone feeling became insurmountable remained on deck till tide turned then instead of taking advantage of so a to gain to southward put schooner head other way so a to keep a near a must to spot where voice reducing sail so a just to stem tide can not now account for anxiety under circumstance most certainly never must have felt unless be that providence be pleased to interpose on occasion more directly than usual must not leave deck waited for daylight with great impatience a day dawned have telescope in hand looking round compass at last a sun rose from fog on horizon something attracted eye made out to be two mast of vessel have sunk in about six fathom water still must see nothing except mast however to make sure made sail on schooner stood towards short tack enabled to fetch in hour passed wreck about half musket shot to windward when perceived arm lifted up out of water waved to there be somebody there said be right quickly lad fore sheet to windward lower down stern boat be done in minute in short time boat returned bringing with lad about sixteen year old whom have found in water clinging to mast of vessel be too much exhausted to speak move be put into bed covered up with blanket warm spirit water poured down throat then hoisted up boat made sail upon schooner went down below to breakfast rejoicing have acted upon impulse have felt have thus be instrumental in saving life of fellow creature few minute after be put into bed lad fell into sound sleep continued during whole of day next morning awoke greatly recovered very hungry a soon a have rose dressed then sent for a be impatient to see learn history when entered cabin struck have seen feature before where must not say to inquiry stated that brig be jane mary of hull laden with coal that have started wooden end during gale that have filled so rapidly that got boat from off boom to save life from heavy sea running confusion boat have be bilged against bulwark went down a be shoving off that have supported by one of oar be soon separated from companion who floated around that during time brig have sunk clinging to oar have be drawn towards a sank carried foot under water on rising perceived top gallant mast above water have made for on looking round must not see of rest of crew who must have perished that have be two day on mast be perished with cold finding that foot hung down on water be much warmer than other portion of body exposed to wind have sunk down in water remained there have not done so must have perished asked how long have be at sea said have only gone one voyage have be three month on board there be something in manner so superior to condition of apprentice stated to be on board of vessel felt such interest must not account for towards lad that then asked who be friend replied stammering that have not friend in world except brother older than by many year did not know where be father name be alive who be must tell that will not know where to send youth be very confused must not give answer come lad said think a have saved life deserve little confidence will not be misplaced perceive that have not be brought up a lad for sea must therefore trust will sir replied if will not send back to father mother certainly not against will good lad replied although will probably persuade can to return to presume ran away from home yes sir did replied for must not possibly stay there longer brother did so before for same reason did well promise if will confide in will not force inclination so now tell who be father mother why left home want friend now without confidence can not expect friendship will tell sir replied for see by face that will not take advantage of then commenced may imagine surprise dear madam when found that be own brother philip whom have left child of ten year old who be addressing have a have asserted left home thrown on wide world for same reason have for spirit like mine must not brook treatment received allowed to finish narrative then made known to may imagine scene delight of poor fellow who a encircled in arm clinging to with tear of joy on cheek told that great object have be to find out that although have idea what have become of thought most likely that have taken to seafaring life now felt certain that providence have specially interposed in business have for own good reason created unusual feeling of interest described to might be saviour of brother most grateful be can assure have now companion friend one to love to cherish be longer alone in world know when have felt so happy for long while left brother below in cabin went on deck to acquaint officer with strange meeting intelligence soon ran through vessel of course poor shipwrecked boy became object of unusual interest that whole day be interrogating receiving intelligence from relative to family made describe sister member of even servant neighbour be not forgotten for first time since have quitted home knew what have occurred during six year of absence from account gave certainly have inclination ever to return a long a certain party be in existence brother declared that nothing force must ever induce more talked with more be pleased with appeared of frank noble disposition full of honour high sentiment winning in manner mirthful to excess indeed handsome countenance implied expressed a much did not deceive hardly need say that took up quarter in cabin having procured for more suitable apparel looked what be perfect young gentleman be soon general favourite on board not only with officer with men one must have thought that danger distress have found in must have sickened for sea for ever be quite contrary delighted in profession be certainly born to be sailor asked what felt when have remained so long clinging to mast if have not given up hope of being saved replied that have not that did not know how long might have have to remain there that have never abandoned idea of being taken off by vessel that thought that might have continued there for twenty four hour longer without being exhausted a after have sunk into water felt warm exertion be necessary be of such buoyant spirit a madam seaman must be made can not have idea of pleasure experienced at falling in with brother philip appeared to have given new stimulus to existence even privateering did not appear so hateful to after have heard express delight at being likely to be so employed for such stated have long be ardent wish two day afterwards have regained cruising ground perceived french privateer steering for port of calais in company with large merchant vessel have captured wind be light discovered at daybreak just a fog cleared away being then about mid channel not more than five mile distant made sail soon be within gun shot frenchman appeared determined not to part with prize without trial of strength a captured vessel be nearest to decided to retake first then fight if wished therefore steered to lay prize by board frenchman lugger of twelve gun perceiving intention made also for prize to defend steering up for close hauled running down to free prize lying between sheltering of from other gun be difficult to say whether frenchman be first to touch side with respective vessel rather think that frenchman be second two before at event be quicker than be be on deck first besides having advantage of assistance of men already on board so that be taken at great disadvantage however did gain deck by boarding at two point forward aft fierce contest ensued french be more numerous than be men be better selected being very powerful athletic fellow philip have boarded with other party forward be led by chief officer party who be abaft not being so numerous be beaten back to taffrail of vessel where stood at bay defending against furious assault of frenchman if lost other party gained for whole body of frenchman be between who faced philip party be driven back to abaft mainmast so happened that philip be thrown down on deck men passed over while in position unable to rise from pressure upon heard calling out from below told that english prisoner be in hold a soon a must rise threw off hatch rushed up to number of twenty three stout fellow to support cheering most manfully by cheer announcing to french that have received assistance gave fresh courage to men who be hard pressed faint with great exertion cheered rushed upon enemy who be already weakened by many of having turned round to resist increased impetus from forward cheer be replied to by philip party prisoner french be losing day made desperate rush upon philip men succeeded in driving back to before main hatch what gained forward lost abaft a pushed on with vigour be last attempt main hatch being open several of in confusion fell into others followed of own accord at last one of be beaten down from deck hatch be put over with three cheer now for privateer be own cried philip follow men continued a sprang upon bulwark of prize from thence into main rigging of lugger alongside most of men followed a there be few men left on board of lugger be soon in possession thus have enemy prize without firing cannon shot be strange that combat between two privateer must thus be decided upon deck of vessel such be fact have several men badly wounded not one killed french be not quite so fortunate a seven of men lay dead upon deck prize proved to be antelope west indiaman laden with sugar rum of considerable value gave up to captain crew who have afforded such timely assistance be not little pleased at being thus rescued from french prison privateer be named jean bart of twelve gun one hundred fifteen men away in prize be new vessel first cruise a required many men to man have prisoner to incumber resolved must take to liverpool at once six day afterwards arrived there without further adventure philip gallant conduct have won great favour with officer men must say that felt very proud of a soon a have anchored vessel went on shore with philip to mr trevannion to give account of what have occurred during short cruise hardly need say that be satisfied with result a have made three recapture of value besides privateer introduced philip to acquainting with miraculous preservation mr trevannion very kindly invited for present to remain in house then took leave promising to be back by dinner time went with philip to fit out in more creditable way having made purchase given order being then almost two o'clock post meridiem hastened to mr trevannion that might be in time for dinner be must confess anxious to see miss trevannion for have often occupied thought during cruise met with great friendliness welcomed back dinner be very agreeable philip sally be much approved of be indeed mirthful witty lad full of jest humour with good presence withal mr trevannion being called out just a dinner be finished miss trevannion observed presume mr elrington that good fortune reputation have acquired in so short time have put end to misgiving a to privateer man life be not quite so light inconstant miss trevannion replied rejoice that in cruise have really nothing to lament blush for trust at same time have be serviceable to country opinion be same certainly wish have fought under king pennant instead of on board of privateer be then of same mind intend to resign command do miss trevannion although admit that lad welfare make more important than ever must have mean of livelihood rejoice to hear speak thus mr elrington think father obligation to be such that if doe not assist must feel ashamed of such be certain will not be case will forward view whatever may be to utmost of power at same time admit from conversation have have with that will be mortified at resigning command so will said philip for agree with brother see more harm in privateering than in other fighting suppose miss trevannion have be cause of brother scruple tell candidly to face that thank for miss trevannion coloured up at remark then replied think mr philip have have pleasure of seeing brother more than three time in life that within last six week sure be that have not have quarter of hour conversation altogether be therefore assuredly too much to say that be cause brother will tell that expressed opinion before ever have have conversation with may be replied philip approved of sentiment concluded business be sure wonder at only hope that wo ask to do thing wish to do for be sure must never refuse thing be glad to hear say so mr philip for if see do think wrong will certainly try influence over replied miss trevannion smiling really be not aware that have such power here mr trevannion came in again conversation be changed shortly afterwards miss trevannion left room philip who be tired of sitting while mr trevannion took pipe who be anxious to see town also left then stated to mr trevannion that having now completed cruise have agreed must wished to know whether have provided with captain a appear so determined dear elrington will only say that be very sorry will not urge matter longer daughter told since absence that be certain that must adhere to resolution although hoped contrary yet have be considering in way can serve be not only pleasure duty so to do have not forgotten never will forget that in probability saved life by self devotion in affair of jacobite when first came to be recommended a good accountant to certain degree man of business at event proved well acquainted apt at figure do think that situation on shore must suit must endeavour to give satisfaction sir replied fear must have much to learn of course must reply that must soon learn now elrington have to say to be be getting old in few year will be past work think must like a assistant for present successor hereafter if must like to join will superintend more active portion of business have doubt that in year two will be master of whole a know have privateer have merchant vessel keep storehouse have done well up to present not so well perhaps now a did when have slave vessel be most profitable deceased wife persuaded to give up traffic have not resumed in honour of memory foolish woman must never interfere in such matter let pas what have to say be that if choose after year to join a partner will give eighth of business a continue will make over further share in proportion to profit will make such arrangement a to enable at death to take whole concern upon favourable term mr trevannion knocked ash out of pipe a concluded be replied a may imagine sir much gratified honoured at proposal hardly need say that willingly accept only hope will make allowance for ignorance at first setting off not ascribe to other cause imperfection may assure good will will never be wanting on part will work day night if required to prove gratitude for so kind offer then be settled said mr trevannion what be to do with brother philip think for sir doe not agree with on question in point of course have right to insist that scruple must be indeed fear must have little chance in persuading a be so fond of life of adventure be natural in one so young age will sober then have objection to going on board of privateer must rather that be in other service sir a can not control must submit if insist upon following profession be gallant clever boy a soon a can will try to procure situation in king ship at present must go to sea in way other be perhaps better that must be in good hand such a captain levee for instance on board of privateer than mix up with who might demoralize more well then will have choice replied mr trevannion be smart lad will do credit wherever may be if may take liberty to advise sir replied think must not do better than to give command of sparrow hawk to chief officer mr james be good seaman brave man have doubt will acquit to satisfaction be thinking same a recommend will take place now a be settled may a well go on board make known that have resigned command tell mr james that be to take place bring clothes on shore will find apartment ready for on return for in future will of course consider house a residence assure now that leave be almost glad that affair be arranged a be wanted assistance be fact hold fortunate that be party who have be selected will meet in evening mr trevannion then went away in direction of daughter room instead of counting house a usual quitted house did not go immediately down to wharf to embark wanted to have short time for reflection for be much overpowered with mr trevannion kindness happy prospect before walked out in country for distance deep in own reflection must say that miss trevannion be too often interfering with train of thought have of course fixed idea more than once be weighing in mind whether must not make known to who be how superior in birth to what imagined after hour passed in building castle retraced step passed through town going down to wharf waved handkerchief for boat be soon on board then summoned officer men told that have resigned command of vessel that in future be to consider mr james a captain packed up clothes leaving many article for successor be longer of use to must have be compelled to replace philip found be down in cabin with have long conversation stated wish to remain at sea saying that preferred privateer to merchant vessel king ship to privateer not being old enough sufficient time at sea to be eligible for king ship agreed that must sail with captain levee a soon a came back from cruise have already sent in good prize a soon a clothes other article be put into boat wished farewell be cheered by men a pulled on shore effect be taken up to mr trevannion house by seaman to whom gave gratuity be met by mr trevannion who showed into large well furnished bed room told be in future to be considered a own passed away afternoon in arranging clothes did not go down to parlour till supper time where found miss trevannion who congratulated upon having changed occupation to one more worthy of made suitable reply sat down to supper having described first great event in life will for present conclude chapter xiii after staying year with mr trevannion proposes to take into partnership decline offer from conscientious motif miss trevannion treat with unmerited coldness father anger make resolve to quit house what overhear see before departure ring may now behold in very different position dear madam instead of laced hat hanger at side imagine in plain suit of gray with black button pen behind ear instead of walking deck balancing to motion of vessel be now perched immoveably upon high stool instead of sweeping horizon with telescope watching straining bending of spar aloft be now with eye incessantly fixed upon ledger day book absorbed in calculation may inquire how liked change at first must confess not over much notwithstanding dislike to life of privateer man often sighed heavily wished that be officer in king service change from life of activity to one of sedentary habit be too sudden often found with eye still fixed upon figure before absorbed in sort of castle building reverie in be boarding chasing enemy handling cutlas sometimes so moved by imagination a to brandish arm over head when exclamation of surprise from one of clerk must remind of folly angry with must once more resume pen after time have more command over must sit steadily at work mr trevannion have often observed how absent be be source of amusement to when met at dinner daughter must say so hear have sea fight morning mr elrington father must laugh heartily a gave description of ridiculous conduct very soon with kind assistance of mr trevannion became master of work gave satisfaction chief employment consisted in writing letter to correspondent at first only copied mr trevannion letter in private letter book a became aware of nature of correspondence what be necessary to be detailed then made rough copy of letter submitted to mr trevannion for approval at first there be few alteration made afterwards wrote fairly out almost invariably gave satisfaction if thing be added be in postscript mr trevannion affair found be much more extensive than have imagined have two privateer two vessel on coast of africa trading for ivory gold dust other article two three vessel employed in trading to virginia for tobacco other produce smaller vessel engaged in newfoundland fishery when have taken in cargo ran to mediterranean to dispose of returned with mediterranean produce to liverpool that be very wealthy man independent of large stake upon sea be certain have lent much money to guild of liverpool have tenanted property in county of knew nothing except from payment of rent what surprised much be that man of mr trevannion wealth having one child to provide for must not retire from business once made remark to daughter reply be thought a do once now think differently when have be on visit with father have stayed away for several week have idea how restless uneasy have become from want of occupation have become habit habit be second nature be not from wish to accumulate that continues at counting house because can not be happy without employment therefore longer persuade to leave off a be convinced that must be persuading to be unhappy until came think fatigue be too great for have a apprizes relieved of heaviest portion of labour hardly need say that be rejoiced that have so done certainly be not that requires to make money miss trevannion a be so liberal in thing must credit what assert that be dislike to having employment induces to continue in business have not yet become such habit in continued smiling think must leave off with great pleasure be not that because have not yet recovered from former habit be so at variance with quiet sedentary life replied fear be so said believe of habit of vagrant be most difficult to overcome used to laugh at first few month be here presume that be little improved a have not be attacked lately father say so be much pleased with mr elrington if telling so give satisfaction certainly doe because wish to please too hope yes most truly miss trevannion only wish have in power to show how much study good opinion will risk father displeasure for replied looking at fixedly yes will provided oh there be proviso already grant that there must not have be a be sure that must not ask to do thing be wrong proviso be that did not undertake what conscience did not approve proviso be good mr elrington for when woman must persuade man must be particularly guarded that be not led into error by rash promise think however that be agreed upon point will therefore come at once to what wish to do be intention of father in course of few day when will have accomplished year of service to offer to take into partnership be certain will be on liberal term now wish to refuse offer unless give up privateering will do so at risk be truly glad have encouragement for taking such bold step tell frankly that will be very indignant there be excitement about privateering have become almost necessary to care little about remainder of speculation be so blind to immorality to lead that doe not think be unlawful pursuit if did be sure that must abandon persuasion have be useless if favourite only daughter can not prevail what chance have miss trevannion better chance mr elrington be partial to be woman look upon observation a woman weakness objection raised by man young man one who have so long be actively engaged in service will therefore carry more weight besides have now become so accustomed to have have so much trouble taken off hand at same time have such implicit confidence in that think if find that have to choose between leaving leaving off privateering will hesitate in relinquishing latter have moreover great weight with mr elrington father be fully aware of deep obligation be under to courage self devotion in affair of jacobite refugee will therefore succeed if be firm if do succeed will have gratitude if be of importance to friendship know have already entrance of mr trevannion prevented reply have be waiting for return from walk dinner have be ready time have just seen of men of arrow said mr trevannion taking off hat spencer detained have captain levee arrived then sir said have sent in prize of great value laden with light ware men in charge tell have have rough affair with vessel armed en flute that have lost men brother philip a usual be wounded must here observe that during year have passed away two privateer have be several time in port have met with moderate success barely sufficient to pay expense brother philip have always conducted very gallantly have be twice wounded in different engagement well sir replied think that loss of little blood will do harm to hot headed youth a master philip hope in short time to give opportunity of shedding in service of king instead of in pursuit of money indeed continued a sat down to table enemy be now so cautious have so few vessel on high sea that fear privateering account current will not be very favourable when balanced a will be in few day notwithstanding cargo of ware just arrived then must hope better for next year replied mr trevannion amy dear have be out to day yes sir be riding for two hour have altered pillion yet yes sir came home last night be now very comfortable called at mr carleton who be much better what fop mr carleton be know what scented powder us perfumed whole room have not mr carleton be invalid must have opened window mr trevannion then turned conversation to political intelligence have just received engaged till dinner be over returned to counting house where found men who have brought in prize who gave letter from philip stating that wound be of consequence communication of mr trevannion took place a daughter have assured must on anniversary of entering into mr trevannion counting house after dinner a a usual be smoking pipe mr trevannion said elrington have be with now one year during time have made fully master of business much to surprise acknowledge still more to satisfaction have reason to be satisfied with may imagine when tell that be now intention to take into partnership trust by so doing that will soon be independent man know capital in business a well a do did say eighth now propose to make over to one fourth to allow profit of year deducting necessary expense to be invested in business until have acquired right to one half of future arrangement will speak hereafter mr trevannion replied that be truly grateful for such unexpected liberality hardly need say have best thanks for noble offer have scruple must confess can not get over scruple exclaimed mr trevannion laying down pipe on table oh see now continued after pause think be robbing daughter labourer be worthy of hire will have more than sufficient carry conscientiousness too far dear fellow have more than enough for amy out of business altogether be aware of sir added did not therefore refer to daughter when said that have scruple must be candid with sir how be that be now in employ why because have dislike to privateering have debt of gratitude to pay exactly sir whether have be pleased to employ not have made up mind a well know from conscientious motif not to continue on board of privateer well grant that same motif sir will not allow to be sharer in profit arising from such source must consider equally wrong if did so a if remained on board be angry with sir continued if with many thanks decline offer of being partner will faithfully serve upon salary may consider may merit trust to liberality in thing mr trevannion made reply have resumed pipe continued to smoke with eye fixed upon mantelpiece a soon a pipe be out rose put on hat walked out of room without making further observation waited few minute then went back to counting house that mr trevannion be seriously offended be convinced valued good opinion of daughter more than did that of mr trevannion indeed feeling towards have during year have be in house gradually become of nature that threatened much peace of mind can not say that loved in usual acceptation of term adoration must better express what felt be so pure so perfect such model of female perfection looked up to with reverence almost quelled feeling of love felt that be above that with wealth must be madness for one in present position to aspire to yet with feeling must have sacrificed hope present advantage to have obtained approving smile be not therefore to be wondered at risked mr trevannion displeasure to gain approbation when resumed seat at desk thought of what have passed made up mind to be once more outcast in world rather than swerve from promise have made to knew mr trevannion to be very decided man hasty when offended that be seriously offended with there be doubt found that have quitted house immediately after have left room have hoped that have gone to daughter apartment that conversation with might have produced good effect such be not case in about hour mr trevannion returned a walked into back room adjoining counting house desired to follow did so mr elrington said sitting down leaving

eastward to cross atlantic met with most violent gale lasted several day fully expected hour that vessel must go down buried a be by heavy sea at last have chance to scud before wind did for two day before raging following sea appeared determined upon destruction on second night a be on deck watching breaking tossing of billow swift career of little bark enabled to avoid water suddenly appeared of one white foam a rose upon next sea be hurled along on crest reeling on foam until have passed then struck heavily upon rock fortunately be soft coral rock have perished next wave lifted up again threw further on on receding little xebeque laid high dry careened over on bilge water rose fell roared foamed about lifted more neither did wash off deck a clung to rigging for stout short mast upon lateen sail be hoisted have not be carried away remained where be till morning one holding on not communicating with other a night wore away so did gale decrease sea subside water now gradually left at interval when wave receded must walk on shore remained on vessel till noon by time found vessel high dry having be carried over coral reef appeared to extend one two mile into offing men who have be much buffeted by wave who be exhausted by clinging so long to rigging now that found safe be warmed by heat of sun rallied began to move about have long consultation a to how must act there be chance of getting vessel off again did not exactly know where be captain agreed that must be upon one of small island of bahama group that have be cast away conjecture be right after consultation captain called men together told that be very probable that might be time before must find mean of getting off island that therefore must do best that must land erect tent with sail obtain provision

anticipating speedy meeting with amy knew how doubtful be chance of being seen by vessel must remain here for month if not longer have be schooled must now say with fervency thy will oh lord not mine be done remained on board of vessel night next morning gale have ceased water to astonishment have receded so a to leave at least sixty yard from sea be now almost calm first took survey of island to ascertain if there be water a island be not more than two mile in circumference did not take long fortunately in centre found deep hole sunk in soft coral rock by other people who have be wrecked here in hole water be although little brackish somewhat palatable evidently be sea water filtered through soft rock whole of island be surrounded with coral reef with lane of deep water running between fish be sporting in thousand after storm there be not tree vestige of vegetation upon whole island soon however discovered that be frequented by turtle for found egg fresh buried in sand having made survey then went back to vessel with spar sail rigged tent upon highest point of island might be ten fifteen foot above level of sea tent be large enough to hold fifty men if required so brought bedding chest cooking apparatus on shore made fire place outside tent with little cabouse have on board of vessel sent man to obtain water from hole put on meat to boil for dinner in evening went out to turn turtle succeeded in turning three when decided that must not capture more until have made turtle pond to put in for have not more than two month provision on board of vessel did not know how long might be detained men behaved very well indeed seemed determined to make a comfortable a must under existing circumstance next day put out line in deep water caught several large fish then went to find proper spot for turtle pond selected hole in reef thought must answer a have only one end of to fill up commenced breaking away rock with crowbar worked hard whole of day breaking others carrying mass broken off by degree rose to surface of water in two day more calculated that pond must be ready to receive turtle have killed one turtle in morning now lived upon altogether a wished to save salt provision captain have many consultation a to what must do what attempt must make to get off from spot build boat must not a have not carpenter among mean of making iron work necessary have tool such a be usually used on board of vessel several pound of large nail none fit for boat building proposed that must examine bottom of xebeque see what damage be done to did so found that garboard streak be broken two of timber be easy to repair in other respect be sound then proposed that must cut down xebeque to large boat must easily do by ripping off plank deck sawing down timber to height required must be heavy boat be true must be able to launch with roller draught of water must be so small that must get over reef must not possibly do xebeque captain approved of idea agreed that a soon a turtle pond be finished must make attempt in two day more have finished pond have turned thirty turtle put into men now that found that have plenty to eat began to show sign of laziness did not very readily commence work upon xebeque ate slept ate slept again on mattress spread in tent at time must fish be with difficulty that captain must persuade to work if did work hour then threw down ax crowbar went back to tent have plenty of tobacco smoked day ate turtle then slept again nevertheless a captain worked hard work progressed in about ten day after began work have ripped off deck side plank a low a thought right be now sawing through timber when quiet of party be disturbed by what may be considered very strange quarrel one of men asserted in conversation that st antony be born in padua one two of other seaman denied difference of opinion at first be mere nothing from sullenness presume something being required to excite in course of day two ended in serious feud paduans terming anti paduans heretic jew epithet of jew be what irritated so much party being exactly even four on side on third day after angry altercation rushed out of tent to decide affair with knife conflict be very fierce took place when captain be at xebeque before must separate four of have fallen two be killed other two badly wounded may appear ridiculous that people must take other life for trifle after nation declare war against other thousand be killed on side for cause almost a slight with great difficulty separated remaining combatant such be rage excitement that now then must attempt to break from attack other again at last disarmed be sad business be melancholy to think that companion in misfortune must take other life instead of feeling grateful to almighty for preservation buried two men who have fallen dressed wound of hurt after quarrel four others came to work continued steady at have now removed upper portion of xebeque commenced fixing beam carlines on lower part so a to make decked boat of in week have decked over have great deal more to do have to reduce mast yard to proper size to alter sail rigging to make small rudder roller to launch upon with reduced force occupied month for two wounded men although recovering must just crawl about turned many more turtle at night that might have sufficient supply now looked out for channel of deep water through reef to get boat out made one out to certain extent must not survey further without getting off reef shark be so numerous that dared not venture however took for granted a have found deep water in shore that must be sure to do so in offing now got boat upon roller have made by digging away sand from beneath trench to water edge have be two month on island when be ready for launching anxious a be to return to england can not say that be unhappy when on island there be always fine sea breeze cooled air enabled to work without exhaustion with exception of unfortunate quarrel have referred to thing went on quietly after work be over resorted a usual to bible read for hour calmed allayed impatient feeling might at time arise felt that have great cause to be grateful to almighty for preserving a have done that must be folly wickedness on part to repine because must not obtain wished waited therefore for own good time without murmuring in full confidence that be for best at last contrived to get boat into water floated much lighter than thought must have done considering weight of wood be in a soon a be anchored about ten foot from beach made gangway to with plank

to carry a there be saying what might be result of new expedition so when other men be busy about own effect asleep first took precaution to roll up in covering of pitch so that if taken from lost might not be known to be diamond then sewed up in piece of leather cut from old glove putting strong leather lanyard to so that might wear round neck having done without one taking notice having nothing else to do took fine twine worked over like mousing of stay in way peculiar to sailor so that when finished be very much in shape of miniature buoy to anchor reminded of fend off fender such a

have arrived at outskirt of wood a soon a have gained beach be yard wide looked round to see if must perceive indian must observe nobody let while be yet dark go round so a to get on opposite side of rock where be concealed said portuguese if be there will take by surprise keeping just within wood walked mile to southward then emerged just a day be breaking made for rock a soon a arrived examined very cautiously before entered cleft there be nobody there canoe be safe be not here said where can be can not be far off said portuguese suspect be hidden somewhere intend to surprise while be launching canoe when musket will be out of hand agree with let now wait at little distance from rock till broad daylight will then be secure from surprise did so when sun rose looked well round must see nobody entered cleft be about to lay down musket lay hold of canoe when perceived small piece of rock to drop down caused immediately to suspect truth cried to portuguese to come back with did so told be certain that indian have climbed rock be lying down on top of ready to pounce upon depend upon must be there said when mentioned falling piece of rock let walk round see if can discover did so be too well concealed what must be done now said be useless attempting to clamber to top of rock for one must do with musket in hand replied be certain if attempt to bring canoe out of cleft may drop

watch while get hold of tow rope bring out indian did not expect manoeuvre be clear still keeping musket in possession butt on sand muzzle resting on shoulder laid hold of tow rope by great exertion hauled canoe several yard away from between two rock then paused for breath after minute two with eye fixed upon top of rock to see if moved then hauled at least hundred yard further off when for first time perceived that bow arrow be not in canoe that must have be taken by indian then must haul again said portuguese when stated to till be out of bow shot let put musket into canoe drag a fast

great matter replied must now drag canoe down to water launch if will let have outwitted so far now turned head of canoe towards sea slowly dragged down eye a may be supposed constantly kept upon rock to see if indian must move did not perhaps felt that have chance with having fire arm open beach in favour launched canoe without further interruption on part in few minute taking care to be out of arrow distance passed rock with head to northward when about two mile off perceived indian to descend from rock walk away into wood let praise god for miraculous escape said to portuguese do holy patron saint who have preserved replied portuguese captain be still heavy at heart feel that have escaped only to come into more strange fresh calamity will never get back to lisbon feel convinced of

labouring at paddle said why not at once let go ashore receive crown of martyrdom be ready for long for hour will rejoice said must to keep quiet be useless such be insanity that gradually neared shore by steering against with paddle so must not prevent have drawn shaft of arrow through arm appeared to feel pain expostulated with at keeping canoe so near to shore smiled gave reply have stream

now must try if can not pick off more of said rising taking musket bring stool over to side for must fire from upper loop hole remained at post for time without seeing indian have gone back to wood for more combustible at last perceived coming back with wood must imagine there be at least twenty of now take good aim said fired almost at same moment three indian fell get down give musket said to mistress handed one taking for herself resumed station fired several time sometimes with sometimes without success for indian went away twice for firewood before have collected what considered sufficient by time be piled up to eaves of cabin loop hole be shut up therefore went over to other side where door be to see if there be indian there must not see one have be on look out for about five minute when crackling of wood smoke forcing through crevice between log told that fire have be applied wind soon fanned up so that flame poured through chink loop hole lighted up cabin must retreat to fire place said come quickly will be shot why so said a did a requested will peep through loop hole on side of cabin where door be see plainly until cabin be filled with smoke soon will be

that do speak so fierce wind drive smoke to leeward in volume great burst of smoke will be when roof be well on fire be now burning fiercely on windward side must wait till lee side have caught then volume of smoke will be greater great point be to hit precise time of opening door escaping shrouded in volume of smoke if too soon will perceive will be shot down if too late roof will fall upon will be smothered burnt have better now think leave be ready best weapon if have to fight way will be axe let take one by now going near to door putting mouth to one of loop hole will breathe freer unbar door at right time do agree with be right said be man be woman left fire place having felt for found ax went near door put mouth to loop hole below smoke passing above enabled to breathe freer looked out perceived that with exception of about six yard to leeward of cabin there be dense volume of smoke rolling along ground for long distance that if must only once gain without being perceived must probably be saved therefore unbarred door drew bolt held in hand ready for start cabin be now in flame in part a well a roof touched mistress then took hand in mine watching at loop hole at last when heat be almost unbearable eddy of wind drove back smoke close to lee side of cabin be dark jumped up opened door dragged mistress after walked out into black mass completely hid from enemy then running hand in hand a fast a must to leeward in centre of smoke found at least one hundred yard from cabin without indian having idea that be not still inside a retreated density of smoke became le then told to run for life a indian must discover that door of cabin be open that have escaped so proved be still hundred yard from wood when yell be given proved that have discovered escape be in pursuit gained wood turned round moment to look behind perceived at least forty fifty indian in full pursuit of foremost about two hundred yard distant now must run for mistress said must no longer take hand will have to thread wood away have time to lose so saying snatched hand from sprang forward following a fast a must more fearful evidently of making escape from than of own escape from indian a soon a be hundred yard in wood turned short to right fled with speed in direction because hoped by mean to deceive indian be easier to run where wood be not so thick mistress followed close must have hallooed to have not breath after first half mile found out that be more fleet than be whether encumbered with clothes perhaps not so much used to exercise heard panting after must easily have left fear be that must have called to if have indian must have heard have known direction have taken when once on trail must a soon a daylight came have followed by to distance therefore slackened speed so a just to enable mistress to keep up with at about ten yard distance when have run about three mile felt certain that must not proceed much further speak must not a ran without once looking behind must make sign continued at le rapid pace for about mile further did to enable to keep up with to recover own breath a much a possible previous to start voice of indian have long be out of hearing be clear that have not discovered direction have taken knew therefore that must not hear now if did cry out a loud a must gradually increased speed till must no longer hear panting behind then went off at full speed after few minute heard voice at distance faintly calling out name yes thought have not forgotten ball chain if thought that have let loose lion while be in cabin will find that have loosed deer in wood then stopped for few moment to recover breath did not however wait long be afraid that mistress might recover breath a well a again set off a fast a must idea of torture from indian again being kept confined by mistress gave endurance thought incapable of before morning calculated that have run at least twenty mile if not more with perspiration running down in stream hardly able to drag one leg before other at last just about daybreak gave up when threw on ground dropped out of hand axe have carried whole way lay there for more than hour tormented with thirst

pale than usually be evidently suffers much for life be wrapped in yours now having told must come into state room allow to enable to appear a brother ought to do think that there be difference in size now although there be when last parted many thanks philip before adonize outward man must wish to satisfy inward craving to tell truth be so hungry from not having broken fast for nearly twenty four hour that if must order something to eat while be looking out clothes must feel in small degree grateful philip rang bell ordered steward in bring something to eat drink after eating occupied quarter of hour more in getting rid of pirate smoke dirt putting on one of uniform for have other clothes on board when came out looking not at like pirate now then said philip before have tete tete come out with let introduce to officer a brother went out with be formally introduced first lieutenant apologized for rough speech told that there be occasion for apology a have doubt that looked very much like pirate at time more than do now sir at event replied by bye brother said there be one man among prisoner who although compelled to act a captain by men be pirate conduct will explain to may request to be kindly treated name be toplift also two portuguese former companion certainly replied philip word be sufficient let person be released taken care of said to first lieutenant will wait for particular by by remained on deck about ten minute then returned to cabin with brother what be have left on dressing table said philip surveying leather bag contained diamond philip said be portion of narrative eventually may prove very important one think can afford to make present of will see doe not look very valuable replied at event do favour to lock up carefully replied well if be in earnest will said having put in drawer locked up said now alexander let have history commenced told that reader be now acquainted with dinner broke off narrative a soon a be over resumed when have finished expressed astonishment asked many question among others said little wretch peleg captain of transcendant son be on board have not seen replied therefore presume that be not able to move went down in schooner be case have indeed told strange tale said philip have have extraordinary escape must have charmed life appear to have be preserved to prove amy persuasion of being still alive be just well founded now be turn to talk yours to listen when left a lieutenant of captain levee schooner very shortly afterwards have action with spanish vessel of very superior force for mounted thirty gun having chance with from superior weight of metal threw on bow boarded spaniard did not relish kind of close fighting gave immediate possession of deck captain levee when brought in prize be appointed to frigate of thirty six gun followed a first lieutenant have combat with vessel of equal force in be victor be sent in prize captain levee wrote very kindly in behalf be made captain given command of small brig let first finish with captain levee captured galleon gave large fortune then gave up command of ship went on shore telling in letter that have hitherto squandered away money now that have got so much intended to keep have done so for have purchased large landed property be married believe be very happy deserves replied long may be so well to continue be sent out on station having information that vessel be now on board of be at anchor in bay close to havannah ran in reconnoitred hoisted spanish colour did same fell calm lay about four mile outside be mistaken for spanish vessel captain of vessel to speak correctly spanish captain of spanish brig came out to see did not discover mistake till be on board detained boat crew continued calm till evening when breeze sprung up put head of brig right for bay a if be going in to anchor breeze being light be dark before got in alongside vessel be completely surprised for imagined that captain be dining with old friend having idea that be thing spanish have not least preparation for resistance have possession of deck before must seize arm brought out without one knowing that have be captured on arrival admiral gave command of have held for nine month be very defective be ordered home must have sailed have not be that scoundrel captain of transcendant gave information induced to come round to back of island little did think what happiness awaited so much for think egotist for speaking of be only clearing away le important information to arrive at most interest amy arrived safe with valuable cargo captain reported that have remained at rendezvous until blown off by sort of hurricane that finding long way off considered when gale have ceased that be not justified in remaining with so valuable cargo be bound to make best of way to liverpool be right conduct be approved of by mr trevannion who looked for arrival hour at last week passed away did not make appearance great alarm be entertained for safety week grew into month be supposed that have be upset in same hurricane have driven amy so far off from rendezvous poor girl whyna be a may suppose kindly received by mr trevannion daughter soon gained affection pined for return when be told that be dead never recovered climate certainly did not agree with contracted very bad cough during winter believe from heart that be loss affected most severely after have be about eighteen month in england fell into consumption died poor whyna said with sigh alexander said philip perhaps be for best for poor girl loved sincerely supposing that be now still alive living with miss trevannion on return marriage must of course unless heaven decree otherwise will take place that poor creature must have be very unhappy although idea of being rival to miss trevannion be something may appear absurd to yet have same feeling must have endured same pang a other woman let colour be what may think therefore removal be blessing happy dispensation saw mr trevannion daughter once previous to receiving letter from rio acquainting with misfortune happy deliverance from slavery be very dejected mr trevannion talked of retiring from business living upon property near liverpool a corresponded regularly with amy learnt that have done so have just wound up affair when letter arrived from rio with order on portuguese exchequer for considerable sum hardly need say that joy occasioned by intelligence be great amy recovered good look father bitterly lamented having retired from business a have wished to have made whole over to money remitted from rio considered a own also set apart share of business from time that be admitted a partner be not aware that must carry diamond of such immense value about person exposed to view of one among indian settler pirate that delight be equal to theirs will be sure give credit to believe although be obliged to sail for west indie day anticipated receiving letter informing of arrival in england judge then distress at first receiving letter stating that have not be heard of for three month after leaving rio expression of fear that accident have happened then month after month many more more desponding letter in mr trevannion plainly stated that xebeque must have foundered only amy clinging to hope that be still alive acknowledge considered dead may therefore imagine surprise delight when signature on slip of paper proved that be not only in existence on board of same vessel with such be narrative of brother philip in return for mine be late at night when parted how sincerely did pray that night thanking heaven for mercy entreating that cup might not be again dashed from lip when arose next morning found that philip be on deck followed will soon be in port royal with wind said hope to find admiral still there have conversation with officer then went below to see toplift be in hammock for have much fever suffered from wound surgeon said that must do well toplift said must keep mind at ease for brother have promised that will not be tried with others have doubt that when explains whole to admiral will be thanked for service thanked said toplift if be not hanged will be fortunate enough fear of replied so keep mind easy get well a fast a can well then sir have saved life at event for have not come on board one must have ever spoken for believed be not pirate in heart like others except two portuguese if necessary will be evidence in favour think evidence will be required except mine will be sufficient with admiral promised that must never want mean of getting livelihood repeat that promise now thank sir replied then left went up to cabin to breakfast following day be at anchor at port royal brother reported what have occurred admiral sent for pirate prisoner except toplift whose case be so fully represented by brother that be permitted to go at large to take passage home to england free of expense if wished be hardly necessary to say that toplift accepted offer remained in vessel with two portuguese be also liberated three day after arrival sailed for england after quick run of between five six week anchored at spithead brother must not leave ship therefore requested to write to liverpool stating that have intelligence of be alive that have be wrecked have fallen into hand of indian near english settlement in virginia have escaped be believed at james town considered wise to make communication like at first a too sudden announcement might be dangerous to one in so weak state of health a philip stated amy to be from letter have received from father remained with at portsmouth until reply came mr trevannion wrote told philip that communication have a be raised daughter from grave a have fallen into state of profound melancholy nothing must remove that have very cautiously introduced subject by degree told what be reported eventually when found that be more composed that have put philip letter into hand concluded that trusted must arrive soon for if accident be now to happen to must be death of daughter who have not strength enough left to bear reverse at request philip then wrote that have received letter from brother officer stating be well safe on board that must be in england few day after receipt of letter leaving direction to philip how to proceed now went off to london having fitted out with

received money bill on government to amount wrote to philip telling what have taken place strange that from two slave in mine must have received such valuable legacy from poor ingram diamond worth so

have received reply containing so satisfactory account of amy restored health that have written to tell have arrived safe in england must be very soon with recommended going immediately a anxiety suspense must be very injurious to amy health therefore made arrangement for departure purchased horse procured four stout serving men well armed to accompany wrote letter sent by express courier
