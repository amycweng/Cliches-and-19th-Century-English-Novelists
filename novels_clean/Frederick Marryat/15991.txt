well ask one question although not of great consequence earl be married perceive by peerage find that have child on contrary have two prospect of more may now request particular connected with property exact particular sir can not well tell a be not acquainted with property in question rather think depends upon name may venture to ask name of child mr de benyon gave list seriatim put down with great gravity of course there be doubt of second brother not being married believe ought to have certificate do know address have be in east indie for many year returned home on furlough have now just sailed again for calcutta be unfortunate must forward letter through india board may also be favoured with address a in probability may be advisable mr de benyon gave address rose promised to give particular a soon a be known to bowed made exit to one who be in sober sens there certainly be not important information gained to be evident that mr de benyon who be general in army be to be interrogated have almost made up mind to set off for calcutta chapter xlii affront irish gentleman make handsome apology be accepted before have gained own room informed mr cophagus who have just returned from visit to maiden aunt house of what have passed ca see anything in japhet wild goose chase who told oh pleggit men sad liar de benyon not name depend upon stuff so on when reflected must acknowledge that worthy apothecary might be right be running after shadow be only in occasional fit of despondency soon rallied be a sanguine a ever undecided how to proceed annoyed by what cophagus have said quitted hotel to walk out in very good humour a went out perceived agent m'dermott speaking to people in bar sight of reminded of what for moment have forgotten be to ascertain whether melchior sir henry de clare be one same person a passed crossing man in tattered habiliment who be sweeping asked for alms being in very charitable humour walked on followed pestering so much that gave tap with cane in hand saying to be off scoundrel oh very well be off be mane by blood of o'rourkes will answer for same anyhow passed on having perambulated city of dublin for time returned to hotel few minute afterwards be told by waiter that mr o'donaghan wished to speak to have not honour of acquaintance replied may show up mr o'donaghan entered tall thick whiskered personage in shabby genteel dress evidently not made for pair of white cotton glove small stick believe have honour of spaking to gentleman who crossed over street about two hour ago upon word sir replied be so uncertain definition can hardly pretend to say whether be person mean indeed from not having pleasure of one acquaintance in dublin rather think there must be mistake devil bit of mistake at at for there be little bit of cane with paid friend mr o'rourke compliment over shoulder really be quite mystified sir understand will favour with explanation with pleasure in life for then will come to right understanding be crossing street gentleman particular friend of mine with broom carry for own amusement did honour to address whereupon of same little stick of yours did honour to give slight taste what do mean do refer to sweeper who be so importunate when crossed over road then by power have just hit a did be particular friend thaddeus o'rourke gentleman gentleman exclaimed with a good a true milesian blood a in ireland if think sir that because friend just for own amusement think proper to put on worst of clothes carry broom just by way of exercise to prevent becoming too lusty be therefore to be struck like hound be slight mistake be here sir be card will oblige by mentioning friend of yours with whom may settle little point necessary before meeting of two gentleman must hardly refrain from laughing at irish gentleman friend thought advisable to retain countenance dear sir replied grief to heart must have committed error in not perceiving gentility of friend have not be so careless certainly must have requested to do honour to accept shilling instead of having offered insult hope be not now too late by power be not one of harum scarum sort who must make up fight when there be occasion for a 'haviour be that of gentleman think will perhaps be better to shake hand upon forget altogether suppose now will consider that be mistake give shilling a intended to do will swear only be in so great hurry then perhaps will not object to throw in shilling for same tap with cane just to wipe off insult a be a do sin when fork out money receive absolution from padre then perhaps will not think too much if charge shilling for time trouble for carrying message between two gentleman on contrary mr o'donaghan think demand be reasonable here be money mr o'donaghan took three shilling then sir many thanks to will wish good evening mr o'rourke will know from that have absolution for whole that have offered satisfaction one gentleman must expect from so saying mr o'donaghan put hat on with firm cock pulled on glove manoeuvred stick with flourishing bow took departure have hardly dismissed gentleman be laughing to myself at ridiculous occurrence when mr cophagus returned first putting cane up to nose with arch look then laying down on table rubbing hand good warm old lady dead cold left thousand only one legacy old tom cat physic to morrow soon die

various cabinet belonging to old lady be full of secret drawer that in one cabinet alone have found upwards of fifty pound in various gold coin that if not well examined must probably be sold with many article of consequence remaining in a only object in ireland be to find out sir henry de clare identify really why must not have said a must have proved nothing after willingly consented to devote day to assist mr cophagus in examination next morning after breakfast went together to house of old lady whose name have be maitland a mr cophagus informed furniture be of most ancient description in room in house there be ormolu japan cabinet of be very handsome decorated with pillar silver ornament can hardly recount variety of article in probability have be amassed during whole

great care be written at bottom of envelope be dear sir cried jumping up embracing mr cophagus be paper require may keep mad quite mad go to bedlam strait waistcoat head shaved so on chapter xliii be not content with minding own business must have hand in of others by mean put foot in then after own fashion told that a executor must retain paper pointed out to little probability there be of containing information relative to birth even allowing that person of name of de benyon did call at foundling to ask for be only supposition finally overthrew hope have be for so many day buoying up when have finished threw upon sofa in despair wished at moment have never be born still hope again rose uppermost must have given possessed to have be able to break open seal of packet have read content at one moment be so frantic that be debating whether must not take from mr cophagus by force run off with at last rose commenced reading letter have put aside there be nothing in trifling

rest of effect in charge of people who kept hotel set off in post chaise on expedition be soon clear of city on fine smooth road a threw back in corner of chaise must not help asking question what be purport of journey a reader will perceive be wholly governed by impulse never allowed reason common sense to stand in way of feeling what have to do replied to to find out if melchior sir henry de clare be not one same person what then what then why then may find out something relative to fleta parentage nay be likely if a suppose melchior be sir henry de clare if a suppose be who be now trying to find out carry off fleta be probable that will gain information from have idea that fleta be little girl said to have died who be child of elder brother why so what interest must melchior have in stealing own niece can not tell why did nattee give necklace can not tell must hardly betray husband at event there be mystery can only be unravelled by being pulled at may learn something by meeting melchior whereas will learn nothing by remaining quiet last idea satisfied for many hour remained in train of deep thought only checked by paying for horse at end of stage be now past twelve o'clock

fortunate that have met previous to introduction to father have so far to congratulate that family be undeniably good there being a know irish peerage in of however have chance a present earl have numerous offspring be also fortunate a far a money be concerned a have reason to believe that father be very rich man of course be only child must now prepare to meet with very different person than perhaps fond anticipation of youth may have led to expect father have paternal feeling can discover have wealth wish to leave have therefore sought out be despotic violent absurd least opposition to will make furious be sorry to add be afraid that be very mean suffered severely when young from poverty own father be almost a authoritative unforgiving a now will state how be that be left at asylum when infant grandfather have procured for father commission in army soon afterwards procured lieutenancy ordered to marry young lady of large fortune whom have never seen sent for for purpose understand that be very beautiful have father seen be probable must have made objection very foolishly sent peremptory refusal for be dismissed for ever in short time afterwards father fell in love with young lady of great personal attraction supposed to posse large fortune to deceive pretended to be heir to earldom after hasty courtship ran off be married when compared note soon did be discovered that on side have nothing pay of subaltern on hers that have not one shilling father stormed called wife impostor recriminated second morning after marriage be passed in tear on side oath curse revilings on lady however appeared more sensible party of two marriage be not known have run away on pretence to visit relative be actually supposed in county town where resided that such be case must quarrel in way ' observed 'you edmund wished to marry fortune not may plead guilty to same duplicity have made mistake be not too late be supposed that be on visit to that be on furlough for few day did confide secret to of brother officer 'not one ' muttered father then let part a if nothing have happened nobody will be wiser be equally interested in keeping secret be agreed ' father immediately consented accompanied mother to house at where be expected framed story for delay by having met very polite young man father returned to regiment thus did like two privateer who when meet engage a soon a find out mistake hoist colour sheer off by mutual consent ca say much for mother affection delicacy observed le say better japhet however be father story now to proceed appears that about two month afterwards father received letter from mother acquainting that short intercourse have be productive of certain result requesting that must take necessary step to provide for child avoid exposure that must be obliged to confess marriage by what mean contrived to avoid exposure until period of confinement know not father state that child be born in house in london by agreement be instantly put into hand that with consent of wife left at door of asylum with paper bank note from received name of newland at time have idea of reclaiming mother have for heartless a appears to have be yet mother must feel for child father regiment be then ordered out to east indie be rapidly promoted for gallantry good conduct during war in mysore territory once only have returned home on furlough then did make inquiry after not appears with view of finding out on own account from promise made mother mother what have met since yes mother went out to india on speculation passing off a single girl be very well married there be going to say however committed very splendid bigamy good heaven how totally destitute of principle father asserts that mother be freethinker japhet father have made one without religion woman have stay father be in up country during time that mother arrived be married to one of council of calcutta father say that met at ball at government house be still very handsome woman much admired when father recognised be told that be lately married to honourable mr be quite electrified must have quitted room have perceived walking up to with greatest coolness claimed a old acquaintance in england afterwards often met never adverted to what have passed between until time for departure to england on leave then sent for begged that must make enquiry after japhet did so know result on return to india found that mother have be carried off by prevailing pestilence at period father be not rich be then appointed to chief command in carnatic reaped golden harvest in return for success bravery appears a far a must obtain from that a long a mother be alive felt interest about death subsequent wealth poured upon have now induced to find out heir to whom may be bequeathed such japhet be outline of father history must point out that have feeling of affection for at present conduct of mother be ever before if be not that wish heir must almost say that feeling be of dislike may create interest in heart be true may be gratified by personal appearance will have very difficult task a will have to submit to caprice fancy be afraid that to high spirit like yours will be almost unbearable really sir begin to feel that fondest anticipation be seldom realised almost to wish have not be sought for by father be happy contented now see chance of having to congratulate on change on one two point also wish to question appears that have entered into sect denominated quaker tell candidly do subscribe heartily sincerely to doctrine be going to add be intention to remain with perceive much difficulty in tenet of sect certainly do believe to be more in accordance with christian religion than other have hesitation in asserting from knowledge of who belong to sect that generally speaking lead better life there be point connected with worship at first considered ridiculous feeling have however worn off a to quaint manner of speaking have be grossly exaggerated dress be part of religion why so japhet can reply to in word of susannah temple when made same interrogatory think peculiarity of dress be outward form be not required be put on to separate from others a proof that have discarded vanity be aware that be not proof of sincerity still discarding of dress be proof of insincerity consider to admire person be vain creed be humility be therefore outward visible sign that must act up to tenet profess be not who wear dress who be quaker in heart conduct know that when be put aside tenet of persuasion be at same time renounced therefore do consider essential mean to say that heart may be a pure faith continue a stedfast without such sign outwardly be part of creed must not choose reject none ' very well argued by little quakeress now japhet must like to put question to be very much attached to young puritan will not deny that be love sincerely doe love carry so far that must for sake continue quaker marry have asked that question at least hundred time during last twenty four hour can not decide if must dress a others do allow to do same must marry to morrow whether will ever make up mind to adhere to persuasion live die quaker for sake be quite matter be afraid not be too worldly minded fact be be in very awkward position with respect to have never acknowledged affection asked for return know love know that love like vain boy flatter leave to judge sir replied repeating to parting tete tete how have returned found in tear that certainly be very corroborative evidence tell japhet do think love well enough to abandon for sake ever will sir be too high principled too high minded might suffer greatly never must swerve from what thought be right must be fine character japhet will be in dilemma indeed appears to that trouble be now commencing instead of ending that must have be much happier where be than will be by being again brought out into world prospect be not over cheerful have awkward father to deal with will be under strong check have notion be afraid will find that notwithstanding will be once more received into society be vanity vexation of spirit be afraid be right sir replied at event will be something gained to be acknowledged to world by father of good family else may have to submit to have be sport of fortune life probably have not yet done playing with be late will now wish good night good night japhet if have intelligence will let know lady de clare address be park street will of course go there a soon a can will sir after have written letter to friend at reading chapter lxxii be little jealous like immortal williama bottom inclined to enact more part than one with big effort hankering after bigamy be mastered by mr masterton by own good sense footnote rather nick ed returned home to reflect upon what mr masterton have told must say be not very well pleased with various information account of mother although be more distressed from character gave of father felt convinced that happiness must not be at increased by having finally attained long desired object of wish strange to say have sooner discovered father wished that have never turned up when compared peaceful happy state of existence have lately enjoyed with prospect of what have in future to submit to bitterly repented that advertisement have be seen by timothy still on one point be peculiarly anxious without hardly daring to anatomise feeling be relative to cecilia de clare what mr masterton have mentioned in course of conversation next morning wrote to timothy to mr cophagus giving shortdetail of what have be informed by mr masterton expressing wish then really did feel that have never be summoned away from having finished letter set off to park street to call upon lady de clare cecilia be rather early footman who opened door recognised be admitted upon own responsibility be now more than eighteen month since have quitted house at richmond be very anxious to know what reception might have followed servant up stair when opened door walked in a name be announced lady de clare rose in haste so did cecilia so did third person whom have not expected to have met harcourt mr newland exclaimed lady de clare be indeed unexpected cecilia also came forward blushing to forehead harcourt held back a if waiting for advance to be made on side on whole never felt more awkwardly believe feeling be reciprocated by whole party be evidently de trop do know mr harcourt at last said lady de clare if be mr harcourt once knew replied certainly do believe be same newland said harcourt coming to offering hand took with pleasure be long while since met observed cecilia who felt necessary to say something at same time did not like to enter upon affair before harcourt be miss de clare replied for be not exactly pleased at reception have be fortunate since have pleasure of seeing last cecilia mother looked earnestly a much a to say in what did not like to ask question there be one present who be not well acquainted with history observed be until time left lady de clare have wish to create mystery have at last discovered father hope be to congratulate mr newland said lady de clare a far a respectability family be concerned certainly have reason to be ashamed replied be brother of earl general in army name will not mention until have seen be formally openly acknowledged have also advantage of being only son if be not disinherited heir to considerable property continued smiling sarcastically perhaps may now be better received than have be a japhet newland foundling lady de clare be afraid have intruded unseasonably will now take leave good morning without waiting for reply made hasty retreat gained door flushed with indignation have nearly gained bottom of stair when heard light footstep behind arm be caught by cecilia de clare turned round looked reproachfully in face a tear stood in eye what have done japhet that must treat in manner said with emotion miss de clare replied have reproach to make perceived that presence be not welcome must no further intrude be then so proud now that have found out that be well born japhet be much too proud to intrude where be not wished for miss de clare a japhet newland came here to see fleta of former day when assume real name will always be most happy of introduction to daughter of lady de clare oh how changed exclaimed fixing large blue eye upon prosperity change miss de clare wish very good morning turned away crossed hall to door a went out must not help looking back perceived that cecilia handkerchief be held to eye a slowly mounted stair walked home to piazza in very pleasant humour be angry disgusted at coolness of reception thought ill used treated with ingratitude so much for world said a sat down in apartment spun hat on table have be out two season be longer same person yet how lovely have grown why change why be harcourt there must have prejudiced against very possibly while idea be running in mind be making comparison between cecilia de clare susannah temple not much in favour of former looking forward prospectively to meeting with father doubt a to reception in society colouring everything with most sombre tint door opened in walked harcourt announced by waiter chair for mr harcourt said to waiter with formality newland said harcourt come for two reason in first place be commissioned by lady to assure beg pardon mr harcourt for interrupting require ambassador from lady in question may make confidant if please be not at inclined to do same explanation after what witnessed felt morning be quite unnecessary surrender claim upon lady de clare daughter if ever be so foolhardy a to imagine have first reason of visit be therefore useless to proceed with may ask other reason have procured honour hardly know mr newland replied harcourt colouring deeply whether after what have now said ought to proceed with second related to myself be attention mr harcourt replied bowing politely be to say mr newland must have taken earliest opportunity after recovery have not disappeared so strangely to have expressed sorrow for conduct towards to have acknowledged have be deservedly punished more perhaps by own feeling of remorse than by dangerous wound have received by hand take even opportunity although not apparently favourable one of expressing what consider duty a gentleman who have wronged to express certainly be going to add more there be so little chance of being well received that have better defer to future opportunity time may come certainly trust will come when may be allowed to prove to that be not deserving of coolness with be now received mr newland with wish for happiness will now take leave must say be with painful sentiment a feel that result of interview will be cause of great distress to who be bound to not only by gratitude sincere regard harcourt then bowed quitted room be very well muttered know world be not to be soothed down by few fine word trust that will be sorry for conduct see again inside door will not sat down trying to feel satisfied with be not felt that have acted harshly to say more ought to have listened to explanation sent by cecilia mother after coming down stair to expostulate be under great obligation to by quick resentment rendered obligation more onerous be unkind of wished that harcourt have not left room a for conduct tried to find fault with must not be gentlemanly feeling fact be be in very bad humour must not at time discover reason be more le than be more jealous of finding harcourt so intimate at lady de clare than be at unpalatable reception have met with waiter came in brought note from mr masterton have morning received summons from father who returned appears two day ago be now at adelphi hotel be sorry to say that stepping out of carriage when travelling missed footing have snapped tendon achilles be laid up on couch a may suppose amiability be not increased by accident pain attending a have requested to bring forward immediate evidence a to identity presence of mr cophagus be necessary propose that start for reading to morrow at nine o'clock have curiosity to go down there having leisure day two will be relaxation wish to see old acquaintance timothy shop answer by bearer j masterton wrote few line informing mr masterton must be with at appointed hour then sat down to solitary meal how different from when be last at hotel now knew nobody have to regain footing in society must only be accomplished by being acknowledged by father a soon a be done must call upon lord windermear who must quickly effect what desired next morning be ready at nine o'clock set off with post horse with mr masterton in own carriage told what have occurred day before how disgusted be at reception upon word japhet think be wrong replied old gentleman if have not told of affection for miss temple to see whom by bye confess to be one of chief motif of going down with must almost suppose that be blinded by jealousy doe not occur to that if mr harcourt be admitted to lady at early hour there be preference shown in quarter now recollect heard something about be elder brother died be come into property heard somebody say that must in probability succeed in gaining handsomest girl in london with large fortune that be said to be match now if such be case broke in upon quiet reunion between two young people about to be united almost without announcement so unexpectedly after lapse of so long time surely can not be surprised at there being degree of confusion restraint more especially after what have passed between harcourt depend upon be cause of have lady de clare daughter be alone reception must have be very different indeed cecilia following down stair prof that be not from coolness towards harcourt calling upon conversation took place be proof that have be mistaken never viewed in light certainly sir observed merely perceived be considered intrusive finding in company one who have treated ill have be antagonist in field naturally supposed that have prejudiced against hope may be wrong have seen so much of world young a be have become very suspicious then discard suspicion a fast a can will only make unhappy not prevent being deceived if be suspicious will have constant fear of deception hanging over poison existence after remark remained silent for time be analysing own feeling felt that have acted in very absurd manner fact be that one of castle building have be be to marry fleta a soon a have found own father be have actuated almost without knowing felt jealous of harcourt that without being in love with miss de clare actually passionately fond of person felt a if must have married without loving must give up susannah temple whom did love rather than that being whom considered a almost of own creation must herself presume to fall in love that must dare to love until have made up mind whether must take after so long absence having given up hope of ever seeing again reader may smile at absurdity still more at selfishness of feeling so did when have reflected upon despised for vanity folly what be thinking of japhet observed mr masterton tired with long abstraction have be making most egregious fool of sir replied with respect to de clares did not say so japhet to tell truth thought something very like now tell be not jealous at finding in company with harcourt exactly so sir will tell susannah temple when see that may form idea of constancy replied mr masterton smiling why what dog in manger must be ca marry still under circumstance can analyse feeling be natural be natural be not always creditable to human nature let talk little about susannah then vagary will be dispersed how old be mr masterton plied with so many question relative to susannah that image alone soon filled mind recovered spirit know what will say at being in dress sir observed have not better change on arrival by mean will fight battle know character pretty well thanks to raving about chapter lxxiii contains much learned argument upon broad brim garment of grey get best of one great wish of life be granted meet father cold reception very indicative of much after heat arrived in good time at reading a soon a alighted at inn ordered dinner then walked down to shop where found timothy very busy tying down labelling be delighted to see mr masterton perceiving have laid aside quaker dress made scruple of indulging in humour making long face thee ing thou ing mr masterton in very absurd manner desired to go to mr cophagus beg that must allow to bring mr masterton to drink tea afterwards to call at inn give answer then returned to dinner whether will ever make quaker of japhet be very doubtful observed mr masterton a walked back a for making one of fellow timothy will defy laugh at everything replied view everything in ridiculous light at event never will make serious in evening adjourned to house of mr cophagus having received message of welcome entered room first susannah came forward to welcome then drew back when perceived alteration in apparel colouring deeply passed took hand of mr cophagus husband then introduced mr masterton hardly knew thee japhet mildly observed mr cophagus did not think that outward garment must disguise from friend replied so appeareth for sister hath not even greeted in welcome greet thee in kindness sincerity japhet newland replied susannah holding out hand yet did not imagine that in so short time thou wouldst have dismissed apparel of persuasion do find seemly miss temple interposed mr masterton be to oblige who be sincere friend that mr newland have laid aside dress quarrel with creed one have right to choose for mr newland have perhaps not chosen badly in embracing tenet let continue steadfast in fair young lady there be creed be perfect even in yours find imperfection religion preaches humility therefore do object to wearing garb of pride of pride sayest thou hath not rather put off garb of humility now appeareth in garb of pride not so young madam when dress a world dress wear not garb of pride when put on dress different from others distinguishes from others then show pride worst of pride for be hypocritical pride ape humility be pharisee of scripture who preaches in high place sound forth charity to poor not humility of publican who say 'lord be merciful to sinner apparel of pretended humility be garb of pride for reason have insisted that discard when with tenet interfere not with there can be religion in dress must indeed be weak in requires dress for support susannah be astonished at new feature of case so aptly put by old lawyer mr cophagus looked at husband cophagus pinched arm evidently agreeing with when mr masterton have finished speaking susannah waited few second then replied becomes not one so young weak a be to argue with thee who art so much senior can not cavil at opinion if not correct at least be founded on holy writing have be otherwise instructed then let drop argument miss susannah let tell that japhet wished to resume quaker dress must not permit if there be blame be to be laid to be use being angry with old man like have right to be angry with anyone replied susannah be angry with susannah interrupted can not say that be anger japhet newland hardly know what feeling might have be be wrong must request thy forgiveness susannah held out hand now must forgive too miss temple said old masterton susannah laughed against wish conversation then became general mr masterton explained to mr cophagus what required of mr cophagus immediately acceded be arranged that must go to town by mail next day mr masterton talked great deal about father gave character in true light a considered

desired to quit presence for ever attempted force resisted that because must not allow to have painful remembrance that have injured one who have strong claim upon have never injured resented also because wished to prove to be de benyon have spirit to resist insult general if imagine have come here with determination of forcing upon be much mistaken be too proud happily be independent by own exertion so a not to require assistance have received kindly believe must have found grateful affectionate heart to have met that kindness must have found son whose sole object through life have be to discover father after whom have yearned who must have be delighted to have administered to want to have yielded to wish to have soothed in pain to have watched in sickness deserted a have be for so many year trust have not disgraced general de benyon if ever have done wrong have be from wish to discover can appeal to lord windermear for truth of assertion allow to say that be very severe trial ordeal few pas through with safety to be thrown a have be upon world with friend parent to assist to advise to have to bear up against contingency of being of unacknowledged perhaps disgraceful birth be harder still when expected to find dearest wish realised that without other cause than of feature resembling of mother be to be again cast away one thing general de benyon request trust will not be denied be that may assume name be entitled to pledge that never will disgrace now sir asking expecting more take leave may be assured that poverty privation affliction of kind will ever induce to again intrude into presence general de benyon farewell for ever made father profound bow be quitting room stop sir said general stop one moment if please obeyed why did put out of temper answer that allow to observe sir did not put out of temper what be more that never lost own temper during insult injury so undeservedly unexpectedly have received very keeping temper made more angry sir be very possible surely be not to blame greatest proof of perfect gentleman be that be able to command temper wished to acknowledge be not without such pretension be a much a to say that father be gentleman presume be specimen of filial duty replied general warmly far from sir there be many gentleman who unfortunately can not command temper be more to be pitied than blamed for sir when such happens to be case invariably redeem error amply so by expressing sorrow offering apology be a much a to say that expect to apologise to allow sir to ask did ever know de benyon submit to insult sir trust not then sir whose feeling of pride will not allow to submit to insult ought never to insult others if in warmth of moment have done so that pride must immediately induce to offer apology not only due to party to own character there be disgrace in making apology when be in error there be great disgrace in withholding act of common justice reparation presume be to infer from that expect apology from general de benyon a far a be concerned that be now of little importance part will probably never meet again if think that must make feel more comfortable be willing to receive must suppose by observation that fully expect otherwise will not stay never have thought of staying general have told that have disinherited discarded for ever one with feeling of man must ever think of remaining after declaration upon what term then sir be to understand that will consent to remain with forget have passed term be simple general must say that retract what have said be very sorry for having insulted without do

have a parent upon son in most case be indebted to parent for care attention in infancy education religious instruction choice of profession advancement in life by exertion interest when be called away have reasonable expectation of leaving portion of substance have heavy debt of gratitude to pay for what have received be further checked by hope of what may hereafter receive up to time sir have not received first day be told that need not expect last allow to ask general de benyon upon what ground claim from filial duty certainly not for benefit received for benefit in expectation feel that be intruding therefore sir once more with wish for happiness take leave went out have half closed door after when general cried out stop go japhet son be in passion beg pardon mind what said be
