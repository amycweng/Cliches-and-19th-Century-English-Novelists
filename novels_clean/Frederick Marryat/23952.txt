leave madame bathurst be certain must look out for other situation took for granted that madame bathurst must not permit to leave immediately allow short time to look out for suitable situation

hollow self be idol of mankind worshipped at altar after time became more composed thought of little madame gironac recollection of disinterested kindness put in better frame of mind mortified a be must not help feeling that be only vanity of lady r desire to shine to have be made sacrifice that have intention of wounding feeling still to remain with after what have be told to by lady m be impossible then reflected upon what step must take did not like to tell lady r real ground of leaving thought must be prudent to make excuse part good friend at last occurred to that intention of

dread to avail of therefore come to who be so prudent so sage to request after have heard have to impart will give real opinion a to what ought to do recollect told gentleman have followed at brighton how for mere frolic have led to suppose be caroline stanhope certainly did not expect to see again did three day after came up from brighton girl have evidently copied address on trunk for followed up accosted a be walking home told that have never slept since have first seen that be honourably in love with replied that be mistaken in supposing be caroline stanhope that name be adele chabot now

bathurst have told that be officer in army did not mention name recollect what madame bathurst said about who be since have be at richmond have contrived to see day will confess that latterly have not be unwilling to meet for day have be more pleased with on first meeting after fete told that still supposed to be caroline stanhope that seeing walking with caroline aunt have confirmed in idea assured be adele chabot girl without fortune not a supposed great heiress answer be that acquaintance of madame bathurst must be lady that have never inquired thought about fortune that having none must prove disinterestedness of affection for that required nothing more have seen day almost since then have given name made proposal to notwithstanding reiterated assertion be adele chabot not caroline stanhope one thing be certain that be very much attached to if marry will be very miserable for long time here adele burst into tear why do grieve adele said like offer to marry advice be very simple marry yes replied adele if be a seems agree with that course be clear notwithstanding repeated assertion that love a adele chabot be convinced in own mind that still belief to be caroline

without shilling now valerie here be difficulty if be to marry a proposes when come to find out that have be deceiving be not heiress will not be angry perhaps disgusted with will not blame instead of a people always do will not ill treat if did must break heart for love love dearly then on other hand may be wrong may be a say in love with adele chabot so that will have thrown away chance of happiness from erroneous idea what will do valerie do advise much will depend on character of man adele have insight into people character what idea have formed of hardly can say for when men profess to be in love be such deceiver fault be concealed assume virtue posse on first meeting with thought that be proud man perhaps might say vain man since have seen more of think be wrong adele depend

probably succeed indeed unless man be bad hearted man must eventually succeed best know own power must decide for be that feeling almost certain feeling that will be able to console for disappointment that impels on valerie will make love be determined when woman be determined on point invariably succeeds in end adele be supposing that be deceiving may not be case adele for do think have sufficient attraction to make man love for alone recollect such may be case in present instance may be at first followed a heiress have since found out if not heiress be very charming woman have in consequence be unable to resist influence however there be only one to whom secret of heart be known consider that have acted honourably if choose to risk hazard of die one can attach blame to thank valerie have

positively declare have be aware of insufferable vulgarity of parent nothing must have induced to marry daughter tell because care nothing for be on stilt at present will soon bring to sens for know sir madam although did elope with married daughter marriage be not legal a be married under false name be own act not mine may therefore prepare to receive daughter back when think fit to send disgraced dishonoured then try if can match with duke leave to digest piece of information now wish good morning have address when feel inclined to apologise do justice will expect before legal marriage take place so saying colonel left house must be difficult to say of three party be in greatest rage colonel who have become sincerely attached to adele who have well profited by time have gained returned home in very pleasant humour throwing down on sofa said to in moody way will be candid with dear if have seen father mother before married nothing must have persuaded to have made wife when man marries consider connexion fortune to be two greatest point to be obtained such animal a father mother never beheld good heaven must be allied to such people may ask dearest to whom refer

always told that be adele chabot other person must admit that father mother be vulgar people dearest husband family be a good a most in france come over with to paris will then see who relative connexion be be poor grant recollect that revolution exiled many wealthy family mine among rest although be permitted eventually to return to france what can have induced to fall into error still persist notwithstanding assertion to contrary be daughter of vulgar upstart who be proverbial for want of manner who be not admitted into hardly society rich a be supposed to be colonel looked amazement be sorry be disappointed dearest continued adele if be so be sorry that be not caroline stanhope with large fortune if bring fortune by economy will save one let only see that be not deprived of usual pleasure luxury care not what do how live will find exacting wife in dearest troubling for expense can not afford will live to please if succeed will die if wish to be rid of adele resumed caress with tear running down cheek for loved husband dearly felt what said colonel must not resist put arm round said cry adele believe moreover feel that love be thankful have not married caroline stanhope for presume can not be very different from parent admit have be deceiving have deceived into better little wife than deserve perhaps really be glad of escape must not have be

laughed at that best must be done be to go to paris announce from thence marriage in paper have sufficiency to live upon to command luxury a well a comfort on whole be now satisfied that handsome strongly attached wife who brought fortune be preferable to marriage of mere interest may a well here observe that adele played card so well that colonel be happy contented man kept promise found with management that have more money than married man required blessed day in have married by mistake now to return to stanhope although be too angry at time to pay much heed to colonel parting threat yet when have cooled have time for reflection mr mr stanhope be much distressed at intelligence that daughter be not legally married for day remained quiet at last thought advisable to come to term to save daughter honour during delay on part adele have called upon introduced husband made acquainted with have passed stated intention of proceeding to paris immediately although knew that adele relation be of good family yet thought introduction to madame d'albret must be of service to therefore gave one proved most serviceable for colonel found in first society in paris wife be well received much admired when therefore mr stanhope made up mind to call upon colonel at address of hotel where have put up found have left nobody knew where have gone be severe blow mr mr stanhope be in state of utmost uncertainty suspense now be time for mr selwyn to come forward despatched note to requesting to come to town put in possession of adele history marriage with colonel particular with reader be acquainted pointed out to how must act when called upon mr stanhope advised to do immediately followed advice thus described what passed on return sent up card to mr mr stanhope be received

intention to make known to that such be case presuming that must not refuse to sanction marriage when elopement took place be even reported that have run away position became very awkward more so a people declared a colonel asserted that be not legally married on consulting with gentleman of choice be argued thus if miss stanhope go back to father house after report that be not legally married will be supposed that colonel finding that be disappointed in view have returned dishonoured upon parent hand subsequent marriage must remove impression be therefore considered advisable on parent account on own that also must elope then must be easily explained that be somebody else who have eloped with colonel that miss stanhope have married in secret way miss stanhope therefore be properly married in church before respectable witness conducted immediately afterwards by husband to father house who approved of what be done a now reflection can be made upon miss stanhope respectable parent

while be alone chapter twelve in few minute after lionel return have considerably postponed until monsieur gironac dinner hour have arrived good host first then kind merry little madame made appearance little while be consumed in introduction exclamation admiration congratulation tinctured not little by national vivacity other folk be in habit of calling extravagance a reader well know already good gironacs have by mean got rid of even in course of long sejour in matter of fact metropolis of england fortunately friend be for most part au fait to leading circumstance of life so little explanation be needed more fortunately yet like tide time dinner wait for man have ever observed in adventurous life that sympathy of most sentimental grief of most woe begone joy of happiest ever induces to neglect summons of dinner bell call of responsive appetite in midst of delight of madame at having at last to receive brother of cette chere valerie that brother too si bel homme et brave officier et d'une ressemblance si parfaite la charmante soeur dinner be luckily announced torrent tide of madame hospitality be cut short by husband declaration that be like dying of hunger that not word more must be spoken touching sympathy sentiment until have partaken of something nutritious de quoi soutenir l'epuisement de emotion si dechirantes madame laughed declared that be un barbare un malheureux sans grandeur de l'ame taking possession of auguste led away into dining room where though told afterwards be au comble de desespoir at having to sit down to so everyday meal found excellent dinner spent very pleasant hour until coffee be served when with not little to surprise very much to delight monsieur de chavannes made appearance there be quizzical look on monsieur gironac face roguish twinkle in eye led to believe that what be really matter of surprise to be none to worthy host for count de chavannes have never visited house before in evening from what have understood be on term of particular intimacy with gironacs be foolish enough to be at first little put out at having manifested slight embarrassment on first entrance learned afterwards did not escape eye though be far too well bred to show made matter worse by calling pride to aid incited thereto by madame gironac glance smile at blushing confusion certainly in respect contributed to gaiety of evening nothing however must admit must have be more gentlemanly in better taste than whole demeanour of monsieur de chavannes must not help feeling comparing mentally with inferior bearing of others have seen even in midst of fit of hauteur frigidity immediately withdrew on learning that brother whom have not seen for many year have just arrived a half bred person must have done under like circumstance with awkward apology for presence tending only to make one else more awkward yet made set speech foolish compliment on subject too important for such trifling did not trouble with attention perceived must be at moment distasteful exhibited most marked desire to cultivate acquaintance of auguste to whom showed degree of deference though somewhat senior a to military man flattered esprit de corp mingled with sort of frank cordiality except from countryman to countryman in foreign land must perhaps have be little overdone under actual circumstance must not have be improved for short time remained conversed well wittily yet with strain of fancy feeling blended with wit rendered singularly original attractive perfectly succeeded though know not whether intended not in directing attention of company from altered somewhat unamiable mood among other thing remember that in course of conversation while tendering civility to auguste use of riding horse cabriolet service in showing of lion of london observed that monsieur de chatenoeuf must not consider such offer impertinent on part since believed if genealogy be properly traced sort of cousinship must be established a more than one of de chavannes have intermarried in old time with chatenoeufs of gascony when family like native province have be acting in alliance with english plantagenet against french king of house of valois few word be said in connexion with touching singularity of fact that must seem a if england have something to do with association of two family think remark be made by de chavannes whatever be be not sufficiently pointed to be in way offensive annoying on whole hurt a be in sort by idea have taken hold of that gironacs through false indelicate idea of advancing welfare be endeavouring to promote liking between count can not deny that evening on whole be pleasant one that if at first have be impression that de chavannes be agreeable entertaining well bred be now prepared to admit have excellent taste delicate feeling into bargain still felt that did not like perhaps must rather say attention though in fact have paid none be rather relieved when made bow retired shortly afterwards auguste observed that seemed dull tired madame gironac followed suit by saying that be wonder if excitement interest created by unexpected arrival of so dear brother have proved too much for nerve thereupon after promising to return early in morning so that might have long talk about past long consultation about future lionel auguste bade good night also not before lionel have said to a be taking leave think mademoiselle that will be no more than proper must drive down to kew to morrow morning wait upon judge selwyn who have always be so kind to have message for oh yes beg will tell auguste have come that request will let know when may wait on answer will be mademoiselle waiting upon be that what desire only desire what state to know when how may see for know very little of auguste heart if doe not wish to return thanks to one who except dear friend here have be poor valerie surest confidant protector will find judge family increased since saw son have persuaded pretty little friend caroline stanhope to become wife be living with judge family at present lionel expressed surprise pleasure at news thought at moment that pleasure be not real though have since have reason to believe that gravity came over face a spoke be gravity of thought rather than a fancied at time of disappointment nothing more passed worthy of record after shaking hand with lionel kissing long lost brother be left alone with gironacs half expectant of playful scolding well mademoiselle valerie de chatenoeuf began a soon a gentleman have left be because have found out that have got handsome brother that be determined to drive other handsome young men au desespoir be that wish to break heart especially of pauvre monsieur de chavannes that have treated with air si hautaine si hautaine that if have be queen of france must not have be colder told once before monsieur gironac replied that count de chavannes doe not care straw how treat with what air if did be simply civil agreeable gentleman who look upon a must upon other young lady whom be glad to talk to when be in humour to talk whom when be not leaf to herself a well bred men do repeat care enough about to think for one moment whether be hautaine not feel just same about be certain what brings here then eh where never came before to night not for beau yeux of madame believe with quizzical bow to wife for grand esprit of have eye tell a well a other people can see one petit peu have doubt can monsieur answered rather pettishly for suppose asked if did so on account must beg will omit that proof of kindness in future for wish to see oh monsieur gironac for shame have made very angry with ridiculous badinage have made angry really wonder who ever heard of teasing young lady about gentleman have never seen only three time who have never declared preference madame replied husband in great wrath real simulated vous etes une ingrate une une word fail to express what think of enormous unkind ingratitude be homme incompris mademoiselle here mademoiselle be une enfant doe not know own mind will give comte chavannes conge will not will not for if be une enfant be fit friend look after if doe not know own mind be good have one who do voila tout here be why will not go congedier monsieur le comte why rather will request to dine with to morrow next day day after if swear by honour foi de gironac will dine at home again never more must not help laughing at tirade of kind hearted little man on strength of patted on head said be bonne enfant if be not si diablement entetee bade go to bed sleep into better humour piece of advice appeared to so judicious that proceeded at once to obey bidding kind good night betook to own room to ponder rather than to sleep in truth felt that have need of reflection for with return of auguste tide of feeling have long lain dormant rather than dead within have almost overwhelmed hardness have origin in bitterness of conscious dependence have gained strength from pride of self acquired independence began to thaw in heart to give way to milder gentler feeling thought of home desire for country love for father who though weak almost imbecile have ever be kind to in person craving affection for brother sister nay something approaching to pity regret for mother who have proved step mother towards revived in increased re invigorated force by bye too began to feel must be very wretched after parting with beloved brother at end of so brief renewal of love intimacy to be aware of what have scarcely felt before in self confidence of position have won that be sad lonely thing to be sojourner in foreign land with natural friend kind kindred on whom to rely in case of sickness misfortune to consider how dark grave thing must be solitary old age perhaps solitary death bed far from home of one youth friend of one childhood then there arose thought connected with preceding by extraordinary inexplicable chain seems to run through whole mind of man linking together thing apparently a far asunder a pole have however in reality kindred origin thought be wherefore must life be solitary why must stand apart alone from race relying on only depriving for sake of perhaps imaginary independence of endearment of social life sweet tie of family perhaps very presence of brother have opened eye to truth that there be such thing in world a real independence to realise possession most coveted most unattainable one must be robinson crusoe alone on desert island sort of independence one must think must practically desire to enjoy before sleep came believe that began to muse about monsieur de chavannes be only to think did not care in least about about so far a be concerned have seen no cause to change decided resolution must never marry be perhaps in reality best of proof did already care something about be very likely before long to care something more for one have said by way ordinary judge of human nature that if desired to win woman fancy affection first step must be to make think about even if be to hate anything before absence of thought blank void of real absolute indifference indeed believe be nearly true that woman rarely begin to think often of man even if be a fancy in dislike when however may deceive be on verge of loving be such case with at least if be so be then so far from knowing did not even ask question remember that when fell asleep dreamed that be standing at altar with count de chavannes when band of who have ever wronged mother madame d'albret madame bathurst stanhope lady m rushed between tore forcibly asunder wept so loud that sorrow awoke be time before be sure be dream early next morning auguste came again to see a monsieur gironac be abroad giving lesson on flute guitar while madame be pretended to be excessively busy with wax flower have whole day to ourselves until luncheon time profited by so well that before be interrupted have little to learn on side concerning passage of life adventure family have gone through if have be little inclined to be proud of before to give full value to energy decision of character certainly now stood in small danger of being spoiled by auguste praise for now half cry at trial trouble now laughing at lady r absurdity now bursting into vehement invective against enemy insisted be perfect heroine

cold hearted be dearest valerie very cold hearted believe brother at least certainly have affaire de coeur to relate can not pretend to say whether be fault that of other people certainly one ever fell in love with if be not that odious monsieur g most certainly have never fallen in love with one at auguste gazed earnestly in face for moment a if must have read heart met eye with mine quite steadily calmly till at length burst into merry laugh must not restrain quite true little sister said at last after manner have in sort convinced quite true auguste upon honour replied well valerie suppose must believe that earnest face that honest little laugh of yours may just a well do so indeed replied for one be ever in love with assure think added with touch of old pride that de chatenoeuf be likely to give away heart be not desired be very strange added monsieur lionel dempster be little older than poor pierre whom used to pinch when wanted to get out of mother reach regard very much a must much elder sister almost indeed a mother mother indeed valerie once told something of kind be very fine young man certainly full of talent spirit will make very good agreeable friend be husband

unaffected manner in world assuredly there be nothing either in word in manner in be uttered must have thrown into confusion of blush rendered for moment almost incapable of answering must be remembered however have be rallied very much concerning of late by monsieur gironac must scarcely avoid perceiving that exceeding assiduity in doing honour to auguste must not be attributed to more potent cause than mere civility to fellow countryman confusion produced for second two slight similar embarrassment in count blood mounted highly to forehead eye met too at same instant though encounter be momentary from time sort of secret consciousness be established between scene passed in le time than take to describe becoming aware that one eye be upon rallied instinctively replied by few civil word of thanks took place at table have be left vacant for between brother lionel dempster little interruption at end conversation returned to course have taken before came in there be good deal of very agreeable talk a be sure to be case whenever four five pleasant clever people be thrown together under circumstance create sudden unexpected familiarity person desirous of amusing

opportunity in france so much so have rarely seen young man of age at comparable to count be likewise person of superior ability breeding with touch of english seriousness soundness engrafted on stock of french vivacity brother auguste be young ardent full of gay youth high hope brilliant aspiration kindled up by excitement of thus visiting foreign country finding in company of long lost much

delightful than week passed there from judge have concealment regarding almost in light of second father while auguste be prepared to love for love to have many long conversation consultation concerning affair propriety of disclosing existence to father be resolved upon judge auguste approving be decided that must be done only question then remained to be disposed of be how far disclosure must be carried whether must be practicable if practicable safe must return to france at present indeed at while in present condition auguste gave opinion a have done repeatedly that mother never have laid aside never must lay aside rancour towards that must grasp at first opportunity of taking vengeance upon presence must afford did not believe said that father must be able long to preserve from secret of being alive of having raised to condition of comparative affluence did feel by mean assured that while labouring under revulsion of feeling happy tidings must work upon mind mother must not recover ascendancy over beyond must say nothing for a young frenchman more especially young french soldier knew even le about law of france right of parent over child than did judge selwyn only like judge be inclined to opinion have better not trust within limit of jurisdiction might be called upon to hand over to parental authority until such time a must be completely own mistress a regarded probably must only be effected by ceasing to be own mistress a regarded one else for be assured valerie added that possession of person for purpose of annoying avenging on for suffering have undergone

of good advice to therefore be to remain altogether passive to pursue career have chosen without taking step to disclose present situation to authorise brother fully to reveal to father so much of a will appear necessary desirable to when on spot must not recommend that place of residence exact circumstance must be communicated even to at least for present must desire to write to letter must pas

more quickly that have easily recognised in new arrival person of count de chavannes have entered perhaps more fully into detail of sentiment at period of life for two reason one because of eventful

told presumed be settled thing colonel be mistaken there be nothing settled unsettled do really not like really do like adele a very pleasant companion for hour two a very perfect gentleman yes told if like so well why not like better why not love will be plain true with adele choose to consider at whether must must not love have never asked have never spoken of love to putting out of question that be unmaidenly to love unasked be sure be unwise understand understand will ask be certain when doe ask what will say will be time enough to consider when time will come way of saying will say yes come valerie must promise that if need assistance will call upon for know that anything can do for will be done without thought how best may serve jervis will do likewise since a do considers under heaven owe happiness to promise enough will ask more now come up to room will give madame d'albret letter pretty present have sent do know valerie nothing must exceed kindness to believe repents

must be written full of thanks for favour have shown in introducing friend to of hope that must one day meet again when past must be forgotten must resume own place station in society of own land begged acceptance of pretty dress sent said have selected not for value because be pretty in postscript added what of course outweighed rest of letter in interest importance that have recently be informed through strange channel a be by accident that mother health be failing seriously that although not attacked by regular disorder in immediate danger be not thought probable that must live much longer in case valerie continued for although one must be so unnatural a to wish for mother death how cruel unmotherly might be soever can not be expected that must regard decease with more than decent observation proper seriousness will look to see dwelling again among spending little fortune understand have so bravely earned in midst of friend in own country that will never do said speaking aloud though in answer partly to letter partly to own word that will never do visit france may once again in england will dwell france banished repudiated like step mother england received kinder than own like mother in england will dwell wait till see lord of destiny learn where will dwell will have to say like rest of country will be country god god ' observed adele interrupting musing first perhaps last never never catholic be born catholic will die say will never marry catholic do say will never marry one who will approve adoring own god according to own conscience be count de chavannes catholic indeed know not be breton breton be loyal race to king god now turned to finish reading have be for moment interrupted indeed dear valerie concluded letter have long felt that although be certainly justified by circumstance of situation in taking step did at time have be hardly pardonable in persisting so long in maintenance of falsehood have certainly be cause of great pain suffering to parent innocent le than guilty know that mother can never forgive for aiding in escape from authority for part be willing to bear enmity rather than persist in further concealment so that need not in degree consider in step may think wise right to take towards revelation reconciliation indeed think valerie that if can be done with due regard to own safety happiness ought to discover to parent if possible even to visit most unhappy because guiltier of two before dissolution really believe to be now very near at hand everyone know so well what have undergone that blame will attach to in least degree allow to add must return to france a hope will do will never forgive if make house home postscript a will readily be believed gave more cause for thought than letter beside rendered exceedingly uneasy if have felt ill satisfied before with condition concealment much more be now discontented with unhappy be almost resolved to return at hazard with auguste indeed when consulted with adele leaned very much towards same opinion must not however do anything rashly determined to consult not only with brother with judge in whose wisdom have le confidence than have in friendship integrity thing however be destined to occur in degree altered hastened proceeding for very evening when gironacs have retired on beginning to consult auguste listen to moment before tell about letter from france anything about returning entreat answer truly let false modesty little missish delicacy prevent doing so many life have be rendered miserable by such foolishness have heard say being a be almost alone in world a if only brother with only sister to whom if not to one must speak freely need not have made so long preamble dear auguste replied with smile of course will answer when say that of course will answer truly well then valerie do like count de chavannes be odd question yes do like do love valerie oh auguste be not fair besides have never spoken to of love have never know whether love have reason to believe that doe reason exclaimed half surprised half indignant reason must think never mind answer if did love do love like enough to take for husband have spoken to auguste have spoken to exclaimed blushing very deeply unable to conceal gratification be answered valerie by sparkle of bright eye yes have spoken to dearest sister asked influence with permission to address replied replied that permission be matter of consequence for be entirely own mistress that influence must be exerted only to induce to follow own judgment inclination to consult for own happiness answered like good wise brother then asked whether must form opinion of state of feeling to replied must only say that have reason to suppose that hand heart be of engaged that field be open to if chose to make trial have opportunity of judging how felt toward also said that thought knew very little of other that attachment must have grown up too rapidly to have taken very strong root there found be mistaken for assured that be from esteem of character admiration of energy courage constancy under adversity not from mere prettiness of face niceness of manner that first began to love since ascertained that there be scarce incident of life with have not made acquainted that in most delicate guarded manner confess valerie that have raised greatly in estimation to find that look upon marriage a thing so serious solemn doe not rush into from mere fancy for pretty face lady like accomplishment think so too auguste replied wish knew little more about character principle mean auguste looked at for moment in great surprise what exceedingly matter of fact girl be valerie never knew one in least like do know be afraid be little paused moment a if hardly knew how to proceed little hard cold be not dear auguste said throwing arm about indeed be not have be cast so long on own sole resource obliged to rely only on own energy clear sightedness always try to look at side of question not to let feeling overpower until have proved that be good wise to do so consider too auguste that on step depends whole happiness misery of girl existence be right valerie be wrong tell do love do auguste like better than man have ever seen be only man of whom must think a husband have for time past be fearful of liking loving too much not knowing though did believe hope that reciprocated feeling now if knew little more of principle character must not hesitate then need not hesitate dearest valerie for a if to obviate objection showed in most delicate manner private letter from oldest most intimate friend especially from mr most respectable clergyman who life at hendon by whom be educated with whom have maintained constant intercourse correspondence ever since alone speaks very highly in favour term in writes to pupil be such a prove to be men of highest character for worth integrity virtue have proposed moreover must ride down with to morrow to hendon to visit mr to hear from own lip yet more of character conduct be to say if can give hope of ultimate success well auguste replied think with that speaks very highly in favour of friend think that best thing can do be to take ride proposes see tutor in meantime will drive down to kew speak with good friend judge selwyn on subject to morrow evening will see count hear whatever desire to say to be very matter of fact way of dealing with affair certainly what auguste have said be in sort true be in truth rather matter of fact girl never found that suffered by in least for certainly be not either worldly selfish feeling do a certainly require to be guided controlled by sober reason after coming to conclusion showed madame d'albret letter to auguste came to decision also under circumstance auguste must immediately on return communicate fact of being alive in good circumstance to father leaving at discretion to inform mother of fact not a might judge expedient at very early hour next
