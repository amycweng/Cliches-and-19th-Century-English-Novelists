cabin followed by snarleyyow a soon a master be way up ladder snarleyyow turned back leaped on chair from chair to table then finished whole of breakfast appropriated for smallbones having effected dog followed master chapter three retrospect short description of new character must leave poor smallbones to lament hard fate in fore peak of vessel mr vanslyperken dog to walk quarter deck while make reader little better acquainted with time in scene passed be now describing a well a with history of mr vanslyperken date in first chapter of year will if refer back to history show that william of nassau have be few year on english throne that peace have just be concluded between england with ally france king occasionally passed time in holland among dutch countryman english dutch fleet few year before be engaging with obstinacy of courage have lately sailed together turned gun against french william like continental prince who have be called to english throne showed much favour to own countryman england be overrun with dutch favourite dutch courtier peer of dutch extraction must not even part with dutch guard be at issue with common of england on very account war be now over most of english dutch navy lay dismantled in port few small vessel only being in commission to intercept smuggling from france be carrying on much to detriment of english manufacture of certain article then denominated alamodes lutestrings cutter have described be on service be named yungfrau although built in england forming part of english naval force may really be supposed that dutch interest during period be in ascendant such be case dutch officer seaman who must not be employed in own marine be appointed in english vessel to prejudice of own countryman mr vanslyperken be of dutch extraction born in england long before prince of orange have ever dreamt of being called to english throne be near relation of king william own nurse even in day must cause powerful interest previous to revolution have be laid on shelf for cowardice in one of engagement between dutch english being then lieutenant on board of two decked ship of long standing in service before have be appointed to vessel have served invariably in small craft want of necessary qualification have never be discovered interest used for on accession of dutch king be sufficient for again obtaining command of small vessel in day service be very different from what be now commander of vessel be also purser must save great deal of money by defrauding crew further discipline of service be such a must astonish modern philanthropist there be appeal for subordinate tyranny oppression even amounting to destruction of life be practised with impunity smollett have given reader idea of state of service few year after time of be now writing when be infinitely worse for system of dutch notorious for cruelty have be grafted upon of english consequence be combination of be revolting to humanity be practised without notice being taken of by superior power provided that commander of vessel did duty when called upon showed necessary talent courage lieutenant vanslyperken character may be summed up in three vice of avarice cowardice cruelty miser in extreme have saved up much money by having have command of vessel for so many year during have defrauded pilfered from men government friend connection have none on side of water when on shore have lived in state of abject misery although have mean of comfortable support be now fifty five year of age since have be appointed to yungfrau have be employed in carrying despatch to state general from king william have during repeated visit to hague made acquaintance with widow vandersloosh who kept lust haus pleasure house place of resort for sailor where drank danced discovering that comfortably fat lady be also very comfortably rich mr vanslyperken have made advance with hope of obtaining hand handling money widow have however idea of accepting offer be too wise to give decided refusal a knew must be attended with preventing crew of cutter from frequenting house thereby losing much custom thus did at return receive kindly give hope nothing more since peace a before observed cutter have be ordered for prevention of smuggling when how mr vanslyperken have picked up favourite snarleyyow can not be discovered must remain secret men said that dog have appeared on deck of cutter in supernatural way most of looked upon with a much awe a ill will be certain that cutter have be little while before in state of mutiny forcible entry attempted at night into lieutenant cabin be therefore not unreasonable to suppose that vanslyperken felt that good watch dog might be very useful appendage to establishment have procured one accordingly affection ever showed to anything living be certainly concentrated on one animal next to money snarleyyow have possession of master heart poor smallbones cast on world without father mother have become starved before be on board cutter have be starved ever since a reader will perceive allowance be mostly eaten up by dog be left to beg precarious support from good will charity of shipmate of whom be equally disgusted with commander cruelty ungain temper of brute companion having entered into retrospect for benefit of reader will now proceed mr vanslyperken walked deck for nearly quarter of hour without speaking men have finished breakfast be lounging about deck for there be nothing for to do except to look out for return of two boat have be sent away night before lieutenant thought be at one minute upon mr vandersloosh thinking how must persuade at upon smallbones thinking how must render punishment adequate in opinion to magnitude of offence while discussing two important matter one of men reported boat ahead broke up commander reverie how far off demanded mr vanslyperken about two mile pulling sailing pulling sir stand right for mr vanslyperken be in pleasant humour ordered cutter to be hove to tink de men have pull enough night said jansen who have just be relieved at wheel to obadiah coble who be standing by on forecastle think so too there will be breeze depend upon never mind devil will have own in good time got for dam said jansen looking at beachy head shaking own why what be matter now old schnapps said coble schnapps tyfel schnapps think how french schnapped dutchman here when englishment must fight mind what say old twenty breech must fight when must fight here where be now by got leave in lurch not come down why must come down bah replied jansen who referred to defeat of combined dutch english fleet by french off beachy head in must fight eh exclaimed obadiah in scorn what do say to hogue yes den fought well dat be good will tell why fought well at hogue dutch porpoise just because have dutchman to help will tell why dutch be beat off head because english must come down to help here obadiah put tongue into right cheek jansen in return threw into left thus argument be finished dispute be constant at time seldom proceeded further than word certainly not between coble jansen who be great friend boat be soon on board from time that cutter have be hove to stroke of oar having be accompanied with nautical anathema from crew upon head of commander steersman first officer who have charge of boat came over gangway went up to vanslyperken be thick set stout man about five foot four inch high wrapped up in flushing garment looked very much like bear in shape a well a in skin name be dick short in respect answered to name for be short in stature short in speech short in decision action now when short came up to lieutenant did not consider at necessary to say a usual come on board sir for be evident that have come on board therefore said nothing so abrupt be in speech that never even said sir when spoke to superior may be imagined be very offensive to mr vanslyperken so be mr vanslyperken be afraid of short short be not least afraid of vanslyperken well what have done short nothing did see anything of boat did gain information have be doing night pulling did land to obtain information yes got none no here short hitched up waistband of second pair of trouser turned short round be going below when snarleyyow smelt at heel man gave back kick with heel of heavy boot sent dog off yelping barking put mr vanslyperken in great rage not venturing to resent affront upon first officer be reminded of smallbones immediately sent for corporal van spitter to appear on deck chapter four in there be desperate combat even at period of english history be custom to put few soldier on board of vessel of war yungfrau cutter have be supplied with corporal six men of whom be belonging to dutch marine to person who be so unpopular a mr vanslyperken little force be great protection corporal van spitter corp be well treated by corporal be purser purveyor have very good berth of for must cheat a well a commandant be moreover prime minister obedient executer of tyranny for corporal van spitter be without shadow of feeling on contrary have pleasure in administering punishment if vanslyperken have told to blow man brain out belonging to vessel van spitter must have immediately obeyed order without change of muscle in fat florid countenance corporal be enormous man tall so corpulent that weighed nearly twenty stone jansen be only one who must rival be quite a tall a corporal a powerful have not extra weight of carcase about five minute after summons huge form of corporal van spitter be seen to emerge slowly from hatchway appeared barely wide enough to admit egress of broad shoulder have flat foraging cap on head be a large a buffalo person be clothed in blue pantaloon tight at ankle rapidly increasing in width a ascended until diverged at hip to expanse be something between sublime ridiculous upper part of body be cased in blue jacket with leaden button stamped with rampant lion with little tail behind be shoved up in air by protuberance of part having gained deck walked to vanslyperken raised back of right hand to forehead corporal van spitter get cat up for punishment when be ready fetch up smallbones whereupon without reply corporal van spitter put left foot behind heel of right by manoeuvre turned body round like capstan so a to bring face forward then walked off in direction soon re appeared with necessary implement of torture laid down on one of lee gun again departed to seek out victim after short time scuffle be heard below be soon over once more appeared corporal with spare tall body of smallbones under arm held grasped by middle part about where smallbones stomach ought to have be head heel of poor wretch hung down perpendicularly knocked together a corporal proceeded aft a soon a van spitter have arrived at gun laid down charge who moved spoke appeared to have resigned to fate awaited made resistance when be stripped by one of marine stretched over gun men who be on deck said nothing looked at other expressively a preparation be made flogging lad like smallbones be too usual occurrence to excite surprise to show disgust must have be dangerous smallbones back be now bared miserable be spectacle shoulder blade protruded so that might put hand sideways under scapula bone of vertebra process be clearly defined through skin of poor skeleton punishment commenced lad received three dozen without murmur measured sound of lash only being broken in upon by baying of snarleyyow who occasionally must have flown at victim have not be kept off by one of marine during punishment mr vanslyperken walked deck turned turned again a before smallbones be then cast loose by corporal who be twirling up cat when snarleyyow whom marine have not watched ran up to lad inflicted severe bite smallbones who appeared at moment to be faint lifeless not having risen from knee after marine have thrown shirt over roused by new attack appeared to spring into life energy jumped up uttered savage yell to astonishment of everybody threw upon dog a retreated holding fast with naked arm met animal with own weapon attacking with frenzied resolution with teeth everybody started back at unusual conflict one interfered long be struggle such be savage energy of lad that bit held on with tenacity of bulldog tearing lip of animal ear burying face in dog throat a teeth be firmly fixed on windpipe dog must not escape for smallbones held like vice at last dog appeared to have advantage for a rolled over over caught lad by side of neck smallbones recovered getting foot of snarleyyow between teeth dog threw up head howled for succour mr vanslyperken rushed to assistance struck smallbones heavy blow on head with speaking trumpet stunned let go hold short who have come on deck perceiving that dog be about to resume attack saluted snarleyyow with kick on side threw down hatchway be about three yard off from where dog be at time how dare strike dog mr short cried vanslyperken short did not condescend to answer went to smallbones raised head lad revived be terribly bitten about face neck what with wound in front lashing from cat presented melancholy spectacle short called of men to take smallbones below in act readily assisted washed over with salt water smarting from various wound brought to sens be then put in hammock vanslyperken corporal looked at other during time that short be giving direction interfered lieutenant be afraid corporal waited for order so soon a men have carried lad below corporal van spitter put hand up to foraging cap with cat seizing under arm went down below a for vanslyperken wrath be even greater than before with hand thrust even further down in pocket than ever speaking trumpet now battered flat with blow have administered to smallbones walked up down muttering two minute will keel haul scoundrel by heaven will teach to bite dog snarleyyow did not re appear on deck have received such punishment a did not expect licked wound where must get at then remained in cabin in sort of perturbed slumber growling minute a if be fighting battle over again in sleep chapter five consultation in there be much mutiny consultation be held upon forecastle of majesty cutter yungfrau on evening after punishment of smallbones major part of crew attended corporal van spitter who on point be known to split with crew six marine who formed corporal tail at be always to be found principal personage be not most eloquent speaker for be dick short who be supported by obadiah coble yack jansen personage whom must introduce boatswain boatswain mate of cutter for although received title of former only received pay of latter person real name be james salisbury for reason will be explained be invariably addressed spoken of a jemmy duck be indeed very singular variety of human discrepancy a to form be handsome in face with manly countenance fierce whisker long pigtail on appeared more than unusually long a descended to within foot of deck shoulder be square chest expanded a far a half way down be to where leg be inserted into human frame be fine well made handsome well proportioned man what falling off be there for reason accident be supposed in infancy leg have never grown in length since be three year old be stout a well a body not more than eighteen inch from hip to heel consequently waddled about very ridiculous figure for be like man razeed cut down put on eminence of couple of foot not see leg must say at distance what fine looking sailor let get down walk up to must find that nature have not finished what have so well begun that be exactly half mistaken malconformation below did not however affect strength rather added to there be few men in ship who must venture wrestle with boatswain who be very appropriately distinguished by cognomen of jemmy duck jemmy be sensible merry fellow good seaman must not affront by joke on figure for must joke with be indeed fiddle of ship company always played fiddle to when danced on instrument be mean performer moreover accompanied voice with instrument when sang to after be tired of dancing will only observe jemmy be married man have selected one of tallest of other sex of beauty le be said better jemmy did not look to perhaps at height face did not appear so plain to a did to who be more on level with effect of perspective be well known even child now have a plaything castle etcetera laid down on card when looked at in proper direction appear just a correct a do preposterous when lying flat before now happened that from level jemmy looked up from to wife face inharmonious feature be in harmony thus did appear what be very advantageous in marriage state perfection to husband without sufficient charm in eye of others to induce to seduce from liege lord moreover let be recollected that what jemmy wanted be height have gained what required in wife if not in own person wife be passionately fond of very jealous be not to be wondered at for a said there never be such husband before since must now return to conference observing that party be sitting down on deck that jemmy duck have fiddle in hand holding with body downwards like base viol for always played in way that occasionally fingered string pinching a do guitar so a to send sound of aft that mr vanslyperken might suppose that be met for mirth two three have eye directed aft that appearance of corporal van spitter marine might be immediately perceived for although corporal be not figure to slide into conference unperceived be well known that be eavesdropper one thing sartin observed coble that dog not officer replied dick short be not on ship book so ca see how can be mutiny rejoined short mein got be not tog be te tyfel observed jansen who know how came into cutter there be queer story about said one of men tum tum tumty tum said fiddle of jemmy duck a if took part in conference that poor boy will be killed if thing go on way skipper will never be content till have driven soul out of body poor creature only look at a lie in hammock never seed christian such object said one of sailor if dog ai killed bone will be be sartain observed coble see why preference must be given to human individual although dog be skipper dog now then what d say lad tum tum tum tum tumty tumty tum replied fiddle let hang at once replied short jansen took out snickerree looked at short made motion with knife a if passing across dog throat no replied short let launch overboard at night said one of men how be one to get brute out of cabin

not tog be tog observed jansen yes replied one of forecastle men know dog be dog question be be dog dog here there be pause jemmy duck filled up by again touching string of fiddle fact be that although one of sailor wished dog be overboard there be not one who wished to commit deed not on account of fear of being discovered who be party by mr vanslyperken because there be great deal of superstition among be considered unlucky to throw dog animal overboard strange story told about way in snarleyyow first made appearance in vessel added to peculiarly diabolical temper of animal have often be theme of midnight conversation many of be convinced that be imp of satan lent to vanslyperken to injure to attempt to destroy must infallibly be followed up with terrible consequence to party if not to vessel crew even short coble jansen who be boldest leading men although when sympathy be roused by suffering of poor smallbones be anxious to revenge have own misgiving on consideration did not like to have anything to do with business of kept reflection to for if must not combat be too proud to acknowledge reader will observe that plan be immediately put end to until important question not little difficult one be decided be dog dog now although story have often be told yet a crew of cutter have be paid off since animal have be brought on board there be man in ship who must positively detail from own knowledge fact connected with first appearance there be only tradition to solve question to tradition be obliged to repair now bill spurey said coble know more about matter

may say that be natural enemy yes mein got de poy be de man said jansen will put up to at event a soon a be out of hammock rejoined jemmy duck little more conversation took place then be carried unanimously that smallbones must destroy animal if be possible to destroy only party who be not consulted be smallbones who lay fast asleep in hammock consultation then broke up went below chapter six in a often happens at sea when signal be not made out friend exchange broadside notwithstanding precaution of party on forecastle consultation have be heard by le person than huge corporal van spitter who have idea that there be mystery going on forward have contrived to crawl up under bulwark throw down on fore staysail lay between two of gun having so done without being perceived for be very moment that party be listening to bill spurey legend of dog first appearance on board threw part of sail over fat carouse thus remained undiscovered during remainder of colloquy heard descending below

then fragment of snow whirl into eye wink out melt run like tear down cheek if be not that be contrary to man of war custom must warm with double shuffle step must be unheard of on quarter deck of even cutter yungfrau tarpaulin over hatchway be pushed on one side space between coaming be filled with bull head broad shoulder of corporal van spitter who at last gain deck look round apparently be not much pleased with weather before proceeds to business examines sleeve front of jacket having brushed off with palm of hand variety of blanket hair adhering to cloth be satisfied now turn to right to left forward aft in le than minute go right round compass what can corporal van spitter want at so early hour have not come up on deck for nothing yet appears to be strangely puzzled fact be by arrangement of last night be decided that morning if snarleyyow did not make appearance in boat sent on shore for fresh beef for ship company unfortunate smallbones be to be keel hauled what delightful morning for keel hauling ingenious process however like many other good old custom have fallen into disuse must be explained to non nautical reader be nothing more le than sending poor navigator on voyage of discovery under bottom of vessel lowering author have here explained keel hauling a practised in time in small fore aft vessel in large square rigged vessel man be hauled up to one main yard arm dropped into sea hauled under bottom of vessel to other in small fore aft vessel be not so easily effected be considered sufficient punishment down over bow with rope retaining exactly in position under kelsom keelson while be drawn aft by hauling line until make appearance at rudder chain generally speaking quite out of breath not at rapidity of motion because when so long under water have expended breath in body be induced to take in salt water en lieu there be much merit in invention people be very apt to be content with walking deck of man of war complain of a hardship when once have learnt by experience difference between being comfortable above board number of deprivation have to submit to when under board overboard at same time find that there be worse situation than being on deck of vessel say privation when under board for really be very important be deprived of air to breathe be not borne with patience even by philosopher be obliged to drink salt water instead of fresh in day of keel hauling bottom of vessel be not coppered in consequence be well studded with specie of shell fish attached called barnacle a shell be open mouthed with sharp cutting point who underwent punishment for be made by rope at side fastened to arm to hug kelsom of vessel be cut scored over body a if with so many lancet generally coming up bleeding in part with face especially nose a if have be gnawed by rat be considered rather advantageous than otherwise a loss of blood restored patient if be not quite drowned consequence be that one out of three be said have be known to recover after submarine excursion dutch have credit will not attempt to take from undoubted right of having invented very agreeable description of punishment be considered heavy phlegmatic sort of people on point in art of ingeniously tormenting be in request must be admitted that have taken lead of much more vivacious otherwise more inventive nation now reader will perceive why corporal van spitter be in dilemma with good will in world with anxiety to fulfil duty to obey superior officer be not seaman did not know how to commence operation knew nothing about foddering vessel bottom much le how to fodder with carcase of one of fellow creature corporal a said before turned round round compass to ascertain if must compass wish at last commenced by dragging one rope end from one side from other must do for side rope wanted long one from forward from aft how to get one from aft under cutter bottom be puzzle then there be mast rigging in way corporal reflected more considered matter more brain became confused be at nonplus gave up in despair stood still took out blue cotton handkerchief from breast of jacket wiped forehead for intensity of thought have made perspire anything like reflection be very hard work for corporal van spitter tousand tyfels at last exclaimed corporal paused knocked big head with fist hundred tousand tyfels repeated corporal after five minute more thought twenty hundred tousand tyfels muttered corporal once more knocking head knocked in vain like empty house there be one within to answer appeal corporal must no more so returned pocket handkerchief to breast of jacket heavy sigh escaped from own breast devil in hell be mentally conjured summoned to aid be be to be presumed better employed for although work in hand be diabolical enough still smallbones be such poor devil probably might have be considered a remotely allied to fraternity may be inquired why a be on service corporal van spitter did not apply for assistance of seaman belonging to vessel particularly to officer in charge of deck fact be that be unwilling to do knowing that application must be in vain for be aware that whole crew sided with smallbones be only a last resource that intended to do being now at wit end walked up to dick short who have be watching corporal motion in silence accosted if please mynheer short mynheer vanslyperken give order dat de boy be keel hauled dis morning want haben de rope de way short looked at corporal made reply mynheer short haben tell de order of mynheer vanslyperken dick short made reply leaning over hatchway called out jemmy ay ay replied jemmy duck turning out of hammock dropping on lower deck corporal van spitter who imagined that mr short be about to comply with request after own harpocratic fashion remained quietly on deck until jemmy duck made appearance hand short jemmy piped hand up boat quoth short turning head to small boat hoisted up astern now a be apparently preparatory to work required corporal be satisfied men soon came up with hammock on shoulder put into netting then jemmy proceeded to lower down boat a soon a be down hauled up alongside short turned round to coble waving hand towards shore said beef coble who perfectly understood put new quid into cheek went down side pulled on shore to bring off fresh beef vegetable for ship company after dick short walked deck gave further order corporal van spitter perceiving went up to again mynheer short please get ready thundered short turning away got for dam dat be mutiny muttered corporal who immediately backed stern foremost down hatchway to report to commandant state of affair on deck mr vanslyperken have already risen have slept one hour during whole night that one hour be so occupied with wild fearful dream that awoke from sleep un refreshed have dreamed that be making attempt to drown smallbones without effect for so soon a lad be dead came to life again thought that smallbones soul be incorporated in small animal something like mouse that have to dislodge from tenement of clay a soon a drove from one part of body must force way back again into if forced out by mouth after incredible exertion made perspire at pore must run back again into ear if forced from thence through nostril then in at toe other part in short laboured apparently in dream for year without success then change came o'er spirit of dream still there be analogy for be now trying to press suit be now liquid in phial into widow vandersloosh in vain administered again again acted a emetic must not stomach then found rejected by widow kicked smallbones stamped upon even snarleyyow flew at bit at last fell with enormous paving stone round neck descending into horrible abyss head foremost a increased velocity awoke trembling confused must sleep more dream be not one to put mr vanslyperken into good humour two severe cut on cheek with razor a attempted to shave for hand still trembled have added to discontent when be raised to climax by entrance of corporal van spitter who made report of mutinous conduct of first officer never be mr vanslyperken in such tumult of rage pulled off beaver from hat to staunch blood wiping off remainder of lather for put aside operation of shaving till hand be more steady threw on coat followed corporal on deck looked round with savage air spied out diminutive form of jemmy duck desired to pipe hand to keel haul whereupon jemmy put pipe to mouth after long flourish bawled out what appeared to mr vanslyperken to be hand to be keel hauled jemmy slurred over quickly little change made in order although men tittered mr vanslyperken thought better to say nothing there be old saying that may bring horse to pond can not make drink mr vanslyperken have given order one attempted to commence arrangement only person who showed activity be smallbones who not aware that be to be punished hearing hand piped for something came shambling wing up hatchway looked round to ascertain what be to be done be met by bulky form of corporal van spitter who thinking that smallbones making appearance in such haste be with intention of jumping overboard to avoid punishment immediately seized by collar with left hand turned round on pivot towards mr vanslyperken raising right hand to foraging cap reported prisoner on deck mynheer vanslyperken roused lieutenant to action for have be walking deck for half minute in deep thought be ready there forward cried mr vanslyperken one replied say boatswain be ready sir replied jemmy nobody know how to set about how never seed anything of like since have be in service whole of ship company say same even flake of snow now fell thick whitened blue jacket of mr vanslyperken must not assuage wrath perceived that men be refractory so summoned six marine who be completely under control of corporal poor smallbones have in meantime discovered what be going on thought that might a well urge something in own defence if please what be going for to do with said lad with terrified look lead forward said mr vanslyperken follow marine whole party headed by lieutenant went before mast strip cried mr vanslyperken strip with snow flying like ar' cold enough already will be colder when be under bottom of cutter replied master o lord then be keel hauling a'ter why what have done cried smallbones a

arm corporal a soon a have lifted body of smallbones over larboard gunwale have direction to attend bow line not allow to be dragged on too fast better selection for purpose must not have be made than corporal van spitter smallbones have be laid without clothes on deck now covered with snow during time that line be making fast to remained silent a usual when punished with eye shut a vanslyperken watched with feeling of hatred perceived occasional smile to cross lad haggard feature know where dog be thought vanslyperken desire to know what have become of snarleyyow overcame vengeance addressed shivering smallbones now sir if wish to escape punishment tell have become of dog for perceive that know smallbones grinned a teeth chattered must have undergone dozen keel hauling rather than have satisfied vanslyperken give ten minute to think of continued lieutenant hold fast at present snow storm now came on so thick that be difficult to distinguish length of vessel smallbones naked limb be

sudden stir be heard amongst men aft a corporal raised up light frame of culprit to carry to gunwale to astonishment of vanslyperken of corporal of smallbones snarleyyow appeared on forecastle made rush at smallbones a lay in corporal arm snapped at leg then set up usual deep baying bow bow bow re appearance of dog created small sensation vanslyperken felt that have now reason for keel hauling smallbones annoyed a much a sight of dog gave pleasure corporal who have dropped smallbones on snow be also disappointed a for smallbones at baying of dog started up on knee looked at a if be apparition with demonstration of terror in countenance eye glared upon animal with horror astonishment fell down in swoon whole of ship company be taken aback looked at one shook head one only remark be made by jansen who muttered de tog be tog a'ter mr vanslyperken ordered smallbones to be taken below then walked aft perceiving obadiah coble inquired whence dog have come be answered that have come off in boat have taken on shore for fresh beef vegetable mr vanslyperken made reply with snarleyyow at heel went down into cabin chapter eleven in snarleyyow doe not at assist master cause with widow vandersloosh will be necessary to explain to reader by what mean life of celebrated cur be preserved when smallbones have thrown into canal tied up a supposed in winding sheet what mr vanslyperken observed be true that there be people below supposed paving stone might have fallen upon voice heard be of father son who be in small boat going from galliot to step where intended to land for canal be not like most others with water in sufficiently high to enable people to step from vessel gunwale to jetty snarleyyow fell in bag few yard ahead of boat splash naturally attracted

made furious lunge at snarleyyow so furious that must not regain possession with teeth door of room have be left open that dog might escape so have street door widow stood at foot of bed waiting for such effect being produced by babette vigorous attack effect be not such a anticipated dog became more enraged at last sprang out at foot of bed flew at widow tore only garment bit in leg frau vandersloosh screamed reeled reeled against door left half open falling against slammed to with weight fell down shrieking snarleyyow who probably have intended to make off seeing that escape be

worse still said corporal stalking aft leaving jemmy duck to follow up train of own thought jemmy who have be roused by corporal felt snow insinuating into nape of neck thought might a well go down below corporal made report mr vanslyperken made comment did more for be aware that mere trifle must cause general mutiny recovery of snarleyyow consoled little thinking what have be event of preceding night thought might a well prove devotion to widow by paying respect in snow storm not in attire of day before mr vanslyperken be too economical for so remained in loose thread bare great coat foul weather hat having first locked up dog in cabin entrusted key to corporal went on shore presented at widow door be opened by babette who with person barred entrance did not wait for vanslyperken to speak first mynheer vanslyperken ca come in frau vandersloosh be very ill in bed doctor say be bad case can not be seen ill exclaimed vanslyperken dear charming mistress ill good heaven what be matter dear babette replied vanslyperken with pretended interest of devoted lover through mr vanslyperken replied babette exclaimed vanslyperken well through nasty cur be same thing dog little thought that be left here replied lieutenant babette let in if please for snow fall fast must not come in mr vanslyperken replied babette pushing back good heaven what be matter babette then narrated what have passed a be very prolix mr vanslyperken be mass of snow on windward side of before have finished did by pulling down worsted stocking showing wound have received a portion in last night affray having thus given ocular evidence of truth of what have asserted babette then delivered message of mistress to wit until dead body of snarleyyow be laid at porch where now stood mr vanslyperken must never gain re admission so saying not feeling very pleasant to continue conversation in snow storm babette very unceremoniously slammed door in mr vanslyperken face left to digest communication with what appetite might mr vanslyperken notwithstanding cold weather hastened from door in towering passion perspiration actually ran down face mingled with melting snow to be not to be give up widow give up darling snarleyyow dog whom loved more more be through entangled in scrape vexation dog whom one hated therefore loved dog have not single recommendation therefore be highly prized dog assailed by especially by scarecrow smallbones to whom death must be victory be impossible then widow with such lot of guilder in bank such good income from lust haus have long made up mind to settle in possession be haven in vista of mind have be so long accustomed to dwell upon must not give up hope yet one must be sacrificed must part with have thought will make widow believe have sacrificed dog then when be once in possession dog will come back again let say word if dare will tame pay off for old score such be determination of mr vanslyperken a walked back to boat reverie be however broken by breaking nose against lamp post did not contribute to good humour yes yes frau vandersloosh will see muttered vanslyperken must kill dog must be dog life will lead when be once secure of madame vandersloosh cheated out of biscuit will see mr vanslyperken stepped into boat pulled on board on arrival found that messenger have come on board during absence with letter of thanks from king loving cousin with direction that must return with forthwith suited view of vanslyperken wrote long letter to widow in expressed willingness to sacrifice everything for not only to hang dog to hang if wished lamented immediate order for sailing hinted that on return ought to find more favourable widow read letter tossed into grate with pish be not born yesterday a saying be cried widow vandersloosh chapter thirteen in ship company join in chorus corporal go on cruise mr vanslyperken be in cabin with snarleyyow at side sitting upon haunch looking in master face wear air of anxiety discomfiture fact be that mr vanslyperken be anything content be angry with widow with ship company with dog with anger towards dog be softened for feel that if anything in world love be dog not that affection be great a much a dog nature will permit at event if animal attachment to be not very strong still be certain that snarleyyow hate everybody else be astonishing how powerful be feeling be derived from habit association now that life of cur be demanded by one a be aware sought for by many vanslyperken put value upon be extraordinary snarleyyow have become precious jewel in eye of master what suffered in anxiety disappointment from perverse disposition of animal only endeared more yes poor dog apostrophised lieutenant must seek life nay hardhearted woman demand that must be laid dead at porch conspire against be not afraid dog master will protect against vanslyperken patted animal on head be not little swelled from blow received from broom of babette snarleyyow rubbed nose against master trouser then raised up by putting paw upon master knee brought dog head more to light vanslyperken observed that one eye be swelled closed examined to horror found that have be beaten out by broom of babette there be doubt of mr vanslyperken choler be extreme now may all curse of ophthalmia seize faggot cried lieutenant wish have here poor poor dog vanslyperken kissed o frontis of cur what perhaps have never occurred since childhood what nothing else must have brought about mr vanslyperken wept actually wept over animal be not from qualification possessed worth charge of cord must have hanged surely affection have sometimes bent towards insanity after short time lieutenant rang bell ordered warm water to bathe dog eye corporal van spitter a smallbones be in hammock answered summons when returned aft with water made known to mr vanslyperken mutinous expression of jemmy duck lieutenant small eye twinkled with satisfaction damned admiral did one be portsmouth plymouth corporal van spitter must not tell be certain that jemmy have damned superior officer moreover continued corporal damned now mr vanslyperken have great hatred against jemmy duck because amused ship company never must forgive anyone who made people happy moreover wanted object to visit wrath upon so asked few more question then dismissed corporal put on tarpaulin hat put speaking trumpet under arm went on deck directing corporal to appoint one of marine to continue to bathe eye of favourite mr vanslyperken looked at dog vane perceived that wind be foul for sailing moreover must be dark in two hour so determined upon not starting till next morning then thought that must punish jemmy duck question occurred to whether must do so not be james salisbury boatswain by right not received only pay of boatswain mate be styled boatswain on book be nice point balance be even mr vanslyperken own wish turned scale resolved to flog jemmy duck if must say if must for a at time tyrannical oppression on part of superior be winked at complaint be listened to by admiralty insubordination be natural result be equally difficult to get over although on board of larger vessel strong arm of power be certain to conquer be not always case in smaller where superior be not in sufficient force backed by numerous party of soldier marine for there be then little difference between two service mr vanslyperken have have more than one mutiny on board of vessel have commanded in one instance whole ship company have taken boat gone on shore leaving by in vessel preferring to lose pay due to than to remain longer on board joined other ship in service notice be taken of conduct by authority such be state of half discipline at period speak of in service of king ship be in other point equally badly fitted out manned peculation of kind be carried to excess who be in command thought more of own interest than of anything else ship store provision be constantly sold want of former be frequently occasion of loss of vessel sacrifice of whole crew such maladministration be said to be case even now in of continental navy be not until long series of year have elapsed that such regulation arrangement a be at present so economically beneficially administered to navy can be fully established having settled point so far mr vanslyperken then proceeded to debate in own mind whether must flog jemmy in harbour after have sailed feeling that if there be serious disturbance on part of men might quit vessel if in harbour decided that must wait until have in blue water thought then reverted to widow a turned turned again clenched fist in great coat pocket be heard by near to grind teeth in meantime news have be imparted by marine who came up into galley for more warm water that dog have have one of eye put out be strange satisfaction intelligence appeared to give to ship company be passed round like wildfire when communicated beam of pleasure be soon apparent throughout whole cutter for simple reason that accident removed fear rising from supposition of dog being supernatural for men argued with reason that if must put out eye must kill altogether for if must destroy part must destroy whole one ever heard of devil eye being put out ergo dog must not be devil one of imp so argued knot of men in conclave jansen wound up by observing dat de tog be only tog after vanslyperken returned to cabin stated intention to factotum confidant corporal van spitter now in instance corporal did not adhere to secrecy to be bound only reason can give be that have a great dislike to jemmy duck a lieutenant for corporal obeyed order so exactly that considered duty not to have even opinion feeling contrary to of superior officer be delighted at idea of flogging jemmy communicated lieutenant intention to most favoured of marine who also told secret to thus in five minute be known throughout cutter a soon a be in blue water little boatswain be to be tied up for having damned admiral in snow storm consequence be a evening be clear that there be very numerous assemblage upon forecastle of cutter yungfrau flog jemmy said bill spurey why jemmy hofficer to be

live admiral with flag hoisted wo say what be here admiral a jemmy damned be more alive than stock fish moreover be not jemmy a damn poll therefore can be mutiny now what consider best be if so be be against article well then let be in for together then vanslyperken will be puzzled moreover will give hint how matter stand may think better of for although must not have jemmy touched still be quite a well not to have regular breeze with jolly for if so be that scarborough other king ship be in port when arrive vanslyperken may run under gun then whip whole boiling of off to ingies glad to get

have be fudged out of history of england will therefore be quite new to majority of reader be in want of material for eventful history have now good opportunity for spinning out volume so far from being case hardly know how to find space for what be now absolutely necessary that reader must be acquainted with friend may probably recollect when remind of fact that there be certain king james second who sat upon throne who be very good catholic that married daughter mary to one william of orange who in return for james kindness in giving daughter took away from kingdom on plea that if be bad son in law at event be sound protestant may also recollect that exiled king be received most hospitably by grand monarque louis xiv who gave palace money that required moreover gave fine army

sea side be assisted over water by band of smuggler who first concealed in cave have described be retreat led to communication arrangement with sir george barclay who although foiled in attempt at assassination never abandoned cause immediately perceived what advantage might be derived in keeping up communication by mean of outlaw for time smuggler be employed in carrying secret despatch to friend of james in england scotland a importance of correspondence increased became necessary to have personal interview instead of written communication sir george frequently passed over to cave a rendezvous at might meet adherent of exiled king in course of time saw prudence of having entire control of band found little difficulty in being appointed leader from mean obtained from st germains smuggling be now carried on to great very profitable extent by regulation enacted chance of discovery be diminished only one point more be requisite for safety secrecy be person to whom must confide charge of cave lady barclay who be equally warm in cause offered service be accepted at latter end of year about one year after plot have failed lady barclay with only child took up abode in isolated domicile sir george then first making arrangement that men must always remain on other side of water must be additional cause of security for upwards of four year lady barclay have remained inmate

swept away by tide until be unable to discover light on shore wind freshened water became more rough night be dark a pitch corporal skimmed along before wind tide tousand tyfels at last muttered corporal a searching blast crept round fat side made shiver gust succeeded gust at last corporal teeth chattered with cold raised foot out of water at bottom of boat for foot be like ice in so doing

fear to despair where be muttered what will become of ah mein gott twenty tousand tyfels what have to do in boat corporal van spitter then be again silent for nearly hour wind shifted to northward rain cleared up be only to make corporal suffer more for freezing blast poured upon wet clothes felt chilled to very centre of vitals whole body trembled convulsively be frozen to thwart yet there be appearance of daylight coming corporal now abandoned to utter hopelessness desperation commenced praying attempted lord prayer in dutch must get further than art in heaven for rest from disuse have quite escaped corporal memory tried to recollect something else be equally unsuccessful at last made up sad mixture of swearing praying mein gott hundred tousand tyfels gut gott twenty hundred tousand tyfels ah gott of mercy million of tyfels holy gott jesus twenty million of tyfels gott for dam die of cold such be ejaculation of corporal allowing about ten minute to intervene between during wind

contest between wind forcing wave one way tide checking other make wave to lose run rise dance bubble into point consequence be that boat a be borne down by tide against shipped sea moment wind threw against carcase of corporal who be now quite exhausted with more than four hour exposure to wintry night temperature being nearly down to zero corporal stoicism be gone talked wildly crouched gibbered in fear when be suddenly roused by heavy shock raised head have sunk upon chest beheld something close to to gunwale of boat be thin tall figure holding out two arm at right angle apparently stooping over be just in position that smallbones lay on forecastle of cutter on day morning when be about to keel haul corporal in state of mental bodily depression be certain that be ghost of poor lad whom have so often tortured terror raised air erect mouth be wide open must not speak tried to analyse wave dashed in face eye mouth be filled with salt water corporal threw down on thwart of boat quite regardless whether went to bottom not there lay half groaning half praying with hand to eye huge proportion raised in air limb trembling with blended cold fright one hour more there must have be nothing corporal part of corporal spitter reason why last movement of corporal did not swamp boat be simply that be aground on one of flat figure have alarmed conscience stricken corporal be nothing more than outside beacon of weir for catching fish being thin post with cross bar to certainly not unlike smallbones in figure supposing to have put arm in position for upwards of hour did corporal lie reversed when day dawned boat have be left high dry upon flat fisherman came down to examine weir see what be success when discovered boat with content at first must not imagine what be for must perceive nothing capacious round of corporal rose up in air by degree made out that there be head foot attached to contrived with united effort of four men to raise up discovered that life be not yet

must not move so heavy weight two of escorted up to hut while others threw fish caught into cart remained took possession of boat fisherman wife perceiving cart so heavily laden imagined a approached hut that there have be unusual success be not little disappointed when found that instead of several bushel of fine fish have only caught corporal of marine be kind hearted for have known misery van spitter be put into bed covered up with blanket must collect very soon be able to drink warm soup offered to be not however till long past noon that corporal be able to narrate what have taken place will lieutenant pay for saving bringing boat demanded men now must be observed that great revolution have taken place in corporal feeling since horror suffering of night felt hatred towards vanslyperken goodwill towards whom have treated unkindly supernatural appearance of smallbones in still believed appeared to a warning what have suffered from cold exhaustion by be considered a punishment for treatment of poor lad morning before have changed heart of corporal van spitter so replied in dutch will give nothing good people not even glass of schnappes tell candidly so keep boat if wish will not say word about except that be lost be not likely to see again besides can alter paint very generous present of majesty property by corporal be very agreeable to fisherman a amply repaid for trouble corporal put on clothes ate hearty meal be freely supplied with spirit went to bed quite recovered next morning fisherman took down to amsterdam in own boat when van spitter discovered that yungfrau have sailed be very puzzling corporal van spitter did not know what to do after cogitation occurred to that for vanslyperken sake might be well received at lust haus by widow vandersloosh little imagining how much at discount be lieutenant in quarter to frau vandersloosh accordingly repaired first person met be babette who finding that corporal be dutchman belonging to yungfrau who presumed that have always felt same ill will towards vanslyperken snarleyyow a did rest of ship company immediately entered into narrative of conduct of snarleyyow on preceding night anger of mistress other circumstance with reader be already acquainted corporal van spitter thus fortunately found out how matter stood previous to introduction to widow expatiated upon suffering upon indifference of lieutenant in sailing a to what have become of fully persuaded babette not only that be inimical now certainly be that always have be so to mr vanslyperken babette who be always ready to retail news went up to widow amused a dressed with corporal adventure widow felt interest in before have seen corporal van spitter from account of moving accident by flood field if prepossessed in favour before saw what did feel when first beheld substantial proportion of corporal van spitter there beheld beau ideal of imagination very object of widow dream antipode of vanslyperken a superior a hyperion to satyr have personal advantage with none of defect of late husband be quite a fleshy have at least six inch more in height in eye of widow corporal van spitter be finest man ever have beheld mentally exclaimed there be man for money at same time resolved that must win ala how short sighted be mortal little did corporal imagine that most untoward event in life must be cause of being possessed of ease competence widow received most graciously spoke in measured term against vanslyperken at corporal raised huge shoulder a much a to say be even worse than think be very violent against snarleyyow whom corporal aware that be mutiny made ceremony in damning in heap a saying be widow begged that must feel no uneasiness a must remain with till cutter returned hour after first introduction corporal van spitter have breakfasted with be actually sitting by request on little fubsy sofa in very place of vanslyperken with frau vandersloosh by side must pas over few day during cutter be away widow have not that maiden modesty to thwart wish so often prevents true love tale from being told that widow must not tell babette duly instructed told for be understood before cutter arrival that corporal van spitter be accepted lover of frau vandersloosh still be necessary that there must be secrecy not only on account of corporal being under command of lieutenant who of course must not allow to be crossed in love without resenting also because be not advisable that crew of yungfrau must not be permitted to spend money at lust haus be therefore agreed that lieutenant must be blinded a to real nature of intimacy that nothing must take place until cutter be paid off corporal van spitter must be gentleman at large independent of wisdom of above proceeding there be secret pleasure to party in deceiving deceiver vanslyperken something else occurred must now refer to corporal residence at widow house have not be unobserved by jesuit who be french agent in house opposite appeared to after inquiry have made that corporal van spitter might be made serviceable have be sent for sounded be canvassed with widow whether must accept offer not finally be agreed that must a

ascertaining who be by small clear spot left in painted window for scrutiny begged that might be concealed be immediately shown into next room by door be hid behind screen jesuit did not exactly shut door a supposed did corporal who wondered what must have brought vanslyperken there kept ajar during whole of interview counting out of money vanslyperken left a shut other door corporal did same with one held ajar took seat at other end of room that jesuit might not suspect having overheard have passed now jesuit have made up mind that be better to treat with principal than with second therefore did not further require service of corporal van spitter told that lieutenant having received private information that one of people of cutter have be seen at house knowing that be french agent have come to inform that if attempted to employ of men in carrying letter that must inform against to authority that be very sorry that after notice be afraid that arrangement must not proceed corporal appeared to be satisfied took final leave wonder therefore that widow babette be on watch when saw vanslyperken enter house at very time corporal be there also corporal went over to widow narrated that have heard seen why traitor exclaimed widow yes mein gott repeated corporal villain to sell country for gold yes mein gott repeated corporal fifty guinea did say mynheer van spitter yes mein gott repeated corporal oh wretch well continued widow at event be in power yes mein gott can hang day in week yes mein gott ho ho mr vanslyperken well well mr vanslyperken will see continued widow

dashing foot upon one of flap of little table before with so much force that be broken short off fell down on floor hundred tousand tyfels continued corporal when witnessed effect of violence although widow lamented table forgave corporal with smile liked such proof of strength in intended moreover knew that accident be occasioned by indignation at vanslyperken yes yes mr vanslyperken will pay for exclaimed prophesy that before long nasty cur will both swing together corporal now walked across little parlour back again then turned to widow vandersloosh with most expressive look slowly muttered

to a soon a be dusk must not be seen together vanslyperken ordered corporal to resume office serve out provision afternoon to astonishment of men gave not only full overweight instead of abusing being cross be good humoured joked with crew stared at other wondered what must be matter with corporal van spitter what be amazement upon snarleyyow coming up to a be serving out provision instead of receiving something from hand of corporal a usual on contrary received sound kick on rib from foot sent yelping back into cabin astonishment must only be equalled by of snarleyyow be not appeared a if wonder must never cease for when smallbones came up to receive master provision after others have be served gone away corporal not only kindly received actually presented with stiff glass of grog mixed with corporal own hand when offered lad must not believe eye even when have poured down throat must not believe own mouth ran away leaving provision chuckling along lower deck till must gain

received then returned on board a soon a have quitted vessel corporal van spitter went to jemmy duck without letting know how matter stood on shore told that be convinced that vanslyperken have sent into boat on purpose to lose that reason be that van spitter knew secret must at time hang lieutenant that in consequence have determined upon revenge in future must be heart hand with ship company to secure mutual object must be better that must appear devoted to vanslyperken a before at variance with ship company now jemmy who be with wit at work knew that be smallbones who cut corporal adrift did not alter case a corporal did not know be therefore advisable to leave in error required proof of corporal sincerity told so mein gott what proof will have de proof of de pudding be in de eating

satisfaction in meanwhile mr vanslyperken be anything comfortable in mind that corporal van spitter must assert that saw devil at shoulder be matter of small annoyance way for devil be at shoulder be not if be why then be evident that in consequence of having attempted murder having betrayed country for money devil considered a own mr vanslyperken did not approve of for like many others in world wished to commit crime go to heaven after mr vanslyperken be superstitious cowardly did believe that thing be possible when canvassed in mind trembled looked over shoulder corporal van spitter might have asserted only to frighten be possible here again be difficulty corporal have be faithful confidant for so long while to suppose must be to suppose that corporal be traitor to that upon ground vanslyperken must conjecture have turned false be impossible mr vanslyperken must not credit so there stuck like man between horn of dilemma not knowing what to do for mr vanslyperken resolved have devil really be there to have repented immediately have led new life if devil have not be there mr vanslyperken did not perceive cause for such immediate hurry at last idea presented to mr vanslyperken mind afforded great comfort be that corporal have suffered so much from boat adventure for corporal have made most of suffering that be little affected in mind have thought that have seen something must have be so said mr vanslyperken who fortified idea with glass of scheedam then went to bed now so happened that at very time that mr vanslyperken be arguing in brain corporal van spitter be also cogitating how must get out of scrape for corporal although not very bright have much of cunning of little mind felt necessity of lulling suspicion of lieutenant to conceal astonishment fear at appearance of dog have libelled mr vanslyperken who must not easily forgive be corporal interest to continue on best term with enjoy confidence of superior how be to be got over took whole of first watch two third of middle before corporal who lay in hammock must hit upon plan at last thought have succeeded at daybreak corporal van spitter entered cabin of mr vanslyperken who

explanation corporal be equally delighted at having so easily galled superior cutter weighed that morning sailed for portsmouth will pas over passage without further remark than that corporal be reinstated into mr vanslyperken good grace that appeared a usual to be harsh with ship company to oppress smallbones more than ever be at particular request of lad who played own part to admiration that mr vanslyperken again brought up question of flogging jemmy duck be prevented by corporal expressing fear of mutiny have also secret conference with corporal a to desire of vengeance upon smallbones to van spitter gave ready ear appeared to be equally willing with lieutenant to bring about thing be in state when cutter arrived at portsmouth a usual ran into harbour may be supposed that mr vanslyperken be in haste to go on shore to pay visit to charming widow still there be one thing to be done first be to report to admiral on arrival at admiral much to dissatisfaction be informed that must hold ready for sailing immediately a despatch for hague be expected down on next morning must give short time to pay address therefore made haste to widow presence be most graciously

considerably puzzled be fortunate thing thought of taking pistol with corporal might have be murdered outright yes mynheer replied corporal binding handkerchief round vanslyperken head then assisted into bed mein gott make head tail of do business said corporal a walked forward must know do truth soon not go to bed for two three hour den hear others be needle to say that mr vanslyperken passed restless night not only from pain of wound from torment of conscience for be by degree that greatest villain can drive away sting then be for short time when doe force back upon be with redoubled power occasional slumber be broken by fitful start in again again heard yell of poor lad saw corpse rolling at foot be about hour before daylight mr vanslyperken again woke found that light have burnt out must not remain in dark be too dreadful raised pulled bell over head one entered bring light immediately cried vanslyperken in minute two gleam of light be seen burning at distance by lieutenant watched progress aft entrance felt relieved have now devouring thirst upon lip be glued together turned over on bed to ask corporal whom supposed be for water fixed eye upon party with candle by feeble light of dip beheld pale haggard face of smallbones who stared at uttered not word mercy o god mercy exclaimed vanslyperken falling back covering face with bedclothes smallbones did not reply blew out candle quitted cabin chapter twenty seven in mr vanslyperken be taught secret be anxious to proceed with narrative must first explain unexpected appearance of smallbones when corporal van spitter be requested by vanslyperken to bring pistol cartridge corporal who have not forgotten hint thrown out by vanslyperken during last consultation immediately imagined that be for smallbones benefit be strengthened in opinion when learnt that smallbones be to go on shore with master after be dusk now corporal van spitter have notion of poor lad brain being blown out when mr vanslyperken went on deck left pistol went into cabin searched for drew bullet vanslyperken of course be not aware of then occurred to corporal that if pistol be aimed at smallbones be uninjured must greatly add to idea already half entertained by superstitious lieutenant of there hem something supernatural about smallbones if be loft to suppose that have be killed have reappeared therefore communicated suspicion to lad told what have done advised if pistol be fired to pretend to be killed when left by master to come on board quietly in night smallbones who perceived drift of promised to act accordingly in last chapter will be observed how contrived to deceive master a soon a lieutenant be out of hearing smallbones rose leaving bag where lay hastened back to portsmouth came on board about two hour before vanslyperken rang bell narrated what have passed of course must not exactly swear that be vanslyperken who fired pistol a be fired from behind even if must have so sworn at time must have obtained little redress be considered much more advisable that smallbones must pretend to believe that have be attacked by robber that ball have missed after have frightened master by unexpected appearance for vanslyperken must still be of opinion that lad possessed charmed life state of mr vanslyperken during remainder of night be pitiable must leave reader to suppose rather than attempt to describe in morning corporal came in after asking after superior health informed that smallbones have come on board that lad said that robber have fired pistol at then knocked down with butt end of that have escaped with loss of bag be great relief to mind of mr vanslyperken who have imagined that have be visited by ghost of smallbones daring night expressed glad at return wish to be left alone upon corporal retired a soon a vanslyperken found out that smallbones be still alive desire to kill returned although when supposed dead must to escape from own feeling have resuscitated one chief idea now whirled in brain be that lad must have charmed life have floated out to nab buoy back again now have have pistol bullet passed through scull without injury felt too much fear to attempt

something in position mind revolt at stratagem be necessary in war be in enemy camp to save own life to serve just cause be more than what attempt to do with be duty to lawful sovereign still like

for service selection have be approved of at court of st germains open warfare must have suited better must not repine at what considered be bound in fealty to perform if required although instinctively shrank from toilet be complete ramsay descended into reception room have be longer than usual probably be because wished to commune with might be because have be informed that there be young lady in house room be empty when ramsay entered took advice of host amused by examining picture other article of vertu with room be filled at last having looked at everything ramsay examined splendid clock on mantelpiece before line glass mounted to very top of lofty room when accidentally casting eye to looking glass perceived in that door of room to back be turned be open that female be

bring despatch for state general may inquire yes replied ramsay did be of importance indeed rejoined mynheer inquisitively dear sir said ramsay blushing at own falsehood be believe earnest in one point be to strengthen good cause under impression having accepted hospitality have right to withhold what know with others be not acquainted dear sir interrupted krause who be now fully convinced of importance of guest do justice be firm steadfast in good cause be known to be so be also trust discreet confiding to tried friend indeed will be generally acknowledged that mynheer krause have possessed safely guarded secret of state now in latter part of speech mynheer krause committed small mistake be known to be babbler one to whom secret must not be imparted without risk of being known be from knowledge of failing in mynheer krause that ramsay have received such very particular recommendation to a syndic of town be impossible to prevent knowledge of government secret when occasionally escaped be always traced to not being able to hold tongue nothing pleased mynheer krause so much a secret because nothing gave so much pleasure a whispering confidentially into ear of dozen confidential friend consequence be government be particularly careful that must not know what be going on did must to prevent there be many others who although must keep secret have objection to part with for consideration in enormous commercial transaction of mynheer krause be not unfrequent for good bargain to be struck with by one more of public functionary difference between sum proposed accepted being settled against interest of mynheer krause by party putting in possession of government movement have hitherto be kept in petto man have hobby usually pay dear for so did mynheer krause now when be remembered that ramsay have opened read whole of despatch may at once be supposed what valuable acquaintance must appear to mynheer krause must not anticipate ramsay reply be feel bounden duty to impart be possessed of to very worthy host allow to observe mynheer that prudence be necessary may be overheard be pleased to find one of age so circumspect replied krause perhaps must be better to defer conversation till after supper in meantime must not just give little inkling of what be going on ramsay have difficulty in stifling smile at specimen of mynheer krause eagerness for intelligence very gravely walked up to looked round room a if be afraid that wall must hear then whispered for few second into ear of host indeed exclaimed krause looking up into ramsay face ramsay

strong mind irregularly cultivated have never known advantage of mother care be indeed self educated have strong tinge of romance in character left so much alone loved to indulge in in other point be clever well read accomplished graceful in manner open in disposition to fault for like father must not keep secret not even secret of own heart for thought gave utterance to be not exactly custom in world often attended with unpleasant consequence seclusion in have be kept added to natural timidity of disposition when once intimate also added to confiding character be impossible to see without admiring to know without loving for be nature at same time in person one of nature masterpiece a observed when retired to saloon mynheer krause very shortly quitted to attend to affair below desiring daughter to exert for amusement of guest contrary however be case for ramsay exerted to amuse very soon be successful for must talk of court king of courtier of people of thousand thing interesting to young girl who have lived secluded a full toned voice in measured low pitch fell upon wilhelmina ear never perhaps be so much interested seldom ventured remark except be to request to proceed eloquent language with ramsay clothed idea added charm to novelty of conversation in course of two hour ramsay have already acquired moral influence over wilhelmina who looked up to with respect feeling can only define by saying that be certainly anything ill will time passed so rapidly that two young people must hardly believe possible that be past six o'clock when be interrupted by appearance of mynheer krause who came from counting house labour of day being over in summer time be custom to take daughter out in carriage at hour weather be too cold moreover be nearly dark conversation ensued

with intelligence called upon friend in person much to surprise told content of despatch have be received much to delight discovered that have be correctly informed also communicated what ramsay have told relative to movement of court of st germain thus unintentionally false intelligence be forwarded to england a from good authority hardly need be observed that in very short time ramsay have

smallbones for vanslyperken be convinced that attempt have be made although have not be successful again excited feeling of mr vanslyperken against lad resolved somehow to retaliate anger overcame awe be reckless in desire of vengeance there be not least suspicion of treachery on part of corporal van spitter in heart of mr vanslyperken corporal played double part so well that if possible be now higher in favour than ever after day two during mr vanslyperken remained on board sent for corporal determining to sound a to whether must make attempt upon smallbones for to height have vanslyperken

in lengthened cadence in manner truly horrible vanslyperken called out mor tal man be reply again vanslyperken almost shrieked in perspiration of fear sound now ceased be followed up by noise like rattling of glass tumbling about of chair table vanslyperken buried face under clothes then door have be shut be heard by to slam like thunder then snarleyyow barked loud deep oh god forgive cried terrified lieutenant father art in heaven save save shortly afterwards corporal made appearance with light inquired if mr vanslyperken have called found reeking with perspiration half dead with fear

corporal who aware of impropriety of situation have attempted to retreat in so doing have overturned table chair with bottle glass upon fearful of discovery upon unexpected noise have hastened out of cabin slammed door waked up snarleyyow knew from exclamation of vanslyperken that lieutenant be frightened out of wit so very boldly returned with candle to ascertain result of disturbance be delighted to find that lieutenant be still under delusion so soon a have replaced everything corporal took chair finding that have fortunately put cork into stone bottle before fell asleep that there

spilt by insatiate heretic have before received immortal crown in suffering a martyr in cause of religion justice still hold that attempt to cut off usurper must be continued hand more fortunate may succeed not only be life to be taken if possible succession must be cut off root branch know that of many child born to heretic william one have be taken away from in judgment for manifold crime one only remains present duke of gloucester do consider that branch of heresy must be removed even in preference to parent whose conduct be such a to assist cause whose death may weaken animosity of catholic majesty whose hostility be well known to be personal have men money to offer have mean trust soon to accomplish point dedicate useless life to attempt must occupy too much of page if be to narrate be said done at conference have be obliged to report a intimately connected with history many others addressed meeting proposal be made rejected acceded to list of adherent be produced of who might be gained over resolution be entered into recorded question debated before breaking up account of sum expended monies still on hand be brought forward in former item name of vanslyperken appeared rather prominent a soon a account be audited conference broke up have said that among who be at conference might be observed person who might be recognised a part of crew of lugger such be case sir robert barclay many others be men of good family stout jacobite young men served in boat with other men who be more than common seaman be considered necessary in time of treachery lugger pulled eighteen oar be clinker built very swift even with full cargo after oar be pulled by adherent of sir robert arm chest be stowed in stern sheet so that young men being always armed attempt to betray to rise against on part of smuggler have be so inclined must have succeeded ramsay trust a steersman have be appropriated to jemmy salisbury other alteration have taken place have entered into detail to prove activity of jacobite party about hour after conference sir robert cavalier have resumed seaman attire for be to go over night two hour before dusk who have be at conference in fate of kingdom crowned head be at stake be to be seen labouring at oar in company with common seaman urging fast boat through yielding water towards haven at cove chapter thirty four besides other matter containing argument left ramsay domiciliated in house of syndic van krause on excellent term with host who looked upon a mirror of information not little in good grace of syndic daughter wilhelmina there must not be more favourable opportunity perhaps for handsome well informed young man to prosecute address to gain affection of latter be so inclined wilhelmina have be brought up in luxury isolated from world be now just at age at be father intention to introduce romantic in disposition cared little for formal introduction be intended must take place have seen in of young dutch aristocracy most of whom be well known to by sight a pointed out to by father when riding with form personal appearance mind eye have embodied in vision of future lover mind be naturally refined looked for elegance grace of deportment sought for in vain among countryman have suddenly be presented to in person of edward ramsay in few meeting of father friend at house conversation be uninteresting if not disgusting for be about good merchandise money speculation occasionally interrupted by politics be to of a little interest how different be demeanour address conversation of young englishman who have be bred in court at same time have travelled much there be interest in said so much information blended with novelty amusement so much wit pleasantry crowning that wilhelmina be fascinated without being aware of before term of intimacy have warranted receiving hand on meeting have already unconsciously given heart opportunity arising from father close attention to commercial affair mutual attraction brought together during major part of day anxious to be amused attracted by youth beauty be taken advantage of by consequence be that before ten day be inseparable syndic did not perceive danger to child be exposed provided that there be objection to intimacy else equally pleased with ramsay have objection to matter taking course a for ramsay that have at first cultivated intimacy with wilhelmina more perhaps from distraction than with definite purpose be certain soon found that attraction be too great to permit to continue if have not serious intention when have entered own room before have be week in house have taxed severely a to nature of feeling be then convinced that must avoid company be impossible if remained in house a man of honour make timely retreat for ramsay be too honourable to trifle with feeling of innocent girl having well weighed point then calculated probability of being discovered propriety of continuing attention to daughter of one whom be deceiving whose political opinion be at such variance with own be point on must come to decision duty to cause supported must not allow to quit house to remain in house without falling in love be impossible why must political opinion ever be known why must not wilhelmina be of same opinion a be why ramsay fell asleep putting question to next morning resolved that thing must take chance be about fortnight since cutter have left for england ramsay be rather impatient for intelligence cutter have not yet returned breakfast have be over time mynheer van krause have descended to warehouse ramsay wilhelmina be sitting together upon one of sofa in saloon reclining free from restraint of nothing extreme intimacy will divest so wilhelmina said ramsay taking up hand lay listless at side playing with taper finger really think william of nassau be good man ramsay replied wilhelmina surprised however may rejoice at being on throne of england doubt whether can justify conduct to unfortunate king james in leagueing against own father in law dispossessing of kingdom suppose now wilhelmina that fortunate man must become one day husband what cruel what diabolical conduct must be on part at least so appears to if in return for father putting in possession of perhaps greatest treasure on earth be to seize upon father property leave beggar because other people be to invite so to do never heard placed in light before ramsay that alliance between king william father in law must have made very scrupulous grant when happiness of nation depended on ought not person in william situation to waive minor consideration happiness of nation wilhelmina in what way must prove so much be at stake be not protestant religion at stake be not king james bigoted catholic grant therefore ought not to reign over protestant nation if imagine that happiness of nation depends upon religion be afraid be deceived religion have be made excuse for interfering with happiness of nation whenever better excuse must be brought forward depend upon mass of people will never quarrel about religion if be left alone interest not interfered with have king james not committed in other point might have worshipped creator in form thought proper that protestant king be be necessary to quiet nation be fully disproved by present state of country now that sceptre have be for year swayed by king william being at moment in state very nearly approaching to rebellion be not that occasioned by machination of jacobite party who be promoting dissension in quarter replied wilhelmina grant that be not idle replied ramsay observe state of bitter variance between william house of common represents people of england what can religion have to do with wilhelmina although in country there be few who rejoice at king being called to throne of england there be many most wise in country who lament quite a much why so because mankind be governed by interest patriotism be little more than cloak benefit to country by alliance with england be very great especially in commercial point of view therefore will find want of patriot to england case be different be not interest to be involved mixed up in continental war dissension must now inevitably be case depend upon posterity will find england will have paid very dear for protestant king religion be what one be willing to admit propriety necessity of until be taxed to pay for then be astonishing how very indifferent if not disgusted become to why ramsay one must never imagine to be such warm partisan of present government a believe really be to hear talk morning replied wilhelmina public conduct a belonging to party doe not prevent having private opinion to party be ever will be stedfast knowing world secret spring of most people action a do must not be surprised at being so candid with wilhelmina conversation believe commenced upon character of king william will confess to that estimating two character in moral worth must infinitely prefer being exiled catholic james than unnatural crowned king william will say next that must just a soon be catholic a protestant if have be brought up in tenet of one instead of other what difference must have made except must have adhered to creed of forefather have worshipped almighty after fashion form ceremony be not religion good if be sincere tend to same object have same goal in view that of gaining heaven must not prefer good honest conscientious man be catholic to mean intriguing unworthy person who professed protestant most certainly must prefer to just catholic man who be just protestant be natural recollect wilhelmina have seen heard a yet one side of question if speak freely to be only to give advantage of experience from having mixed with world be true to party a man must belong to party become nonentity be in condition so unshackled may take up lay down opinion a pleased without loss of character a woman may for instance so little do care for party so well balanced do know right wrong to be on side must to please one loved at once yield up opinion to agree with if must not yield up hers to agree with mine then think woman might do so that be compliment to sex ramsay for be a much a to assert that have not only no weight influence in world also that have character stability far from only mean to say that woman generally enter sufficiently into politics to care much for generally imbibe politics of live with without further examination that be disgrace to if change besides there be one feeling in woman so powerful a to conquer others when once that enters breast remainder be absorbed become obedient to that feeling be love wilhelmina if woman happens to have be brought up in one way of thinking by parent when transfer affection to husband must politics be adverse will soon come round to opinion if really love be not quite so sure of ramsay be quite sure ought politics party be ever subject of dispute therefore must be avoided by wife besides if woman selects one a husband guide counsellor through life one whom swears to love honour cherish obey give poor proof of if doe not yield up judgment in matter more peculiarly province really put thing in new light ramsay that hardly know how to answer even when be not convinced because have not have sufficient time for reflection wilhelmina weigh well dwell upon what have said then will either acknowledge that be right find argument to prove be wrong promised singing let lead into music room have introduced conversation between wilhelmina ramsay to show not only what influence have already gained over artless yet intelligent girl also way by considerately prepared for acknowledgment resolved to make to on future opportunity for although ramsay cared little for deceiving father must not have married daughter without being fully aware of who be conversation be constantly renewed a if accidentally by ramsay long before have talked in direct term of love have fully prepared for so that felt must not receive very severe shock when threw off mask even when discovered that be catholic opposed to father in religion a well a in politics fact be that ramsay at first be a much attracted by wealth a by personal charm like many other men a love increased so did gradually become indifferent to wealth be determined to win for wife in spite of obstacle even if be obliged to secure hand by carrying off without paternal consent have be requisite be not certain whether ramsay might not have be persuaded to have abandoned party so infatuated have at last become with really fascinating wilhelmina ramsay be interrupted in middle of one of most favourite song by old koops who informed that lieutenant of cutter be waiting for in room apologising for necessary absence ramsay quitted music room hastened to meet vanslyperken mr vanslyperken have received order to return to hague few day after fright have received from nasal organ of corporal in pursuance of instruction from ramsay have not failed to open government despatch extract content have also brought over letter from ramsay adherent be sure extract be quite correct said ramsay after have read over

intelligence mynheer krause demanded other despatch have not yet be opened be waiting for mynheer van wejen suppose will learn something there knew before did when cutter arrived last time must have important friend at english court mynheer van krause here mynheer van krause nodded head looked very knowing shortly afterwards took leave particular friend of mynheer krause be also particular enemy krause have lately imparted secret be supposed to be known entrusted to none in entire confidence of government how must have obtained unless by treachery of one at home why must mynheer krause who be not trusted by government there notwithstanding high civil office because be known to be unsafe be trusted by one at home unless be for treacherous purpose so argued mr krause most particular friend who thought proper to make known opinion on subject to submit to other authority whether be not fair subject for representation in next despatch to england in consequence of suggestion representation be duly made mynheer krause be not first person whose tongue have got into difficulty so soon a vanslyperken have delivered despatch to ramsay proceeded to widow vandersloosh when a usual be received

wilhelmina a hero heroine of tale then will leave one curious feature in principal will not only not be united tale will wind up without ever seeing other allons en avant of treachery practised by party certainly appears to that treachery of widow be most odious diabolical be like bloated spider slowly entwining thread for victim be to entrap to destruction for have vowed that never must again

stopped mr vanslyperken have further order for wished to be left alone leaned head upon hand remained for time in melancholy reverie with eye fixed upon tail lay before that tail now bleeding piece of earth never be to welcome with wag again what passed in vanslyperken mind during time must be too difficult too long to repeat for mind fly over time space with rapidity of lightning flash at last rose took up dog tail put into pocket went on deck ordered boat pulled on shore chapter thirty seven in mr vanslyperken drive very hard bargain will be just candid in opinion relative to historical fact be now narrating party spirit various other feeling independent of misrepresentation do at time induce people to form judgment to say best harshly too often incorrectly be for posterity to calmly evidence handed down to examine into merit of case divested of party bias actuated by feeling hesitate to assert that in point at question mr vanslyperken have great cause for being displeased that conduct of moggy salisbury in cutting off tail of snarleyyow be in opinion not justifiable there be respect for property inculcated protected by law must never be departed from may have be aggression on part of mr vanslyperken of dog still tail be tail whether mangy not be bona fide part of living body aggression must inevitably come under head of cutting maiming act act however must with same candour will ever guide pen be acknowledged be not passed until much later period than to history of narrative refers having thus with deference offered humble opinion will revert to fact mr vanslyperken went on shore with dog tail in pocket walked with rapid stride towards half way house in one of be room tenanted by aged mother for to whom else must apply for consolation in case of severe distress that be moggy salisbury who gave cruel blow be fact completely substantiated by evidence that be smallbones who held dog who thereby became participator therefore equally culpable be surmise to insinuation of corporal have given authority of direct evidence a mr vanslyperken felt that moggy be not only out of power even if in power that dare not retaliate upon for reason have already explained to reader be therefore clear to that smallbones be party upon whom indignation must be most safely vented moreover that in so doing be only paying off long accumulating debt of hatred ill will at same time mr vanslyperken have made up mind that lad who must be floated out to nab buoy back again without sinking who must have bullet through head without mark remaining who must swallow whole twopenny worth of arsenic without feeling more than twinge in stomach be not so very easy to be made away with corporal vision be fiction be evident lad be not to be hurt by mortal man although widow arsenic have failed mr vanslyperken in superstition accounted for on ground that woman be not active agent on occasion having only prepared herring not having be received from hand by smallbones reader may recollect that in last interview between vanslyperken mother latter have thrown out hint that if took smallbones in hand must not have such miraculous escape a have have a in undertook did business thoroughly bearing in mind mr vanslyperken went to pour forth sorrow to obtain assistance of much to be respected venerable mother well child what be be money bring cried old

catching hold of tail sending flying out of casement be open there sir now may follow tail d 'ye hear leave room instantly will cleave craven skull blind old woman forsooth undutiful child vanslyperken in spite of mother indignation must not prevent eye from following tail of dog a sailed through ambient air surrounding half way house be glad to observe landed among cabbage leaf thrown into road without attracting notice satisfied that must regain treasure when quitted house now turned round to deprecate mother wrath who have not yet completed sentence have quoted above supplicate pardon dear mother said vanslyperken who felt that in present humour be not likely to gain point with that have in contemplation be so vexed so irritated that knew not what be saying blind old woman indeed repeated beldame again beg to forgive dearest mother continued vanslyperken about dog tail cut off better off than on so much le mange on snarling cur be touching up vanslyperken on raw have great object in view restrained feeling be wrong mother very wrong have done can have begged pardon came here for advice assistance what advice assistance can expect from blind old woman retorted old hag what advice assistance doe so undutiful child deserve be time before ruffled temper of beldame must be appeased at last vanslyperken succeeded then entered into detail of have passed concluded by observing that a smallbones be not to be injured by mortal man have come to for assistance be to say have come to to ask to knock lad brain out to take away life to murder in fact say cornelius be not so be exactly so dearest mother know courage yes yes understand now hear child there be deed be done have done deed be only done upon strong impulse murder be one people murder for two reason only for

of money be on verge of grave for what must require gold must be so foolish be insanity vanslyperken be right be insanity for avarice be better do mean replied vanslyperken that want gold from from

agreed that must be advisable not to attempt deed until day before cutter sailed a must remove suspicion be supposed that boy have deserted arrangement having be made vanslyperken made rather hasty retreat fact be that be anxious to recover fragment of snarleyyow mother have so contemptuously thrown out of casement chapter thirty eight in mr vanslyperken be taken for witch mr vanslyperken hastened into street walked towards heap of cabbage leaf in observed object of wish to have fallen there be one there before old sow very busy groping among refuse although vanslyperken came on shore without even stick in hand have fear of pig walked up boldly to drive away fully convinced that although might like cabbage not being exactly carnivorous must find tail in statu quo appeared that sow not only must not stand being interfered with be carnivorously inclined for be at very moment routing tail about with nose received vanslyperken advance with very irascible grunt throwing head up at with savage augh then again busied with fragment of snarleyyow vanslyperken who have started back perceived that sow be engaged with very article in question finding be service of more danger than have expected picked up one two large stone threw at animal to drive away mode of attack have effect desired in one respect sow made retreat at same time must not retreat without bonne bouche carried away in mouth vanslyperken followed sow proved that must fight a well a run minute turning round to bay chumping grumbling in very formidable manner at last after vanslyperken have chased for quarter of mile received unexpected assistance from large dog who bounded from side of road where lay in sun seizing sow by ear made drop tail to save own bacon vanslyperken be delighted hastened up a fast a

walk step be agitated uneven face be haggard be rather rapid angry pacing of tiger in den who have just be captured than of person in deep contemplation still mr vanslyperken continued to tread deck be quite light with bright pale moon men be standing here there about forecastle near boom in silence speaking in low whisper vanslyperken eye be often directed towards for have not forgotten report

have be endangered if by undeceiving vanslyperken have be deprived of such just legitimate revenge smallbones disappeared a soon a vanslyperken have fallen down be allowed to remain there for time to ascertain if must say anything a still continued silent raised up found that be insensible be consequently taken down into cabin put into bed effect produced by trial of mr vanslyperken nerve be most serious already too much heated with use of ardent spirit brought on convulsion in continued during major part of night towards morning sank into perturbed slumber be not till eleven o'clock in

on pillow have be intended by conspirator that smallbones must make appearance in cabin a bell struck one o'clock effect have already be so serious that be thought advisable to defer further attempt a for smallbones being concealed in vessel for length of time there be difficulty in for allowing that vanslyperken must go forward on lower deck of vessel never did smallbones have only to retreat into eye of be there so dark that must not be seen therefore regulated conduct much in same way a member of inquisition used to do in former day allowed patient to recover that might be subjected to more torture be not until fourth day that cutter arrived at port of amsterdam mr vanslyperken have kept bed ever since have be put into must do no longer rose weak emaciated dressed went on shore with despatch first delivered then bent step to syndic house where delivered letter to ramsay arrival of cutter have be duly notified to widow vandersloosh before have dropped anchor in pursuance with resolution immediately dispatched babette to track mr vanslyperken watch motion babette took care not to be seen by mr vanslyperken shrouding close in cotton print cloak followed to stadt house from stadt house to mansion of mynheer van krause at short distance from gate of remained till came out wishing to ascertain whether went to other place did not discover until perceived that be proceeding to widow then quickened pace so a to come up with oh mynheer vanslyperken be heard have come in so did mistress have be expecting last half hour have made haste can babette be obliged to deliver despatch first replied vanslyperken thought always took despatch to stadt house well so do babette have just come from thence be enough for babette proved that visit to syndic be intended to be concealed be too prudent to let know that have traced why mr vanslyperken look very ill what have be matter with mistress will be quite frightened have not be well babette replied vanslyperken really must run home a fast a can will tell mistress have be unwell for otherwise will be in such quandary babette hastened ahead of mr vanslyperken who be in too weak state to walk fast syndic house heh said widow mynheer van krause why be thorough king man by report continued understand there be trusting man now day babette must go there by bye see if can find out whether person brought over called king messenger be living at syndic house think must be why must vanslyperken go there if be there be treason going on be will find out name be not vandersloosh shortly after mr vanslyperken arrived at house be received with usual treacherous cordiality have not remained more than hour when coble came to having be dispatched by short to inform mr vanslyperken that frigate be coming in with royal standard at main indicating that king william be on board of intelligence obliged mr vanslyperken to hasten on board a be necessary to salute also to pay respect on board of frigate frigate be within mile when mr vanslyperken arrived on board of cutter when battery saluted cutter did same shortly afterwards frigate dropped anchor returned salute mr vanslyperken attired in full uniform ordered boat to be manned pulled on board on arrival on quarter deck vanslyperken be received by captain of frigate then presented to king william of nassau who be standing on other side of deck attended by duke of portland lord albemarle several others of courtier not of quite so faithful a two whom have named when mr vanslyperken be brought forward to presence of majesty trembled almost a much a when have beheld supposed spirit of smallbones well might for conscience told a bowed knee that be traitor agitation be however ascribed to being daunted by unusual presence of royalty albemarle a vanslyperken retreated with cold sweat on forehead observed to king with smile worthy lieutenant must show little more courage doubt not majesty if be in presence of enemy be to be hoped so replied king with smile agree with keppel majesty lord albemarle did not know mr vanslyperken a reader will acknowledge chapter forty one in be shown how dangerous be to tell secret mr vanslyperken received order to attend with boat upon majesty landing took place in about quarter of hour afterwards amidst war of cannon king william be received by authority at landing stair from thence stepped into carriage awaiting drove off to palace at hague much to relief of mr vanslyperken who felt ill at ease in presence of sovereign when majesty put foot on foremost to receive in virtue of office be syndic mynheer van krause who in full costume of gown chain perriwig bowed low a majesty advanced expecting a usual gracious smile friendly nod of sovereign to mortification reverence be returned with grave if not stern air king passed without further notice courtier also who have be accustomed to salute to exchange few word with to astonishment turned head way at first mynheer van krause must hardly believe sens who have always be so graciously received who have be considered most truly a such staunch supporter of king to be neglected mortified in way without cause instead of following majesty to carriage with rest of authority stood still transfixed carriage drove off syndic hardly replying to question put to hurried back to own house in state of confusion vexation almost indescribable hastened up stair entered room of ramsay who be very busy with despatch have received well mynheer van krause how be majesty looking inquired ramsay who knew that syndic have be down to receive on landing mynheer krause threw down in chair threw open gown uttered deep sigh what be matter dear sir appear ruffled continued ramsay who from extract made by vanslyperken from despatch be aware that suspicion have be lodged against host such treatment to one of most devoted follower exclaimed krause at last who then entered into detail of what have occurred such be sweet aspect smile must aspire to of king mynheer krause there must be occasion for observed syndic doubt of replied ramsay reason not just one be certain replied syndic one must have maligned to majesty may be replied ramsay there may be other cause king be suspicious subject may be too rich too powerful there be many pauper among favourite of majesty who must be very glad to see property confiscated cast into prison dear sir forget also that jacobite be plotting have be plotting for year conspiracy be formed upon conspiracy that when so surrounded opposed that king will be suspicious majesty king william firmly attached loyal a be to sovereign mynheer krause think that king william be more to be relied upon than king james king be king will repay most important service by smile least doubtful act with gibbet agree with that one must have maligned allow to make remark that if once suspicion dislike enters into royal breast there be effacing complete verdict of innocence will not do be like sapping of one of dam of country mynheer krause admission of water be small at first increase increase till end in general inundation must demand audience of majesty explain explain very attempt will be considered a proof of guilt a sincere friend must advise to be quiet to take such step a case requires that frown treatment of in public be sufficient to tell that must prepare for event can expect king to publicly retract retract require public apology from sovereign if having frowned upon publicly again smile upon publicly doe retract acknowledges that be in error becomes public apology god in heaven then be lost replied syndic throwing back in chair do really think so mynheer ramsay say that be lost at present have only lost favour of king can do without mynheer krause do without know that without be lost be not syndic of town of amsterdam can expect to hold important situation if be out of favour very true mynheer krause what can be done be assailed in dark know charge brought against therefore can not refute parry what charge can bring against there can be one charge against person in high situation that of disaffection disaffection who be have always be so devoted most disaffected generally appear most devoted mynheer krause will not help god then exclaimed krause with animation what will if loyalty be to be construed into sign of disaffection nothing replied ramsay coolly suspicion in heart of king be never to be effaced disaffection may be magnified into high treason bless exclaimed van krause crossing hand on heart in utter despair dear mynheer ramsay will give opinion how must act there be saying how far may be right in conjecture mynheer krause replied ramsay may have have be mistaken frowned looked cross see face now yes little thing will sour face of royalty corn may have pinched at time might have have twinge in bowel voyage may have affected smiled upon others upon friend engelback very graciously be very party who have prepared charge against krause own very particular friend did replied ramsay then depend upon be very man who have belied what engelback particular friend yes must imagine so tell mynheer krause trust have never entrusted to important secret have made acquainted with for if have knowledge of must be quite sufficient knowledge of really can not understand that how can knowledge of what be going on among king friend counsellor be cause of suspicion why mynheer krause because king be surrounded by many who be retained from policy fear of if secret be made known contrary to oath be not clear that party so revealing must be sincere friend of majesty will not be naturally concluded that who have possession of be equally open secret enemy then mynheer ramsay by rule must be majesty enemy doe not follow mynheer krause may obtain secret from who be not so partial to majesty a be to doe not disprove loyalty to expose must of course render liable to suspicion guard carefully have not told word to soul to dear mynheer krause have felt assured that be much too loyal to make known to one what be duty to king to keep secret surely mynheer krause have not trusted that man may have given hint so be afraid that did be most particular friend if be case replied ramsay be not at surprised at king frowning on engelback having intelligence from supposed to be known only to highest authority have thought duty to communicate to government be now suspected god in heaven wish never have secret mynheer ramsay appears then have committed treason without knowing at event have incurred suspicion be pity that mentioned what confided to what be done can not be helped must now be active what must dear friend expect worst be prepared for be wealthy mr van krause will not be in favour will only hasten explosion sooner later will take place remit a much of money a can to where will be secure from spoiler convert that can into gold that may take advantage of first opportunity if necessary of flying from vengeance do very quietly go on a usual a if nothing have occurred talk with friend engelback perform duty a syndic may blow over although be afraid not at event will have in probability warning a will displace a syndic before proceed further have only one thing to add be guest depend upon will share fortune whatever may be if be thrown into prison be certain to be sent there also may therefore command a please will not desert may depend upon dear young man be indeed friend advice be good poor wilhelmina what must become of yes indeed used to luxury father in prison perhaps head at gate whole property confiscated because have earliest intelligence such be reward of loyalty yes indeed repeated syndic put not trust in prince say psalmist if such be to be return for loyalty there be time to lose must send post to hamburgh frankfort many thanks dear friend for kind counsel will follow so saying mynheer krause went to room threw off gown chain in passion hastened to counting house to write important letter may now take opportunity of informing reader of what have occurred in house of syndic ramsay have a may be supposed gained affection of wilhelmina have told love received acknowledgment in return have also gained power over that have agreed to conceal attachment from father a ramsay wished first asserted to be possessed of certain property daily expected must fall to until that did not think that have right to aspire to hand of wilhelmina that ramsay be most seriously in love there be doubt must have wedded wilhelmina even if have not six penny at same time be too well aware of advantage of wealth not to fully appreciate felt necessity justice to wilhelmina that must not be deprived by mean of luxury to have be brought up here there be difficulty arising from espousing very opposite cause to espoused by mynheer krause for difference of religion very rightly considered a mere trifle compared with difference in political feeling have already weaned wilhelmina from political bias imbibed from father connexion without acquainting with belonging to opposite party for present have be intention a soon a service be required elsewhere to have demanded wilhelmina hand from father still leaving in error a to politics by taking with after marriage to court of st germain to have allowed mynheer krause to think what pleased not to enter into explanation a ramsay truly observed mynheer krause have by not retaining secret confided to rendered suspected once suspected with king william disgrace if not ruin be sure to follow fact so important to ramsay plan have be communicated in extract made by vanslyperken from last despatch ramsay have be calculating consequence when mynheer krause returned discomfited from presence of king ramsay played very diplomatic game in conversation have repeated be true still be best game for krause a well a for own interest a event will show must however remind reader ramsay have idea of double treachery on part of vanslyperken in copying letter sent by to well a extracting from government despatch dearest edward what have detained so long from morning inquired wilhelmina when entered music room about hour after conversation with syndic ramsay then entered into detail of what have occurred wove in such remark of own a be calculated to disgust wilhelmina with conduct of king william to make consider father a injured man informed of advice have given then pointed out to propriety of enforcing following with argument of persuasion in power wilhelmina indignation be roused did not fail when speaking with father to rail in measured tone against king to press to quit country where have be so ill used mynheer krause felt same pride have be severely injured may be truly said that one of staunchest adherent of protestant king be lost by combination of circumstance a peculiar a be unexpected in meantime corporal have gone on shore a usual made widow acquainted with last attempt upon smallbones revenge of ship company babette have also done part have found out that ramsay lived in house of syndic that be passenger brought over by vanslyperken in cutter widow who have now almost arranged plan received vanslyperken more amicably than ever anathematised supposed defunct smallbones shed tear over stump of snarleyyow asked vanslyperken when intended to give up nasty cutter live quietly on shore chapter forty two in be shown imprudence of sleeping in open air even in summer night yungfrau be not permitted to remain more than two day at anchorage on third morning mr vanslyperken signal be made to prepare to weigh immediately answered giving order to short hastened a fast a must up to syndic house to inform ramsay stating that must immediately return on board again that letter must be sent to ramsay perceived necessity of consented on return to boat mr vanslyperken found that signal to repair on board frigate have be hoisted hastened on board to put on uniform obey order received despatch from captain of frigate with order to proceed to sea immediately mr vanslyperken under eye of superior officer must not dally delay hove short hoisted mainsail fired gun a signal for sailing anxiously looking out for ramsay boat with letter afraid to go without boat made appearance mr vanslyperken be forced to heave up anchor still did not like to make sail remained few minute more when at last perceived small boat coming off at same time observed boat coming from frigate arrived alongside cutter about same time fortunately ramsay boat first mr vanslyperken have time to carry letter down below commandant wish to know why proceed to sea sir in obedience to order said officer only waited for boat to come on board sir replied vanslyperken to lieutenant pray sir from whom doe that boat come inquired officer from syndic mynheer van krause replied vanslyperken not knowing what else to say thinking that name of syndic must be sufficient what did boat bring off to occasion delay sir letter two for england replied vanslyperken very well sir wish good morning said lieutenant who then went into boat vanslyperken made delay of cutter to receive syndic letter be fully reported same evening to commandant who knowing that syndic be suspected reported same to authority trifling circumstance only increased suspicion against unfortunate mynheer van krause must follow cutter on board of smallbones have remained concealed on board wound have be nearly healed be now again proposed that must a soon a be out at sea make appearance to frighten vanslyperken immediately arrived at portsmouth must go on shore desert from cutter a mr vanslyperken must of course find out that mother be killed consequence to smallbones must be dangerous a have evidence if vanslyperken swore that have murdered mother arrangement be overthrown by event will now narrate be on third morning after sailed that vanslyperken walked deck there be one man at helm abaft weather be extremely sultry for cutter have run with fair wind for first eight forty hour have then be becalmed for last twenty four have drifted to back of isle of wight when be not three league from st helen consequence be that ebb tide have now drifted down very nearly opposite to part of island where cave be situated of have made mention vanslyperken people talking below a usual anxious to overhear what be said have stopped to listen heard name of smallbones repeated several time must not make out what be said anxious to know went down ladder instead of going into cabin crept softly forward on lower deck when overheard coble short spurey in consultation will be in to morrow said spurey if breeze spring up then will be too late smallbones must frighten again to night yes replied short will go into cabin at twelve o'clock will be best way corporal hush there be one there said spurey who attracted by slight noise made by vanslyperken boot turned short round vanslyperken retreated gained deck by ladder have hardly be up when observed face at hatchway who be evidently looking to ascertain if be on deck few word overheard satisfied vanslyperken that smallbones be alive on board cutter perceived how have be played with rage be excessive did not know how to act if smallbones be alive that appeared to be must have escaped from mother of course ship company must know that life have be attempted that did not care much about have not done deed how lad must have come on board did not see lying dead be very strange life of boy must be charmed at event be mystery mr vanslyperken must not solve at first thought that must allow smallbones to come into cabin get loaded pistol ready for word corporal be cut short proved to that corporal be party to affair yet be strange that ship company must have concealed lad without corporal knowledge vanslyperken walked walked thought thought at last resolved to go down into cabin pretend to go to bed lock door be not custom see if must attempt to come in did so corporal be dismissed at twelve o'clock door be tried tried again being fast party retreated vanslyperken waited till two bell to ascertain if more attempt must be made none be so rose from bed where have thrown with clothes on opening door softly crept upon deck night be very warm there be light increasing breeze cutter be standing in close to shore to make long board upon next tack vanslyperken passed man at helm walked aft to taffrail stood up on choak to ascertain what way be making through water be meditating upon best method of proceeding have known where smallbones hammock be hung must have gone down with view of ascertaining fact with crew so evidently opposed to must not see how even ascertaining that smallbones be on board must be productive of good consequence more vanslyperken thought more be puzzled fact be that be between horn of dilemma devil who always help favourite came to aid of mr vanslyperken small boat be a usual hoisted up astern mr vanslyperken eye be accidentally cast upon perceived black mass lying on thwart examined more closely heard snoring be one of ship company sleeping there against order leant over taffrail putting aside great coat covered party looked attentively on face there be doubt be smallbones from knowledge of premise vanslyperken knew at once that lad be in power boat after being hauled up with tackle be hung by single rope at davit be very broad in proportion to length be secured from motion by single gripe confined in place bowsing close to stern of cutter preventing from turning over bottom up upon least weight upon one gunwale other must be inevitably case smallbones be lying close to gunwale next to stern of cutter by letting go gripe therefore boat must immediately turn bottom up smallbones must be dropped into sea vanslyperken carefully examined fastening of gripe found that be to be cast off by one movement that success be certain still be cautious man at helm must hear boat go over might hear smallbones cry for assistance so vanslyperken went forward to man at helm desired to go down to order corporal van spitter to mix glass of brandy water send up by that must steer vessel till came up again man went down to execute order vanslyperken steered cutter for minute during looked forward to ascertain if one be moving be safe watch be asleep forward vanslyperken leaving cutter to steer hastened aft cast off gripe boat a calculated immediately turning over sleeping smallbones fell into sea vanslyperken hastened back to helm put cutter head right heard cry of smallbones be not loud for cutter have already left astern be fainter fainter at last be heard more not one of watch have be disturbed if ever haunt again muttered vanslyperken may be hanged particularly call reader attention to word of mr vanslyperken man returned with brandy water with vanslyperken drank bon voyage to poor smallbones then ordered cutter to be put about a soon a be round went down into cabin turned in with greater satisfaction than have for long time will have got rid of at last poor dog said patting snarleyyow head enemy be gone for ever mr vanslyperken slept soundly because although have committed murder there be chance of being found out soon get accustomed to crime before started at idea of murder now that cared for be detection good night to mr vanslyperken chapter forty three in smallbones change from king man into smuggler also change sex if adhered to usual plan of historical novel writer must in instance leave smallbones to what must appear to have be inevitable fate then bring on stage again with coup de theatre when least expected by reader be not intention consider that interest of narration of by gone event be quite sufficient without condescending to what be called clap trap there be so many people in narrative continually labouring under deception of one kind that need not add to by attempting to mystify reader who on contrary will take with familiarly by hand like faithful historian lead through event in order in occurred point out to how lead to one common end with intention in view will now follow fortune of smallbones whom left floundering in about seven fathom water weather be warm even sultry a said before notwithstanding notwithstanding be very tolerable swimmer considering that be so thin smallbones did not like to be awoke out of profound sleep of sudden to find floundering out of depth about mile from nearest land be anything agreeable transition be too rapid smallbones descended few foot before must divest of fold of flustring coat have wrapped up in belonged to coble have purchased at sale shop on point for seventeen shilling sixpence moreover be a good a new in consequence of delay below watermark smallbones have very little breath left in body when rose to surface must not inflate lung so a to call loud until cutter have walked away from at least one hundred yard for be slipping fast through water minute plainly proved to smallbones that be left to own resource at first lad have imagined that be accident that rope have given way with weight when found that attention be paid to cry then be convinced that be work of mr vanslyperken by gum be done for at last well care can die once be sartin sure will go to devil be sartin sure smallbones with comfortable assurance continued to strike out for land indeed have little prospect of ever making shame for to come for to go to murder poor lad three four time over sputtered smallbones after time feeling strength fail then turned on back to ease arm ca do how see that said smallbones so may just a well go down like dipsey lead a muttered be making up mind to discontinue further exertion not very easy thing to do when be about to go into world still floating on back with eye fixed on starry heaven thinking a smallbones afterwards narrated that there be' much to live for in here world considering what there must be in 'ere head struck against something hard smallbones immediately turned round in water to see what be found that be one of large cork supported heavy net laid out across tide for taking of shoal fish cork be barely sufficient to support weight gave certain relief time to look about a saying be lad ran under net cork with hand until arrived at nearest shoal for be three four hundred yard long when arrived there contrived to bring of cork together until have quite sufficient for support then smallbones voted pretty comfortable after for water be very warm now quite smooth smallbones a reader may have observed during narration be lad of most indisputable courage of good principle have be fortune to have be born among higher class to have have advantage of education might have turned out hero a be did duty well in state of life to have be called a said in speech to men on forecastle feared god honoured king be natural enemy to devil chevalier bayard be nothing more only have wider field for exertion talent armed accoutred bayard did not show more courage conduct when leading army to victory than did unarmed smallbones against vanslyperken dog consider that in way smallbones be quite a great hero a chevalier for man can do more than best indeed be unreasonable to expect while smallbones hung on to cork be calculating chance of being saved if so be a how come to take up net in morning why then think may hold on if so be wait why will then find dead a fish said smallbones who seldom ventured above monosyllable whose language if not considered a pure english be certainly amazingly saxon then smallbones began to reflect whether be not necessary that must forgive mr vanslyperken before died pro con ended with thinking must for be duty however must not be in hurry about thought be last thing that need do a for dog be' obliged to forgive be certain a certain a tail be off smallbones up to chin in water grinned so at remembrance that took in more salt water than be pleasant spit out again then looked up to star be twinkling above wonder what o'clock be thought smallbones when thought heard distant sound smallbones pricked up care listened yes be in regular cadence became louder louder be boat pulling well be sure thought smallbones will think have caught queer fish anyhow waited very patiently for fisherman to come up at last perceived boat be very long pulled many oar be smuggler thought smallbones wonder whether will pick up poor lad boat ahoy boat continued to pas towards coast impelled at speed of seven eight mile hour be now nearly abreast of smallbones not fifty yard from say boat ahoy screamed smallbones to extent of voice be heard time there be pause in pulling boat still driving through water with impulse have be given a if required propelling power say ai going for to come for to leave poor lad here to be drowned be that be smallbones will swear cried jemmy duck who be steering boat who immediately shifted helm sir robert barclay paused there be too much at stake to run risk even to save life of fellow creature take time for to think on anyhow cried smallbones be going for to leave fellow christian stuck like herring in fishing net be must not like anyhow be smallbones sir repeated jemmy duck will vouch for a lad be good true sir robert no longer hesitated give way lad pick up in few minute smallbones be hauled in over gunwale be seated on stern sheet opposite to sir robert be great deal colder out of water than in be sartain observed smallbones shivering give way lad have time to stay cried sir robert take smallbones said jemmy why so be

understand manoeuvre beat comprehension what have done with vanslyperken know have kicked cur out of cabin then have kicked out too depend upon thus did crew continue to surmise during whole night a bill spurey said manoeuvre beat comprehension one thing be agreed upon that must make attempt to recover vessel a soon a must in meantime ramsay with wilhelmina jesuit have taken possession of cabin have opened despatch acquainted with direction in detail given for taking of conspirator at portsmouth in cave have not be to save friend ramsay must at once have taken cutter to cherbourg have there landed wilhelmina treasure anxiety for friend determined to run at once for cave send overland to portsmouth wind be fair water smooth before morning cutter be on way in meantime crew of cutter have not be idle ladder have be taken up hatch closed only chance of success be attack upon guard who be stationed outside of cabin have six pistol about two hundred pound of ammunition with exception of dozen bayonet other weapon be resolute men a soon a have made arrangement consisted of piling up hammock so a to make barricade to fire over then commenced operation first signal of be pistol shot discharged at men who be on guard in passage wounded one of ramsay darted out of cabin at report of pistol be discharged ramsay then gave order to fire in return be done without injury to seaman of cutter who be protected by hammock ramsay having already three of men wounded found that post below be longer tenable consultation took place be determined that passage on lower deck cabin must be abandoned a upper deck must be easy to retain cabin skylight be taken off box of gold handed up while party outside cabin door maintained conflict with crew of yungfrau when box be up wilhelmina be lifted on deck skylight be shipped on again a soon a after hatch be ready to put on ramsay men retreated at ladder drew up after then put on hatch have not barricade of hammock prevented crew of yungfrau might have made rush followed others on deck before must beat down barricade did a soon a perceived opponent retreat ladder be up hatch placed over hatchway yungfraus have gained whole of lower deck must do more ramsay perceived that if must maintain possession of upper deck be a much a must expect with such determined assailant warfare have be continued during whole morning be twelve o'clock before cabin lower deck have be abandoned by ramsay associate during whole day skirmish continued crew of yungfrau climbing on table of cabin firing through skylight in so doing exposed to fire of other party who sat like oat watching for appearance discharging piece moment that head presented in meantime cutter darted on before strong favourable breeze thus passed first day many attempt be made during night by seaman of cutter to force way on deck be prevented by vigilance of ramsay next morning isle of wight be in sight wilhelmina have passed night on forecastle covered up with sail none of people have have anything to eat during time that be on board ramsay be most anxious to arrive at destination about cutter be abreast off black gang chyne ramsay have calculated upon retaining possession of cutter taking whole of occupant of cave over to cherbourg be now impossible have five of men wounded must not row boat to cave without leaving so few men on board that must be overpowered for ammunition be expended with exception of one two charge be retained for emergency that must do now be therefore to put treasure in boat with wilhelmina whole party make for cave when must send notice to portsmouth for others to join must be content to await meditated attack upon cave defend till must make escape to france wind being foul for cutter return to portsmouth must enable to give notice at portsmouth overland before must arrive there be great oversight committed when lower deck be abandoned despatch have be left on mr vanslyperken bed have be taken away destroyed there must have be ample time for whole of party to have made escape from england before duplicate must arrive a be must do more than what have already mentioned boat be hauled up box of specie put in wounded men laid at bottom of boat having at suggestion of one of men cut lower rigging halyard etcetera of cutter to retard progress to portsmouth ramsay associate stepped into boat pulled for cave departure be soon ascertained by crew of yungfrau who now forced skylight gained deck not before boat have entered cave what be to be done now said coble smash timber have played old harry with rigging must knot splice yes replied short what devil have done with vanslyperken cried bill spurey shoved overboard taken with suppose cried coble well be nice job altogether observed spurey mein gott yes replied corporal will have pretty story to tell de admiral well have rid of at event only hope will hang mein gott yes will have desarts replied coble got for tam like to see swing now be

must come from whispered spurey coble shrugged up shoulder short gave long whistle expending more breath than usual however there be more to be said a soon a rigging be knotted spliced sail be made in cutter wind being dead in teeth did not arrive until late next evening admiral did not see despatch till next morning for best of possible reason that vanslyperken did not take on shore have long story to tell thought prudent not to disturb admiral after dinner a great men be apt to be very choleric during progress of digestion consequence be that when next morning mr vanslyperken called upon admiral intelligence have be received from cave party have absconded mr vanslyperken told own tale how have be hailed by boat purporting to have messenger on board how have boarded beat down crew how crew have fought under hatch beat on deck how have be forced to abandon cutter be very plausible then vanslyperken gave despatch opened by ramsay admiral read in haste gave immediate order for surrounding breaking into house of jew lazarus in military found nobody old tom cat then desired mr vanslyperken to hold cutter in readiness to embark troop sail afternoon troop move so fast a people think before one hundred men have be told off by sergeant with accoutrement knapsack sixty pound of ammunition be too late to embark night so waited until next morning moreover mr vanslyperken have

have come on shore with view of forcing entrance into cave in minute preparation be made for defence for have long be arranged that in case of unexpected attack woman must make resistance in power nature of place enabled to do a many observed party although coming from cutter not badly armed did not appear to advance in hostile manner after waiting time near boat advanced with box on shoulder what box might be be puzzle might be hand grenade for throwing into cave however be soon down to rock at ladder be let down then smallbones stood up with musket in hand with straddling leg short

upon desperate resistance if discovered have buff jerkin under female garment be soon in cave very busy under ramsay direction preparing against expected attack sir robert barclay with boat have be over two day before be not known when must return that presence be most anxiously looked for maybe readily conceived a boat crew must double force if obliged to remain there boat must enable with one

woman to contend with be mentioned in despatch believe observed admiral that there be only woman supposed to be in cave smuggler who be on board cutter have left with specie yesternight admiral so that will gain honour profit at event will have merit of obeying order major lincoln major made reply went away very much dissatisfied in meantime sergeant have communicated with non commissioned officer private ordered on duty discontent be universal most of men swore that must not pull trigger against woman if be shot for disaffection almost amounted to mutiny nancy in meantime have not be idle have found mean to speak with boat crew of yungfrau stated departure of smuggler with gold fact that be to fight with nothing woman that soldier have vowed that must not fire shot that moggy salisbury who be with swore that must hoist up smock a flag fight to last be soon known on board of yungfrau gave great disgust to one of crew who declared to man that must not act against petticoat much le fire shot at moggy salisbury what mountain of mischief can be heaped up by insidious tongue of one woman after explanation may be supposed that zeal of party dispatched be not very great fact be be sulky from major downwards among military from vanslyperken downwards among naval portion of detachment nancy corbett satisfied with having effected object have crossed over night before joined companion in cave what be extremely fortunate on same night sir robert barclay came over in lugger finding how matter stood immediately hoisted boat up on rock taking up men prepared with follower for vigorous resistance naturally to be expected from whose life depended upon issue of conflict next morning cutter be seen coming down with boat in tow hardly stemming flood from lightness of breeze when nancy corbett requested to speak with sir robert barclay stated to what have done dissatisfaction among troop seaman in consequence submitted to propriety of smuggler being dressed a woman a must operate more in favour than if have fifty more men to defend cave sir robert perceived good sense of suggestion consulted with ramsay who strongly urged suggestion being acted upon men be summoned affair explained to consequence be that there be scene of mirth laughter ended with man being fitted with woman attire only one who remained in dress of man be woman wilhelmina krause be to remain in cave with other woman take part in coming fray chapter fifty in officer non commissioned officer rank file be sent to right about about yungfrau hove to off cave troop be told off into boat about past

glass in hand stepped into boat with mr vanslyperken whole detachment pulled for shore landed in small cove where found smuggler boat hoisted up on rock at men seemed rejoiced a took for granted that must find men to fight with instead of woman major headed men commenced scramble up rock arrived at foot of high rock formed platform above at mouth of cave when major cried halt very judicious order considering that be impossible to go further soldier looked about everywhere must find cave after hour strict search major lincoln officer glad to be rid of affair held consultation be agreed that troop must be re embarked men be marched down again very hot from exertion thus expedition must have ended without bloodshed have not be for incautious behaviour of woman that woman be moggy salisbury who having observed that troop be re embarking took opportunity while sir robert men be keeping close to hoist up certain under garment to pole a if in derision thus betraying locality of cave running risk of sacrificing whole party in a be going up caught eye of one of seaman in boat who cried out there go ensign up to peak at last where exclaimed major pulling out telescope yes by heaven there be there then must be cave sir robert of conspirator be aware of manoeuvre of moggy for smallbones perceiving what have done hauled down again in minute afterwards have be hoisted major considered duty to return so once more troop ascended precipitous path moggy then went into cave have found out sir said point to be coming up again will stand a sentry men wo fire at if do care sir robert ramsay be in close consultation appeared to that by bold manoeuvre must be able to get out of scrape wind have gone down altogether sea be a smooth a glass there be appearance of continued calm if must manage think may then sooner affair be brought to issue better moggy have now taken musket on shoulder be pacing up down edge of flat in imitation of sentry be soon pointed out titter ran through whole line at last a major approached called out say soger what be doing here keep off will put bullet in jacket good woman replied major while men laughed want to hurt must surrender surrender cried moggy who

lilly let come in again will not fire first at event cried moggy never fear sir guard turn in continued upon lilly squadron then disappeared upon honour be too ridiculous said lieutenant dillon upon soul know what be to be done rejoined major moggy must commence hostility somehow cried sir robert from within smallbones here came out with musket to release moggy moggy retired into cave major who imagined that there must be path to cave on other side now advanced with determination of finding out somehow putting end to unusual warfare if please will keep back will fire cried smallbones levelling musket major went on heedless of threat smallbones discharged piece major fell confound that devil be hurt major cried lieutenant dillon yes be ca move shot be now fired sergeant fell hell flame what must do now whole party of smuggler poured out of cave a woman with bonnet on commenced murderous fire upon troop who fell in direction captain who have assumed command now attempted to find way to other side of cave where have doubt must find entrance in so doing soldier be exposed to most galling fire without being able to return at first troop refused to fire again for that have to deal with smuggler wife made certain of even in thickest of smoke there be nothing masculine to be seen troop who be at greater distance who must return fire did not be rather amused at character of woman not being aware that comrade be falling so fast remained inactive there be limit to even gallantry a wounded men be carried past indignation be roused at last fire be a warmly returned before took place one half of detachment be hors de combat assistance might have received from covering party of sailor on beach be neutralised did not know how much soldier have suffered although fired in pursuance of order must not take aim for time soldier be forced on to eastern side of rock a reader may recollect be much more precipitous than western side where be descended from by ladder here be at mercy of conspirator who concealed below mass of rock on platform took unerring aim captain have fallen lieutenant dillon be badly wounded led back to boat command have devolved upon young man who have just joined regiment who be ignorant of anything like military tactic even if must have be brought into play upon service do call fighting with woman sergeant tanner said one of men have seen service murderous fire be never in why have lost two third of men will lose before find out mouth of cursed cave regiment have lost character for ever care how soon bullet settle business ramsay now detached party of men to fire at covering party of seaman who be standing by boat in cove who be unprotected while men be concealed behind mass of rock many fell wounded killed vanslyperken after shifting about from one position to ordered wounded men to be put into boat with two hand pulled off a said to procure more ammunition leaving remainder of detachment on shore to do a well a must thought a how work must be too warm for observed bill spurey yes replied short who at moment received bullet in thigh fell down among rock fire upon seaman continued to be effective move from post did not one after sank wounded on ground soldier who be now without one to command for who have forced way to western side of rock finding advance retreat be alike impossible crawled under side of precipice to retreat from murderous fire must not return others be scattered here there protecting a well a must below mass of stone returning fire of conspirator surely desperately of hundred men sent on expedition there be not twenty who be not killed wounded nearly whole detachment of seaman have fallen where stood be then four o'clock few men who remained unhurt be suffering from extreme heat exertion devoured with wounded cried for water sea be still calm smooth a mirror not breath of wind blew to cool fevered brow of wounded men cutter with sail hanging listless floated about on glassy water about quarter of mile from beach now be time sir robert yes ramsay now for one bold dash off with woman gear men buckle on sword put pistol in belt in very short time order be complied

jacobite cause be triumphant by sea a well a by land great difficulty sir robert barclay have to surmount be to find mean of transport over channel for numerous friend male female then collected in cave now that retreat be known be certain that effective measure must be taken by government by if not otherwise reduced must be surrounded starved into submission two boat have be not sufficient for transport of so numerous body consisting now of nearly one hundred fifty individual mean of subsistence be limited to few day arrival of cutter with detachment be source of regret to sir robert who hoped by defeat of troop to obtain boat thus make escape must have be difficult if not impossible if cutter have be under command a carried four gun must have prevented escape even if did not destroy boat when sir robert observed that have fallen calm at once struck that if after defeating troop must board carry cutter that difficulty be over then must embark whole of people run over to cherbourg be plan proposed by sir robert agreed to by ramsay to accomplish now that troop be put to rout have made rush for obtained boat a for woman left in cave be perfectly secure for time a without scaling ladder there be possibility of remaining troop even if wore rallied being able to effect anything that part of crew of yungfrau who have perceived rush down to beach reported to mr vanslyperken who have gone down to cabin not choosing to take further part in affray to risk valuable life vanslyperken came on deck where witnessed manning of boat pushing out of cove be coming to attack sir said
