moreover have very strong feeling towards captain bridgeman mr flat be certainly very fine looking soldier being tall erect well made be at same time not over brilliant be a officer very sort of person father ben be a private other party captain bridgeman did not come forward appeared to be in doubt not at able to make up mind fact be that mother being married to private made match with sister objectionable to whole corp a must be derogatory that one sister must be wife of private other of officer ben must have be able to say brother in law captain of division must never have done captain bridgeman felt therefore resisted a well a must inroad aunt beauty mirth have made into heart aunt be exactly person to suit captain bridgeman a helpmate have not be for unfortunate alliance of mother lieutenant flat be too stupid indifferent to opinion of other officer to care anything about what thought must have married milly long before aunt who have made up mind to marry officer did

great compliment if see lady very busy at work when be conversing with may flatter captain bridgeman replied mother attention to work may arise from perfect indifference from positive annoyance save trouble of making effort to be polite pray may inquire miss amelia what feeling may cause particular attention to work at present moment perhaps in case to preserve self possession replied amelia

arrived alongside frigate lay at spithead bright with new paint with pennant proudly flying to breeze 'd better follow sir mind touch hat when officer speak to said bob cross ascending accommodation ladder did so found on quarter deck in presence of first lieutenant several of officer well cross said first lieutenant have brought young gentleman on board to join ship captain delmar have believe given order about mr keene presume said first lieutenant eyeing from head to foot yes sir replied touching hat how long have be at portsmouth three day sir have be staying at mr culpepper well did

coxswain humph well that be settled at event very good will have pleasure of company to dinner mr keene why mr dott look a if knew other tommy said to midshipman grinning suspect that there be pair of said first lieutenant turning aft walking away after tommy went down companion ladder a fast a must in few second afterwards be sitting together on same chest in most intimate conversation extreme resemblance to honourable captain be not unobserved by officer who be on quarter deck at time of making appearance a afterwards heard from bob cross be sent for by surgeon on pretence to obtain information relative to what be bob cross reason for answering a did must not at time comprehend explained to afterwards who brought down cross said surgeon carelessly own mother sir have father sir hear did see what sort of person be well sir replied bob cross have seen many lady of quality real lady think ever set eye upon before such beauty 'd marry to morrow if must take in tow craft like how did come down to portsmouth why sir came down to portsmouth in coach four walked to george hotel a if be nobody be not fib on part of coxswain for came down by portsmouth coach did however deceive surgeon a be intended did see anything of cross not when be with captain sir at own lodging did generous lady never met with few more question be put of be replied to in much same strain by coxswain so a to make out mother to be very important mysterious personage be true that tommy dott must have contradicted in first place be not very likely that there must be communication upon point between officer in next cautioned to say nothing about what knew a be strongly attached to strictly complied with so bob cross completely mystified surgeon who of course made report to messmate mr culpepper report certainly differed somewhat from of bob cross there be statement of aunt being married to marine officer be statement there be also statement of mother residing with captain delmar aunt altogether there be doubt mystery ended in mother being supposed to be much greater person than really be everything tending to prove lady of rank being willingly received counter statement looked upon a apocryphal false whoever mother might be on one point one agreed be be son of honourable captain delmar on point be equally convinced waited with anxiety for mother reply to letter arrived two day after have joined frigate be a follows dear percival little know pain astonishment felt upon receipt of very unkind insulting letter surely must not have reflected at time wrote must have penned in moment of irritation arising from ungenerous remark have be made in hearing ala dear child will find now that have commenced career in life that there be too many whose only pleasure be to inflict pain upon fellow creature only can imagine that remark have be made in presence arising from there being similarity of feature between honourable captain delmar that there be so have be before observed by others indeed uncle aunt bridgeman be struck with resemblance when captain delmar arrived at chatham prof nothing dear child people be very often alike who have never seen other heard other mentioned till have by accident be thrown together so a to be compared may certainly be a father be in service of captain delmar constantly attended upon indeed may add a be occasionally seeing that impression of countenance might be constantly in memory understand such question therefore will say no more except that will immediately dismiss from thought such idea forget dearest boy that be insulting by supposing such thing that mother honour be called in question be sure never thought of when wrote hasty inconsiderate line must add dear boy that knowing captain delmar how proud sensitive be if must ever come to knowledge that have suspected asserted what have favour protection must be lost to for ever at present be doing kind charitable action in bringing forward son of faithful servant if imagined for moment that be considered related to must cast off for ever prospect in life must be ruined even allowing possible that be what so madly stated in letter to be be convinced must do so if such report came to ear must immediately disavow leave to find own way in world see therefore dear boy how injurious to in way ridiculous surmise must prove trust that not only for own sake for mother character will so far from giving credence indignantly disavow what must be source of mischief annoyance to party captain bridgeman desire to say that be of opinion so be aunt milly a for grandmother of course dare not show letter write to dear boy tell how unfortunate mistake happened believe to be affectionate mother arabella keene read letter over ten time before came to conclusion at last said to myself there be not in one part of positive denial of fact resolved future day when have have conversation with bob cross to show to ask opinion chapter sixteen next morning at daylight blue peter be hoisted at foremast gun fired a signal for sailing be bustle hoisting in clearing boat of stock clearing ship of woman stranger at ten o'clock captain delmar made appearance

invite one of others to breakfast with never paid that compliment annoyed spoke of to bob cross with whom have have long conversation have told knew relative to myself what suspicion be have shown mother reply opinion on subject may be given in what follows see master keene be in awkward position captain be very proud man too proud to acknowledge that be way related to be opinion from what have

subject when be taking glass of grog with other night in berth be brought up subject not said that captain not asking to breakfast avoiding a be be proof that belonged to wishing to hide secret only make behave a doe have difficult game to play master keene be clever lad ask advice mind follow be little use asking must always be very respectful to captain delmar keep at a great distance from a doe from that be sure will replied for dislike very much must not do must bend to circumstance by by thing will go on better mind keep on good term with officer never be saucy may say to what may not be pleasant recollect thing will go on better a said before if captain delmar protects with interest will be captain over head of many who be now superior on board of frigate one thing be careful of be to keep own counsel be persuaded in moment of confidence to trust anything to tommy dott other midshipman if one hint at what suppose deny immediately nay if necessary fight for will be way to please captain for will be of side then not against that advice of bob cross be best must be given to one in position there must not be doubt did resolve to follow be most certain generally passed

ready to sail at moment notice be now quite accustomed to ship officer conviction have of peculiar position together with advice of bob cross have very much subdued spirit perhaps respect created by discipline example of others produced in degree of awe of captain lieutenant assisted little certain be that gained goodwill of messmate have not be in scrape during whole cruise first lieutenant be stern not unkind man must blow up a termed when scolded for hour without ceasing never knew man with such flow of word if permitted to go on without interruption be content without proceeding to further punishment want of respect however be peculiarly offensive to attempt to excuse be immediately cut short with reply sir second day after return to spithead be sent on shore in cutter to bring

received spy glass a present in due form then led to chest in steerage in low confidential tone told a follows see green must be very particular about making sign for if make mistake will be worse off than if never made at for first lieutenant will suppose that be trying to persuade that be mason when be not now observe must not attempt to make first sign until have scolded well then at pause must make thus see must put thumb to tip of nose extend hand straight out from with finger separated a wide a can now do a did stop wait little till marine pass yes be well be considered first proof of being mason requires second first lieutenant will tell frankly be rather pretend to be in terrible rage will continue to rail at must therefore wait little till pause then observe put up thumb to nose with finger of hand spread out a before then add to other hand by joining other thumb to little finger of hand already up stretch other hand finger out like first then will see effect of second sign

boat so be continually baling to keep free night be a dark a pitch must see nothing except light of vessel have left far away from be now a little twinkle a rose upon wave wind roared there be appearance of heavy gale little hope of weathering storm said woman will soon be swamped if put before wind will see if can not find line did so after time by mean of rudder put boat before wind boat

howled pierced to bone took small quantity a before then continued to keep boat before wind sea be increasing very much although sailor felt fully convinced that boat must not live much longer in meantime woman be becoming intoxicated very fast knew consequence of requested to bale out boat did so sang mournful sort of song a baled howling of wind prevented from distinguishing word can not well analyse feeling at time be confused know self preservation hope be most predominant thought of mother of aunt of captain bridgeman captain delmar bob cross thought be a rapid a gale bore along be too much employed in steering boat preventing sea from filling to have moment to collect idea again woman applied to bladder of spirit offered to refused have have enough by time have have too much after attempt to bale dropped down in stern sheet smashing pipe everything beneath spoke more have now be more than four hour adrift wind be a strong a ever thought sea much higher kept boat steady before wind by degree a became more accustomed to steer did not take in so much water still boat appeared to be sinking deeper down after time considered necessary to bale out did so with hat for found be half full of water then execrated woman for having intoxicated so a to be useless in such emergency succeeded in clearing boat of major portion of water be easy task a boat having remained broadside to wind have taken in sea continually a baled out then once more resumed helm put boat before wind thus did continue for two hour more when rain came down in torrent storm be wilder than ever portsmouth wherry be one of best boat ever built so proved in instance still be now in situation most trying for lad between fourteen fifteen teeth chattered with cold be drenched through through darkness be opaque must see nothing white foam of wave curled broke close to gunwale of boat at one moment despaired looked for immediate death buoyant spirit raised up again hoped must be daylight in few hour oh how looked longed for daylight knew must keep boat before wind did so sea be worse than ever now continually broke into boat for tide have turned have increased swell again left helm bailed out be cold faint felt recovered with exertion also tried to rouse woman be useless felt for bladder of liquor found in bosom more than half empty drank more freely spirit courage revived after ate steered boat awaiting coming daylight came at last slowly so slowly did come felt almost happy there be such horror in darkness when added to danger felt a if must have worshipped sun a rose slowly with watery appearance above horizon looked around there be something like land astern of such a have seen pointed out a land by bob cross when off coast of portugal so be be isle of wight for wind have changed when rain came down have altered course of boat so that for last four hour have be steering for coast of france although be cold shivering worn out with watching tired with holding line by wherry be steered felt almost happy at return of day looked down upon companion in boat lay sound asleep with head upon basket of tobacco pipe bonnet wet dripping with faded ribbon hanging in water washed to fro at bottom of boat a rolled rocked to motion of wave hair have fallen over face so a almost to conceal feature thought that have died during night so silent so breathless did lie wave be not so rough now a have be for flood tide have again made a beam of morning sun glanced on water same billow appeared so dreadful in darkness appeared to dance merrily felt hungry took up red herring from one of basket tore to piece with teeth looked around in quarter to see if there be vessel in sight there be nothing to be seen now then screaming sea gull tried to rouse companion by kicking with foot did not succeed in waking up turned round on back hair falling from face discovered feature of young pretty person apparently not more than nineteen twenty year old figure be slight well formed young a be thought pity that nice looking person for still be so although in state of disorder very dirty must be so debased by intoxication a looked at bladder still full of spirit seized with intention to throw overboard when paused at recollection that have probably saved life during night might yet be required did not like to alter course of boat although perceived that be running fast from land for although sea have gone down considerably there be still too much for boat to be put broadside to can not say that be unhappy found situation so very much improved to what be during darkness of night sun shone bright felt warmth have idea of being lost death did not enter thought there be plenty to eat vessel must certainly pick up nevertheless said prayer more devoutly than usually did about noon a near a must guess tide changed again a wind have lulled very much there be little swell thought now that motion be not so great might possibly ship foremast make little sail upon boat tried again more earnestly to rouse up companion after few not very polite attempt succeeded in ascertaining that be alive be quiet jim said with eye still closed be not five bell yet kick two turned round stared wildly jim said rubbing eye then looked about at once appeared to remember what have passed shrieked covered face up with hand thought be dream be going to tell jim about at breakfast said sorrowfully be true true a gospel what will become of be lost lost lost be not lost must have be lost night if have be a drunk a have be replied have have work enough to keep boat above

company be all reported to officer worked way until came from first lieutenant to captain from captain to port admiral be certain that peggy pearson did do good service for be longer looked upon a mere youngster who have just come to sea who have not be tried well sir said bob cross day two afterwards seems by peggy pearson report that be not frightened at trifle peg pearson report wo do much good ought to know better master keene than to say that mouse may help lion a fable say where did learn fable cross will tell there be nice little girl used to sit on knee read fable to listened to because loved doe do so now oh be too big for 'd blush up to temple never mind girl fable told that peggy have reported conduct a say in service now do know that very day heard first lieutenant speaking of to captain have idea how proud captain looked although pretended to care nothing about watched looked a much a to say boy well if plea will make prouder yet of if have opportunity replied that will master keene if be judge of fizonomy be way to go to parent heart make feel proud of did not forget a reader will eventually discover have written to mother giving long account of adventure not saying word of having be at chatham made suppose a did captain have be carried up to london letter reached day after one announcing safety written to by captain delmar answered by return of post thanking heaven for preservation stating how great have be anguish misery at supposed loss in latter part of letter be paragraph strange to say on night of th when be on bed in tear having just received news of loss grandmother went downstairs declares that saw ghost in little back parlour at event found insensible on floor so that must have seen something might have be frightened at nothing yet know not what to think for there be circumstance almost make believe that somebody be in house presume can prove alibi mother have be suspicious perhaps more than suspicious from disappearance of letter be convinced when replied to said alibi be easily proved by applying to master seaman of vessel on board of be old granny must have be frightened at own shadow idea of coming to house having left without seeing be rather too absurd granny must have invented story because hate thought to make do same mother may have thought did not again mention subject have however few day afterwards letter from aunt milly in laughingly told same story of granny swearing that have seen ghost at first thought be ghost since letter from captain delmar to mother have be missing be now imagined that have be here have taken possession of will tell dearest percival be sure if did play trick to granny not know may trust with of trick be not in instance to be wheedled by aunt wrote in return saying how much be amazed at grandmother telling such fib proved to most satisfactorily be in london at time supposed might have be at chatham that aunt have be requested by mother to try to find out truth be well convinced felt secret of too much importance to trust of from time subject be never mentioned believe be at last surmised that letter might have be destroyed accidentally purposely by maid servant that grandmother have be frightened at nothing at opinion more supported a maid who have taken advantage of mother retiring to room have be out gossiping declared that have not left premise three minute not soul must have come in moreover be so unlikely that must have be in chatham without being recognised by somebody grandmother shook head said nothing during canvassing of question aunt milly declared that never must have be at chatham without coming to see be opinion that servant girl have read letter when left on table have taken out to show to associate somebody who wished to have hold upon mother by possession of letter have retained think mother came to opinion at last be source of much uneasiness to dared not say word to captain delmar day expected to have offer made of returning letter upon certain sum being paid down offer be never made a letter have be sewed up by bob cross in piece of seal skin be worn round neck with ribbon with a much care a if have be supposed bit of wood of true cross possessed by old female catholic devotee long before discussion be over hm ship calliope have be ordered to sail be steering down channel before smart breeze chapter eighteen although have so much to say a to oblige to pas over without notice majority of companion think ought to dedicate one chapter to more particular description of with whom be now principally in contact on board of calliope have already spoken much of honourable captain delmar must describe more particularly when young must have be very handsome man even now although nearly fifty year of age hair whisker little mixed with grey be fine looking personage of florid complexion large blue eye nose mouth very perfect in height be full six foot walked so erect that looked even taller there be precision may say dignity in motion if turned to be slowly deliberately there be nothing like rapidity in movement on most trifling occasion wrapped up in etiquette with consequence of spanish hidalgo showed in almost action word that never forgot superiority of birth one except perhaps must ever have thought of taking liberty with for although there be pomposity about at same time be pomposity of high bred gentleman who respected expected one to do same sometimes little mirth be occasioned by extreme precision be true be whispered not boldly indulged in a to quality a officer seaman will only say that be considered more than respectable long habit of command have given fair knowledge of duty in first instance never condescended indeed must have be contrary to character to let officer seaman know whether did did not know anything about second a to moral character can only say that be very difficult to ascertain that must never do be in slightest degree derogatory to character of gentleman be most certain be so wrapped up in exclusiveness that be almost impossible to estimate feeling occasionally may say very rarely might express if did be for moment be again reserved a before that be selfish be true who be not in high rank be still more so than others not so much by nature because self be encouraged by around must easily offend pride be above being flattered in gross way really believe that person in ship for whom have least respect be obsequious mr culpepper such be honourable captain delmar mr hippesley first lieutenant be broad shouldered ungainly looking personage have more appearance of master in service than first lieutenant be thorough seaman really for first lieutenant very good natured man be requisite be to allow momentary anger to have free escape by safety valve of mouth if did not explosion be sure to be result be a use term at sea regular ship husband be to say seldom put foot on shore if did always appeared anxious to get on board again be on good term not familiar with messmate very respectful to captain there be other officer in service who must have suited captain delmar so well a mr hippesley who although might occasionally grumble at not being promoted appeared on whole to be very indifferent about matter men be partial to a always be to one who may be peculiarity be consistent nothing be more unpleasant to men than to sail under person whom to use own expression never knew where to find second third lieutenant mr percival mr weymss be young men of good family be admitted to very slight degree of familiarity with captain delmar be of gentlemanly manner good seaman kind to inferior mr culpepper purser be abomination nasty earwigging flattering bowing old rogue master mr smith be very quiet man plain unoffending perfectly master of always attentive to duty marine officer mr tusk be nonentity put into red jacket surgeon be tall very finicking sort of gentleman a to dress well informed friendly in disposition perfectly acquainted with profession messmate be most of young men of good birth with exception of tommy dott who be son of warrant officer mr green whose father be boot maker in london will not however waste reader time upon will appear when required will therefore now proceed with narrative be usually custom for midshipman to take up provision spirit beyond allowance pay purser extra sum for same mr culpepper must not permit indeed be most stingy disagreeable old fellow ever met with in service never have dinner grog enough even light sufficient for want complained to first lieutenant be not inclined to assist said have allowance be must demand that too much grog be bad for a for candle only made sit up late when ought to be in bed be moreover very strict about light being put out however be occasion of war to knife between midshipman mr culpepper be of avail must seldom trust own steward mate of main deck whenever must superintended serving out of provision mixing of grog wonder that be said to be rich man only party to whom be civil be mr hippesley first lieutenant captain of whom have power of annoying reducing profit to captain be humility expense that required be with proffered bow cheerfully submitted to gained on whole by apparent liberality a captain be rather inclined to protect in other point of service except connected with own comfort luxury many good job did mr culpepper get done for by humbly requesting obsequiously bowing have be at sea for about week be running down towards island of madeira expected to reach next morning destination be secret a captain sailed with sealed order to be opened when off island weather be very fine warm wind have fallen when at sundown high land be reported from mast head at about forty mile distant be a on former cruise signal midshipman did day duty be went down with sun kept night watch have be cogitating how must play trick to mr culpepper midshipman have often proposed that must do so have made up mind that whenever did must make confidant tommy dott often suggested idea invariably refused a secret be only secret when be known to one person for reason never consulted bob cross because knew that must have persuaded not to do so after anything be happily executed then used to confide in observed before mr culpepper wore flaxen wig felt sure from penuriousness that be not likely to have more than one on board therefore fixed upon wig a object of vengeance having made up mind on night that made island of madeira determined to put project in execution for convenience first lieutenant have small ladder went down through skylight of gun room so that must descend direct instead of going round by after hatchway entering by gun room door where sentry be placed went to hammock slept till middle watch be called then got up dressed without being perceived a soon a lieutenant of middle watch have be called by mate who lighted candle left to dress came up by after ladder watching opportunity when sentry at captain cabin door have walked forward softly descended by skylight ladder into gun room light in cabin of lieutenant who be dressing be quite sufficient heat of weather be so great that officer slept with cabin door fastened back for ventilation have therefore difficulty in putting hand on purser wig with escaped unperceived immediately turned in again to hammock to consider what must do with prize must throw overboard must stuff down pump well slip into ship copper that might re appear when pea soup be baled out dinner must put into manger forward where pig be in meantime while be considering matter midshipman of first watch came down turned in be again quiet except occasional nasal melody from heavy sleeper at last quite undecided peeped through clew of hammock to see what sentry at gun room door be about found that have sat down on chest be fast asleep knew immediately that man be in power did not fear then be that idea came into head must singe purser wig went softly to sentry light took from hook went down with into cockpit a being best place for carrying on operation wig be very greasy curl a held in candle flared up burned beautifully to within quarter of inch of caul be soon done replaced sentry light finding that gun room door be jar went in softly replaced wig where have taken from repassed sentry who be still fast asleep regained hammock intending to undress in have quite forgotten one thing be soon reminded of heard voice of officer of watch calling out to sentry at cabin door sentry what be smell of burning know sir replied sentry be just thinking of going forward for ship corporal smell have gradually ascended from cockpit now spread from deck to deck became stronger stronger gun room door sentry jumped up at voice of lieutenant called out that there be very strong smell in cockpit lieutenant mate of watch came down be immediately supposed that spirit room have caught fire for smell be really very powerful first lieutenant who have wakened up at voice be out in minute put head over cockpit ordering officer of watch to call drummer beat to quarter ran up to inform captain drummer be out in moment seizing drum hung up by mainmast ran up in shirt beat tattoo whole ship company rose up at sound knew be signal for something important beat of drum be followed up by shrill piping of boatswain mate at hatchway at moment frightened man belonging to watch cried out that ship be on fire lower deck be immediately scene of bustle confusion perhaps there be nothing more awful than alarm of fire at sea feeling that there be escape only choice being by element fire water choose to perish if be awful in daylight how much more so be to be summoned up to await such peril when have be sleeping in fancied bounty captain have hurried on clothes stood on quarter deck be apparently calm collected a usual first lieutenant carried on duty well did where be gunner mr hutt bring up key from cabin have ready for clearing magazine if required fireman get bucket to bear carpenter rig pump silence there fore aft confusion became very great there evidently be panic captain then interposed calling out to boatswain mate to send man aft on quarter deck order be obeyed men came thronging like flock of sheep huddling together breathless silence there men cried captain delmar silence say be conduct of men of war men man of sit down on deck pas word there for man to sit down order be mechanically obeyed a soon a ship company be seated captain said tell what lad be ashamed of way to put out fire be to be cool calm obeying order keeping silence now collect yourselves of for until be quiet cool will sit where be after pause of few second now men be more steady recollect be cool keep silence carpenter be pump rigged yes sir replied carpenter now fireman go for bucket let nobody else move silence not word three foremast gun main deck to quarter silence quiet if please now be steady then to quarter men wait for order be astonishing how collected ship company became by judicious conduct of captain who now continued to command when men have gone down to station directed two junior lieutenant to go examine where fire be to be careful not to lift hatch if discovered that be in spirit room have be on quarter deck time being aware of cause of course be not at alarmed have exerted very assiduously in keeping men cool quiet shoving men down who be unwilling to sit down on deck even using very roughly showing great deal more sang froid than other of officer of course be not to be wondered at mr culpepper who be most terribly alarmed have come up on deck stood trembling close to side of captain first lieutenant have pulled on wig without discovering that have be burnt a passed burnt smell be very strong indeed so thought captain first lieutenant who be waiting return of officer smell fire very strong just now said captain to first lieutenant yes sir now then be very strong replied first lieutenant purser wig be just between wonder that smelt after two three minute officer came up reported that must discover fire that there be very little smell of fire down below yet smell now said captain delmar so do sir said second lieutenant really smell stronger on deck than doe down below be very odd let continue search search be continued first lieutenant now going down after time said that strongest smell be from purser cabin mr culpepper say smell be in cabin said captain delmar go down if please may want to open locker mr culpepper who still trembled like aspen went down ladder followed in descending second ladder foot slipped fell down hatchway to lower deck hastened down after be stunned thought good opportunity to pull off wig did very dexterously concealed be taken into gun room surgeon called while walked up on deck quietly dropped wig overboard at gangway reason for doing be that having idea that trick must have created so much confusion have turned up officer men a did thought that purser wig must next morning account for smell of fire investigation take place although might not lead to discovery must certainly lead to suspicion so wig be now floating away with wig went away evidence after search of nearly hour nothing be discovered drummer be ordered to beat retreat be quiet again went to bed quite satisfied with event of night slept sleep of innocence at least slept just a soundly mysterious affair ever remained mystery only loss be purser wig be nothing a mr culpepper acknowledged that did not know what be about for knew to contrary might have thrown overboard conduct on occasion again gained great credit have be remarked by captain officer rose in estimation how might have behaved have really supposed that ship be on fire be quite affair presume not quite so fearlessly a be be resolved to take credit given to for reason be not till long while afterwards hinted secret even to bob cross chapter nineteen next morning when arrived at funchal found that order be for west indie stayed one day to take in wine then hove up anchor went on to destination soon got into trade run fast down till arrived at carlisle bay barbadoes where found admiral delivered despatch be ordered to water complete a soon a possible a be to be sent on cruise tommy dott quondam ally be in disgrace have several time during cruise proposed must join in several plot of mischief refused a did not consider quite safe be not keen fellow thought be said be up to nothing now there be fun in a there used to be be mistaken there be fun in there be also prudence from what have latterly seen of tommy dott did not think be to be trusted day after anchored at carlisle bay tommy came to said old culpepper serf out plum suet afternoon heard tell steward now think may manage to get never saw better plum on board of ship well said like raisin a well a do tommy what be plan why have got squirt old culpepper never light more than one of purser dip small candle in steward room will get down in cockpit in dark squirt at candle water will put out will send steward for light then will try get be not bad plan still refused to join in a be only work of one person not two pointed that out to agreed with saying that must do when mr culpepper went down into steward room tommy reconnoitred then came into berth filled squirt although must not join thought might a well see what be going on therefore descended cockpit ladder soon after tommy keeping out of way in foremost part of cockpit where be quite dark tommy directed squirt very dexterously hit lighted wick of solitary candle fizzed sputtered finally gave up ghost bless said mr culpepper what can be leak from seam above suppose said steward will go to gallery for light yes yes be quick said mr culpepper who remained in steward room in dark until return of steward tommy dott then slipped in softly commenced filling pocket with raisin have nearly taken in full cargo when somehow mr culpepper stepped forward from where stood touched tommy whom immediately seized cry out thief thief call sentry sentry come here sentry of gun room door went down ladder a mr culpepper dragged out tommy holding fast by hand take sentry take in charge call master at arm little thief mr dott hah well will see consequence be that mr tommy dott be handed from sentry to master at arm taken up on quarterdeck followed by mr culpepper steward there be defence excuse to be made pocket of jacket of trowsers be stuffed with raisin at bottom of pocket when be emptied by master at arm be found squirt a soon a hue cry be over party be on quarter deck a coast be clear thought might a well take advantage of therefore came out from hiding place went into steward room filled handkerchief with raisin escaped to berth unperceived so that while tommy dott be disgorging on quarter deck be gorging below mr dott be reported to captain for heinous offence in consequence be ordered below under arrest place in captain gig being filled up by so that in point of view tommy suffered reaped harvest what pleased most be that being midshipman of captain boat be of course continually in company of coxswain bob cross must not delay at present a have to record very serious adventure occurred by for long while be separated from companion shipmate in ten day sailed in search of pirate vessel be reported to have committed many dreadful excess have become terror of mercantile navy order be to proceed northward to cruise off virgin island near be said to have be last seen about three week after have left carlisle bay look out man reported two strange sail from mast head be sent up a signal mid to examine found that be schooner hove to close together one of very rakish in appearance sail in chase be made immediately came up within three mile of when one evidently pirate be in search of made sail while other remained hove to a passed vessel hove to took for granted be merchantman pirate have be plundering captain ordered one of cutter to be lowered down with midshipman boat crew to take possession of men be in boat midshipman have gone down for spy glass something else a be merely with view of ascertaining what vessel be chief object be to overtake pirate vessel to prevent delay be caused by other midshipman not being ready mr hippesley ordered to go into boat instead of a soon a be on board of schooner to make sail follow frigate captain did say be too young mr hippesley be not 'd sooner trust than many older sir be reply of first lieutenant jump in mr keene did so with telescope in hand lower away lad unhook sheer off away went frigate in pursuit of pirate vessel leaving in boat to go on board of schooner be soon alongside found that there be not soul on board of vessel what have become of crew whether have be murdered not be impossible to say there be few drop of blood on deck vessel be american bound to one of island with shingle fir plank not only be hold full fir plank be piled up on side of deck between mast to height of five six foot pirate have apparently be taking of plank on board for own use dropped boat astern let draw foresheet made sail after frigate be now more than mile from leaving very fast schooner be so over loaded that sailed very badly before evening closed in must just perceive top gallant sail of calliope above horizon thought little of a knew that a soon a have captured pirate must run back again take out there be ham other article on board for pirate have not taken everything although locker have be all broken open article be strewed about in direction in cabin on deck just before dark took bearing of frigate stood same course a be doing then sat down to plentiful meal to did justice then divided boat crew into watch went down into cabin threw on standing bed place of there be one with clothes on men who have not watch went down turned in in cuddy forward where seaman usually sleep be not till past midnight must obtain sleep heat be excessive be teased by cockroach appeared to swarm in cabin to incredible degree be constantly running over face body little thought then why swarmed recollect that dreamt of murder tossing men overboard then of vessel being on fire after felt very cool comfortable dreamed more thought that heard voice calling name appeared that did hear in sleep slept on at last turned round felt splashing a of water water coming into mouth awoke be dark quiet put hand out put into water where be be overboard jumped up in fright found that be still on standing bed place water be above mattress immediately comprehended that vessel be sinking called out there be reply turned out of bed place found up to neck in water with foot on cabin deck half swimming half floundering gained ladder went up hatchway be still quite dark must not perceive hear anybody called out there be reply then be certain that men have left vessel when round sinking have left to sink with may a well here observe that when men have found water rising upon forward have rushed on deck in panic telling man at wheel that vessel be sinking have immediately hauled up boat to save life did recollect coxswain of boat have come down in cabin by ladder called cabin be full of water receiving answer considered be drowned returned on deck boat have then shoved off be left to fate still hoped that such be not case hallooed again again in vain thought be over with be dreadful position to be in said prayer prepared to die yet thought be hard to die at fifteen year old although consider that prayer be of much efficacy for there be little resignation in praying have one good effect composed began to think whether there be chance of being saved yes there be plenty of plank on deck if be daylight must tie together make raft must bear up how longed for daylight for be afraid that vessel must sink before must see to do what be requisite wind have become much fresher during night wave now dashed against side of water logged vessel a watched for daylight began to reflect how must have happened occurred to that pirate have scuttled bottom of vessel to sink in conjecture be right at last faint light appeared in east soon broke into broad day lost time in setting about work before began however thought advisable to ascertain how much more water there be in vessel since have quitted cabin appeared to must have be about two hour therefore went down in cabin to measure know how high be when waded through found to surprise may say to joy that be not higher than be before thought that perhaps might be mistaken so marked height of water at cabin ladder sat down on deck to watch appeared to not to rise higher made reflect then struck that a vessel be laden with timber must not probably sink lower so deferred work till have ascertained fact three hour did watch found that water did not rise higher be satisfied wind increased vessel sail instead of flapping to wind a drove without one at helm be now bellied out vessel careened to leeward be afraid that must turn over finding axe on deck mounted rigging with commenced cutting away lacing of sail from mast then lowered gaff cleared away canvas in same way so that sail fell on deck be work of at least one hour when canvas be off vessel be steady be well that have taken precaution for very soon afterwards wind be much fresher weather appeared very threatening sea also rose considerably be very tired sat down for time on deck abaft then occurred to that weight of plank upon deck must not only keep vessel deeper in water make more top heavy determined to throw overboard first looked for something to eat found plenty of victual in iron pot in men have cooked supper night before a soon a have obtained from cask lashed on deck drink of water to wash down cold fried ham have eaten set work to throw overboard plank on deck when have thrown over portion from one side went to other threw over a many more might a much a possible keep vessel on even keel job occupied whole of day when have completed task examined height of water at cabin ladder found that vessel have risen more than six inch be source of great comfort to what pleased more be that wind have gone down again water be much smoother made supper off raw ham for fire have be extinguished committing to protection of heaven lay down a sun set from fatigue of day be soon in sound sleep awoke about middle of night star shone brightly there be slight ripple on water thought of mother of aunt milly of captain delmar felt for seal skin pouch be fastened round neck be safe calculated chance made up mind must be picked up by vessel before long said to myself why be better off now than be when in wherry with peggy pearson be saved then why must not be now felt desponding lay down be soon fast asleep be broad daylight when awoke took spy glass looking round horizon discovered vessel several mile off standing towards gave fresh spirit made raw breakfast drank plenty of water a before wind be very light increased little vessel came nearer made out to be schooner in two hour be close to waved hat hallooed a loud a must schooner be full of men steered close to be beautiful craft although wind be so light glided very fast through water must not help thinking that be pirate vessel frigate have be in chase of appeared a if intended to pas hallooed schooner ahoy why send boat on board must say that when idea struck that be pirate vessel heart almost failed shortly afterwards schooner rounded to lowered boat pulled to vessel boat crew be negro one of said jump in white boy next jump take be into shark mouth continued man grinning a addressed to others in boat got into boat rowed on board schooner did then think be done for for what mercy must expect being king officer from pirate word of negro convinced be a soon a be alongside of schooner ordered to go up side did with spy glass in hand leaped from gunwale down on deck found on board of armed vessel with crew wholly composed of black be rudely seized by two of who led aft to where negro stood apart from rest more fierce severe determined looking countenance never beheld be gigantic in stature limbed like farnesian hercules well boy who be said how came on board of vessel told in very few word then belong to frigate chased day before yesterday yes replied what be name calliope sail well said yes replied be fastest sailer on station be information want of boy now may go go where replied go where go overboard to be sure replied with grin heart died within mustered courage enough to say much obliged to sir 'd rather stay where be if be same to other negro laughed at reply felt little confidence at event good humour gave courage felt that being bold be only chance negro captain

about east end of island have cruised accordingly must not discover vincent threw on other sofa pretended to asleep a did not wish to enter into conversation with be too much occupied with own thought felt that there must be nothing in common between at moment be very soon asleep talked in sleep be evidently in action gave order now then speaking few word aloud then appeared a if have taken english schooner that be fulfilling vow of retaliation shuddered a heard half broken menace exulting laugh occasionally burst from lip arose watched a slept hand be continually in motion fist clenched smiled

now came into cabin for after magazine be under forepart of hatch be taken up screen let down be dark have nothing to do to catch now then command given by negro captain draw inference a to what be taking place although for first hour gained little information after time have elapsed knew what be going on voice hailing from vessel reply of stella be broadside there must be mistake in stella be then put about other broadside given without return from opponent at last came a shot whizzed over tore up planking of gunwale certainly did feel very strangely have never be in action before sensation be confess that of alarm be so mingled with curiosity a to what be going on that be impossible to say what feeling be longed to be on deck certainly must have be if have thought that be safe with pirate crew that alone prevented remained therefore in most unpleasant state of ignorance suspense broadside be now exchanged rapidly wounded brought down between deck minute told that action be

referred to stained skin presume will wear off by by will dine with to day now may go to messmate left cabin bowing very respectfully pleased with what have occurred hastened to join messmate not however until have shaken hand with bob cross who appeared a delighted to see a if be father leave reader to imagine sort of levee held on quarter deck below mr hippesley must not get of officer to mind duty certainly be for two three day greatest personage in ship after have time to tell whole of history quietly to bob cross bob cross when have heard without interruption said well master keene there be telling what man born to till after be dead then be known doe appear to that be born to something out of common here be not sixteen not only playing man part playing manfully have be put in most difficult situation always have fallen upon foot in end appear to have old head upon very young shoulder at one moment to be scampish boy full of mischief at resolute cool clever man sarcumstances say make men so appears in doe seem strange for one same lad to be stealing purser plum at one moment twisting devil of nigger pirate round finger very next then have have such escape twice reported dead at head quarter twice come to life again now master keene have very good news to tell know how high stand with captain officer there be feeling of envy against lad who go ahead a well a man blind people to real merit when be supposed to be dead gone longer in way of others then one tell real truth do assure that not only officer captain grieved most sorely at loss saw captain eye wink more than once when speaking of first lieutenant be always telling other mids that have not one worth salt now that be gone now that have come back gained so much credit for what have passed do really think that captain be proud of overheard little conversation between captain first lieutenant day came on board after have be in cabin telling adventure can say be that game be in own hand if only play card well never let captain delmar have least idea that know that have such claim upon that certainly will not replied a might check feeling towards exactly have often thought about now that like so much watch captain for sake listen particularly to what say after dinner especially when have opportunity for see when gentleman drink wine speak more freely a to what really think just a foremast men do when get grog on board greatest misfortune must happen to in position must be captain marrying having child on right side of blanket a call now have often heard captain express dislike to matrimony laugh at people getting married have pleased very much for sake master percival see man think much of marrying after forty captain must be fifty if not more yes if brother dy be very infirm man captain will then be viscount de versely inherit very large estate then will marry to have heir to title estate even if there be love in case so may replied cross there be saying still even if doe ai certain that have family chicken must not be counted before be hatched have to pray for then be that brother may prove a tough a old admiral whose sens get tired of staying longer in body leave long before hulk be worn out why do admiral live so long well suppose be for same reason that salt meat keep so much longer than fresh have be forty fifty year with salt spray washing in face wetting jacket so in time d see become a be pickled with brine talking about how long will be before get that tanning off know a captain say be to do duty while last hope wo wear off too soon spoken like midshipman now take advice although not ordered to duty come up on deck take spy glass have lost unfortunately be good glass for saved life yes turned out a good for a freemason sign be more than mr green can say think will ever make sailor 'd better bear up for clerk then might do very well for purser by by there eight bell master keene so think have better say good night chapter twenty arrow schooner have suffered very severely in contest having lost commanding officer thirteen men killed wounded indeed have not calliope be at hand be general opinion that stella must have overpowered notwithstanding that latter have lost mainmast for arrow be completely dismantled must not have be able to have made calliope sent carpenter best seaman on board to repair damage next day stood away for port royal jamaica to announce destruction of pirate vessel in morning captain delmar sent for mr keene a can not do duty for present a wish to be idle think have better pay little attention to navigation send in day work perceive suppose have never regularly gone through course of study sir replied fudge day work must be very glad to learn navigation properly so presume well then have spoken with mr smith master who have promised to give necessary instruction will commence to morrow can sit at table in fore cabin where will have nothing to distract attention may go now bowed left cabin meeting bob cross on main deck told what captain have said be glad of master keene show that captain doe now take strong interest in have never taken trouble of kind with midshipman before will be of great service to so pay attention will please captain if master give good report of who know may be sent away in prize sent with to take care of must that be capital spree next day commenced accordingly under tuition of master a have not tommy dott to play with gave satisfaction continued to do so until arrival at port royal when captain went up to admiral stating particular of action by way of sequel adventure on board of pirate vessel admiral be so much interested that requested captain delmar to bring on shore to dine with next day be still very black that made presume more interesting told story over again afforded great amusement to company particularly to lady have reason to believe that many compliment be paid behind back by admiral officer who dined there at event captain delmar be much pleased strange history soon got wind governor heard of asked captain delmar about consequence be that received invitation from governor captain delmar again informed that might tell own story did modestly a before say modestly for never be boaster at time really believe that thought much le of circumstance than did to whom narrated have at time one wish be to find favour in sight of captain delmar felt that prospect in life depended upon aware of disposition deference that expected humility have become a be habitual during time that remained at port royal continued study in cabin a captain remained almost altogether on shore found run of cabin very pleasant a have inclination to study whole of day be not sorry that tommy dott be very often companion in cabin entrance to a must not pas sentry at door obtained by climbing down mizen chain creeping into port window a soon a captain boat be seen coming off tommy be out again by port a quick a monkey be very studiously poring over right angled triangle rose of course a captain entered cabin sit down mr keene must say sit down master have reported favourably of be glad to hear of one morning when a usual tommy dott have come through port be so busily employed with caricature be making of old culpepper that captain boat came alongside without being aware of captain voice speaking to first lieutenant a be descending after ladder be first intimation received of being on board be impossible for tommy dott to escape without being seen a climbed out table be in centre of cabin be covered with blue cloth large enough for table when additional leaf be put to in present reduced size cloth fell down to deck pointed out to tommy a sentry hand upon handle of door announced immediate entrance of captain

occasion to speak to first lieutenant on important private business oblige by leaving cabin till be done may a well tell mr hippesley wish to see yes sir replied making bow leaving cabin felt very much alarmed lest tommy must be discovered in hiding place after captain have stated that have particular business with first lieutenant be duty knowing that mr dott be there to have said so hardly knew what to do how to act after be great crime a stood tommy dott have come into cabin without leave have concealed if be to allow tommy to remain there listen to important particular business evidently of secret nature must forfeit good opinion confidence of captain nevertheless be very unwilling to betray be dreadfully puzzled when went to first lieutenant perceived confusion why what be matter with mr keene look quite frightened said well sir be replied think duty to tell why be so then informed that tommy dott be under cabin table must of course hear secret communication of captain have done very right mr keene know how unpleasant be to to inform against messmate at present there be harm done then laughed said however mr dott will never know that have said anything about will frighten out of cabin for future then went down ladder into fore cabin expected that must have discovered tommy a if by accident such be not case captain have just gone into after cabin mr hippesley immediately followed shutting door informed of mr dott position why have made known captain must not help laughing a after be great offence then gave necessary information to first lieutenant walked into fore cabin first lieutenant saying if please then captain delmar will send boat immediately with letter certainly replied captain sitting down who evidently be inclined to join in joke with mr hippesley sentry send officer on deck to man jolly boat tell mr dott to come here immediately be on deck when sentry put head up ladder gave order immediately perceived plan of first lieutenant state of alarm in tommy dott must have be put jolly boat be manned mr dott called for in quarter of ship did not make appearance after delay of several minute officer on deck went down into cabin reporting that jolly boat have be manned time that mr dott be not to be found not to be found replied captain why ca have fallen overboard not sir replied first lieutenant have gone to sleep somewhere either in

keene said captain delmar sentry called made appearance mr keene will go on shore to dockyard in jolly boat give letter to master attendant wait for answer yes sir replied have seen anything of mr dott said first lieutenant be constantly together saw just before captain delmar came on board sir have not seen since well well will settle account with young gentleman a soon a turn up replied captain may go mr keene perceived that captain first lieutenant smiled a left cabin appeared that soon after left captain went on shore tommy be so frightened that remained in hiding place a made sure must be flogged if made appearance resolved to remain where be until return that might consult a soon a have reported given answer to first lieutenant hastened to cabin then poor tommy crawled from under table tear be still wet on cheek will be flogged keene a sure a stand here tell can do what can say tell truth be best way replied tell captain be hid under table must never do depend upon be best plan replied be only advice can give may be flogged if tell truth be sure to be flogged if tell lie will only add to offence well have be thinking about be sure that mr hippesley will flog if catch to day to morrow if remain hid for day two will really think have fallen overboard then will say poor tommy dott perhaps be so glad when do make appearance that will forgive yes replied delighted at idea be sure will if do tell truth when appear again then be what will do first lieutenant said that might be in spirit room where will go to why said must remain under table till dark then may easily slip down into coal hole where be so dark that never will see even if go down for coal be only place know of stay there to morrow next day come up in evening next morning perhaps will be better well be very good place replied tommy anything better than being flogged will bring something to eat drink depend upon tommy replied will contrive to bring something night well then will do

tommy have fallen overboard a shark be thick enough in port royal that be safely stowed away in one of maw will say that whole of ship company be very sorry for with exception of mr culpepper who observed that good ever came of boy who stole raisin so think that because lad steal few of confounded plum observed second lieutenant deserves to be eaten by shark if be tommy dott must haunt if must be not afraid of dead men replied mr culpepper be quiet enough perhaps so recollect make chew tobacco therefore ought to rise up in judgment against if do against one a conversation passed on quarter deck put idea in head that night went to tommy whom found terribly tired of sitting on coal brought bottle of mixed grog boiled beef biscuit consoled by telling that one be sorry at disappearance be convinced that must not be punished if told truth tommy be for leaving coal hole immediately pointed out to that captain have not be on board that that be necessary that captain must believe that have fallen overboard a well a officer compassion must not be roused tommy saw propriety of consented to remain day then told what mr culpepper have said added now tommy if mr culpepper must see by chance

without anything occurring worth relating except having captured four good prize be returning to jamaica when fell in with schooner gave intelligence of capture of island of curacao by four english frigate a be near to island short of water captain delmar resolved to touch at remained two three day reader will perhaps recollect that old dutch gentleman whose life have saved in pirate vessel have stated that name be vanderwelt that lived at curacao next evening entered harbour be astonishing to one how so strong place must have be taken by so small force commodore who have plenty of work on hand requested rather ordered captain to remain with for ten day fortnight to assist on third day after arrival obtained leave to go on shore a wished to find out old dutch gentleman a be again in captain gig have very often landed have not have opportunity of making inquiry a must not leave boat boat crew afternoon landed in gig went up through gate into town must not find anyone who spoke english at last by asking for house of mynheer vanderwelt be pointed out to went up to door be very large house with verandah round painted bright green while alternately there be several slave sitting down at entrance asked for mynheer vanderwelt stared at wondered what wanted a be in midshipman uniform be of course very civil one of beckoned to follow did be introduced to old gentleman who be sitting in cane arm chair with pipe in mouth fanned by two slave girl about twelve year old a have spoken to in english on board of pirate immediately went up to said how do do sir be very well sir replied taking pipe out of mouth what do want do come from english commodore what be pleasure sir replied come from commodore came up to see oh be replied old gentleman putting pipe in mouth again

replied turning on heel be strutting out with dignity of offended midshipman when be met face to face by little girl daughter stared at very much passed in sovereign contempt followed timidly looked into face then panting for breath seized by arm turned to at being stopped in manner be about to shake off with anything politeness when screamed out in moment have sprung up be hanging with arm round neck fader fader cried out a struggled to disengage old gentleman came out at summons stop fader let go away cried in dutch be be who child asked old gentleman pirate boy replied little girl bursting

not to blame indeed be not dear young friend must have given ten thousand rix dollar to have met might prove gratitude for noble defence of preservation at risk come sir must forgive mistake of old man who be certainly not inclined to be civil to officer who belonged to squadron who have within few day so humiliated by astonishing bravery success let little girl whose life saved persuade if can not in mean time little girl have dropped from shoulder be on floor embracing knee still sobbing felt convinced that what old gentleman said be true that have not recognised have forgotten that have be stained dark at time have met on board of stella therefore held out hand to old gentleman raising little girl three went in together to where have found old gentleman on first introduction to if knew how delighted be to see be able to express thanks said mynheer vanderwelt poor minnie too how often have talked over dreadful day wondered if ever must see again assure on honour now no longer

frigate be in port told be impossible must come a often a must obtain leave at nine o'clock bade good night be escorted to boat by six of slave carrying lantern captain delmar a well a other captain of frigate have taken up quarter on shore for harbour be so narrow landlocked that heat on board be excessive found that next day old mr vanderwelt have paid respect to captain delmar giving account of what have occurred on board of pirate much more flattering to than what have stated steward be present at time have told bob cross who communicated to mynheer vanderwelt have also begged a favour might be permitted to stay on shore with during time that frigate be in harbour to captain delmar have not consented promising however must have occasional leave when service must permit of reader may recollect that island of curacao have be surrendered to english in restored to dutch in during interval several english merchant have settled there remained after restoration now at second capture

reflection a well a appearance arrived hastened to house from have escaped so mysteriously last time be in mother threw in arm embracing then looking at with surprise pleasure three year half have changed hardly knew for association of idea have still pictured a smart stripling whom have with so much anguish consigned into hand of bob cross be proud of adventure danger conduct honourable mention in gazette be known to have be evidently congratulated by many upon successful career grandmother who have grown much older in appearance seemed to be softened towards have sense enough to receive advance with great apparent cordiality aunt captain be delighted to see found that two cousin of whose appearance have be duly apprised be very pretty child found that mother have two assistant in business everything appeared to be on grander scale more flourishing than ever first two three day be devoted to narrative communication explanation admiration a be usually case after so long absence after quietly settled down in relative position of mother son assumed rather must have assumed control over be not wish have made up mind that although clever woman must in future control took first opportunity of long tete tete to let know that such be intention speaking of captain delmar at once told that knew be father have own handwriting to prove denied at first told that denial be useless that have possession of letter have written to upon supposed death that be ghost who have frightened grandmother be first blow heavy one to poor mother for what woman can bear to be humiliated by offspring being acquainted with indiscretion loved mother must fain have spared pang have not be that future plan be based upon one point be necessary must aid abet in poor mother be bowed to earth when found that be in vain to deny parentage covered face with hand in deep shame before child consoled caressed told what really felt be indebted to for not being son of private marine at event have noble blood in vein must prove worthy of descent whether be acknowledged not from hour took command over from hour be that dictated authority a parent be gone for ever let not be imagined that treated harshly on contrary be more kind before other people more dutiful than ever be before be only confidant to only did explain reason of action be adviser advice be not that of parent that of humble devoted attached friend during remainder of day position be never altered a soon a mother have acknowledged fact there be longer reservation on part told what be conduct of captain delmar towards pointed out checking display of paternal feeling towards also certainty have that be partial to proud of explained to line of conduct have pursued be determined still to pursue towards percival said mother see judiciousness of what say of behaviour towards allow to ask be object be aiming at mean particularly aiming at of course hope to obtain advancement from interest perhaps if becomes more attached to may not forget when dy appears to that have something nearer to heart than tell be right be dear mother great end be that captain delmar must acknowledge a son fear that will never do percival indeed do think must gain by when be more advanced in world parentage may be considered a obscure still being born in wedlock will be more respectable than acknowledgment must seek from captain delmar be not aware of affront may meet with by obtaining what evidently wish once known a son of captain delmar may wish that be never promulgated be born in wedlock mother a say a many others be who now be peer of realm in virtue of being born in wedlock succeed to property to must otherwise not be entitled shame excuse for using word disgrace be equally covered by wedlock be answer to accusation of illegitimacy a to affront fear ever will from who know can defend protect be great difference to to let world suppose be son of ben marine when know to be son of future lord de versely wish to be acknowledged by captain delmar in such way a to convince world that such be fact without world being able to throw up in face be easily done if captain delmar chooses to do if done a ought to be done will lead to benefit at event will satisfy pride for feel that be not son of husband have blood boiling in vein must satisfy proudest aristocrat prefer half relation to class such a be with penalty to being supposed to be son of man whom from prudential motif alone took to be husband well percival can not blame therefore blame mother too much when consider that same feeling be cause of becoming mother far from dear mother replied only let now act in concert require assistance allow to ask one question have not realised sufficient sum of money to enable to retire from business certainly have dear percival much more than be necessary for to live in comfort may say little luxury have thought of for sake year have continued to add to profit then dear mother for sake give up business a soon a possible money be not object tell what reason be for demand dear mother will be candid with wish to retire from business leave place for distant part of england wish to change name in one word wish captain delmar must believe that be dead why so percival can not see how will benefit be on account that took charge of be not sure that may not be severed from who know that supposed death may occasion to desert altogether assist cause dear mother by what say if be on account captain delmar be friend if a say might desert when be dead supposed to be so be evident that motive of action must be fear have secret of birth supposes to be known only to to be convinced that if be supposed dead that secret be own if thought that there be proof against must then not care showing towards that regard be inclined to feel a father be now checked by pride captain delmar be naturally of kind affectionate disposition that be sure of memory must do more for than existence ever can a for rest leave to at event if must a believe will be inclined to throw off have still written acknowledgment be son to make use of in case of necessity now dear mother must consent to do a wish give up business a soon a possible retire to part of country when consider proper time to do so death will be made known to have doubt that will be afloat again in few month when be out of england will bide proper time grandmother percival must tell tell only that intend to retire from business go away from chatham say that will in future reside in devonshire ask to accompany depend upon will be pleased with intention a to what arrange relative to captain delmar say nothing to hate very name be not likely to talk about well percival will allow till to morrow to think about before give decided answer certainly dear mother wish so to do a be convinced that will agree with infinitely prefer that must decide on conviction than be induced by maternal regard a be well assured

use a seaman mr keene have behaved very prudently replied captain delmar understand motif leave rest to few minute after bob have communicated to what captain have said pressed men be ordered up ranged along quarter deck finer set of men never saw together appeared to be a afterwards proved to be prime seaman captain called one by one questioned asked to enter refused crimp begged hard to be released name be put down on ship book together captain turning to for have stood up last of row said understand officer of impress agreed to release if must tell where comrade be like losing good man

from information have received procured in course of fortnight more than two hundred good seaman of defence be most desperate fort a one crimp house after be forced must not imagine how must have be discovered put on guard on last three occasion merchant seaman be armed gave obstinate fight however although wound be occasionally severe there be loss of life having expended knowledge have nothing more to do than go on board did be kindly received by master other officer who have be prepossessed in favour such be successful result of plan crimp did not allow to go on shore discharged into gun brig captain of be notorious martinet have doubt being aware of character occupation that kept word when told captain delmar that must make ship hell to sarve right too said bob cross when heard of money that rascal obtain from seaman mr keene be quite terrible poor fellow after having earned by two three year hard work go to prison in crimp house to spend rather to be swindled out of be fellow raise such report against english navy frighten poor fellow so hear of men being flogged until die under lash lie can be invented not that master of merchant vessel be at backward in disparaging service threaten to send man on board man of war for punishment if behaves ill that be enough to raise prejudice against service now sir can safely swear that there be more cruelty oppression more ill treatment more hard work on board of merchantman than on board man of war why so because there be control over master of merchant vessel while captain of man of war be bound down by strict regulation dare not disobey see many report in newspaper of ill treatment on of merchant vessel for one be made known ninety nine be passed over for seaman have something else to do than to be kicking heel at magistrate office when get clear of vessel with pay in pocket prefers to make merry forget treatment to seeking revenge say again sarve that crimp right hope that will get lash for pound have robbed from poor seaman may a well inform reader that a be mostly case after men have be impressed nearly whole of entered service when time afterwards ascertained that be that have tricked so far from feeling ill will towards that have on first coming on board laughed very much at successful plan be more partial to than to other of officer frigate be now well manned nearly ready for sea wrote to mother enclosing head of letter to must send to captain delmar in day two received answer with copy of what have sent be to effect be now going away for second time that be possible might never see captain delmar again that wished success happiness begged in case must be called away not to forget promise to what have undergone for sake trusted entirely to that must watch over interest even more out of regard to memory than if be alive to support claim upon letter be given to captain delmar when be on quarter deck went with down below came on deck shortly afterwards looked at did not perceive that be in way put out moved by reception claim for past service whether upon country upon individual be seldom well received like payment of tavern bill after have done with enjoyment seem inclined to cavil at separate item ainsi va le monde be reported down at mutton cove that ship sailed with sealed order be to be sent to west indie captain did not expect wish a have have enough of tropic already when however opened order be found that mutton cove be correct captain instruction be to seek admiral of station with possible dispatch carried sail day night a manilla proved remarkably fast sailer be very soon in carlisle bay barbadoes where found admiral six sail of line few smaller vessel a soon a despatch be opened by admiral signal a well a of smaller vessel be made before evening have spread canvas in direction being sent to recall whole of disposable force to rendezvous at carlisle bay knew that something be in wind what have idea of order be to proceed to halifax have quick passage found two frigate there gave instruction then having remained only twenty four hour made sail together for barbadoes on arrival there round bay crowded with vessel twenty eight sail of pennant fleet of transport containing ten thousand troop three day afterwards signal be made to weigh whole fleet stood out from carlisle bay being now well known that capture of island of martinique be object of expedition on third day arrived off island troop be disembarked at two point expecting to meet with strong opposition such however to surprise be not case appeared that militia of island being composed of slave who be sent to oppose did not consider slavery be worth fighting for quite a well a liberty therefore very quietly walked home again leaving governor regular troop to decide question a to whether island be for future to belong to french english two following day there be hard fighting troop although advanced have severe loss french retired from advanced post to fort dessaix obtained possession of fort on point salamon next point to be attacked be pigeon island there navy be called into action have to get carronades mortar up hill almost inaccessible did much to surprise of troop who must hardly believe when battery opened fire after brisk cannonading of ten hour pigeon island surrendered then admiral stood into anchored fleet in fort royal bay not however in time to prevent french from setting fire to frigate be in harbour few day after town of st pierre town of fort royal surrendered fort dessaix only held out for more than week be very busy constructing battery landing cannon mortar when be ready bombardment of fort dessaix commenced five day afterwards french capitulated island be formally surrendered to english have hurried over capture a have oftentimes be described in detail can say be that be very hard work for seaman that have full share of fatigue from peculiar nature of service affair took place be of much importance to said before that sailor be employed in hard duty of getting gun etcetera on shore up to where battery be to be erected in short working like slave in heat of sun while troop remained quiet investing fort there be objection raised to seaman worked very willingly staff mounted officer of army who rode to fro giving order be not quite a civil a might be be of certain feeling of dissension ill will be created in consequence junior officer of navy lieutenant who must be spared to direct labour of seaman on shore received occasionally very harsh language from of military officer did not fail to give very prompt reply to who did not consider have right to control complaint be made to captain of men of war on being investigated result generally be that captain defended officer military gentleman obtained redress active service however did not admit of notice being taken of at time after island have surrendered unfortunate animosity be resumed few day after capture of island prisoner troop be embarked fleet sailed sufficient garrison being left upon island for defence admiral also thought proper to leave two three men of war in harbour frigate be one for first few day everything went on french inhabitant be soon on good term with ball party have commenced seaman soldier when met at liquor store began to quarrel a to branch of service have done most towards taking island will always be case with people so addicted to intoxication several severe wound be received in various skirmish took place at last seaman be interdicted from going on shore indeed a be not armed soldier carried bayonet be too unequal contest when affray took place ill will spread at last arrived to superior officer consequence be that challenge be given to one of captain of frigate by adjutant be accepted not hour after be accepted captain be taken with fever on morning of following day when duel be to have taken place be not able to quit bed military gentleman on arriving at ground found excuse instead of antagonist whether be really supposed that fever be mere excuse to avoid duel that animosity prevailing gave rise to report certain be that there be many sneer on part of military men great indignation on tart of naval officer who if must have so done must have gone on shore on purpose to insult officer must meet who wore red coat in consequence of excitement being known leave be prohibited captain delmar who be naval commanding officer have taken up quarter on shore have done all possibly must to prevent unpleasant feeling from continuing have shown great forbearance good sense so happened that being in company with of military staff observation be made in presence relative to conduct of naval captain ill with fever that must not permit gave flat denial to consequence be that language be used left alternative duel be monday night a be too late then be agreed that meeting must take place on following evening at sunset believe be proposed by captain delmar in preference to morning a knew antagonist be regular duellist wished to have next day to put affair in order previous to meeting must here observe that captain have not be on anything like intimate term with lieutenant surgeon master be old shipmate with be sociable whether be that did not choose to ask favour of commissioned officer certain be that sent for master to be second on occasion on master returning on board desired to go on shore with boat take captain pistol with not to allow to be seen by one message be also sent for surgeon to go on shore to captain when surgeon arrived at house where captain resided be ushered up sitting room be empty have put case of pistol in piece of canvas so a to look like despatch about to be sent to england uncovered placed on one of table few minute afterwards captain came out be very much surprised at appearance be very flushed heated in face appeared to tremble a walked surgeon also looked at with surprise knew to be incapable of fear yet gave appearance of person very much troubled doctor said be glad that be come feel very unwell feel pulse yes sir said doctor that certainly be have same fever on a captain w singular yes will be rather too singular doctor poor w have obloquy enough on account of illness if second captain in navy be to be obliged to send similar excuse must be at pretty discount with red coat if can do thing for do must be perfectly understood fight to morrow evening will even if be carried to ground certainly captain delmar if be possible think that little blood must be taken from immediately probably fever may subside before arm must be bound up captain became incoherent in discourse after bleeding have be performed when attempted to look at paper be so confused that found impossible be obliged to be put to bed immediately when surgeon came out of bed room said to will never get up to fight that duel depend upon fever increase may be that may never rise again fear be yellow fever bad job replied master very bad job indeed two captain in navy receiving challenge sending excuse on account of illness service will be disgraced will fight soldier will never do replied surgeon will not help captain that have sent one of officer in stead steward make bed up here in room will not leave house to night be of use staying here observed master either keene let go on board will be here early to morrow morning confounded bad job good bye master returned to boat have be reflecting good deal on disgrace must at event for certain period be thrown upon service captain delmar by unfortunate circumstance before have gone up ship side have made up mind a soon a be on board requested master to allow to speak to in cabin when be there after canvassing question pointing out to what discredit must ensue working up into great state of irritation then proposed to what considered to be best course to pursue one say how like be to captain delmar mr smith said if be own son must not be more so replied master well sir be now a tall a be colour of hair be lighter certainly captain wear wig now sir be perfectly sure that if be to put on captain uniform wig a duel be to take place in evening never must find out that be not captain a for good shot think can hit button a well a best duellist in existence master bit lip be silent for short time at last said what propose be certainly very easy why must risk life for captain delmar why did not offer to do just now for honour of service have that feeling moreover wish to serve captain delmar who have be patron what be life of midshipman worth even if be to fall nothing be true enough replied master bluntly then correcting added that be midshipman in general think may be worth something by by however keene do think on whole be very good plan if captain be not better to morrow will then consider more seriously have idea that be more likely to pin fellow than captain who although a brave man a can be have not believe fired twenty pistol in life good night hardly need say must keep secret never fear sir good night went to hammock quite overjoyed at half consent given by master to proposition must give such claim on captain delmar if survived if fell at event must cherish memory a for falling felt sure must not have presentiment probably more than buoyant hope of youth must be victor at event went to sleep very soundly did not wake until be roused up by quartermaster on following morning after breakfast master requested boat to be manned went on shore on arrival at house found surgeon in great anxiety captain be in state of delirium fever be at highest how be demanded master more likely to go out of world than to send out of replied surgeon can not well be worse be can say have be raving night have be obliged to take

replied be safest man to wait upon agree with keene send for will remain at bedside master then spoke with surgeon communicated proposition surgeon replied well from what have learned night there be person who have so great right to take place perhaps will be a well for captain sake own at event will go with in case of accident do best matter be therefore considered a arranged went into captain room be delirious constantly cry out about honour disgrace indeed there be doubt that anxiety to meet antagonist be one very great cause of fever having run so high at time changed subject then spoke of mother where be boy own boy percival said pride where be arabella must not be angry with arabella consider consequence then must burst out in such fond expression towards that tear ran down cheek a planted kiss upon forehead for be insensible must do so without offence bob cross who have for time be at bedside wiped tear from eye said master keene how man must have suffered to have cloaked feeling towards in way have done however be glad to hear if necessary will tell of ay if get seven dozen for next minute remained with bob cross at bedside for whole day during more than twenty time

who officiated for adjutant in be decided that must turn back to back with pistol ready on word make ready present fire given in succession be to turn round to other level fire made more difficult to

surgeon then informed captain of death of captain w poor fellow replied captain delmar well will not make appointment until be better captain then lay down again leaving newspaper on coverlet week now passed during captain became nearly convalescent have be out of bed have remained for few hour on sofa in respective room surgeon told that must be necessary to tell truth very soon that thought must do so on following day did however happen that discovery be not made to by surgeon in afternoon when latter be on board captain delmar felt so strong that resolved to put on clothes go into sitting room desired cross to give to first article handed to be trowsers bob quite forgot that have worn why how be said captain here be hole through waistband be bloody bob be so frightened that walked out of room a if have not heard what captain have said appears that captain took up coat discovered hole in shoulder with same mark of blood be quite dream said captain talking to have wound yet newspaper say that be wounded twice cross cross where be cross bob who have taken refuge in room where overheard everything said whispered be use now mr keene must tell never fear know how to do then obeyed

wig uniform be how be sir go on said captain well sir master must not bear sneering of sogers on shore consented that mr keene must take place did sir hope will not be angry with mr keene for be old coat sir think may have piece let in wo be seen cross then went on describing whole affair of course praising told captain everybody on board a well a on shore thought that be wounded have be taken with yellow fever that nobody knew real truth except master surgeon be mr keene seriously hurt inquired captain after pause sir doctor say will do very well be a near gone a ever man be at one time breath must not move feather blood be out of body for minute captain made reply at last said in quiet tone may leave room cross be thought feeling of captain delmar when be left to reflect upon information have received can not tell that be not angry inferred by tone in desired cross to leave room be absorbed in own feeling when surgeon entered room gave letter here be schooner just come in with despatch from admiral said surgeon second lieutenant have brought on shore for captain among letter from england found one for have seen cross continued surgeon nodding head significantly a left room second lieutenant with despatch sir reported bob cross to captain in other room will show in be not well desire to send in by replied captain while captain be busy with despatch read letter be from mother enclosing copy of one from grandmother announcing mother death of course there be great many dying wish be matter of course felt happy that letter to captain arrived at propitious time a knew that announcement of mother death must be great point in favour that ought not to have be confess knew whom have to deal with captain be ashamed of intimacy claim of mother upon not so much ashamed of now that be removed probably might not be at ashamed mother be relation below be own flesh blood half ennobled by so being captain sent on board order for getting under weigh appeared that admiral have written to desiring to sail for coast of south america to look after french frigate that a there be farther occasion for so large force at martinique be to leave next senior officer in command be captain w who have died of fever a senior in command captain delmar then filled up vacancy captain of corvette be appointed to captain w ship first lieutenant to command of corvette lieutenant vacancy be not filled up much to surprise of officer of squadron be work of afternoon in evening master be sent for consultation held with surgeon ended in captain consenting to go on board with arm in sling a if have be wounded being put into cot removed on board to captain cabin a if still too weak with fever to quit bed cross be enjoined silence be made acquainted by surgeon with result of conference next morning be embarked hove anchor up made sail to southward must be observed have seen have communication with captain during whole of time be informed by surgeon be in great distress of mind at news of mother death that recovery must be retarded in consequence chapter twenty one be not until three four day after ship have sailed from martinique that captain spoke to have during time remained in cot be hung up in fore cabin when surgeon dressed wound be only in presence of bob cross on fourth morning after sailing captain came inside of screen be hung round cot well mr keene said in very kind voice how be much better sir thank hope will look over great liberty ventured to take for honour of service why replied captain smiling think have be sufficiently punished already for temerity appreciate motive of action feel obliged to for great zeal towards service towards only objection may say annoyance have on subject be mystery secrecy compelled to be observed in consequence of taking place still more that one of seaman of ship must be party to secret certainly did not consider consequence a ought to have done sir when ventured to act a did replied say no more about mr keene be very sorry to hear of mother death be not believe unexpected sir replied therefore shock have not be so great well mr keene of course be from interest took in mother be induced to take under protection death will make difference in point so long a conduct a have hitherto done have now created strong interest for by good conduct will not lose sight of how many month have yet to serve before time be out have served five year seven month a far a can recollect so thought now mr keene be because thought of did not fill up lieutenant vacancy be made by death of captain w promotion of commander first lieutenant a soon a be well will give acting order a lieutenant of ship a be now on sort of roving commission have doubt that will have served time found mean of passing before join admiral promotion will under such circumstance be have doubt confirmed so all have to do now be to get well a fast a can good bye captain gave most gracious nod then went outside of screen giving time for thanks be indeed overjoyed not so much at promotion a at change in captain manner towards change so palpable that filled with fondest anticipation remained for long while reflecting upon future prospect a lieutenant of same ship must be more in contact with must now converse take notice of without being considered remarkable nay must be intimate with resolved to be most careful of conduct so a not to alarm pride by least familiarity hoped eventually to play card so a to obtain earnest wish felt that there be great deal of ground to go over first that greatest circumspection be necessary felt that have still to raise in opinion in opinion of world to much higher position than be in at present before must expect captain delmar must virtually acknowledge a son felt have to wade through blood stand chance of thousand of ball bullet in professional career before must do bright vista of futurity floated before in far distance felt in possession of ambition with eye still fixed upon dropped fast asleep revelling still in same dream have indulged in when awake in fortnight be quite recovered wound have healed up now walked about having have uniform altered by ship tailor procured epaulet from one of lieutenant took possession of cabin in gun room be warmly received by new messmate did not return to duty for nearly month on account of little lameness still remaining surgeon declared be often case after yellow fever ought to have observed that when mother be so indulgent a to commit suicide for sake have taken precaution letter of grandmother informed captain delmar that mother have bequeathed pound in three per cent have laid by from business therefore there be longer occasion must be expense to captain delmar must not however be supposed from grandmother stating captain delmar be at mercenary stingy on contrary considering that a second son of nobleman have only pound per annum besides pay be exceedingly liberal although not extravagant in money matter at last be well enough to return to duty glad be to be once more walking quarter deck not a before on lee on weather side with epaulet on shoulder strange to say there be not midshipman in ship although there be so many who have served so long a have in consequence there be not heart burning jealousy at promotion continued on best term with old mess mate although gradually lessening intimacy existed between be not intentional on part be effect of promotion removal from berth of set of lad to company of senior older officer be now man have feeling thought of man frolic trick be discarded with midshipman coat in respecting new rank respected now that walked on same side of deck captain delmar very often entered into conversation with although at first be with caution on part yet when found that never presumed be invariably most respectful became on much more intimate term with during three month continued cruising about without falling in with having received intelligence of french frigate be sent in quest of at last captain delmar resolved to change cruising ground ran up to ten degree of latitude further north a be running up fell in with american brig brought to boat be sent for captain who when came on board be interrogated by captain delmar a to having seen heard of french vessel on coast a conversation took place on quarter deck be officer of watch can repeat well replied american through nose reckon there be frenchman in part have fallen in with inquired captain delmar well may say have for lay alongside of in cartagena when be taking in cargo of hide have such thing a spar a will make pole top gallant mast captain have be large small well captain care whether spar be large small have two carpenter on board will soon dub down into shape inquired about vessel did not refer to spar replied captain delmar haughtily referred to spar be business not to vessel be consarn of mine replied american captain see master have want want information want spar have objection to fair swop well replied captain delmar rather amused give information will have spar be agreed send for carpenter desire to get out small spar mr said captain delmar to first lieutenant well captain that look like business so now will go on frenchman be a large a may be said looking round deck may be bit larger wo mind that suppose did leave in port when sailed reckon be off two day before how many day be since sailed just four day calculate did hear where be going to yes did have notion must put finger upon now if choosed captain have got coil of two inch must lend ai got topsail brace to reeve be very queer just now reckon have be turned end for end so often that there be end of say that know where vessel be where be captain be telling ca have two inch have not whole coil of two inch left sir said master touching hat might spare enough for pair of new brace well well be reasonable altogether if so be have got expect be very odd now ca just now remember place that french vessel be going to be slipped clean out of memory perhaps two inch might help memory replied captain mr smith let rope be got up put into boat well said american captain a say mister may help memory be not first time have freshened man memory with bit of two inch continued grinning at own joke see coming have ordered to be put in boat replied captain delmar haughtily order be not disobeyed be word doubted not by a know dare say captain be stranger to think ask much after bit of spar bit of rope just to tell where may go take fine vessel pocket nation lot of dollar a prize money well there be rope now will tell be going off berbice surinam to look after west indiaman who be on coast expected on know there will find a sure a stand here think that be bit bigger than vessel mind that dare say may go on board now sir said captain delmar well thank ye captain good luck to american captain went down side a soon a boat returned be hoisted up made sail for coast of demerara must be fine vessel said captain delmar to a be walking deck very fine vessel if be bigger than be will excuse captain delmar if venture to observe that there be expression in eye of american when said bit bigger made take into head that in saying so be only deceiving american be not very partial to must be glad of revenge may be mr keene see that can be deceiving by making out to be larger a be putting on guard have said that be smaller must then have be deceiving did not take in sense sir replied said bit bigger now ca help thinking that bit bigger be meant to deceive that will prove that frenchman be line of battle ship not frigate wished to leave under impression that be larger frigate than own more may be so replied captain delmar thoughtfully at event mr keene be obliged to for suggestion captain took two three more turn fore aft in silence then quitted deck chapter twenty two in three day have gained latitude of berbice on fourth morning men at mast head be keeping sharp look out for strange sail head be then towards land being very low must not be seen breeze be light royal have be set men piped down to breakfast when mast head man reported three sail right ahead soon made out to be merchant vessel a separated made sail from made sure that have be captured so proved when took possession of did not do of third before night fall upon interrogating prisoner few english who have be left on board prize found out that have be right in conjecture have be captured by french line of battle ship have left in shore evening before english reported very fast sailer believed to be eighty gun ship indeed french prisoner acknowledged that such be case be very important intelligence captain delmar walked up down deck in deep thought fact be be puzzled how to act to attempt to cope with force unless under peculiarly favourable circumstance must be madness to leave coast mercantile navy exposed to depredation be at same time very repulsive to feeling sense of duty prize have be manned prisoner be on board boat hoisted up manilla still remained hove to fact be captain did not know way to put ship head walked up down in deep thought mr keene be watch sir oblige by telling master to work up reckoning wish to know exactly where be be done already sir replied pricked off on chart have just left gun room then mr keene bring chart into cabin followed into cabin with chart laid down on table pointed out position of ship be right in supposition mr keene said captain really vessel turning out to be line of battle ship have put in very awkward predicament really be puzzled fighting be of use yet run away will not if can possibly help now have be studying chart have made up own mind how must have acted under circumstance have be in captain delmar position great point be to give idea without appearing to offer advice therefore replied have one advantage at event sir have be cruising so long that be flying light think draw sixteen foot water yes may give heel of in light wind certainly replied captain think can not draw le than twenty six twenty seven foot of water sir continued to put on right scent on coast will be great advantage think sir when be down below measured from sounding to sounding water be so willow deepens so gradually that there be distance of four mile between seventeen foot twenty eight foot water took up compass so a to take in two sounding laid down in chart then measuring distance showed that assertion be true captain said nothing for little while at last perceived smile on lip tell officer of watch to lower down cutter mr keene go on board of prize tell in addition to present order to follow that in case of enemy be to run a close in shore a water will allow drop anchor aye aye sir replied leaving cabin order satisfied that captain perceived what must suggest be that if once got in shore in willow water might laugh at line of battle ship in probability must not be able to get near enough to reach with gun if attempted must run on shore then must have best of a soon a have given order to prize master returned on board boat be hoisted up sail made for land at twelve o'clock sounded found ourselves in nine fathom water by calculated be about thirty mile from land hardly need say that most careful lookout be kept up that might not fall in with formidable adversary at one o'clock moon rose having middle watch surveyed horizon on side without discovering enemy at half past three day dawned before watch be over be broad daylight then just a be going down having be relieved by second lieutenant strange sail be reported about eight mile to leeward two point before beam second lieutenant hastened down to cabin to report to captain went up to mast head to make out soon discovered that be line of battle ship immediately descended reported to captain who have come on deck a must distinguish mast sail of enemy very well from deck glass be fixed upon at gang way be seen to set royal flying jib in chase of felt that be safe a must be in willow water long before must beat up to have to fear for be merchant vessel have re taken be two three mile astern of with sail that must carry be five knot breeze water quite smooth be very favourable for line of battle ship ourselves not for merchant vessel with cargo required more wind to propel through water state of affair when hand be piped to breakfast be a follows french line of battle ship have stood in for land under sail until half past seven being then a be when first saw exactly two point before beam when probably being in shoal water have tacked be now little abaft beam lying pretty well up for merchant vessel furthest astern of since have tacked have risen hull out of water so a to show upper tier of gun two of merchant vessel be about three mile astern of other one five stood fair chance of being cut off more so because when discovered enemy be standing about two point free right for coast whereas upon hauling wind in chase of course did same made approach willow water in more slanting direction consequently not get in quite so soon be now in seven fathom water by pricking off on chart about eleven mile from land be so low a to be barely visible from mast head men be allowed hour to breakfast then beat to quarter captain did not however put out fire so a to prevent ship company dinner being cooked a everything be ready magazine must be opened in minute at ten o'clock have drawn into six fathom water frenchman be now nearly astern of still on opposite tack passing about three mile to leeward of merchant vessel lagged most behind be now considered certain that must re capture vessel be at least seven mile astern of not impossible that might take one if not of others a be evident be prime sailer a fast almost a own ship at quarter past ten french line of battle ship tacked stood right after in wake being now hull down about twelve mile from will soon have starnmost vessel mr keene said bob cross to mr dott have charge of be always in scrape other yes replied get out of dare say will out of helm up there quarter master flatten in forward wind heading sir said master be full again now thus boy nothing off have broken off two point sir better replied captain be squeak for mr dott in few minute perceived that other vessel have met change in wind have broken off a well a frenchman did not now lay up for merchant vessel a did before latter have chance of escape be very exciting for a time drew nearer to noon wind became more light more variable at one time vessel broke off point shortly afterwards wind flew back again to point at first blew from enemy lay once more right up for merchant vessel french line of battle ship be still about four mile astern of merchant vessel nearest to think will have calm soon observed captain delmar square mainyard may a well be nearer to a not now for if fall calm will recapture with boat will be too far to give assistance get yard tackle up ready mr aye aye sir replied first lieutenant pipe boat crew away let get gun ammunition on gangway be about quarter to eleven when hove to breeze still continuing variable light french line of battle ship did not come up so fast a before sounded after hove to found that be in five half fathom water at twelve o'clock in consequence of having hove to relative position of vessel be a follows two merchant vessel have be about four mile astern of be now alongside of third be about three mile astern of frenchman be about same distance astern of so that frigate be about six mile from french line of battle ship captain delmar have given order to pipe to dinner at seven bell half past eleven o'clock that in case boat be required men might have dined before be sent away few minute after twelve o'clock fell dead calm hand be turned up boat hoisted out lowered down gun ammunition put in everything in readiness keeping glass upon enemy watching manoeuvring at distance be be now easily to be distinguished captain delmar be aware that ran risk in sending boat away for might so happen that breeze might spring up from seaward enemy have advantage of long before if so might bring up to vessel astern boat be captured indeed might bring up nearly alongside of before caught wind be necessary therefore to be very cautious not send boat away till last moment be before saw french ship hoisting out lowering down own that frenchman knew that boat have be hoisted out must not be doubted a eye be quite a sharp a ours however tried to double for of sudden a have glass upon french ship perceived three boat coming round quarter pulling right for merchant vessel fact be that have lowered down stern quarter boat to leeward must not perceive reported immediately to captain who ordered boat crew to be piped away who be to command boat sir said first lieutenant mr keene said captain mr keene wish to speak with before go captain delmar then walked to capstern in few word pointed out what have just stated a difficulty might occur chance of capture understand mr keene perfectly sir replied well then trust to discretion mr keene hope will not be disappointed now may go french ship be getting up yard tackle said signal man then have time to lose mr keene a for small boat be of consequence went down side shoved off men gave way cheerfully manfully three boat of frenchman have little start of in hour be within le than mile of merchant vessel french boat be nearest of two affair now became very exciting in ten minute french boat have gained merchant vessel men be clambering up side while be not more than three cable length from that tommy dott be defending be to be presumed a good deal of firing took place before must get alongside be evident that men have be mastered french be in possession of vessel now turn came dividing boat six in number into two division boarded on side very soon have regained vessel mastered french who did not amount to more than thirty five men while have more than seventy found that frenchman have not spared people on board of vessel of being wounded killed fact be that tommy dott have fought most nobly resisted to very last poor fellow lay against cap stern with head cut open by blow of cutlas quite insensible a soon a have secured prisoner turned eye to line of battle ship saw that large boat have shoved off be five in number much larger holding more men than have little reflection decided that must have better chance of resisting on board of vessel than in boat determined must get boat gun up on board of vessel arm in way be necessary however to secure boat that might not cut away from alongside therefore a soon a gun ammunition be on board lowered iron chain cable down from bow passed from one boat to other under fixed thwart of boat including captured from french hauling end of cable on board again through stern port have plenty of time to do make other preparation on board before french boat arrived be dead calm sea be like mirror advancing boat a oar rose fell in water gave idea of creature possessed of life volition a rapidly forced way through yielding fluid vessel stern be towards line of battle ship boat be pulling up little on starboard quarter gun have hoisted on board have for want of other mean be sufficiently secured by rope to slide breechings to enable to fire with effect when boat be about quarter of mile from opened fire not that expected much from gun a knew must not obtain more than two good shot at boat before be alongside still there be chance of hitting disabling chance be to be thrown away first shot be successful struck one of pinnace swamped immediately men cheered while other french boat pulled to took up men who be floating in water before must effect gun be fired with grape round apparently did execution a there appeared to be much confusion on board of two boat have gone to assistance of comrade now fully expected boat to advance on contrary spread out on quarter opened fire upon with gun very foolish act on part a gave advantage for be far superior to in number of men must have boarded at once instead of risking loss of more of boat so little did expect at one time be debating whether must not leave gun in boat alongside instead of getting on board that there might be delay in case wind sprang up be necessary that must be off of course a be be very glad that have decided otherwise action if may be so termed now continued for about hour without great casualty on side have five six men wounded on board of vessel none killed have occasionally looked round to see if there be appearance of wind just about time perceived black line in offing promised not only wind wind from very quarter must be most disastrous to began to feel very anxious when heard bugle sounded from largest french boat be signal to advance be very glad a affair must now be soon decided a boat be secured on starboard side of vessel frenchman did not attempt to board on side a in so doing must have be at double disadvantage have therefore no alternative to board together on larboard side two of boat gun have be fixed on side double shotted depressed so a to be fired at moment one of boat must pas beneath be fired at leading boat launch be very large full of men shot went through bottom did not prevent coming alongside filled sank almost immediately afterwards while men be climbing up side of vessel sinking of boat prevented men of other boat outside of from supporting companion have therefore only to meet force of launch two other boat have come alongside ahead of be in number not equal to own always have idea that french must never do much in way of boarding so proved be beat down a fast a made appearance above bulwark french lieutenant be attempting to get over gunwale be unsupported a almost men have tumbled back into sea instead of cutting down caught by collar hauled on board a soon a be disarmed gave in charge of marine in ten minute be over two of french boat remained alongside others shoved off half manned dropped astern gave three cheer a parting salutation have time to lose wind be evidently springing up fast already cat paw be to be seen here there rippling water line on horizon be now dark broad ordered boat to be ready for starting gun to be got in wounded men divided among a fast a possible two large french boat remained on starboard side cleared of men who lay in then have bottom beat out to sink french lieutenant two other officer ordered into own boat to take on board a prisoner rest of french who have be captured with wounded put into three small french boat have be captured in first attack taking away oar that when shoved off left vessel might drift about till be picked up by french ship thing being in readiness have now to decide what must do with merchant vessel wind coming up so fast from seaward gave chance of escape decided must set on fire having so done in three different part to ensure destruction then shoved off with boat having first pushed off frenchman in boat without oar wished good bye certainly did look very foolish anything pleased a pulled for frigate perceived that line of battle ship sail be filling that be touch go with also knew that must not leave boat that must take time to pick up two be half manned pulling towards other three be without oar must be picked by other boat of must occasion delay notwithstanding pulled a hard a must be halfway back before breeze be sufficiently steady to enable line of battle ship to make much progress through water of course must not well see what be going on when have pulled away in boat be at distance must see be that french line of battle ship be not yet in chase from presumed that have not yet picked up boat in meantime merchant vessel burnt furiously column of smoke very often hid enemy from view before arrived on board breeze have passed caught sail of frigate two merchant vessel so that be more easy on score captain delmar have be very anxious yard tackle stay tackle for hoisting up quarter boat be already hanging down a pulled alongside hand in boat be piped before must get up gangway there be time to be lost french line of battle ship have picked up boat be now in chase with studding sail below abaft two merchant vessel have made sail be running inshore ahead of touched hat to captain said come on board sir will see quarter boat hoisted up if please mr keene replied fact be be very easy to tell story after boat be up sail made upon frigate knew there be time for talking never witnessed rapidity a be shown on occasion in le than five minute boat be on board sail made looked at french line of battle ship be within four mile of bringing up very steady breeze be now drawing through water a re captured vessel be three mile ahead of there be nothing to fear captain delmar came aft to look at frenchman who have already passed by vessel have set on fire now then mr keene said will know what have taken place of course have seen most of narrated what reader already know what do suppose to have be loss must say three boat about forty men sir forgot sir to tell that have lieutenant two officer prisoner whom brought on board with desire to be brought on deck said captain mr keene have done work well with great gallantry great judgment touched hat not little pleased at compliment from captain delmar what be last sounding mr smith inquired captain quarter four sir said master chase wo last long observed captain take in lower studding sail french lieutenant be then questioned with exception of name of ship captain there be little to be expected from be dismissed sent below affair however be not without loss on side principally arising from tommy dott stout defence have two men killed have altogether fourteen men wounded of very severely friend tommy dott came on board miserable object face hair matted with blood when be washed away proved to be not so much hurt a be supposed cut be severe bone be not injured be very soon out of hammock again chief pleasure be to put tongue in cheek make face at french lieutenant who at last became so annoyed that complained to captain delmar who ordered mr tommy to leave off expression of national animosity if have wish to obtain promotion to return a breeze freshened french ship have first of rapidly gained upon in hour half be about three mile from have now shoaled water to three fathom half be quite near enough to ground a left four foot between keel bottom studding sail be taken in ranged cable few minute afterwards french line of battle ship be seen to shorten sail haul to wind have followed into a shoal water a far a dared to venture in a rounded to out of spite presume fired gun evening be now closing in a there be appearance of fine weather stood out till be again in four fathom then dropped anchor next morning when day broke french line of battle ship be in offing about eight mile distant may easily be imagined that french be very much annoyed at what have taken place prize re captured three boat lost ship company weakened by inferior force close to without prospect of having revenge on other hand be not very pleasantly situated be true that be safe at same time be in prison must not hope for escape unless vessel came down to assistance how long might be compelled to remain where be what chapter of accident might bring about one must foresee about eight o'clock french ship again stood in when a close a dare come to ran up down trying for deeper water on one side other in vain be within gun shot of be true a have run out into four fathom must always trip anchor when pleased stand further in at last tried shot at fell very close captain delmar did not however get under weigh stand further in although ordered capstern bar to be shipped messenger passed second third shot be fired one went over at last frenchman anchored set to work in good earnest found that be within range a did not move presumed that be in a willow water a must run into a wind be still to seaward laid head on to one of shot struck in forefoot captain delmar then ordered cable to be hove in anchor tripped by mean drifted in shore increased distance without being aware of firing still continued without injury to reason for captain delmar doing be evident wished french ship to continue firing a report of gun might be heard bring down vessel to assistance at event such be not good fortune on first day began to be tired of

freshened after sun went down remained on deck carrying on to last moment bob cross once twice ventured to say that have better reduce sail told bob that admiral be very anxious must make quick passage yes mr keene turning turtle ' be not making quick passage except to other world admiral doe not wish despatch to go there be fine boat sir there may be too much sail carried on good vessel men say never have be so pressed before well be right bob so will take little off yes sir be watch coming on now will carry can bear with safety think will go quite a fast a doe now will have more wind yet sir depend upon well so long a be fair mind how much replied send watch aft reduced sail then went down to bed at daylight awoke went on deck carpenter have watch for watch be entrusted to warrant officer who be good seaman accustomed to schooner found that wind have freshened be steady from same quarter schooner be darting through water at tremendous rate sail well mr hayter said yes sir that doe replied never sailed better than doe now be little alarmed for stick last night until shortened sail admiral order to carry press of sail mr hayter well sir then by jove obey order half frightened men although have be so long in vessel felt by what carpenter have said that have be rash bob cross must have ventured so much if have not be so understood vessel better than did so resolved to be guided by until felt able to judge for notwithstanding that sail be afterwards carried more prudently have most remarkably rapid passage for took breeze with down whole way not seeing vessel during run have cause of impatience be to ascertain if mr vanderwelt minnie have left island on arrival went first to naval commanding officer then to governor delivering credential complimented on having be so active accepted governor invitation to dinner then went to inquire after mr vanderwelt walked first to house found occupied by scotch merchant who however be very polite stated that be old friend of mr vanderwelt must give information a have received letter from very lately that in letter mr vanderwelt have informed have said in last letter to be again on west india station requested if came to island to show attention so dear sir continued mr fraser trust will enable to comply with friend mr vanderwelt injunction consider house a home during stay here thanked mr fraser accepted offer

vessel have done great deal of mischief one be french brig of fourteen gun very fast full of men have consort large schooner who be also regular clipper other vessel be brigantine very fine vessel built at baltimore of course under french colour cruise alone know how many gun carry suspect that brig will be too much for unless must catch schooner away from consort will not be able to do much with firefly will do best sir replied have very fine set of men on board think very good officer well at event if ca fight have good pair of heel to run with replied captain c dinner announced left early that might have conversation with mr fraser on return sat down to sangoree cigar then told that mr vanderwelt have left curacao about nine month before that last letter directed to have be forwarded to holland have often heard history of saving life on board of pirate vessel from mr vanderwelt who made constant theme of discourse added mr fraser know what regard have for little minnie sir inquired be now nearly five year since saw little minnie be longer little minnie mr keene can assure be fifteen when left island have grown tall very beautiful girl young men here be mad about must have followed not only to holland to end of world believe if thought that have least chance from intimacy with family tell candidly that think if be to meet again must not have bad one for talk incessantly of when alone with father must not divulge family secret fear there be little chance of meeting again with replied have to carve way up in profession war doe not appear likely to be over soon must like to see father again grant for have made few friendship during life theirs be one of most agreeable where be mr vanderwelt settled be not in holland be at hamburg well there be saying accident may bring together again a did on board of pirate hope may shortly afterwards went to bed must say description of minnie be even much more in detail than have narrated to reader did prevent going to sleep for long while woman a reader may have seen never once troubled thought have fed upon one sole absorbing idea that of being acknowledged by captain delmar be have be source spring of action be only daily object of reverie be ambition ambition in shape in direction may be led be so powerful a to swallow up other passion of human mind still have strong affection for minnie be for little minnie a saw first with beautiful large eye madonna countenance clinging to father with exception of own relation who be so much senior have have nothing to bestow affection on have not even made acquaintance may say of woman unless casual intercourse with bob cross mary indeed might be so considered passion for other sex be therefore new to although new be pleasing perhaps more pleasing from being in present case ideal for have only description of minnie a be recollection of what have be must therefore between two fill up image with what be to fancy ideal of perfection did so again again until night wore away tired out at last fell fast asleep next day after have be on board of schooner given order to bob cross returned to mr fraser sat down to write to mr vanderwelt also wrote to minnie have never done before night revery have effect on be certain for wrote long letter whereas have commenced one before arrival at curacao must have be puzzled to have made out ten line told be sitting in same chair be sleeping in same room must not look around without being reminded of dear face happy hour passed together that mr fraser have told how tall have grown be no longer little minnie used to kiss in fact wrote quite romantically a well a affectionately when read over letter wondered how be that have become so eloquent begged mr vanderwelt to write to a soon a possible tell about doings sealed letter then threw back in chair once more indulged in revery of night before have new feeling suddenly sprung up in heart threatened to be formidable rival to ambition in two day firefly be ready reported a being so to captain c gave order be to cruise for six week then to rejoin admiral at port royal unless circumstance must make think advisable to return to island boat of men of war be sent to tow out of harbour be once more on wide blue sea schooner darting along like dolphin for fortnight cruised without seeing vessel naiad be very much afraid that captain must have ordered to keep company a considered vessel quite match for brig schooner if must fall in with did not want prize money to be shared with crew of firefly allowed to go own way saying to laughingly a went over side will certainly take if meet will have to recapture well hope will not forget promise sir replied will depend upon during fortnight have be out have taken great pain in exercising men at gun great gun particularly have have excellent sight put on have not very much required during two three day calm have fired shot at mark for three four hour day found that men with little practice be very expert must hit very small object now that sight be put on gun two best shot however be gunner bob cross night after parted from naiad have run to southward having heard from captain that driver be more to northward than be there be nothing in sight on next day when evening set in wind being very light water smooth said to cross suppose furl sail at night be just a good a running about then will see if come in way will not see very good idea mr keene must keep good look out be followed up own suggestion furled sail leaving two men with officer of watch to keep sharp look out allowed rest of ship company to remain in hammock during whole of night when day broke have two look out men at mast head remained with sail furled a before for same reason that must discern vessel by sail long before must discover more thought of more convinced be of advantage to be gained by following up of plan be on exact cruising ground wished to be therefore must not do better while weather remained so fine chapter twenty four four night three day remained in way during men have nothing to do to exercise at gun of took care must have good spell on fourth night wind be little fresher water quite smooth have turned in about twelve o'clock have be asleep about hour when cross came called well cross said what be here be sir what privateer yes brig schooner coming down right before wind be on weather quarter will pas within two mile if not nearer left bed place be dressed in minute went on deck with glass directed to vessel be quite plain to naked eye put out binnacle light cross said might discover brig be headmost of two vessel be now nearly crossing stern schooner be about mile astern of turn hand up cross see ready for action making sail not yet sir surely not yet will let run two three mile dead to leeward then follow till daylight till see when of course will be after be very fortunate sir that did furl sail for have come down under sail must have seen must have be to leeward of must have given poor chance against such odds now will have weather gage may choose if heel be a good a theirs expect be if not better will fight in shape bob may depend upon of course will mr keene will disappoint ship company have confidence in can tell thanks to long yarn bob presume thanks to telling truth mr keene schooner be right astern of now so there be weather gage gone thank god remained a be till considered two vessel sufficiently to leeward sail be then set upon firefly first running to eastward so a to get right in wind eye of put helm up followed have continued course in wake for about hour when day dawned schooner who have discovered fired gun a signal to concert so have found out at last have said bob cross at event keep better look out than do old fellow shortly after gun be fired vessel hauled to wind on larboard tack did same being about four mile to windward of schooner five five half of brig must now examine adversary schooner be apparently about same tonnage a firefly very beautiful vessel with mast raking over stern be painted black must not ascertain at first how many gun carried a port be shut after short time knocked out half port to prepare for action then discovered that carried twelve gun not long gun on swivel like one on board of firefly observed to cross who replied then sir have to do now be to try rate of sailing with if be faster than be have not much to fear unless lose spar indeed be mr keene schooner have more sail on than have will set exactly same cross for think have fore reached upon already if can beat with le sail set will do just a well think that breeze be steady if anything will have more than le of for hour continued running on same tack with by time found that have not only brought schooner one point abaft beam have weathered at least mile therefore be fully satisfied that have sailed better than schooner with brig be not so although have brought schooner two point abaft beam brig be much in former position being still point abaft beam moreover have come in much closer to schooner proving that have weathered fore reached upon a near a must judge sailing with brig be much upon par having ascertained point more satisfactorily by allowing hour of trial desired men to get breakfast while officer did same a soon a be done ordered firefly to be kept away edging down till within good range of long brass thirty two pound gun be about one mile half when again hauled wind hoisted english colour tri colour be immediately thrown up by two frenchman shot be fired at by schooner fell exhausted into water about cable length from now cross said see if ca return compliment with little better success cross who have be training gun have eye on sight waited for second two fired saw shot pas through first reef of main sail dash into water to leeward of very good that cross hull if can schooner now returned fire with whole broadside apparently twelve pounder did not throw so far a long thirty two pounder shot went over although one fell close under stern at distance therefore that be have everything in favour object be to dismantle schooner before chance enabled brig to assist continued to fire at taking greatest pain in aim for next hour during ascertained that have hulled more than once have very much cut up spar rigging continued to return fire without effect one two shot hit force be so much spent by distance be propelled that did not enter side at last shot fired by gunner did job struck foremast shortly afterwards went by board firefly gave three cheer at good fortune be done for sir said cross now for brig must try what metal carry stop bit said cross must give schooner little more before get away have lowered down main sail presume intend getting up head sail so a to pay off run under lee of brig for shelter put helm up run down so a to keep schooner about two point on larboard bow get gun round pitch into a have supposed schooner got stay up from bowsprit to mainmast head hoisted fore aft sail upon that might pay off run down to consort for support a ran three foot to one now stood directly for be enabled to get close to put several shot into from long gun a advanced did not attempt to round to to give broadside raking shot must have have great effect when within mile of rounded to gave broadside for have followed further must have be closer to brig than might be agreeable indeed be nearer than thought for have continued to hug wind be so weatherly that be not more than mile to leeward of when rounded to wind again a have fore reached upon schooner be distant from about two mile a rounded to brig tacked immediately did same now have fair trial of sailing with cross let men go down get what can to eat said get up grog will have plenty of work before night be over expect must make running fight of sir expect for be too heavy for will try same way a schooner cross replied if can only knock away of spar without losing own will then be able to do something if on contrary lose spar get alongside of why then must fight to last consider schooner a own replied bob must haul down colour when longer protected by brig yes be afraid that must run away to leeward altogether see have rounded to be doubt getting up jury fore mast allowed men to remain hour at dinner then be summoned up during hour found rate of sailing between brig so nearly balanced that be impossible to say have best of now lad will wear round get little closer to fellow see what can do with men be full of spirit hope be a anxious to decide question a be in ten minute passed brig within mile on opposite tack have given long gun three time have received broadside have long twelve pounder think sir said cross smart gun at event there be fore shroud back stay gone be great matter a soon a brig be three point abaft beam tacked recommenced firing not shot be thrown away by men believe brig be hulled time be fire without effect upon rigging be much cut up several of shot have gone through sail have two men hurt be annoyed at a have surgeon on board assistant surgeon who have belonged to schooner be at hospital there be not one to replace when sailed however have one of men belonging to hospital sort of dispenser who knew very well how to manage anything be not very serious breeze have gradually died away did not go more than three mile through water a sail be much torn did not hold so good wind consequence be that distance between antagonist be by two o'clock decreased to half mile fight became very warm broadside gun be now called into play assisted very much a directed chiefly at sail rigging while long thirty two pounder be fired at hull pointed below water line have advantage in number of gun certainly large shot from long gun be more destructive about three knocked away fore topmast enabled to shoot ahead about quarter of mile increase distance be boon to for latterly have suffered very much have eight men wounded one of poor middy killed have received several shot in hull now that have increased distance have better chance a long gun be more effective than of brig at five o'clock fell dead calm vessel lay with head round compass be also in favour a must train long gun on circular bend in direction pleased brig contrived by getting sweep out of bow port to bring broadside to bear upon action continued till night closed in chapter twenty five a may be supposed men be completely worn out with fatigue excitement of day cross said there be saying how will end mr keene at event have not worst of at present bob replied wish men be not so knocked up oh a for sir will answer for that if serve out more grog make eat biscuit at tub before drink make little bit of speech that will go on for twenty four hour more if will have effect be sure will try replied will have first oh biscuit first grog next then speech afterwards fellow have not fired for last five minute perhaps wish to put off till to morrow morning will not so get up grog make pretty strong will get something to eat for have have nothing to eat day a soon a ship company have have refreshment sent for aft said lad have behaved very well be much obliged to have have hard work dare say be tired enough will tell what opinion be think that have peppered that frenchman very well be convinced that have put good many shot into between wind water now that be anxious to leave off fighting till to morrow morning that may stop leak repair damage have doubt indeed prof by having ceased to fire for very reason that want to leave off wish to go on for be much heavier armed than be sail a well if permit to get right ataunt by to morrow morning may prove very awkward customer yet now what propose be that must first get up fresh sail bend then renew action through night there will be occasion for of to be on deck will fight schooner watch watch till daylight that opinion mr keene said bob cross mine replied carpenter of mr keene replied ship company with one voice then lad let work hard when have settled that fellow will have plenty of time to sleep men now set to with good will spare sail be got up be shattered by enemy unbent replaced new sail have bent furled be dead calm then recommenced fire for be nearer to than when ceased firing must distinguish very well fired long gun four time before returned shot then opened very briskly none of shot did damage sail being furled prevented distinguishing a well a must after time manned small gun on broadside worked for large gun be so hot that be necessary to let cool before must reload at last one of shot came in through bulwark splinter wounded carpenter be not so much hurt a to oblige to leave deck bound up leg with handkerchief carpenter however be taken down below be much hurt sir said bob cross oh flesh be lacerated good deal be not very deep there be little wind springing up sir from right quarter said bob be glad to hear replied for will soon be daylight now at moment shot struck hammock rail piece of about two foot long be sent with great force against bob cross head be stunned if not worse fell immediately be severe blow to a well a to poor bob desired two of men who be abaft to take down into cabin do must for ordered men to quit broadside gun renew fire with long pounder in quarter of hour afterwards breeze came down very strong resolved to shoot ahead farther off from antagonist a must have better chance by using long gun at greater distance sail be set schooner went fast through water leaving brig who have also benefit of breeze for time firing again ceased on reflection determined must wait till daylight must appear in le than hour before renewed action contrived with difficulty for leg be so numbed that must scarcely feel that have one to go down into cabin see bob cross be recovering very wild incoherent a far a must judge skull be not injured although splinter have torn off large portion of scalp be drenched with blood at event must be of further assistance to at present must be to so regained deck sat down abaft for leg have become so painful must not stand for few minute at last day dawned must distinctly make out brig schooner be about mile half distant from brig have since wind sprung up driven mile ahead of schooner who have contrived to get up jury mast during night a must not stir without reducing after sail have close reefed main sail so that must make little progress brig be very much cut up in sail rigging saw at once have now advantage in sailing therefore wore round stood towards brig did same went down to schooner that might have support immediately recommenced firing with long gun a soon a be within mile hove to brig schooner then bore up gave broadside have just done so when midshipman who be on deck with cried out large sail coming down before wind mr keene caught up glass be sloop of war cut of sail rigging evidently english must be naiad said well be glad of will lose prize money at event require surgeon be of more consequence men who be quite tired out be in great spirit at appearance of friend brig have set studding sail have evidently seen vessel to windward be now trying to escape schooner be following a well must immediately kept away in pursuit when fired into schooner hauled down colour did not wait to take possession followed brig who appeared to sail a well off wind a did when close hauled once twice rounded to return fire afterwards continued running before wind having got two of gun aft with attempted to cut away rigging in meantime strange vessel to windward have hoisted english colour be bringing down with spanking breeze fortunately be so for fore topmast be knocked away by fire of brig now dropped fast astern have scarcely got up new fore topmast set sail again when naiad who have exchanged number with passed schooner without taking possession of be very soon not mile from in hour be alongside hailing to haul wind take possession of schooner continued in chase of brig obeyed order by time have put men on board of schooner brig have hove to hauled down colour to naiad ran down to in company with prize then sent boat requesting immediate surgical attendance naiad surgeon assistant be brought on board in one of sloop of war boat lieutenant to obtain from particular of action gave to lieutenant told that have heard firing about one o'clock in morning have in consequence bore up brig have so many shot in be making so much water that be almost afraid that must not be able to get into port be now quite faint with pain of wound exhaustion be carried below to have dressed men have be attended to be glad to hear that bob cross be in danger although wound be very severe surgeon assistant be allowed to remain on board captain of naiad sent men back manned prize giving order to keep company with a soon a wound be dressed be put into bed felt much relieved soon afterwards fell fast asleep chapter

have received from admiralty by packet relative to depredation on commerce by vessel have be enough to make saint swear now be happily disposed of have chiefly to thank for captain c informs that brig be well adapted for majesty service that schooner be old vessel admiral then left room in few minute returned with paper in hand laid upon table taking up pen signed presented to saying captain keene

promotion be confused have hoped that by continuance of good conduct might in year two obtain must receive after only one cruise in schooner be beyond imagination felt grateful a soon a be more composed returned thanks to heaven vowed eternal gratitude to admiral felt be step nearer to lord de versely thought of pleasure must give mother minnie have be alone about hour when admiral returned have just sent for old messmate of yours captain keene who be severely wounded in action with dutch frigate have now passed lord de versely recommended to a deserving young officer mr dott oh yes admiral be first acquaintance when went to sea have be to sea longer than have lost good deal of time well be going to give acting order for brig hope be good smart officer yes admiral be very good officer indeed replied laughing will oblige by not telling be to be captain till after have met ah mischief suppose if make captain of such boy a must expect be wounded men going on well sir even bob

schooner be that can not take with be right hand man owe much to will be sore blow to a well a to see want made boatswain of brig be assure admiral must be most grateful if must have kindness be always ready to promote good man recommending severe wound be sufficient will be boatswain keene be very kind sir replied hope will do justice to patronage have fear of keene know that man to work well must a far a can choose own tool mr dott be waiting now a soon a have acting order will send in to about ten minute afterwards mr tommy dott made appearance extended hand to saying in haw haw way keene dear fellow be glad to see certainly did look two three inch taller for walked almost on tiptoe glad to see tommy said well what be news nothing believe except what have brought hear have bit of brush got winged even so tommy replied pointing to wounded leg admiral have kindly asked to stay here until be better dine with to day replied tommy a for staying here must think that rather bore by bye keene what sort of craft be that diligente brig naiad took very fine craft tommy sail a well a firefly oh of course swear by own vessel there be nothing like schooner be natural enough now must say prefer something little larger therefore be not sorry have commission for new brig indeed tommy wish joy replied thank ye keene replied tommy very dignified wonder said what sort of skipper will have there be first lieutenant of naiad have good chance saw very sharp sort of gentleman carry head remarkably high wo do for will not allow captain to play trick in ship be aboard of know rule regulation of service a well a one that captain will see if attempt to go beyond tether now tommy replied know that although talk so big if have be appointed lieutenant into ship commanded by lord de versely must have be a much afraid of a lieutenant a used to be a midshipman lord de versely replied tommy who felt truth of what said be peculiar sort of man take word for tommy will find captain peculiar to one point be that expect respectful behaviour not cavilling from officer service be so peculiar that be absolutely necessary that officer must set example to men yes may be very well who know captain of brig may be young fellow who have seen no more service than perhaps not be to sea so long be reason that must not obey order indeed if not experienced ought to do can to support well

indiaman ship be evidently good deal cut up in spar rigging bob cross who be close to side when examined with glass said captain keene rascally frenchman will be off a soon a see if hoist english colour if hoist french colour may get down pin before know what be think be right bob say hoist french colour will make sure of prize then will laugh at disappointment a cross turned away to go aft

must have held out till came down a hauled down colour be taken possession of by enemy now becomes recapture expect salvage of indiaman will be of more value to than two three of such schooner that

towards two people who be object of attack one be very little man dressed in black other stout burly young fellow in shooting jacket what amused most be that stout young fellow instead of being in advance to defend one so much smaller than not only kept behind little man actually now then held by shoulder before own person a shield to ward off expected attack of vicious animal be true that little personage expostulated spoke several time in tone of command to companion word be unheeded cow advanced retreated in order have described quickened pace so a to gain rapidly upon be soon few yard from animal have stick weapon of kind still knew how to manage unruly cattle a sailor do when be sent on board ship alive indeed have more than once put into practice although with bull be not very easy matter with cow felt certain that must effect purpose animal appeared now determined to come to close quarter therefore approached until be about couple of foot from flank ready for spring in case must see turn round be too busy with party in front of at last made run stout young man pushed little man towards cow then ran for little one in attempt to recoil fell on turf cow made at sprang forward catching horn of animal farthest from in right hand at same time put left knee on horn nearest to threw weight upon so a to turn animal nose up in air seizing by nostril with other hand held head in position of course rendered animal harmless in position cow went over prostrate man without doing injury plunging capering so a to extricate from weight remained clinging to for about ten yard further when perceived stout fellow ahead who hallooed out hold tight hold tight must no longer do a be fatiguing work so a punishment for cowardice let go animal springing clear off behind cow galloping away a fast a must down lane fellow screaming running before a fast a must having thus rid myself of cow coward turned back to where other party have be left on ground found standing up looking at what be passing be not hurt sir said thanks to thanks to rascally clerk of mine who wanted to shove on cow horn to save have run for now at event replied laughing let cow loose on purpose for if have held on used strength must have brought down on side kept down oh there be break in bank have climbed up so be safe for good fright continued now have better get away ourselves for animal

help thinking that manner towards be more affectionate than have be before hauteur with civility kindness have hitherto be blended appeared to have be thrown aside presumed that lord de versely have be speaking in favour felt grateful to for kindness perhaps thought have revealed to secret of birth now considers a relation perhaps may have left more than supposed however be of little consequence

day consented after returned from shooting next day changed clothes leaving word with butler dined out took way across field be walking very quietly on grass by side of high hedge when perceived two other men on opposite side one recognised a colonel delmar other must not at first make out a approached perceived that colonel be talking with clerk of mr warden passed without notice for be very earnestly engaged in conversation what said did not know thought singular that so proud person a colonel delmar must be so engaged with inferior little reflection however made consider that there be nothing very surprising in colonel delmar entering into conversation with man in country might be talking about game hundred other thing have very friendly dinner with mr warden who after dinner gave hint must not be worse for paper signed day before did not however say anything positive a must have be breach of trust when spoke of soon being afloat again said that must not fail to watch over interest at hall during absence requested must write to consider a sincere friend of course dear captain keene expect that will at present give entire confidence trust will when know at event that will not fail to do so when advice may be of use to have debt of obligation to pay will be most happy to do so if be in power thanked mr warden for kind offer promised to avail myself of parted great friend next day friday have large addition to shooting party have not be out more than hour when a be standing near lord de versely who be re loading gun report close to be heard fell down close to

examination have have very narrow escape better part of charge of shot have entered back part of head fortunately not have penetrated through skull after tedious hour employed in extracting load head be bound up be made comfortable in bed must say that lord de versely colonel delmar vied with other in attention to latter constantly accusing a author of mischief watching by bed major part of day accident delayed departure be not until three week afterwards be sufficiently recovered to leave room in meantime lord de versely assured that be out of danger went back to london colonel however remained kindness attention have given great pleasure have become very intimate have offered to go with to portsmouth have expressed pleasure must have in company honourable miss delmar have shown greatest feeling anxiety for during illness so have mr warden who often called to see in fact found so surrounded by well wishers friend hardly regretted accident at end of fifth week be sufficiently recovered to be able to return to portsmouth where be now very anxious to arrive a circe have be launched have already received lower mast took leave of miss delmar who requested early return to madeline hall accompanied by colonel delmar be once more established at billett hotel bob cross be first who made appearance for have written to to acquaint with intended return have heard of narrow escape a have be put into newspaper information be trifling to purpose be right a to frigate sat on water like duck rigging be far advanced officer seemed of right sort be right also a to matrimonial affair wife be thing wished old gentleman be a sweet a molasses have laid keel of young cross then entered upon business gave direction a to rigging left next morning first lieutenant called to pay respect appearance conversation proved to be what have be recommended a good seaman brave man went with to dockyard to look at frigate in basin afterwards on board hulk to see other officer men who have be entered have reason to be satisfied then returned to hotel to dine with colonel delmar officer appeared to have taken strong interest in ever since accident of gun going off have so nearly be fatal to be unbounded in profession of regard must say that more gentleman like more amusing companion never met with great intimacy be established between be constantly making present of value must fain have prevented doing occasionally when be alone must hint something about family parentage be subject upon be invariably silent immediately changed conversation once only replied that father mother be dead on arrival at portsmouth found several letter waiting for among two three from mother who have seen report in newspaper of escape have have of course be excessively anxious to hear from own hand how be have thought that must have come to knowledge certainly must have written to grandmother from madeline hall imagined that knew nothing about until return to portsmouth when anxious letter proved contrary for in anxiety have quite forgotten promise that communication must be through grandmother a soon a have read letter locked up in desk hastened to reply to assuring mother of perfect restoration to health cautioned not to break through agreement have made for future pointing out to have letter be forwarded to madeline hall handwriting must have be recognised said in conclusion must say dear mother now heartily repent that must have resorted to step have done in pretending that be dead that advantage be gained by at time really believe have feeling eventually mischief may occur from hope may be mistaken if be not will only be punishment deserve for act of duplicity have repented of ever since chapter thirty seven time be now fully employed during day in fitting out frigate in evening generally dined out at admiral at officer mess received several invitation from marine mess to dine with always contrived to be engaged for be fearful that something might be said relative to putative father ben might hurt pride not that have reason to suppose that of officer must have be guilty of such rudeness a great deal of wine be drank when company be at mess there be many young men there be possible that having knowledge might in cup say something never must have done when be sober colonel very often dined there constantly asked why refused reply be certainly not truth for said be not very partial to marine officer have be three week at portsmouth when colonel delmar received letter from friend of major stapleton read aloud to at breakfast stated that major must be down at portsmouth next day requested colonel to procure good room be excellent fellow major continued colonel will be great addition to society will prevail upon to stay week ten day on return from dock yard on following day found colonel major stapleton in sitting room be introduced to be small neatly made man with handsome feature very well dressed of very fashionable appearance still there be something in eye did not please be unsettled wandering never fixed upon for more than second met with great warmth empressement shook by hand declared what pleasure have in making acquaintance sat down to dinner be very merry major have be with week when have large party to dinner wine be passed freely be more le elated major appeared particularly so very much inclined to be quarrelsome a constantly addressed to be very cautious in what said a perceived that be in humour to take offence at anything several very offensive remark be made by a if to pick quarrel between parried a well a must be making observation when major started up told that what said be lie be scoundrel for having said so now a observation be to first lieutenant be in reference to hold of frigate there must be cause for insult must only be ascribed to being in state of intoxication reply be very cool quiet major know what be saying will talk about to morrow morning then rose went to bed room whole party broke up immediately shortly afterwards colonel delmar came into room blaming major very much for conduct ascribed to intoxication said that must make send proper apology have doubt next morning when major be informed of what have done must be most anxious to offer replied that presumed so quitted room indeed so fully be convinced of in own mind gave further thought be soon fast asleep did not wake until colonel delmar entered room at late hour well colonel said dear keene said have be to major to surprise when stated to what have passed at table last night reply be that perfectly remembered about that must not retract what have said remonstrated with in vain say that be cowardly to retract that will never make apology then replied there be one step for to take a friend told so pressed very hard to acknowledge error continued steadfast in refusal then took upon to say be there a friend begged must name officer to whom might address did not right dear keene certainly be very much obliged to replied putting on dressing gown must be mad utterly positively mad exclaimed colonel delmar regret very much that have ever come here know that year ago when be younger fought two three duel rather than make apology in instance be so unprovoked have hoped that have got over nonsense obstinacy be good shot keene because be notorious one can hit man colonel be true have only fought one duel in life must make great sacrifice rather than fight alternative be left in case if blood be shed must be on head of who provoked very true replied colonel delmar biting lip only hope will be successful have particular animosity against major stapleton replied a be such good shot will in own defence take good aim at at event have sufficient acquaintance with fire arm have passed through too many bullet not to be cool collected under fire therefore consider quite match for major now colonel if will order breakfast will be down in ten minute quarter of hour a colonel be going out of room servant knocked at door said that captain green wished to speak to on particular business therefore did not hurry proceeded quietly with toilet a be well aware what particular business be that conference might last time on descending into sitting room found colonel alone well keene said everything be arranged for major be deaf to expostulation be to meet evening to avoid interference captain green have agreed to say that major have apologised be made up of course have objection to make to parted for present walking to dock yard remaining at hotel to write letter reader may think that took matter very coolly fact be have preparation to make in case of accident having wife family a to other preparation at time considered a mockery knew be about to do what be wrong to offend creator knowing sinning with eye open much a regretted that be compelled to do so be still resolved upon doing how great may be culpability in such case when be called upon to sacrifice worldly interest to be despised among men run risk of involuntarily taking person life must not pretend to judge one thing be certain that however may be judged in next world in among soldier sailor will always be considered a venial did therefore what most in profession must have done under same circumstance drove from thought a much a possible until time came to decide fate considered that must be judged by tenor of whole life that repentance under chance of death be of about same value a death bed repentance a soon a dock yard men be mustered out returned to hotel sat down to dinner with colonel have scarcely finished bottle of claret when be time to be off walked out of town to place appointed where found adversary second ground be marked out by colonel when took station found that setting sun be in eye pointed out to requested position might be changed other second heard do so very handsomely agreed that be entitled to what asked colonel immediately apologised for remissness to interest ground be then marked out in direction colonel took to place where observed that one of white washed post be exactly behind making sure mark for antagonist be not used to thing keene replied colonel delmar make strange mistake then pointed out direction must be fair for party pistol be then loaded put into hand fired at signal felt be hit adversary fell be paralysed although remained on foot must not move captain green colonel went up to where adversary lay ball have passed through chest be dead said captain green quite dead yes replied colonel delmar dear keene congratulate have killed greatest scoundrel that ever disgraced majesty uniform colonel delmar replied captain green observation might well be spared error folly die with very true captain green replied can only express surprise that colonel must have introduced to person whose memory now so bitterly assails somehow from commencement of duel colonel delmar conduct have excited suspicion hundred thing crowded into memory appeared a if illumined like flash of lightning came suddenly to conviction that be enemy not friend be bleeding fast marine who be passing be summoned body of major stapleton be carried away by one party while be committed to taken back to hotel surgeon be sent for wound be not dangerous ball have gone deep into thigh have missed vessel of magnitude be extracted be left quiet in bed colonel delmar came up to a before received profession with great coolness told that thought must be prudent of to disappear until affair have blown over declared to that must remain with at risk shortly afterwards captain green came into room said be sure captain keene will be glad to hear that major stapleton be not dead have swooned be now come to doctor think favourably of be indeed very glad captain green for have animosity against major conduct to have be quite incomprehensible after inquiry about wound expressing hope must soon be well captain green left observed that took further notice of colonel delmar than haughty salute a quitted room then to surprise colonel delmar said that upon consideration thought must be advisable for to go away for certain time agree with replied must be better said because did not wish company for at once struck a very strange that must now that major stapleton be alive promising to do well talk of departure when refused at time supposed to be killed be therefore very glad when in hour two afterwards took leave started a said for london chapter thirty eight recovery be rapid in le than fortnight be on sofa frigate be now rigged have taken in water store be reported ready for sea in month a still required about forty men to make up complement saw great deal of captain green who paid visit almost day once when conversation turned upon duel made same remark a did when colonel delmar used such harsh language over body of major stapleton yes replied captain green thought be duty to tell what colonel delmar have said be very much excited replied greatest scoundrel did say then be devil better than tempts however be in other power must get well first then will act there certainly be mystery attack be so unprovoked determination so positive have reason to suppose that colonel delmar be enemy captain keene for certainly did appear to to do must at time of duel to give advantage really have cause to suppose that have ground for being enemy can not help suspecting that for reason reason unknown be so when captain green have left tried must to find out why colonel delmar must be inimical to that be supposed heir to miss delmar knew surely leaving few thousand be not sufficient cause for man to seek life lord de versely have nothing to leave must come to conclusion be at satisfactory then thought whether must write to lord de versely tell have happened decided must not initial have be put in paper at announcement of duel have seen certainly must have written down to inquire about fact mother have so done resolved must answer letter have hitherto remained on table sent for desk when servant brought bunch of key be hanging to lock thought strange a have locked desk before went out to meet major stapleton have never sent for since return servant however must tell nothing about except that found a brought to after little time recollected that doctor have asked for pen ink to write

last dying speech cross quitted cabin followed a soon a be on deck desired first lieutenant to turn hand up send aft when be assembled with cross at head stood on one of carronades said lad have sent for because consider although gale be evidently breaking be shoaling water so fast that be in danger of going on shore before gale doe break now what intend to do a best chance be to cut away mast anchor a soon a be in six fathom water perhaps may then ride out at event must do best put trust in providence lad must be aware that in time of difficulty be important that must be cool collected that must adhere to discipline obey officer to last if everything will go wrong instead of right have proved yourselves excellent set of men be sure will continue so to do be possible may not have to cut away mast to anchor still must make preparation in case be necessary have therefore sent for to explain intention to request that will assist to best of ability feel convinced that will will do duty like british seaman be have to say lad pipe down mr cross ship company went forward in silence perceived full extent of danger first lieutenant boatswain employed portion in backing best bower anchor with sheet others roued up cable from tier coiled on main deck clear for running hand be busily employed employment made forget fear work be done silently orderly steadily in meantime have shoaled to eight fathom be now nearly three o'clock a be summer time day be long indeed when weather be fine there be little night weather be warm be in favour when everything be reported ready went round to examine ascertain if cable must run clear satisfied that be right then picked out men appointed who be most trustworthy to station of importance having so done then returned to quarter deck called up carpenter of topmen to be ready with ax to cut away mast lashing of boom boat just a order be completed gale blew fiercer than ever be now in seven fathom water pressed heavy by gale stood at break of gangway first lieutenant master by side cross little forward watching eye men in chain continued to give sounding in clear steady voice by mark seven quarter seven half six at last man in chain next to fine old forecastle man gave sounding by mark six gave with louder voice than before with sort of defiance a much a to say time be come let element do worst time be come silence fore aft man down under half deck except stationed cut away boom lashing clear boat be soon done reported now then lad be steady cut away lanyard in chain one after lanyard backstay be severed mast groaned creaked then fore mast main mast be over side almost at same time mizen followed a frigate broached to righted leaving ship deck mass of wreck confusion one be hurt from precaution have be taken mast having be cut away before rounded to to anchor a otherwise must have fallen aft not gone clear of ship stand by best bower stand clear of cable let go anchor a soon a best bower cable be nearly out sheet anchor small bower be let go at same moment result be to be ascertained chapter forty frigate be head to wind rising pitching with heavy sea not yet feeling strain of cable mast lay rolling beating alongside ship company have most of returned on deck to view impending fate carpenter who have already received order be battening down hatchway on main deck in minute frigate rode to anchor a soon a strain be on cable dipped tremendous sea broke over bow deluging fore aft nearly filling main deck washing carpenter away from half completed work second third followed rolling aft so a to almost bury vessel sweeping away men who clung to cordage gun carrying many of have quitted gangway where there be hold have repaired to main bitt behind stump of main mast even in position must not have be able to hold on if have not be for bob cross who be near who passed rope round body a be sweeping away boom boat have be cut adrift in case of ship driving on shore broadside be driven aft with last tremendous sea many men on quarter deck be crushed mangled after third sea have swept over there be pause cross said to have better go down on main deck captain keene get half port open if possible did so with great difficulty found people to help for a may be imagined confusion be now very great carpenter be again collected half port got out then battening down be completed for although continued to ship sea fore aft be not so heavy a three first have so nearly swamped again went on deck followed by cross who must not leave most of men have lashed to gun belaying pin looked in vain for first lieutenant master be standing at gangway at time of first sea breaking over be to be presumed that be washed overboard for never saw again have hardly be on deck taken old position at bitt when heavy sea again poured over boom having be cleared port on main deck open did not sweep with same force a before can not stand long bob said a clung to bitt sir cable must part with heavy strain if will drag anchor till strike on sand then will go to piece yes sir forget to get to wreck of mast if possibly can best chance will be there bad best cross however be intention reader will be surprised at having conversation with other party cross fact be that although be only occasionally that heavy sea poured over be blinded by continual spray in frigate be enveloped prevented not only from seeing own position even few foot from a if one who have not firm hold when sea poured over deck be almost certain to be washed overboard man clung to where be indeed there be not fifty men on deck for who have not be washed overboard by first sea have hastened to get under half deck many have be washed overboard in attempt most painful part be to hear moaning cry for help of poor fellow who lay jammed under heavy spar boat have be washed aft to whom be impossible to afford relief without assistance of large body of men have described since anchor be let go occurred in few minute on sudden frigate heeled over to starboard at same time sea broke over chesstree nearly drowned where be clinging a soon a pouring off of water enabled to recover speech have parted cross be over with said yes sir a soon a strike will break up in ten minute must not stay here a will part amidships felt truth of observation waiting until heavy sea have passed over contrived to gain after ladder descend a soon a be on main deck crawled to cabin seated ourselves by after gun cross having made hold on to ring bolt for with silk neck handkerchief there be many men in cabin silently waiting doom knew that be over nothing must be done yet still contrived to touch hat respectfully to a passed lad said a soon a have secured hold cable have parted ship will strike go to piece in very short time recollect that mast to leeward be best chance who be near said thank captain keene word be scarcely out of mouth when shock passed through whole vessel communicated to very heart ship have struck on sand beam timber have not ceased trembling groaning when sea struck larboard broadside throwing over on beam end so that starboard side of main deck gun be under water must be impossible after to detail what occurred in clear correct manner a noise confusion be so terrible at sea hurled against side of vessel resistance to became le what with crashing of beam breaking up of timber gun to windward a fastening gave way tumbling with tremendous crash to leeward passing through ship side occasional scream mixed with other noise pouring dashing washing of water scene be appalling at last one louder crash than of former announced that vessel have yielded to terrific force of wave have parted amidships after there be little defence against even where be clinging for water poured in a if maddened by success through passage formed by separation of vessel came bounding on a if changing direction on purpose to overwhelm a two part of vessel be thrown higher up shock be more severe indeed wave appeared to have more power than before in consequence of being so increased in weight from quantity of sand be mixed up with crash side of after part of vessel have given way heavy gun disengaged flew to leeward found without shelter from raging water part of wreck on cross be sitting be so completely on beam end that deck be within trifle of being perpendicular to walk be impossible that must do be to slide down into water to leeward little be to be gained by a there be egress therefore remained for more than hour in same position wearied with clinging continual suffocation received from wave a deluged perceived that wreck be gradually settling down deeper deeper in sand be more steady in consequence at same time wave have more power over upper part so proved for one enormous sea came in blowing up quarter deck over head tearing away planking timber hurling to leeward at event set free although exposed more than before must now see about be must see to leeward cross pointed out to mainmast tossing about in boiling water with main top now buried now rising out clear nodded head in assent made sign to say that must go first after next wave have passed over found alone a soon a have cleared eye of salt water perceived cross in surge to leeward making for floating mast gained waved hand immediately followed after short buffet gained place by side just behind main top afforded considerable shelter from sea indeed a main mast be in manner anchored by lee rigging to wreck of vessel latter served a breakwater sea be therefore comparatively smooth found position infinitely more agreeable than when be clinging on wreck must now breathe freely a be seldom be wholly under water be necessary a before to cling for life on looking round found that about twenty men be hanging on to mast many of appeared quite exhausted have not strength left to obtain more favourable berth position taken by cross be very secure being between main top catharpings water be so warm that did not feel occasional immersion five other men be close to not word be said indeed hardly recognition exchanged at time thought only of immediate preservation have little feeling for anybody else chapter forty one night be now coming on rolling wave changed from yellow tinge given by sand to green then to purple at last be black except white foaming breaker exhausted with fatigue have not be dark more than two hour when felt irresistible desire to sleep have doubt that did slumber in position half in half out of water for time for when be roused up by losing balance looked above perceived that sky be clear star shining brightly then looked around be evident that water be not so agitated a have be wind too have subsided roaring have ceased although still whistled strong cross said here be captain keene close under lee gale be broke will have fair weather before morning yes sir have thought so time thank god for mercy must trust that will not leave here to perish miserably hope not replied cross let trust in confess see little chance so have many others yet have be saved cross very true sir replied wish be daylight have however three four hour to wait during time wind gradually subsided then went down to light fitful breeze at dawn of day mast rose fell with swell of sea still heaved after late commotion without run in particular direction for be now calm have be sitting on mast with back against futtock shroud now rose up with difficulty for be sorely bruised stood upon mast clear from water to look around about thirty yard from be wreck of foremast with many men clinging to mizen mast have broken adrift fore part of frigate be several foot above water bowsprit steeved in air of after part there be three four broken timber to be seen clear of water so deep have be buried in sand cross have risen on foot be standing by when be hailed from wreck of fore mast main mast ahoy halloo replied cross have got captain on board yes replied bob alive hearty faint huzzah be return affected sensibly that men must think of when in position be soothing to feeling a looked at on other mast around calculated that there must not be more than forty men left out of such noble ship company must have wept be time for action cross said now that be calm think will be better on fore part of frigate than here half in half out of water forecastle be still remaining weather bulwark will shelter men besides if vessel must come in sight must more easily be able to make signal to attract attention very true sir replied cross a there be many men here who can not hold on much longer must try if can not haul on board do feel strong enough to swim to wreck yes quite cross then will start together sir see how matter be dropped into sea followed by cross a distance from be not forty yard soon gained wreck of fore part of frigate lee gunnel be just above water clambered over found deck still whole weather portion a white a snow quite dry gained weather bulwark looked in offing in case there must be vessel must see nothing now sir have better hail tell who can swim to come to did so six men from main mast nine from fore mast soon joined now lad said must look after who can not get here try to save get end of rope from belaying pin bend on one to then will return make men fast will haul on board be soon done cross took end in hand swam back to main mast one of top men with broken arm be first be made fast when signal be given hauled through water to wreck six seven more followed in succession two men swam back time with rope accompanied who be hauled on board that might not sink there be many more hanging to different part of main mast on examination be found to be quite dead sent on board showed symptom of life then swam to fore mast assisted who be hanging to in about two hour task be completed mustered twenty six men on wreck be glad to shelter under bulwark where lay huddled up together before noon most of poor fellow have forgotten suffering in sound sleep cross man with broken arm be only three awake latter be in too much pain to find repose moreover suffered from extreme thirst breeze now sprang up from southward cheered spirit a without wind there be little chance of receiving assistance night again came on men still slept cross laid down be glad to follow example night be cold when lay down did not yet feel much from hunger thirst when morning dawned woke in suffering not from hunger from thirst everybody cried out for water told men that talking must only make feel more advised to put shirt sleeve in mouth suck then climbed upon bulwark to see if there be anything in sight knew that greatest chance be that cutter must be looking after at same time be not yet likely that must come so near to sand have be hour on gunnel when cross came up to be banking up sir to southward hope be not going to have more bad weather have fear of gale although may have thick weather replied must be almost a bad for a must perish on wreck before be discovered be going to lower down into galley captain keene to see if can find anything fear will not be successful replied for copper range be carried away know that sir have be thinking of cook closet have built up above bowsprit know that used to stow away many thing there perhaps there may be something believe shortest way will be to go to leeward swim round to cross then left continued to look out about hour afterwards returned told that have easily opened with knife have found eight nine pound of raw potato bucketful of slush be not hungry enough to eat now sir there be enough to keep life in for three four day at least be if must get water expect will feel want of dreadfully in short time must give great deal if must only find drop to give poor fellow anderson with broken arm be terribly swelled must suffer very much did find anything in closet to put water into cross in case must get yes there be two three kid small breaker captain keene well then have better get ready for cloud rise so fast that may have rain before morning if so must not lose chance why doe look like rain sir replied cross will take one two of men with to assist in getting up watched horizon till night again set in be very faint distressed for water cool of evening somewhat relieved breeze too be fresh men have remained quietly in shade a have advised although patient evidently suffered much once more attempted to forget in repose be soundly asleep when be woke up by cross captain keene be raining will soon rain much harder now if will order men will soon collect water enough call up immediately cross must not lose providential succour may save life men be soon on alert rain came down in steady shower a soon a be wet through took off shirt dabbling into water a ran down to leeward squeezed out into mouth until want be satisfied then under direction of cross commenced filling three breaker four tub have be brought up have time to fill to spare for rain continued till morning tub breaker be securely slung under fore bitt for future use then continued to drink till must drink more chapter forty two sun rose chased away cloud heat be overpowering what must have be situation if have not pleased heaven to refresh consequence of thirst being appeased made demand for food imperative raw potato be given to man day passed so did third fourth hope began to fail when at daylight next morning spied sail to westward breeze be light vessel be evidently coming down towards before noon made out to be cutter then sat on bulwark held out white shirt a signal to attract attention when about three mile from cutter rounded to not appearing to notice for two hour be left in state of maddening anxiety suspense when at last perceived bow pay off again stood towards have at last seen a soon a have run down to within three cable length boat be lowered sent to take off in three trip be on board devoutly thanked heaven for preservation lieutenant of cutter said that at first sun prevented seeing believe be fact acknowledged that have idea that have be wrecked although thought that dryad be a have seen mast floating sending boat to look at found name on cross tree be however too much exhausted to enter into much conversation a soon a have be supplied with food be put to bed in hammock first lieutenant resigned standing bed place to long sleep recovered felt little worse for what have suffered sat down to breakfast at noon on following day with good appetite cutter have by direction shaped course for island of heligoland where must find mean of returning to england have letter for captain keene said lieutenant if be well enough to read thank mr d be now quite well will be happy to have lieutenant brought

there be three private letter from england one of be in lord de versely hand writing opened first be very kind short complaining that have not be very well lately second be from mother read contained nothing of importance then took up third have black seal opened be from mr warden acquainting that lord de versely have expired very suddenly on return from house of lord of ossification of heart in weak state blow be too much for fainted how long remained in state can not say when came to sens found still down in cabin rallied a well a must be time before must take up letter again finish stated that lordship have left personal property be that must leave that library wine be of value that there must be about thousand pound left at banker when funeral expense debt have be paid oh if must have left family name cried be all coveted father kind father may really say who will lament loss a do threw on pillow of sofa for long while shed bitter tear not unmixed must own for grief at death be increased by disappointment in having for ever lost great object of wish lieutenant of cutter came down into cabin be compelled to hide emotion complained of headache weakness collecting letter again lay down in standing bed place drawing curtain be left to own reflection there be sad tumult in mind must not keep idea upon one subject for moment be feverish excited at last head be so painful that must think more fortunately exhaustion threw again into sound sleep did not wake till next morning when did have to recollect where be what have happened knew that there be something dreadful have occurred again flashed into memory lord de versely be dead groaned fell back on pillow be very ill captain keene said voice close to opened curtain perceived that be cross who be standing by bedside be indeed cross very ill have very bad news lord de versely be dead be bad news sir replied cross very bad news worse than losing frigate captain keene must have ups down in world have have long run of good fortune must not be surprised at change be hard to lose frigate father at same time have not lost life be great mercy to be thankful for turned away for heart be full of bitterness cross perceiving mood left remained in state of indifference never rising from bed place during remainder of time be on board on second day arrived at heligoland be requested by governor to take up quarter with until opportunity occurred for return to england spirit be however so much weighed down must not rally brooded over misfortune thought that time be now come when be to meet reverse of prosperity have so long enjoyed sudden death of lord de versely at age of fifty six left without patron have destroyed hope centred in object of ambition be considered for ever lost to there be now chance of being acknowledged a member of family then loss of so fine frigate noble ship company must be honourably acquitted by court martial have not doubt have chance of future employment for now lord de versely be dead have one to support claim prospect therefore in service be gone a well a vision have indulged in dwelt with pleasure upon idea that lord de versely have left personal property proved regard wanted family name preferred that to thousand per annum second day after arrival cross called be admitted found in bad spirit tried must to rouse at last said a for loss of frigate captain keene human endeavour must have saved one must have done duty better than did a court martial will prove sir think must be proper just now to show that zeal for service be a strong a ever how be to do cross why sir know a well a do how frenchman be going to wall that have be thrashed out of russia that be retreating everywhere say that have left hamburg understand that gun brig here be going on expedition from island to morrow next day to storm battery of cuxhaven so create diversion a call very good diversion be licking french rascal now captain keene if may take liberty of saying so must not be a well to take a many of men a be able to go join storming party much better than sitting here day melancholy doing nothing be first have heard of cross be sure be correct how must hear sir shut up here seeing nobody be true enough sir be telling off men a came up think start at daylight to morrow well cross will think of let know decision if call here in hour cross left be still undecided when governor called to pay visit after first exchange of civility asked if report be true that there be expedition about to proceed to cuxhaven reply be that russian have entered hamburg french have evacuated on th that french garrison at cuxhaven be reported to be in very distressed state in consequence blazer gun brig be about to proceed to attack fort hamburg thought why minnie vanderwelt be at hamburg with father will go try if can not get to hamburg remembrance of minnie gave spur to energy created new stimulus then told governor have few men doing nothing must join to expedition serve a volunteer governor thanked for zeal left to go down communicate intention to commanding officer of gun brig who expressed most happy at assistance co operation chapter forty three a men have luggage to hamper for have just clothes stood in be not long getting ready started next morning on entering river found that french have destroyed flotilla soon afterwards be invited by people to come on shore take possession of battery french have evacuated remained with cross men on shore at cuxhaven while brig went up river in pursuit of privateer after day two tired of inactivity anxious to arrive at hamburg proposed to cross that must accompany cheerfully acceded to have drawn bill at heligoland so that be in want of money set off on expedition have not however proceeded far before be informed that road to hamburg be so full of french troop scattered about that must be impossible to gain city without made detour a knew that throat must be cut by disorganised party followed advice given to walking from village to village until have put hamburg between river when there found that must not approach imperial city be obliged to direct step more inland at last heard that inhabitant of town of lunenburg have risen driven out french garrison resolved to proceed there a be more advisable than being continually in danger of being picked up by french straggler who be committing enormity must be imagined arrived safe stated who be to authority be well received have not be there more than two day when rejoicing bragging of town people on account of late victory over french garrison be turned to consternation by intelligence that general moraud be advancing with considerable force to re take town panic be so great that idea of defence be in vain at very time be entreating to make stand french troop poured in two cuirassier galloped up seized upon cross few minute afterwards general moraud came up inquired in rough tone who be replied in french that be english officer take away said secure well will make example here sha be forgotten be taken to guard room where remained shut up for night next morning one of cuirassier looked into cell asked whether must not have something to eat cela ne vaut pa la peine mon ami vous n'aurez pa le temp pour la digestion dans une demie heure vous serez fusilles may ask english of captain keene replied cross yes be very pleasant say that be not worth while eating anything a will be shot in hour well suppose will shoot first try afterwards replied cross wo give reason suspect not cross be sorry have got into scrape a for care little about be sorry for poor jane sir replied cross owe death after be not worth making fuss about conversation be here interrupted by party of french soldier who opened door ordered to follow have not far to go for be led out to grand place before prison where found french troop drawn up general moraud with officer round standing in centre at twenty yard distance surrounded by troop did not amount to more than three hundred be thirty of principal inhabitant of town pinioned handkerchief tied over eye preparatory to being shot being terrible example that governor have threatened look cross said what handful of men frenchman have retaken town with why if have resisted might have laughed at wo laugh more expect replied bob allons said corporal to where replied to friend there replied pointing to town people who be about to be shot wish to speak to general replied resisting must go will speak to general replied pushing corporal on one side walking to where general be standing well said general fiercely wish to know sir replied by what law be guided in shooting be english officer here on duty to assist against french at most can only be prisoner of war upon what ground do order to be shot a spy replied general be spy sir be post captain in english navy who joined with seaman saved from wreck of frigate in attack upon cuxhaven there be boatswain who came up with to go to hamburg at event be fully justified in siding against french to shoot will be murder will not fail to be revenged may pas off a captain of frigate dress disproves have better information be two spy smuggler therefore will be shot tell before officer that be captain keene of circe frigate belonging to britannic majesty spy if choose to shoot now leave death to be revenged

of great disgust farewell vangilt said in french thank for interference although have not succeeded with scoundrel take away roared general at moment report of musketry be heard in dropping shot well if ever saw such bloody villain said cross take at event continued bob shying hat right into general face only wish be pounder murdering thief rage of general may easily be imagined once more gave order drawing sword in menacing way at own soldier who now forced towards part of square where other victim be collected a soon a be there wanted to blind eye that bob positively refused delay be created by resistance musketry be now approaching much nearer few second afterwards general gave order for party to advance who be to execute sentence other prisoner kneeled down cross must not while be resisting general repeated order to fire men be confused with advance of enemy impossibility to fire while cross not only resisted soldier held so fast that have party fired must have shot a well a cry to arm be given troop wheeled round in front to repel enemy loud hurrah be followed by inpouring of hundred cossack with long spear who in few second charged routed french who retreated in greatest confusion by different street led into grand place hurrah be saved cried cross snatching up musket have be dropped by soldier did same pursued retreating french till bullet through leg put stop to progress called to cross who came to assistance helped back to grand place be now clear of troop chapter forty four cossack having divided gone in pursuit of french pointed out to cross hotel
