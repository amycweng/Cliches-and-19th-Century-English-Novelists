one on be be small detached distance from others on guano be found in great profusion so hitherto have be neglected vessel have ever come near indeed other island be not to be seen from except on very clear day when appeared like cloud mist on horizon shore of island be moreover so precipitous that there be landing place eternal wash of ocean must have made almost impossible for vessel to have taken off cargo such be island upon found in company with man cabin be built of ship plank timber under shelter of cliff about fifty yard from water there be flat of about thirty yard square in front of from cliff there trickled down rill of water fell into hole dug out to collect then found way over flat to rock beneath cabin be large capable of holding many more people than have ever lived in be not too large a have to secure in provision for many month there be several bed place level with floor be rendered soft enough to lie on by being filled with feather of bird furniture there be none except two three old ax blunted with long use tin pannikin mess kid rude vessel to hold water cut out of wood on summit of island there be forest of underwood bush extended distance down ravine led from summit to shore one of most arduous task be to climb ravine collect wood fortunately fire be not often required climate be warm year round there seldom be fall of rain when did fall be generally expended on summit of island did not reach at certain period of year bird came to island in numberless quantity to breed chief resort be tolerably level ground indeed in many place be quite level with accumulation of guano ground be divided from spot where cabin be built by deep ravine on spot might perhaps contain about twenty acre more sea bird must sit upon egg not four inch apart from other whole surface of twenty acre must be completely covered with there must remain from time of laying of egg until young one be able to leave nest fly away with at season when bird be on island be gaiety

of wing in face darting beak at eye of old bird a robbed of progeny collected hundred day bore a heavy load a must carry across ravine to platform in front of cabin where busied in skinning splitting hanging out to dry in sun air of island be so pure that putrefaction ever took place during last fortnight of bird coming on island have collected sufficiency for support until return on following year a soon a be quite dry be packed up in corner of cabin for use bird be may be said only produce of island with exception of fish egg taken at time of first making nest fish be to be taken in large quantity be sufficient to put line over rock have hardly time to go down fathom before anything at end of be seized indeed mean of taking be a simple a voracity be great line be composed of sinew of leg of man of war bird a afterwards heard named a be only about foot long required great many of knotted together to make line at end of line be bait fixed over strong fish bone be fastened to line by middle half hitch of line round one end kept bone on parallel with line until bait be seized when line being tautened half hitch slipped off bone remained crossway in gullet of fish be drawn up by simple a contrivance be answered a well a best hook of have never seen one at time fish be so strong large that when be young man must not allow to attempt to catch lest must pull into water a grew bigger must master such be food from one year end to other have variety except when occasionally broiled dried bird fish upon ember instead of eating dried by sun raiment such a be be also indebted to feathered tribe for bird be skinned with feather on skin sewn together with sinew fish bone by way of needle garment be not very durable climate be so fine that did not suffer from cold at season of year used to make new dress year when bird came by time that returned have little left of last year suit fragment of might be found among rocky steep part of ravine where used to collect firing living life with so few want periodically easily supplied hardly varied from one year end to may easily be imagined that have few idea might have have more if companion have not be of such taciturn morose habit a be looked at wide ocean sky sun moon star wondering puzzled afraid to ask question ending by sleeping away large portion of existence have tool except old one be useless employment of kind there be book asked what be for what be got answer remained upon shelf for if looked at be ordered away at last regarded with sort of fear a if be kind of incomprehensible animal day be passed in idleness almost silence perhaps not dozen sentence be exchanged in twenty four hour companion always same brooding over something appeared ever to occupy thought angry if roused up from reverie

trifling have little nothing to employ about for have mean of employment seldom heard human voice became a taciturn a companion amusement be equally confined looking down into depth of ocean a lay over rocky wall girted major portion of island watching motion of finny tribe below wondering at star during night season eating sleeping thus did pas away existence without pleasure without pain a for what thought be can hardly say knowledge idea be too confined for to have food for thought be little better than beast of field who lie down on pasture after be filled there be one great source of interest however be to listen to sleeping talk of companion always looked forward to time when night fell repaired to bed must lie awake for hour listening to ejaculation murmured speech trying in vain to find out meaning in what must say gained little talked of woman appearing to be constantly with other men muttering about something have hidden away one night when moon be shining bright sat up in bed a have before said be on floor of cabin throwing aside feather upon have be lying scratched mould away below lifted up piece of board after minute replaced everything lay down again evidently be sleeping during whole time here at last be something to feed thought with have heard say in sleep that have hidden something must be hiding place what be perhaps ought here to observe feeling towards man be of positive dislike if not hatred never have received one kind word deed from must recollect harsh unfeeling towards evidently looking upon with ill will only suffering because saved trouble perhaps because wished to have living thing for companion feeling towards be reciprocated by mine towards what age be at time mother died know not have faint recollection of one who treated with kindness caress recollection became more forcible in dream when saw figure very different from that of companion female figure hanging over leading by hand how used to try to continue dream by closing eye again after have woke up yet knew not that have be brought about by dim recollection of infancy knew not that figure appeared to be shadow of mother loved dream because be treated kindly in change took place by hand of providence one day after have just laid in yearly provision of sea bird be busy arranging skin of old bird on flat rock for annual garment be joined together

ascended in air vessel approached nearer nearer until be within suppose two mile of island then fell quite calm companion threw more water on to increase smoke vessel now hauling up course perceived that there be people on board while be arranging idea a to what vessel might be companion cried out see see there be hope now confound have be here long enough hurrah for old england commenced dancing

surface of water be still cloud be not more than ten degree above horizon although be thick opaque at season of year tornado a may call visited sometimes have one sometimes more be only when gust came on that have rain below on board of vessel speak now from after knowledge did not appear to be aware of danger sail be set flapping against mast at last perceived small object close to vessel presumed be boat companion looked for be like young vessel close to old one said nothing a be watching wondering effect rising wind must have upon for observation of companion have made feel that be important after time perceived that white sail be disappearing that form of men be very busy moving on board boat went back to side of vessel fact be have not perceived squall until be too late for in moment almost saw that vessel bowed down to fury of gale after that mist be so great must see more be sending boat boy cried companion ca see replied for be hidden by wind a said tornado reached to where stood threw off leg to entrance of cabin with wind came down torrent of rain drenched cloud covered whole of firmament became dark lightning darted in direction with peal of thunder be deafening crawled into cabin into rain beat in great fury flowed out again in small river companion sat near lowering silent for two hour tornado lasted without interruption sun have set darkness be opaque be impossible to move against force of wind deluge of water descended speak did not shut eye against lightning held finger to ear to deaden noise of thunder burst upon in most awful manner companion groaned at interval whether from fear know not have fear for did not know danger that there be god to judge earth gradually fury of gale abated rain be only heavy at interval must now hear beating of wave a dashed against rock beneath sky also cleared up little must dimly discern white foam of breaker crawled out of cabin stood upon platform in front straining eye to see vessel flash of lightning for second revealed to be dismasted rolling in awful breaker bore down upon high rock not quarter of mile from there be exclaimed a disappearance of lightning left in darkness more opaque than ever be done for growled companion who be not till then aware stood by side hope time confound then continued for time to curse swear awfully a afterwards discovered for did not then know what be cursing swearing there be again said a flash of lightning revealed position of vessel yes wo be there long in five minute will be dashed to atom soul perish what be soul inquired companion gave reply will go

strong wild cloud flew fast shore of island be one mass of foam be dashed high in air fell upon black rock looked for vessel must see nothing day be evidently dawning sat down waited coming companion be apparently asleep for lay without motion noise that misfortune have happened be convinced what knew not passed long time in conjecture dividing thought between vessel at last daylight appeared weather be moderating fast although wave still beat furiously against rocky shore must see nothing of vessel descended path now slippery insecure from heavy fall of rain went a near to edge of rock a breaking billow must permit walked along occasionally drenched by spray until arrived where have last seen vessel wave be dashing tossing about a if in sport fragment of timber cask spar be must see except mast rigging lay alongside of rock sometimes appearing above on summit of wave then descending far out of sight for dared not venture near enough to edge to look over then vessel be dashed to piece a companion said thought wonder how be made remained about hour on rock then turned back to cabin found companion awake groaning heavily there be ship said nothing piece of wood floating about

again called at last cried out henniker have be ruffled by calling boy must not answer at last fairly screamed name then be silent after moment perceived that crawled out of bed place feeling by side of cabin contrived on hand knee to crawl in direction of hole into water have previously be received smiled at what knew must be disappointment when arrived there did so at last put hand to feel edge of hole then down into to feel for water when found that there be none cursed bitterly laughed at vexation then felt way down where water have fallen found that course of have be stopped dared not

bed place threw down with heavy groan chapter four then went down to water edge to see if must find anything from wreck for water be smooth longer washed over rock of island except fragment of wood perceived nothing until arrived at pool where be accustomed to bathe found that sea have thrown into two article of large dimension one be cask of size of puncheon lay in about foot of water farthest from seaward other be seaman chest what thing be did not then know wish reader to recollect that great portion of narrative be compiled from after knowledge cask be firm in sand must not move chest be floating hauled on rock without difficulty then proceeded to open be time before must discover how for have never seen lock hinge in life at last finding that lid be only portion of chest yielded contrived with piece of rock to break open found in quantity of seaman clothes upon put value of article immediately comprehended use of filled with delight there be two new tin pannikin must hold

waist other american long knife in sheath be usually worn by in belt now three four year back jackson have remains of clasp knife be there be about inch of blade remaining a may be supposed valued very much indeed miserable a article be in destitute state be invaluable knife have laid on rock when fishing have be dragged into sea a line ran out be for many day inconsolable for loss have used for cutting open bird when skinned indeed remains of knife have be always in request since loss of have have hard work to get skin off bird therefore well knew value of knife immediately secured remainder of article in chest be quite full laid upon rock with clothes to dry of most of did not know use consequently did not prize at time be not until afterwards when have taken to companion that learned value may a well here observe amongst article be two book from positive command of companion not to touch book in cabin looked upon with degree of awe hesitated upon taking in hand at last put out to dry on rock with rest of content of chest felt knife blade be sharp put lanyard of clasp knife round neck sheath knife be formidable weapon made fast round waist with piece of fishing line cut off then turned step towards cabin a night be coming on though moon be high in heaven shining brightly on return found jackson in bed place heard come in asked in quiet tone whether must bring water answered must not for what have said about what must do if got into power will tame cried be master now a will find may be replied quickly still be reason why must not let have water did ever prevent from having water never have to fetch for rejoined must not have taken trouble what trouble must take for if be blind now not must become of use to must leave to die only let live that might make work for beat cruelly be turn now be boy be master reader must remember that did not know meaning of word boy idea of be that be in opposition to master boy with have same idea a word slave be so replied calmly will not want water long there be quietness about jackson made suspect consequence be that although turned into bed place be on ground at side of cabin opposite to did not feel inclined to go to sleep remained awake thinking of what have passed be towards morning when heard move face being turned way have occasion to stir to watch motion crept very softly out of bed place towards listening advancing on knee not more than foot ten second want in grasp thought come along drew american knife from sheath without noise awaited approach smiling at surprise must meet with allowed to come right up to felt side of bed then passed right hand over to seize caught right hand with left passing knife across wrist more than half divided from arm gave shriek of surprise pain fell back have knife exclaimed with surprise holding severed wrist with other hand yes have knife more than one replied see that know how to use will come again will believe that be master if have charity mercy kill at once said a sat up in moonlight in centre of floor of cabin charity mercy said what be never heard of ala replied have showed none be judgment on judgment on for many sin lord forgive first eye now right hand useless what next o lord of heaven why other hand next replied if try again jackson made reply attempted to crawl back to bed faint with loss of blood dropped senseless on floor of cabin looked at satisfied that must make more attempt upon turned away fell fast asleep in about two hour awoke looking round perceived lying on floor where have fallen night before went to examined be asleep be dead lay in pool of blood felt be quite warm be ghastly cut on wrist thought if be dead will never tell want to know knew that bound up cut to stop blood took feather from bed put handful on wound after have done bound wrist up with piece of fishing line have taken to secure sheath knife round waist then went for water poured down throat revived opened eye where be said faintly where be why in cabin said give more water did so for did not wish to kill wanted to live to be in power after drinking water roused crawled back to bed place left then went down to bathe reader may exclaim what horrid tyrant boy be why be a bad a companion exactly be so let reader reflect be made so by education from time must first remember have be tyrannised over cuffed kicked abused ill treated have never known kindness most truly be question put by charity mercy what be never heard of american indian have kind feeling be hospitable generous yet educated to inflict receive severest torture to from enemy doe first with most savage vindictive feeling submits to latter with indifference stoicism have indeed kindlier feeling of nature exercised still change not have be from earliest infancy brought up to cruelty can not feel that be wrong now position be worse have never seen softer feeling of nature called into play knew nothing tyranny oppression hatred vengeance be therefore not surprising that when turn came did to others a have be done by jackson have excuse for treatment of whereas have excuse for retaliation did know better did not followed way of world in petty microcosm in have be placed knew not of mercy of forgiveness charity good will knew not that there be god only knew that might be right most pleasurable sensation felt be that of anxiety for vengeance combined with consciousness of power after have bathed again examined chest content looked at book without touching must know what mean thought will know thirst for knowledge be certainly most remarkable in boy of age presume for simple reason that want most what can not obtain jackson having invariably refused to enlighten on subject became most anxious impatient to satisfy longing increased with growth chapter five for three day did jackson lie on bed supplied with water did not eat anything groaned heavily at time talked much to heard ask forgiveness of god pardon for sin noted down for explanation on third day said to henniker be very ill have fever coming on from wound have given say that did not deserve for did know have treated ill that must hate question be do wish to die replied want to live answer question will do so will do so replied have done wrong will make amends do understand mean to say have be very cruel to now will do wish answer question may put to a well a can be what want replied know be wound be festering must be washed dressed feather make worse will do for thought little recollected that be still in power a must not obtain water replied yes will cord hurt must take off fetched kid of water untied cord took away feather have matted together with flow of blood then washed wound carefully looking into wound desire of information induced to say what be little white cord be cut through be sinew tendon replied by be enabled to move hand finger now be cut through will not have use of hand again stop moment said rising up have just thought of something ran down to point where chest lay took shirt from rock brought back with tearing into strip bandaged wound where did get linen said jackson told got knife there too said with sigh replied in affirmative a soon a have finished told be much easier said thank what be thank replied mean that be grateful for what have done what be grateful inquired again never said word to before ala replied have be better if have mean that feel kindly towards for having bound up wound must do thing for if have power mean that if have eyesight a have week ago be master a then be must not kick beat be kind to do understand yes replied think do if tell want to know will believe will a soon a be well enough now be too ill must wait day two till fever have left satisfied with jackson promise tended carefully washed dressed wound for two following day said that felt much better language to be so kind conciliatory hardly knew what to make of be certain that have good effect upon gradually hatred ill will bore to wore off found handling tenderly anxious not to give more pain than be necessary yet without being aware that be prompted by better feeling be on third morning that said can talk to now what do want to know want to know whole story of how came to island who father mother be why said that hated name said jackson after silence of few minute will take time must soon tell if be not for last question why hated name history of father be so mixed up with mine can not well tell one without other may a well begin with own history will be telling then tell replied tell what be not true will tell exactly what be replied jackson may a well know a not father be born in england know be country by birth also know that language talk be english did not know tell something about england before say more will not trouble reader with jackson description of england many question put to be night fall before have finished answering before be satisfied with information imparted believe that be very glad to hold tongue for complained of being tired dressed wound wetted bandage with cold water for before went to sleep can hardly describe to reader effect uninterrupted flow of language have upon be excited in very strange way for many night after must not sleep for hour may say here did not understand great proportion of meaning of word used by jackson gathered from context a must not always be interrupting be astonishing how fast idea breed idea how word meaning of did not understand when be first used became by repetition clear intelligible not that always put right construction on if did not find answer when used at time to former interpretation of must then ask obtain explanation did not however occur very often a for first night be positively almost drunk with word remained nearly whole of arranging fixing new idea have acquired feeling towards jackson also be changed be longer felt hatred ill will against be swallowed up in pleasure have afforded looked upon a treasure beyond price not that many old feeling towards returned at interval for be not so easily disposed of still must not for world have lost until have obtained from possible knowledge if wound did not look well when removed bandage be much more distressed than be indeed there be prospect of ultimately being friend from mutual dependence on other be useless on part in present destitute condition to nourish feeling of animosity against one on whose good office be now so wholly dependent on part against one who be creating for may say new world for imagination thought to dwell on on following morning jackson narrated in substance a near a can recollect a follows be not intended for sailor be taught at good school when be ten year old be put into house of business a clerk where remained at desk day long copying into ledger day book in fact writing what be required of house be connected with south american trade where be south america said have better let tell story replied

amount to about pound be not yet twenty one year of age must not receive for year mr evelyn who have till then reason to be satisfied with conduct used to joke with say that a soon a be of age must allow if chose to put money in business thus obtain small share in such be intention looked forward to bright prospect hope of one day being married to mother have doubt such must have be case have still conducted properly before be of age made very bad acquaintance soon ran into expense must not afford worst be that contracted habit of sitting up late at night drinking to excess never have since got over proved ruin then have proved ruin through life little fortune of mine not only gave consequence be cause of thinking very highly of now be more particular in attention to miss evelyn be graciously received by father neither have reason to complain of treatment from young lady a for father be quite thrown into back ground have property hope of except what might hereafter secure by diligence good conduct attention received from mr evelyn also head clerk who have idea be to be partner consequently must become superior made very melancholy unhappy for believe that then be quite a much in love with miss evelyn a be must tell that love for be unbounded well deserved happy prospect be overthrown by own folly a soon a be known that have property left to be surrounded by many others who requested to be introduced to evening be passed in what considered very good company proved very reverse by degree took to gambling after time lost more money than must afford to pay caused to have recourse to jew who advanced loan at large interest to be repaid at coming of age trying to win back money at last found indebted to jew for sum of nearly pound more that became involved more reckless became mr evelyn perceived that kept late hour looked haggard a well might indeed position have now become very awkward mr evelyn knew well sum have be left how be to account to for deficiency if proposed must put into business must be ruined in opinion never be convinced must intrust happiness of daughter to young man who have be guilty of such irregularity at same time love for

comprehension have language idea to meet yet did to certain degree comprehend saw not clearly sometimes a through mist at others through dark fog must discern little day however increased knowledge of language term gave increased knowledge of idea gained more by context than did by other mean a be by degree enlightened so thirst for information knowledge became day more insatiable that much that considered understood be erroneous be certain for mine be knowledge a yet of theory only must imagine to a far a explanation received what object might be having made up idea on matter be content further knowledge must however incline to think occasionally to decide that idea have formed be incorrect must alter thus did flounder about in sea of uncertainty still of exciting interest if one who have be educated have used eye in civilised country read account of people thing hitherto unknown to can from description from own general knowledge form very correct idea of what country contains then have used eye have seen object between parallel difference have be pointed out now have not that advantage have seen nothing sea rock sea bird have one companion here be great difficulty may say be never surmounted until have visited mixed with civilisation men difficulty however only increased ardour be naturally of ingenious mind have remarkable memory increase of knowledge be to source of delight in fact have now something to live for before have not verily believe that if jackson have be by chance removed from at particular time must soon have become lunatic from sudden drying up of well supplied inordinate thirst for knowledge day passed before asked jackson to continue narrative during lived in great harmony whether be that be deceiving commanding temper till have opportunity of revenge whether be that forlorn helpless condition have softened down must not say appeared gradually to be forming attachment to be however on guard at time wounded wrist have now healed up hand be quite useless a tendon have be severed have therefore le to fear from than before at request that must continue history jackson related a follows after sailing in vessel after vessel generally dismissed after voyage for failing of intemperance embarked on board ship bound to chili after having be on coast for nearly year be about to proceed home with cargo when anchored at valdivia previous to homeward voyage a have few article to ship at port be again ready for sea when heard from captain that have agreed to take two passenger gentleman wife who wished to proceed to england cabin be

with luggage on arrival on board be so drunk that captain must not allow to return in boat knew nothing of what have passed until be roused up next morning to assist in getting ship under weigh have be under weigh two three hour be clearing land fast when gentleman passenger came on deck be then coiling down rope on quarter deck a passed by looked at recognised immediately a father year have passed from stripling have grown man face be not to be mistaken there be apparently gentleman of property consideration be drunken sailor hoped be that must not recognise shortly afterwards went down again returned escorting wife on deck again took furtive curious glance perceived at once that be that miss evelyn whom have once so loved by folly have lost be madness a stood on deck enjoying cool sea breeze for weather be delightfully fine captain came up joined be so confused at discovery that knew not what be about presume be doing something very awkwardly for captain said to jackson what be about drunken hound suppose be not sober yet at mention of name father mother looked at a lifted up head to reply to captain eyed earnestly then spoke to other in low tone after interrogated captain must not hear what said be certain be talking about that have suspected if have not recognised be ready to sink to deck at same time felt hatred of father enter heart of during life never must divest be a supposed father have recognised following morning came up to a be leaning over gunwale amid ship addressed jackson ' said be sorry to find in situation must have be very unfortunate to have become so reduced if will confide history to perhaps may when arrive in england be able to assist really will give great pleasure ' can not say that replied very cordially mr henniker ' said have be fortunate by appearance can therefore afford compassion to who have not be so sir in position feel a if pity be in reality sort of triumph offer of assistance insult be content with present position will at event not change by interference earn bread honestly can do more time may change yet be long road have turning to wish good morning ' so saying turned from walked away forward with heart full of bitterness anger from hour never spoke to noticed again captain be more severe upon ascribed severity most unjustly to father be about to go round cape horn when gale from se came on ended in loss of vessel for several day strove up against at last vessel be old leaked so much from straining that be obliged to bear up run before did for several day wind sea continuing without intermission at last found among island be compelled occasionally to haul to wind to clear made leak more more until at last became water logged be forced to abandon in haste during night having time to take anything with left three men on board who be down below by mercy of heaven ran boat into opening below be only spot where must have landed think have better stop now a have good deal to tell yet do then replied now think of will bring up chest thing be in will tell what be went down returned with clothes linen there be eight pair of trouser nine shirt besides one have torn up to bandage wound with two pair of blue trouser two jacket four white duck frock shoe stocking jackson felt one by one with hand told what be how worn why wear of inquired if will give leave will replied let have duck frock

spy glass ala be blind will show how to use at event here be two book said give to said let feel one be bible be quite sure by shape other be think prayer book what be bible what be prayer book replied bible be word of god prayer book teach how to pray to who be god have often heard say o god ' god damn ' who be will tell to night before go to sleep replied jackson gravely very well will remind have found little box inside chest be full of manner of little thing string sinew let feel put bundle into hand be needle thread for making mending clothes will be useful by bye at last whole content of chest be overhauled explained must not well comprehend glass bottle how be made put with pannikin everything else very carefully into chest again hauled chest to further end of cabin out of way before went to bed that night jackson have to explain to who god be a be only commencement of several conversation on subject will not at present trouble reader with what passed between jackson appeared to be very melancholy after conversation have have on religious matter be frequently agitated muttering to chapter seven did not on following day ask to resume narrative relative to father mother a perceived that avoided already have so far changed a to have consideration for feeling point have now taken possession of mind be whether be possible to learn to read book have found in chest be first question put to jackson when arose on morning how be possible replied be not blind how can teach be there way replied mournfully let think yes perhaps there be way at event will try know book told be prayer book oh small thin one yes fetch here now said when put into hand tell be there straight line down middle of page of book so that word letter be on side of yes there be replied in page a call there be black line down middle word letter suppose be on side among letter there be larger than others especially at side nearest to margin know what margin be mean here replied pointing to margin of page yes there be well then will open book a near a can guess at morning service tell if can find part of writing appears to begin with large round letter like what will say bottom of pannikin there be one on leaf quite round very well now get small piece of stick make point to did so jackson swept away small place on floor of cabin now said there be many other prayer begin with round o a letter be called so must first ascertain if one be one require if be know by heart by will be able to teach letter of alphabet what be alphabet alphabet be number of letter invented to enable to read write there be twenty six of now look frank be next letter to o shape of drew with pointed letter u on ground yes be replied next be like continued drawing letter r after have smoothed ground effaced u yes replied well then to make sure have better go on be one word then there be little space between next come to f yes replied looking at what have drawn comparing with letter in book then believe that be right to make sure will go on for little longer jackson then completed word father art that followed then be satisfied now said out of prayer can teach letter if pay attention will learn to read whole morning be passed in telling different letter very soon knew during day lord prayer be gone through a learnt word a well a letter must repeat before night read over to twenty thirty time spelling word letter by letter until be perfect be first lesson why be called lord prayer said because when lord jesus christ be asked by follower in what way ought to address god gave prayer to repeat a being most proper that must use who be jesus christ be son of god a told yesterday at same time equal with god how must be equal with god if a said yesterday god sent down to be killed be with own consent that suffered death be mystery can not understand at present what be mystery can not understand do understand no only know such be fact be above not only mine men comprehension tell honestly that on point be bad teacher have paid little attention to during life a far a religion be concerned can only give outline for know more thought said that people be to be punished rewarded when died according a have lived bad good life to live good life people must be religious obey god command did tell so told truth did not tell have led bad life a have done have neglected to pay obedience to god word command then will be punished when die will not ala fear so child replied jackson putting hand up to forehead hiding face there be still time continued after pause o god of mercy exclaimed how will escape be about to continue conversation jackson requested must leave alone for time went out sat on rock watching star say be made by god god made everything thought god life up beyond star thought for long while be much perplexed have never heard anything of god till night before what jackson have told be just enough to make more anxious curious evidently did not like to talk on subject tried after time if must repeat lord prayer found must so knelt down on rock looking up to bright star a if must imagine be god repeated lord prayer to then rose up went to bed be first time have ever prayed have learnt so much from jackson latterly must hardly retain what have learnt at event have very confused recollection in brain thought turned from one subject to till there be for time perfect chaos by degree thing unravelled idea became more clear still laboured under half comprehension of thing in position be unavoidable now mind be occupied with one leading object wish be to learn to read thought more of jackson history account might give of father mother be a willing a be that must be deferred for time what required now be to be able to read book to object whole mind attention be given three four hour in earlier portion of day same time in latter be dedicated to pursuit attention never tired flagged in course of think about six week must read without hesitation almost portion of bible prayer book required more teaching from jackson who now became attentive hearer a read to morning evening portion of gospel liturgy can not say that understood many portion read question put to jackson puzzled not little very often acknowledged that must not answer a afterwards discovered arose from own imperfect knowledge of nature of christian religion according to statement to might be considered to have be comprised in following sentence if do good on earth will go to heaven be happy if do ill will go to hell be tormented christ came down from heaven to teach to do how to follow example that read in bible must believe may be considered a creed imparted to at time believe that jackson like many others knew better candidly told what have be taught to believe season for return of bird arrived stock of provender be getting low be therefore soon obliged to leave book work hard for jackson a soon a young bird be old enough set to task now found how valuable be knife have obtained from seaman chest indeed in many point must work much faster by tying neck sleeve of duck frock made bag enabled to carry bird more conveniently in greater quantity at time with knife must skin prepare bird in one quarter of time with fishing line also must hang up more to dry at one time so though without assistance have more bird cured in same time than when jackson be employed in labour whole affair however occupied from morning to evening for more than three week by time major portion of provender be piled up at back of cabin did not however lose what have gained in reading a jackson must not let go away in morning retire to bed in evening without reading to portion of bible indeed appeared to be quite uncomfortable if did not do so at last work be ended then felt strong desire return to hear portion of jackson history connected with father mother told so did not appear to be pleased with communication at willing to proceed a pressed hard showed symptom of resolution rebellion reluctantly resumed narrative chapter eight wish to understand said that unwillingness to go on with history proceeds from being obliged to make known to hatred that subsisted between father if will recollect that have in early day be striving to gain same object mean mother also that have taken a be what considered to have be place in other point that have be successful in life have be unfortunate must not then be surprised at hating a did understand nothing about feeling replied why injured by marrying mother can not see why loved well suppose did know what love be therefore can not understand so tell story well then when left off told that have ventured to land upon island by running boat into bathing pond in so doing boat be beaten to piece be of use afterwards landed eight person in be captain father carpenter mate three seaman besides mother have literally nothing in boat except three ax two kid two pannikin have indeed now a for provision even water have none of first object therefore be to search island to obtain water soon found at rill now run down by side of cabin be very fortunate for that arrived exactly at time that bird have come on island have just laid egg if not must have perished with hunger for have not fish hook with even fathom of line collected quantity of egg made good meal although devoured raw while be running about rather climbing about over rock to find out what chance of subsistence might have on island captain father remained with mother who sat down in sheltered spot near to bathing pool on return in evening captain called together that might speak to said that if must do well must act in concert that also must be necessary that one must have command control of others without such be case nothing must go on well asked if did not consider that what said be true agreed although for one felt little inclination to do so a rest said so raised objection captain then told that a be of one opinion next point be to decide a to who must have command said that if have be on ship board of course must have taken now be on shore thought that mr henniker be much more competent person than be therefore proposed that command must be given to for one must willingly be under order to proposal carpenter mate immediately agreed at last two of seaman be left alone resisted saying be not going to be ordered about by landsman that if be to obey order must be from thorough bred seaman other two sailor be of way of thinking be sure although have given consent hoped that must join appeared very much inclined to do father spoke very coolly modestly prudently pointed out that have wish to take command that must cheerfully serve under captain of vessel if must be more satisfactory to party that such must be case captain others be positive saying that must not have choice disputed by drunken vagabond a be that if did not like to remain with might go to part of island chose conference ended by getting in passion saying must not be under father order be seizing one of ax to go off with when captain caught arm wrested from stating that axe be property then telling that be welcome to go where pleased left therefore went away by to where bird be hatching a wished to secure supply of egg when night closed in lay down upon guano felt cold for gale be now over weather be very mild next morning when awoke found that sun have be up time looked for rest of companion whom have quitted perceived that be busily at work sea be quite calm when vessel went down after left many article have floated have be washed to island of men be busy collecting spar plank be near rock pushing along with boat hook to direction of bathing pond where hauled over ridge secured father mother with carpenter be on ledge where now be having selected a proper place for building shelter be apparently very busy captain one of seaman be carrying up what spar timber must be collected to where father be standing with carpenter appeared to be active working into other hand confess that a looked on envied wished that have be along with must not bear idea of obeying order given by father alone prevented joining making excuse for what have done said previous night therefore swallowed more bird egg raw sat down in sun looking at a worked soon perceived that carpenter have commenced operation frame of cabin be with assistance of father before be noon quite complete put up then went down to bathing place where boat be lying with bottom beaten out commenced taking to piece saving nail other men carried up portion of boat a be ripped off to where frame of cabin have be raised saw mother go up with load in hand believed to be nail taken from boat in couple of hour boat be in piece carried up then father most of men went up to assist carpenter hardly need tell what did a have cabin before roof see be mostly built out of timber of boat lower part out of heavier wood very good job made of before morning closed in one of side of cabin be finished saw light fire with chip have be cut off with ax then dressed egg bird have collected first day there be one thing have quite forgotten when mutinied left companion be necessity of water to drink now perceived that have taken possession of spot where only water have a yet be found be suffering very much from thirst towards close of day set off up ravine to ascertain if there be none to be found in direction before night succeeded in finding a know for have often drunk from spring when have gone up for firewood gave great encouragement for be afraid that want of water must have driven to submission by way of bravado tore off cut with knife a many bough of underwood on ravine a well must carry next morning built sort of wigwam for myself on guano to show have house over head a well a have built further up to edge of cliff above guano plain so need not have communication with who knew must come for egg bird for daily sustenance before night of following day set in cabin be quite finished weather became warmer day found very fatiguing to have to climb ravine two three time day to procure drink of water for have nothing to hold water in thought that must be better must take up quarter in ravine build wigwam among brushwood close to water instead of having to make so many journey for so necessary article knew must carry egg in hat pocket handkerchief sufficient for two three day at one trip so determined must do so next morning went up ravine loaded with egg to take up residence there in day two have built hut of bough made very comfortable returned for fresh supply of egg on third day with basket have constructed out of young bough enabled to carry whole week sustenance then felt quite satisfied made up mind must live a hermit during sojourn on island however long might be for preferred anything to obeying order of one whom detested a did father soon be evident however how well have done in selecting father a leader have fancied that bird must remain on island thus must always be able to procure supply father who have lived so long in chili knew better that in few week must quit nesting place pointed out to showing what mercy be that have be cast away just at time how necessary be to make provision for year must not imagine that be possible to do without salt to cure bird with knew how beef be preserved without salt on continent showed how to dry bird in sun while therefore be up in ravine be busy collecting drying in large quantity before time of bird leaving have laid up sufficient supply be also that invented fishing line out of sinew of leg of bird mother who knotted together at first caught fish with hook made of nail father showed way to take without hook a have learnt from have be shown by of indian on continent owing to father be well prepared when bird flew away with young one while be destitute previous to flight have fared badly for egg contained young bird half formed latterly so completely formed must not eat a have fire did not understand drying have alternative eating young bird raw be anything pleasant consoled however with idea that father mother rest be faring just a badly a looked forward to time when bird must begin to lay egg again when resolved to hoard up much larger supply while be fresh scheme be put end to for in two day after great deal of noise flying about in circle bird young old took wing left without mean of future subsistence be horrid discovery be put to wit end wandered over guano place after third day of departure be glad to pick up even dead bird with to appease hunger at same time wondered how former companion got on for considered that must be a badly off a be watched from behind rock must perceive sign of uneasiness there be mother sitting quietly on level by cabin father captain talking with perceived however two of party be employed fishing off rock wondered where got fishing line at last concluded that be by catching fish that supported however did not help be starving starvation will bring down pride of man on fifth day walked down to rock to where one of seaman be fishing having greeted told be starving asked for something to eat can not help ' replied have power to give anything away be more than dare do must apply to mr henniker who be governor now what foolish fellow be to mutiny a did see what have brought to ' why replied if be not for fishing must not be better off than be oh yes must be have to thank for without grant must not have be have plenty of provision although fish to help out ' puzzled amazingly there be help for must starve no longer so up went to level where father be standing with captain in swaggering sort of tone said that have come back wanted to join comrade captain looked at referred to father who said that must consult with rest when came to dinner a without permission must hing then turned away in meantime be ravenous with hunger be made more so by perceiving that two large fish be slowly baking on ember of fire that mother be watching however there be help for sat down at little distance anxiously waiting for return of rest of party when fate must be decided pride be now brought down so low must have submitted to term might have be dictated in about two hour be assembled to dinner remained envying morsel that ate until repast be finished when after consultation be ordered to approach did father addressed jackson deserted when might have be very useful when labour be severe now that have worked hard made ourselves tolerably comfortable request to join partake with of fruit of labour foresight have provided nothing have consequence be that be in comparative plenty while be starving now have taken opinion of companion be agreed that a have not assisted when be wanted must now allow to join will have to work more than others to make up equivalent be therefore proposed that will join on one condition be that during year till bird again visit island will be task to go up to ravine day procure firewood be required if choose to accept term be permitted to join always supposing that to other rule regulation have laid down for guidance will be subject a well a be be term may decide a think proper ' hardly need say that gladly accepted be still more glad when remnant of dinner be placed before be nearly choked devoured with such haste until appetite be appeased when be done thought over condition have accepted blood boiled at idea be to be in manner slave to rest a must have to work hard day forgot that be justice be only earning share of year provision have not assisted to collect heart be still more bitter against father vowed vengeance if ever have opportunity there be help for day went up with piece of cord axe cut large fagot of wood brought down to cabin be hard work occupied from breakfast to dinner time have time to lose if wanted to be back for dinner captain always examined fagot ascertained that have brought down sufficient supply for day consumption chapter nine year passed away during be thus employed at last bird made appearance after have laid up annual provision be freed from task have only to share labour with others be now great source of speculation how long be likely to remain on island day did anxiously look out for vessel must see none if seen be too far off from island to permit to make signal to at last began to give up hope a hope be abandoned settled gloom be perceptible on most of face believe that others must have now mutinied a well a if have known what to mutiny about father mother be life soul of party inventing amusement narrating touching story in evening so a to beguile weary time great respect be paid to mother certainly deserved seldom approached have taken decided dislike to arising presume from behaviour towards husband for now be again on footing with others be a insolent to a dared to be without incurring penalty attached to insubordination opposed a much a must in proposal that brought forward father kept temper although lost mine too often first incident occurred of consequence be loss of two of men who have with father permission taken week provision with intention of making tour round island ascertaining whether valuable information must be brought back be carpenter one of seaman appears that during return a be crossing highest ridge feeling very thirsty not finding water attempted to refresh by eating berry found on plant berry proved to be strong poison returned very ill after languishing few day died be event roused up broke monotony of life be one be not very agreeable to dwell upon yet at same time felt rather pleasure than annoyance at felt be of more consequence many other thought entered mind will not now dwell upon buried in guano under first high rock where indeed others be subsequently buried three more month passed away when other seaman be missing after search trouser be found at edge of rock have evidently be bathing in sea for day on be missed water be a smooth a glass whether have seen something floating wished to bring to land whether have ventured for own amusement for be excellent swimmer must never be ascertained more than whether have sunk with cramp have be taken down by shark never appeared again real fate be mystery to day must ever remain so thus be reduced to four men father captain mate must be tired will stop now tell remainder other time although be not tired yet a jackson appeared to be so made objection to proposal went to sleep while have read bible to jackson have often be puzzled by number being mentioned never must understand what be meant be must form idea of quantity represented by seventy sixty whatever might be jackson answer be oh mean great many will explain to by bye have nothing to count with a be blind must have something in hand to teach recollected that at bathing pool there be great many small shell on rock about size of pea there be live fish in appeared to crawl on rock collected great quantity of brought up to cabin requested jackson must teach to count did until came to thousand said be sufficient for many day continued to count up to hundred until be quite perfect then jackson taught addition subtraction to certain degree by making add take away from shell count accumulation remainder at last must remember what have gained by manipulation if may use term further must not go although addition have to degree made master of multiplication subtraction gave good idea of division be new delight to occupied for three four week at last have a thought learned that must teach in blind state threw away shell sighed for something more of sudden occurred to that have never looked into book still lay upon shelf in cabin saw reason now must not so mentioned to jackson asked why might not have book to be sure may replied never asked for quite forgot when asked before be so particular must not open be reason then jackson replied have reason except then disliked thought that looking into book must give pleasure belonged to poor fellow be drowned have left in stern sheet of boat when be at valdivia have forgotten found there when landed on island take down will amuse took down book opened be if recollect right called mayor natural history at event be natural history of beast bird with plate representing description annexed must be impossible for to convey to reader astonishment delight have never seen picture drawing in life did not know that such thing existed be in ecstasy of delight a turned over page hardly taking sufficient time to see one object before hastened on to for two three hour did thus turn over leaf without settling upon one animal at last pulse beat more regularly commenced with lion now what source of amusement what multitude of question have to be answered by companion have to tell about country in animal be found description of animal with anecdote be source of much conversation what be more fore ground back ground of landscape with animal be surrounded produced new idea there be palm tree explained to jackson inquired about led to more inquiry lion occupied for whole afternoon be getting dark when lay down with new treasure by side have read of lion in scripture now recalled passage before slept thought of bear destroyed child who have mocked elisha prophet determined that first animal must read about next morning must be bear think that book lasted nearly two month during time except reading portion night morning to jackson bible prayer book be neglected time thought that book must not be true when came to bird found frequented island so correctly described that have longer doubt on subject perhaps what interested most be plate in barn door fowl peacock be described a in back ground of first be cottage figure representing rural scenery of england own country in second there be splendid mansion carriage four horse driving up to door in short be impossible to convey to reader new idea received from slight effort of draftsman to give effect to drawing engraving be also matter of much wonder required great deal of explanation from jackson book became treasure be not till have read through through so a almost to know by heart at length returned to bible time have never asked jackson to go on with narrative now that curiosity be appeased made request appeared a before very unwilling be pertinacious be worried into there be four of left mother mate be in very bad state of health fretted very much poor fellow for have left young wife in england what appeared to fear most be that must be married again before must get home ended in confirmed liver complaint carried off nine month afterwards thus be one more of companion disposed of died very quietly gave sleeve button watch to deliver to wife if ever must escape from island fear there be little chance of ever receiving where be said recollecting how have seen lift up board under bed place have safe replied jackson necessary will tell where to find reply satisfied allowed to proceed buried in guano by side of two others now be three be at time that mother be confined be born be about three month after death of mate have just finished laying in stock of bird for year when be taken ill sooner than be expected be supposed that be occasioned by over exertion at time however got up very well without medical assistance father be much pleased at having son for have be married five year without prospect of family ought to observe that loss of companion one after have have effect of bringing remained much closer together be treated with more kindness by father mother captain returned a well a feeling must permit for must not altogether get rid of animosity to father however became much more confidential be certain be now treated a equal six month passed away have become thriving child when melancholy occurrence here jackson covered up face with hand remained for time silent go on said jackson know that died somehow very true replied recovering well father disappeared have gone to rock to fish when be sent to bring home to dinner be nowhere to be found be supposed that larger fish than usual have be fast to line that have be jerked off rock into water shark have taken be dreadful affair continued jackson again covering face think replied that man in sens must have allowed fish to have taken line rather than have be dragged into water think that supposed manner of death be at satisfactory perhaps not replied jackson foot may have slipped who know only must guess line be gone a well a made think what said still searched everywhere without hope search be captain mine for poor mother remained with in arm distracted be cause of disaster no le than death of captain say misfortune never come single surely be instance of truth of proverb how did die replied gravely for somehow other felt doubt a to truth of what be saying jackson did not reply till after pause when said be out with up ravine collecting firewood fell over high cliff be so injured that died in hour what did do what did do what must do go back break news to mother who be distracted when heard for captain be friend must not bear well go on pray said did must to make mother comfortable a there how be left on island be then about three year old mother always hated appeared now to hate more more never recovered loss of father to whom be devotedly attached pined away after six month died leaving only on island now know whole history pray ask more about chapter ten jackson threw back in bed place be silent so be for be recalling that have told doubt be raised a to truth of did not like hurrying over latter portion of narrative in way have done what have said about mother be not satisfactory have for time be gradually drawing towards not only showing feeling for great increase of good will suspicion have entered mind now began to feel former animosity towards renewed night sleep however more reflection induced to think that possibly be judging too harshly a must not afford to quarrel with intercourse remained a amicable a before particularly a become more more amiable towards did everything in power to interest amuse be one day reading to account of monkey given in book of natural history in be said that animal be fond of spirit will intoxicate jackson be telling many anecdote of monkey on board of vessel have sailed in when occurred to that have never thought of mentioning to of ascertaining content of cask have be thrown into bathing pool with seaman chest did so then to jackson wondering at content how be to be got at jackson entered into question warmly explaining to how where to bore hole with gimlet making two spile for to stop hole with a soon a have done so curiosity induced to go down to pool where cask have be lying so long in about foot half water by jackson direction took pannikin with might bring

large drop of perspiration hand be clenched together although asleep appeared by convulsive twitching of muscle of face to be suffering in great agony occasionally groaned deeply lip appeared to move sound proceeded from perceived that pannikin of liquor be not finished one third at least having be left chapter eleven then went out of cabin took usual seat began to reflect upon what have heard have talked about diamond now knew what diamond be so far a be of great value for have read of in bible jackson have explained value of precious stone to have told of diamond of very great value indeed then said that be henniker diamond must have meant father be positive that one must prove be implied that jackson have right to indeed how must have then recalled to mind having secret hiding place under bed where presumed diamond be deposited then turned over in mind what have told relative to death of father captain mother how confused be how glad be to get rid of subject how unsatisfactory thought account be at time after much cogitation made up mind that jackson have not told truth that there be mystery yet to be explained how be to get at there be one way liquor made talk must supply with liquor by degree must get truth out of at same time must not allow to suppose that have said anything to commit that have suspicion how naturally do fall into treachery deceit from evil in own heart without assistance example from world how must have learnt deceit isolated a have be must not have be innate returned to cabin woke jackson without much difficulty since have not drunk so much a on previous night how be morning said not very well have have bad dream well sang beautiful song replied yes recollect said fell asleep at last yes refused to sing more went off in loud snore jackson got out of bed place gave meal talked during whole day about singing hummed air have pleased most have got air pretty correct said must have ear for music have ever tried to sing never know have not might have tried when be not with try now will sing tune then do repeat after did so repeated very good said let try compass of voice ran up gamut followed think can go higher than can said however go quite high enough so now will give singing lesson thus be occupied at interval during whole day for jackson must not allow to try voice too much at first a evening fell again asked to fetch liquor a have three quart wine bottle a before mentioned have found in chest took down to fill a must save many trip be more convenient in respect brought up full jackson stopped up with of rag have torn to bind round wrist put three in bed place will be much better arrangement said a now can pour out liquor into pannikin a want besides mean to take little water with in future be not quite so good with water last longer one go to sleep so soon well little thought must have comfort sent after suffering so much care now about staying here go fetch water in pannikin night be repetition of first jackson sang till be intoxicated then fell fast asleep not talking saying word be disappointed for remained awake to catch anything might say must be tedious to repeat what took place for about month suffice to say be very rarely during time that jackson said anything in sleep drunken state what did say must make nothing of continued in daytime ' to give lesson in singing must now sing several song very correctly at night returned to usual habit be more le intoxicated before night be over perceived however that excess have great effect upon constitution that have become very pale haggard impatient a felt to find out truth concealed feeling towards have certainly very much changed again since discovery have made suspicion have formed remained on best of term with resolving to wait patiently have spoken once therefore argued that must speak again be wrong in calculation one night after have finished usual allowance of liquor have composed for sleep observed that be unusually restless changing position in bed place few minute at last muttered captain james well what of captain james eh thought struck that might reply to question how did die said in low clear voice die replied jackson fell down cliff did ca say killed never put finger on after that be silent for time then recommenced always said that destroyed did not only one yes one grant hated not for diamond if said wife indeed love hate then killed for love of wife hate of yes did who be have guessed that who be will have life a said started up in bed place awakened by dream probably by voice have replied to who spoke said frank henniker did speak made reply pretended to be sound asleep a still sat up a if watching feigned snore must not have be muttered jackson be quite fast mercy what dream then sank down in bed place heard gurgling noise told that have put bottle of liquor to mouth be drinking out of from time that gurgling lasted must have taken great deal at last be quiet again so have discovered at last said a blood boiled at what have heard did murder father will kill while sleep be first thought came into troubled mind wo do what then will tax with when be awake then kill thought that a be blind unable to defend must be cowardly must not do that what then be to do a cooled down thought of word of bible that be to return good for evil for jackson of whom when read asked why be told to do so have explained to afterwards when came to part said vengeance be mine lord have told that there be punishment for wicked hereafter be reason why be not to obey jewish law of eye for eye tooth for tooth have referred to portion of bible have well explained certain be that prevented raising hand against night still remained in state of great excitement felt that must be impossible for to be longer on good term with revolved question in mind till at last worn out by excitement fell fast asleep short time before daylight started up at what thought be faint cry listened hearing nothing more again fell asleep be broad daylight when arose first thought be naturally of jackson looked at where lay be no longer there bed place be empty be astonished after moment thought recollected cry have heard in night ran out of cabin looked around must see nothing of then went to edge of flat rock upon cabin be built looked over be about thirty foot from rock to one below nearly perpendicular thought that must have gone out in night when intoxicated with liquor have fallen down precipice did not see a peered over must have gone for water thought ran to corner of rock where precipice be much deeper looking over perceived lying down below without motion apparent life have then judged rightly sat down by side of pool of water quite overpowered last night have be planning how must destroy now lay dead before without being guilty of crime vengeance be mine lord be word first escaped lip remained many minute in deep thought at last occurred to that might not yet be dead ran down cliff clambering over rock arrived breathless at spot where jackson lay groaned heavily a stood by jackson said kneeling down by be much hurt for feeling of animosity have vanished when perceived unhappy condition lip moved did not utter sound at last said in low voice water hastened back a fast a must to cabin got pannikin half full of water poured little rum in out of bottle journey return to occupied ten minute put to lip seemed to revive be dreadful object to look at blood from cut on head have poured over face beard be clotted with gore how to remove to cabin knew not must be hardly possible for to carry over broken rock have climbed to arrive at where lay there be other way what be longer just a difficult by degree appeared to recover gave more of content of pannikin at last must speak although with great pain difficulty a did so put hand to side be indeed ghastly object with sightless eyeball livid lip face beard matted with blood do think must get to cabin if helped said will never get there let die where be said cut on head be not very deep replied feel side bleed inwardly be broken to piece said pausing gasping between word looked at side perceived that be already black much swollen offered more drink took eagerly then returned for further supply filled two of wine bottle with water small drop of spirit a before went back to where lay found more recovered have hope that might still do well told so no replied have few hour to live feel that let die here die in peace then sank into sort of stupor occasioned presume by what have given to drink remained quite quiet breathing heavily sat by waiting till must rouse up again for more than hour be in very confused state of mind a may well be imagined after what have passed in night chapter twelve what most thought of be obtaining from now that be dying full truth a to death of father mother jackson remained so long in state of stupor feared that must die before must interrogate a proved be not to be case waited hour very impatiently must acknowledge then went to asked how felt replied immediately without difficulty appeared before to have experienced be better now inward bleeding have stopped still can not live side be broken in think there be rib be not fractured into piece spine be injured for can not move feel leg may live many hour yet thank god for mercy in allowing so much time short indeed to make reparation for so bad life still nothing be impossible with god well then replied if can speak wish must tell truth relative to father death also about death of others a for father know that murdered for said so last night in sleep after pause jackson replied be glad that did that have told so wished to make full confession even to for confession be proof of repentance know that must hate will hate memory can not be surprised at look at now frank ask own heart whether be not more object of pity than of hatred vengeance be mine lord have not vengeance fallen upon even in world look at here be separated from world loved so much with chance of ever joining possessed of wealth must few month ago have made happy now blind crushed to piece by avenging god in whose presence must shortly appear to answer for wickedness expectation overthrown hope destroyed accumulated sin procuring nothing may be eternal condemnation ask again be not object of pity commiseration must assent to proceeded will now tell truth did tell truth up to time of father mother embarkation on board of brig up to when gale of wind came on occasioned eventually loss of ship now give little drink vessel be so tossed by storm wave broke over so continually that between deck be full of water a hatch be kept down heat be most oppressive when be not watch remained below looked out for berth to sleep in before cabin bulkhead on starboard side captain have fitted up sort of sail room to contain spare sail in case must require be about eight foot square sail be piled up in so a to reach within two foot of deck overhead though lower one be wetted with water above be dry took berth on top of sail a sleeping place now state room in father mother slept be on other side of cabin bulkhead straining rolling of vessel have opened chink between plank so must see great deal of what be done in state room must hear word almost be spoken by be not aware of when selected place a berth found out on first night light of candle shining through chink into darkness by be surrounded outside of course be when man be alone with wife that talk on confidential subject knew well hoped by listening to be able to make discovery what have idea of with bad feeling stimulated determined not to lose opportunity be not till about week after have selected berth made discovery have have watch from six to eight o'clock have gone to bed early about nine o'clock father came into state room mother be already in bed a father undressed mother said doe not that belt worry great deal dear ' replied father be used to now did when first put on now have have on four day feel will keep on a long a weather last there be saying what may happen will not do to be looking for belt at moment warning ' do think then that be in danger ' not particularly so storm be very fierce vessel be old weak may have fine weather in day two may not at event when property of value be at stake that property not own must feel very culpable if did not take precaution well wish be safe home again dear that father have diamond be in hand of god ' yes must trust to ' replied father circumstance induced to look through one of chink of bulkhead so must see father perceived that be unbuckling belt be round body doubt contained diamond referred to be of soft leather about eight inch wide sewed lengthways breadthways in small square in presumed diamond be deposited after time mother spoke again really think henniker ought to wear belt why so dear ' because might be mean of preservation in case of accident suppose now be obliged to abandon vessel take to boat husband in hurry might forget wife must not forget diamond if wore belt must be certain to put in boat observation of yours must have force with husband wife retorted father a have firm belief in scripture doe not affect do proverb say price of virtuous woman be far above ruby good ruby be worth even more in market than diamond of same size well must comfort with idea ' replied mother laughing supposing be thrown upon out of way place ' said father will then commit belt to charge might soon be discovered on person whereas on yours must stand chance of being long concealed say because even in desert must be dangerous to have known by unscrupulous unprincipled men that one have so much wealth about ' well replied mother be also comfortable for to hear for will not leave behind because will be necessary to conceal treasure ' yes replied father laughing there be chance for see ' father then extinguished light conversation be not renewed have heard enough father carried great treasure about person wealth took for granted that if once must obtain return to england must save from present position avarice be hereby excited thus passion equally powerful equally inciting to evil deed be added to hate already have imbibed for father must leave off now jackson drank little more then remained quiet a have food day took opportunity of returning to cabin with promise must be back very soon in hour returned bringing with bible prayer book a thought that must ask to read to after have made confession found breathing heavily apparently asleep so did not wake a looked at recalled to mind word be not object of pity confessed that be then asked question can forgive who be murderer of father after reflection thought must be not already punished have not murder be already avenged be not possible to retain animosity against one so stricken so broken to piece heart smote when looked at disabled hand felt boy a be have have share in marring at last spoke be there frank yes replied have have little sleep said do feel easier inquired kindly yes feel side more numbed so will remain till mortification take place let finish confession wish to relieve mind not that will die to night perhaps to morrow still wish over come nearer to that may speak in lower voice then will be able to speak longer did so proceeded know how be cast upon island how behaved at first when afterwards took place with others evil thought gradually quitted gave up idea of injury to father did not last long death of so many at last captain father mother being only one left on island besides once more excited cupidity thought again of belt of diamond by what mean must gain possession of devil suggested to murder of captain of father have ascertained that father no longer carried belt on person when used to bathe at bathing pool be therefore a father have proposed in mother keeping having once made up mind watched opportunity to put intention into execution be custom for one of to fish morning a mother must not eat dried bird if fish must be procured considered that only chance have of executing horrible wish be when father went to fish off rock usually did so off ledge of rock divide bathing pool from sea found out place where more fish of better quality be to be taken be off high wall of rock just below know where mean have often sent to fish there never must go since father death father took line there be hauling in large fish when who have concealed close to where stood watched opportunity a looked over rock to see if fish be clear of water to come behind throw off into sea must not swim knew after waiting minute two looked over saw body just a sank after last struggle then hastened away guilty conscience induced to ascend ravine collect faggot of firewood to bring home that suspicion might be entertained so doing be very cause of suspicion a will afterwards perceive returned with wood captain observed when came up to cabin why be something new for to collect wood out of turn jackson wonder will never cease ' fact be that be becoming very amiable ' replied hardly knowing what to say afraid to look of in face for mother with on lap be standing close by have husband caught fish do know jackson ' said mother for be high time that came home how can tell replied have be up ravine for wood ' be down on rock two hour ago replied mother for captain james saw coming away ' that certainly did ' replied captain have caught fish when be with ' must have perceived confusion when said yes be on rock never went near henniker that will swear must have be near even when saw ' replied captain never looked at if be replied well then one of have better go down see what be about ' said captain will leave jackson with ' yes yes replied mother much agitated for have foreboding better leave here ' captain hastened down to rock in quarter of hour returned very much heated saying be not there ' not there ' replied getting up for have seated in silence on rock during captain absence be very odd be ' replied captain jackson go try if see anything of while attend to mr henniker ' mother on captain return have bowed head down to knee covered face with hand be glad of excuse to be away for heart smote a witnessed condition remained away hour then returned saying must see nothing of father mother be in cabin captain went in to while remained outside with feeling of cain upon brow be dreadful day for party food be taken mother captain remained in cabin dared not a usual go into own bed place lay night upon rock sleep must not moment saw father body sinking a have seen in morning next morning captain came out to be very grave stern must not accuse whatever suspicion might have be be week before saw mother again for dared not intrude into presence finding there be accusation against recovered spirit returned to cabin thing went on a before chapter thirteen one thing however be evident that mother have aversion may say horror of must not conceal said nothing never must look at to question put must seldom make reply strange to say treatment of hers produced quite different effect from what might have be anticipated felt former love for revive shrinking from made more familiar towards increased disgust assumed jocose air with at time captain james considered duty to interfere check be very powerful man in contest must have proved master knew knowledge compelled to be more respectful to mother in presence when back be turned became so disgustingly familiar that at last mother requested that whether fishing collecting wood instead of going out by turn must go leave alone must not well refuse a captain james must in probability have used force if have not consented hatred to be in consequence most unbounded however event took place relieved from subjection be under left alone with mother now must rest little wait hour will know rest be now late in evening there be bright moon shone overhead broad light shadow made rock around appear peculiarly wild rugged towered up one above other till met dark blue of sky in star twinkled faintly while moon sailed through ether without cloud to obscure radiance in majestic scenery be found two living being poor boy mangled wretch murderer soon to breathe last be summoned before offended god a remained motionless by side felt a looked up sensation of awe not of fear thought to myself god made world besides bible said so speculation then be a to what god must be for although have read bible have confused idea have be asked a be to man in chariot by philip understandest thou what thou readest most certainly must have answered remained for nearly two hour in reverie at last fell asleep with back against rock be however wakened up by jackson voice when asked in low tone for water there be said handing to have called long replied asked once have be asleep said a soon a have drunk said will finish now side begin to burn then proceeded be about four month after father death captain james went together to ravine to collect firewood passed under wall of rock know so well went through gap a call when captain james left water course walked along edge of wall followed of have piece of rope in hand with tied faggot of sudden foot slipped rolled down to edge of rock catching hold of small bush have fixed root in rock saved when body be hanging half over precipice give end of rope ' said to perfectly collected although in such danger yes replied intended so to do a perceived that if refused must still have saved by bush to clung bush began to loosen give way captain james perceiving cried out quick quick bush be giving way ' assertion of determined not to give rope pretended to be in great hurry to do so entangled about leg then appeared occupied in clearing when cried again quick hardly have said word when root of bush snapped down fell below crash a came to rock beneath see judgment of god be not now precisely in position lying battered crushed a be after time went down to where lay found expiring have just strength to say god forgive then died be murder for must have saved must not yet prayed to god to forgive how much happier must have felt if have not said that god forgive ' rang in ear for month afterwards returned to cabin with bold air stated to mother what have happened for felt must say time did not do deed burst out into frantic exclamation accusing of being not only murderer murderer of husband tried must do to appease in vain for many week be in state of melancholy despondency that made fear for life have still to bestow affection upon for sake lived soon made discovery be now wholly in power be awed by look even for time at last became bolder spoke to of becoming man wife turned from with abhorrence then resorted to other mean prevented from obtaining food must have starved with pleasure must not bear to see suffer will not detail cruelty barbarity towards suffice to say be such that pined away about six month after death of captain died exhorting not to injure if ever have opportunity to take to grandfather must not refuse demand made by woman whom a certainly killed by slow mean a have father by more sudden death buried in guano by side of others after death life be torture to for long while dared not kill hated have only one consolation one hope occasionally gave satisfaction consolation if so must be called be that have possession of diamond hope must one day see england again see now be not avenged must not feel truth of jackson last sentence be indeed avenged after short pause said to now frank feel that mortification in side be making great progress in short time will be in too great pain to talk to have made full confession of crime be reparation can make to now can forgive for will die very miserable if just look at can feel resentment against one in wretched state recollect that pray to be forgiven a forgive others give answer think yes feel that can forgive jackson replied will soon be left alone on island be sure must be much more miserable than will be if forgive do forgive thanks be good boy may god bless be not nearly daylight yes be will soon be able to read bible prayer book to have here pain be too severe becomes worse minute will not be able to listen to now will have moment of quiet before die then jackson groaned heavily ceased speaking for many hour appeared to suffer much agony vented in low groan perspiration hung on forehead in large bead breathing became laborious sun rose have nearly set again before jackson spoke at last asked for drink be over now said faintly pain be subsiding death be near at hand may read to now first while think of let tell where will find father property know replied in bed place under board saw remove when did not see true have more to say will all be over soon read burial service over after be dead now while still above read what think will like best for can not collect sufficiently to tell what be most proper indeed hardly know can pray at time read on did so came upon parable of prodigal son that suit said jackson now let pray pray for frank know how replied never taught ala jackson be then silent saw pale lip move for time turned away for few moment when came back to be more jaw have fallen being first time have ever faced death looked upon corpse with horror dismay after few minute left body sat down on rock at distance from for be somewhat afraid to be near to on rock remained till sun be sinking below horizon when alarmed at idea of being there when be dark took up book hastened back to cabin be giddy from excitement not having tasted food for many hour a soon a have eaten lay down in bed place intending to reflect upon be to do now be alone be in few moment fast asleep did not wake until sun be high arose much refreshed seeing bible prayer book close to bed place recollected promise to jackson must read burial service over body found place in prayer book for have read more than once before having just looked over went with book to where body lay presented yet more hideous spectacle than have night before read service closed book what can do thought can not bury in guano will be impossible to carry body over rock indeed if have be possible think must have touched be afraid of at last determined must cover up with fragment of rock lay about in direction did so occupied about two hour then carrying bottle with gladly hastened away from spot with resolution never to revisit felt quite relief when be once more in cabin be alone be true be longer in contact with dead must not collect thought analyse feeling during remainder of day sat with head resting on hand in attitude of one thinking at same time mind be vacant once more lay down to sleep following morning found invigorated capable of acting a well a thinking have weight upon spirit must not at first account for arose from feeling be now alone without soul to speak to communicate with lip must now be closed till again fell in with of fellow creature be that likely have seen of perish not far from be during period of many year chapter fourteen be now by jackson account nearly fourteen year old during fourteen year one vessel have be seen by might be fourteen more double time might elapse before must again fall in with of fellow creature a thought saddened felt how much must have sacrificed if jackson have remained alive be only for company must have forgiven anything even then felt a if in murderer of father have lost friend day be so unsettled must not do anything tried to read must not tried to eat appetite be gone sat looking at ocean a rolled wave after wave sometimes wondering whether must ever bring fellow creature to join at others sat for hour in perfect vacuity of thought evening closed in be dark still remained seated where be at last returned to bed almost broken hearted fortunately be soon asleep sorrow be forgotten morning be gladdened with brilliant sun dark blue ocean be scarcely ruffled by breeze swept over felt spirit much revived appetite returned after taking meal remembered what jackson have told about belt with diamond went up to bed place turning out bird skin feather raked up gravel be not more than two inch deep came to board lifted up found underneath hole about foot deep full of various article there be watch sleeve button of mate dollar wrapped in old rag tobacco box old pipe brooch with hair forming initial letter be signed j evelyn perceived be from grandfather probably taken by jackson after mother death say letter because be such a afterwards found out have not then ever seen letter first attempt to decipher written hand be useless although did manage to make out signature there be in tobacco box plain gold wedding ring probably mother there be also lock of long dark hair presumed be hers also there be three four specimen of what afterwards found out to be gold silver ore silver pencil case pair of small gold ear ring at bottom of hole be belt be of soft leather must feel hard substance in sewed in square of course presumed be diamond did not cut one of division open to see what be in have on upper part of in very plain writing property of mr j evelyn minories london examined article one after having satisfied curiosity replaced in hole for future survey covered hole with board put back gravel feather into bed place occupied about two hour then again took former position on rock remained in state of listless inactivity of body mind remainder of day state of prostration lasted for many day may say for week before be altogether removed must find pleasure in book be taken up after few moment laid aside be now within month of time that bird must come to island be in want of for sustenance there be plenty left almost loathed sight of food reader may inquire how be that knew exact time of arrival of bird reply that only reckoning ever kept by jackson be arrival of full moon also made mark on rock time that moon be at full thirteen moon be quantity reckoned from time of bird appearing on island one year until re appearance next twelve moon have now passed at length tired with everything tired of may say almost tired of life one day took into head must take provision with bottle to hold water go up ravine cut firewood must last long while must remain up there for several day for hated sight of cabin of be near to next day acted upon resolution slinging dry provision on shoulder set off for ravine in hour have gained not being in hurry to cut wood resolved upon climbing higher up to see if must reach opposite side of island be at least get over brow of hill to have good view of continued to climb until have gained smooth grassy spot be clear of brushwood a sat down to rest observed blue flower have never seen before indeed did not know that there be flower on island a afterwards discovered be one of variety of gentianella looked at admired felt quite affection for be very pretty be a well a alone jackson when be pointing out english cottage in landscape of mayor natural history have told great deal about gardening in england how wild flower tree be transplanted improved by culture how rose other plant be nailed up wall a have observed in engraving how be watered kept a sat down looking at flower thought occurred to why must not take with keep for can water take care of resolved must do so for already looked upon plant a treasure took up carefully with american knife leaving sufficient mould about root then proceeded to ascend hill before have gone hundred yard found at least dozen more of plant in flower finer than one have dug up three four others very different from be also quite new to be puzzled what to do put down plant have dug up continued ascent not having made up mind after hour climbing gained summit must perceive ocean on other side other half of island lying beneath be very grand from height stood on observed little difference between one side of island other be rugged barren rock a on side with exception of portion close to have brushwood in ravine appeared to be sort of cleft through island be silent solitary not bird be to be seen nothing have life must discover be about to return when thought might a well go down ravine facing for little way see what there be in did so discovered other plant have not seen on side of island there be also fern tree twining plant running up thought to myself why plant be what saw in picture of english cottage very like wonder if must run up cabin then at once idea came to must plant of round cabin must make garden of flower have plant of own reader can hardly imagine pleasure that idea gave sat down to ruminate upon felt quite happy for time now recollected however that cabin be built on rock that plant must only grow in earth at first idea chilled a seemed to destroy scheme resolved must bring earth to rock make garden in way at first thought of guano jackson have told that be only used in small proportion to enrich soil must kill plant if used by after hour consideration during called to mind jackson have told on subject made up mind must return to cabin on return ascertain how low down ravine must obtain earth for garden must then carry earth to cabin make soil ready for plant flower then when be ready must go up ravine collect what must make garden did so found that must get soil about one third of way up ravine quarter of mile below where brushwood grew having ascertained returned to cabin threw down provision be to have lasted week a be late decided must not commence operation until following day took out of chest duck frock tying up sleeve collar so a to form bag of body of frock set off next morning to begin task day contrived to carry to cabin ten twelve bag of mould put round in border about four foot wide about foot deep occupied whole week to obtain quantity of earth necessary to make bed on side of cabin be hard work made cheerful happy to what have be before found that best cure for melancholy solitude be employment so thus obtained valuable knowledge a well a making of garden when have finished carrying mould started off for ravine with two bag to hold plant might collect after day toil returned with bag full of small shrub besides bundle of creeper to plant against side of cabin following day be occupied in planting everything have procured be sorry to see that leaf flower hung down watered before went to bed next morning be delighted to perceive that have recovered be looking quite fresh garden be not full enough to please once more went up ravine selecting other plant have flower on one two other shrub have not before observed when be planted watered garden looked very gay full of plant then discovered mould came down for want of support at edge therefore went picked up piece of rock of sufficient size to make border hold up mould now be complete have nothing to do to go on watering daily did recollecting what jackson have said about guano got bag of put to plant good effect of be soon observable before bird came garden be in very flourishing condition can not express to reader pleasure derived from little garden knew plant shrub talked to a if be companion while watered tended did night morning rapid growth be delight no longer felt solitude so irksome a have done have something to look after to interest to love be alive a well a be grew threw out leaf flower be grateful for care bestowed upon became companion friend before mentioned that during latter portion of time be with jackson have taught to sing several song feeling tired in solitude of not hearing human voice found at first humming over afterwards singing aloud various air have collected from afforded much pleasure used to sing day have one to listen to be true a fondness for garden increased used to sit down sing to flower shrub fancy that listened to stock of song be not very large at last have repeated so often that became tired of word occurred to that prayer book have psalm of david at end of set to music got book a far a air knew must suit sang never be psalm probably sung to such tune before amused there be want of variety of language three four day must go up ravine search carefully for new flower shrub have not yet planted in garden when found one a often did be source of great delight chapter fifteen at last bird came procured of egg be very agreeable change after living so long upon dried meat want of occupation occasioned also to employ of time in fishing seldom have done while jackson be alive created variety in food to for long while have be stranger jackson did not care for fish a to cook be obliged to go up ravine for wood did not like trouble when bird came have recourse to book on natural history to read over again account of man of war bird gannet other bird mentioned in there be vignette of chinaman with tame cormorant on pole in letter press account of how be trained employed to catch fish for master gave idea must have bird tame a companion if possible teach to catch fish for knew that must wait till young bird be fit to be taken from nest now resolved that during time bird be mating must go to ravine remain there several day to collect bundle of firewood firewood be chiefly cut from sort of low bush like sallow willow fit for making basket indeed fit for anything better than firewood however there be bush be of harder texture burnt well be jackson who told that former be called willow used for making basket also showed how to tie faggot up by twisting sallow together be not however what jackson said be from after knowledge must say that be specie of oleander something of kind having roasted several dozen of egg quite hard by way of provision set off one morning went to ravine a jackson have said before have to walk under wall of rock thirty foot high then pas through water course to get up to ravine increased distance to where shrub grew at least mile be over wall that captain fell be killed because jackson must not assist gained thicket where bush grew for three day worked very hard have cut down tied about fifty large faggot when thought have collected enough to last for long while have still to carry down be heavy task a must not carry more than one at time occurred to that if threw faggot over wall opposite to where have be cut down must save nearly mile of carriage a otherwise have to walk way to water course divided wall of rock then walk back again indeed where cut down wood be not more than quarter of mile from bathing pool down hill be delighted at idea wondered have never occurred to jackson commenced putting into execution top of wall of rock be slippery from constant trickling of water over surface be only in place carried faggot down one by one threw over being careful not to lose footing in so doing have carried three four have become careless when on heaving one over heel be thrown up before must recover slid down remainder of ledge be precipitated down below distance of more than thirty foot must have remained there many hour insensible at last recovered found lying on faggot have thrown down be falling on faggot instead of hard rock have saved life rose a soon a must collect scattered sens felt very sore very much shaken blood be running out of mouth there be bone broken be however too ill to attempt anything more day walked home at very slow pace went to bed sound sleep restored in day two be quite recovered watered plant found drooping a if have grieved at being so long away from then returned to where faggot have be left to lighten labour resolved to carry down to bathing pool stack up there on rock near to mention for reason that reader will comprehend by bye occupied two day for be not inclined after fall to work hard very glad be when labour be over young bird be now hatched have to wait four five week before be fit to be taken began again to find solitude tedious flower in garden have bloomed withered there be not so much to interest recommenced reading bible narrative in old new testament again afforded pleasure hardly need say to reader read bible a must have read other book for amusement not for instruction have learnt little from jackson indeed a regard true nature of christian religion may say nothing at believe that knew anything about be true that precept in new testament struck be more interested about saviour than anybody else must not comprehend mission in short read in darkness may say that almost knew bible by heart without understanding how must how many thousand be there who do same without having excuse to offer for blindness at last time for taking bird arrived have then sufficient employment to keep from being melancholy collected quite a many a have done when jackson have to be provided for with new knife labour be comparatively easy a soon a have completed provision went back to take young bird already have selected left for purpose be high time for found that when went to take be ready to fly however after good battle with old bird for have taken six young one two from nest arrayed force of six old one against who fought very valiantly in defence of offspring succeeded in carrying off followed by old bird who now screamed darted close to a came pursuing to cabin a soon a got safe back took young bird into cabin tying of by leg with piece of fishing line other end of line fastened to piece of rock have collected ready on platform outside of cabin old bird continued to persecute till be dark then went away tired with day labour be not sorry to go to sleep when woke up next morning found old bird on platform in company with young one presume trying to persuade to fly away with line on leg prevented that did not leave at approach for little while at last took wing went off to sea in course of few minute returned with small fish in mouth with fed young one continued to do for two following day when there be general break up announcing departure of main body after much soaring wheeling in air flew off in northerly direction six parent bird who be with young one at cabin appeared for time very uneasy flying round round screaming wildly at last soared in air with loud shriek flew away after main body be still in sight love for young overpowered by instinctive habit be not sorry when be gone a wanted to have new family to myself went down to rock caught fish be large enough to supply for three four day fed with inside of fish ate very heartily for several day appeared very uneasy gradually settled not only appeared to know to welcome coming be to source of great pleasure now neglected flower for bird be more animated of two sat down for hour on platform with six companion who must own be not over lively intelligent be alive have eye seldom roused up unless brought fish of have supply four time day then must stand on leg open beak far apart waiting for share be great happiness to watched gradual increase of plumage of size be very rapid gave name out of natural history book one be lion then tiger bear horse jackass at time named last must have be very appropriate to a always called by name a fed soon found to great joy that knew well enough delighted read book to by way of amusement sang song to talked to must even narrate various history out of bible to such a of joseph brother etcetera stolid air with communication be received made almost imagine be listened to after time took line off leg of two of with precaution of first cutting wing two became much more lively following into cabin generally staying there during night a found that attempt be made to escape let loose after having cut wing behaved equally well with two first to have given liberty perfect obedience good behaviour of new companion again gave leisure be not altogether desirable a left vacuum to fill up returned to garden must do more at present water plant look at increased daily growth of climber a now boldly ascended side of cabin thought be high time to go up into ravine about island to see if must not add to collection one morning set off up ravine be not successful so contented with carrying by long road faggot have left behind on day when fell over precipice labour finished then returned to cabin where be met by bird with half extended wing open mouth a if be very glad to see very hungry into bargain ought to observe bird appeared now to separate into pair male female a difference of plumage denoted lion horse be always side by side a be jackass bear tiger panther now fed one by one calling by name to immediately responded if one came who be not called be switched for trouble next morning set off on voyage of discovery after plant time resolved upon trying what must find among crevice of rock for have seen at distance what appeared to to be very pretty flower on ledge of one of cleft did not go up ravine time commenced climbing rock behind where cabin be built be hard work be not easily discouraged after couple of hour arrived at level have in view when commenced labour here be amply rewarded for found several plant quite new to variety of fern thought very beautiful although have flower scene from where stood be awful beautiful looked down upon rock below cabin appeared very small thought must see bird like dot upon platform be bright day smooth water must clearly distinguish other island in distance thought that saw something like white speck close to perhaps be vessel made melancholy must not help asking whether be to remain life upon island alone if there be chance of ever being taken off a looked down upon cabin be surprised at steepness of rock have climbed felt alarmed a if never must be able to get back again thought be soon chased away turned from seaward looked inland found that on one side of there be chasm between rock bottom of be so far down must not see on other side rock rose up a straight a wall attention be soon diverted by discovering plant now commenced task of digging up obtained with fern about twenty new variety made up in bundle ready for carrying down slung round neck for knew must require hand to descend with then sat down to rest little before commenced return after have be seated few minute thought must sing song by way of amusement chapter sixteen have before said that tired of repeating word of song jackson have taught have taken of psalm in metre at end of prayer book by way of variety a far a metre went answered very well although people must have be surprised to have heard psalm sung to such quick varied measure psalm chose time be first how blest be who ne'er consent began accordingly when came to end of line to astonishment heard plaintive voice at distance repeat after con sent looked round thought must have be deceived so continued by ill advice to walk time must not be mistaken to walk be repeated by same voice a plainly a possible stopped singing lost in wonder there must be somebody on island a well a thought for never have heard echo before except when thundered such echo have put down a portion of thunder who be there cried who be there replied voice be be be answer did not know what to make of cried out again again again again heard what said repeated answer to question thought be insulted by somebody yet when listened voice spoke came from face of rock on other side of chasm one must be there without seeing made think be mistaken that there must not be anybody still must not solve mystery at last became frightened a sun be now setting determined to get back to cabin did so went down much faster than have gone up for a grew dark became more alarmed only thing reassured be softness plaintiveness of voice not like jackson a of one who must not think of injuring although be generally speaking quiet content with isolated position yet be only when be employed amused with favourite at time must not find anything to do be overcome by weariness must then throw away book remain for hour thinking upon probability of ever again seeing fellow creature fit of melancholy must come over must last many day be in one of mood when occurred to that although have seen other side of island from summit have not gone down to beach to explore resolved must do so making trip of three four day when knife have become blunt jackson have told how to sharpen by rubbing blade upon hard flat piece of rock wetted with water have found to answer very well now determined must try sharpen one of old ax in same way so a to make serviceable for be very much afraid of breaking knife in cutting down brushwood knew how much more rapidly must be done with axe picked out large stone suitable for purpose with kid of water at hand set to to sharpen axe be long job in day two have succeeded admirably axe be in good order then thought how must leave bird for so many day a must require food at last considered that if caught two large fish cut up must be sufficient for sustenance did so provided with packet of dried bird for food tied up in duck frock with natural history book for amusement pannikin to get water in axe on shoulder knife by side first kissed bird told to remain quiet good till came back set off on bright clear morning on tour of examination in couple of hour have gained summit of island prepared for descent by sitting down eating dinner observed that a before water on other side of island be quite smooth compared to what be on side where resided be in fact from prevailing wind during year lee side of island having rested sufficiently commenced descent accomplished in little le time than took to ascend from other side a neared rock by shore thought perceived something occasionally moving about on be not mistaken for a came closer found that there be several large animal lying on rock occasionally dropping into sea close to sight of anything living be to of great interest determined to get nearer ascertain what animal be at last by creeping along from rock to rock arrived to within forty yard of recollected animal of same shape in book of natural history fortunately have with in duck frock sitting down behind rock pulled out turned over page until came to print exactly answered to appearance be seal having satisfied on point read history of animal found that be easily tamed very affectionate when taken young also might be easily killed by blow on nose at least be for two most important piece of information occurred to that must be very pleasant to have young seal for playmate for gannet after be not very intelligent resolved to obtain one if must put down duck frock with provision behind rock taking axe in hand cautiously advanced to where animal lay there be about twenty of together on one rock be large seemed to be about five six foot long must not see small one anywhere so walked in behind rock further to right towards rock where saw batch of lying a neared saw by seal with young one by side not more than two foot long be what wanted lay at distance from water upon low rock watched for time be much amused at prattling passed between old young one thought to obtain young one must of course kill old one for perceived that have large teeth considered advisable to get between water that might not escape contrived so to do before made appearance a soon a old one perceived running to gave shrill cry then floundered towards water a came close together showed teeth rose upon flapper to defend young one kept close to side blow on nose with axe rendered motionless apparently dead delighted with success seized hold of young one took in arm be carrying away when found confronted with male seal alarmed by cry of female have come to assistance be much larger than female with more shaggy hair about neck shoulder apparently very fierce must not pas a be in shore of have just time to drop young seal leap behind rock on one side with axe ready animal reared on rock to pas over to when saluted with blow on head staggered have lost presence of mind by creature coming upon so unexpectedly blow be not well aimed before must recover first blow on nose tumbled over to appearance lifeless then hastened to gain other side of rock where have left young seal found that have crept to mother body be fondling took in arm retreated to where have left duck frock throwing everything else out put animal in tied up end so that must not escape then sat down to recover from excitement occasioned by first engagement have ever be in quite delighted with newly acquired treasure then thought what must do be now within hour of dark be too late to return to other side of island must have done so a be anxious to get seal home at last decided must go farther from beach take up quarter for night collected provision with seal under arm walked away about one hundred yard from water edge took up position under large rock here ate supper then untied line closed up frock have parting look at little friend before went to sleep have struggled good deal at first be now quiet although occasionally made attempt to bite coaxed fondled good deal then put into bag again made secure appeared to annoy very much a be not half a quiet in bag a be when held in lap then took book to read over again history of seal found that skin be valuable also that gave great deal of oil have use for oil though thought that skin might be very comfortable in bed place shut book lay down to sleep must not obtain till near daylight have be so excited be so anxious about treasure sun shining in eye woke up found seal be lying very quiet touched to see that be not dead cry that gave assured to contrary then walked back to where have left body of parent found on examination that be dead also that fur be very beautiful resolved must have skin here be difficulty if took off skin must not carry with be anxious to get young one home lest must die of hunger so decided must first take home young one give food warm then return skin old one therefore made breakfast leaving remainder of provision in cleft in rock might not have trouble of bringing again set off on return used such diligence be back at cabin by noon found bird well apparently quite satisfied with provision have left for be most of asleep be awake did not notice arrival ah thought only like for what give next time go away will leave hungry then when see come back will all flutter wing with gladness be puzzled where to put seal so a to keep safe at last decided upon opening seaman chest putting in did so gave piece of fish bird have not eaten little creature devoured eagerly took line went down to catch fish for further supply in hour returned with two large fish then took seal out of chest fed again ate very heartily be glad to perceive that appeared much tamer already threw of inside of fish to bird who be now become of very inferior interest to having fed animal then thought of a took meal arranged that next morning must go over to other side of island skin two seal spread out skin on rock to dry must leave there till have better opportunity of bringing to cabin at present must not be away from new acquaintance wished to make tame fond of having fed again in morning put down lid of chest then started for lee side of island chapter seventeen arrived early skinned seal dragged skin up from water side though with difficulty especially that of large one to rock where have taken up quarter night before here spread out to dry putting large piece of rock upon edge that might not be blown away be nearly dusk when have finished set off hour after dark arrived at cabin for now that knew way so well got over ground twice a fast a did before crawled into bed place in dark slept soundly after fatigue awoke next morning with plaintive cry of seal in chest hastened to get fish to feed with took out fed be astonished how tame little animal have become already remained very quietly with after have be fed nestling close to side a if have be mother even making half attempt to follow when left bird appeared very dull stupid observed also that be very dirty always rushed to kid when be full of water trying to get into made think that required bathing in salt water took one down to bathing pool with long line to leg put in manner in poor creature floundered dipped washed for several minute proved supposition correct so after allowing hour for recreation took back went down with others until have indulged in luxury of bath from time a took down almost day be astonishing how much brighter sleeker plumage became remained week in cabin taming seal who now be quite fond of one night a be going to bed crawled into bed place from time be bedfellow at end of week went over to other side of island contrived to carry up two skin to summit be hard day work day afterwards conveyed to cabin a be quite dry put into bed place to lie down upon a did not like smell of bird feather although have so long be accustomed to now what with seal bird garden occupation gave time passed quickly away until by reckoning be nearly period for bird to come again observed a time drew near that bird be uneasy have paired a mentioned before when plumage be complete be evident that have paired male female a have supposed have not be tethered for long while appeared to now very much inclined to fly especially male bird at first thought must cut wing a be fearful that must join other bird on arrival observing that be so fond of mate resolved to cut wing of female only a did not think that male bird must leave did so took chance for since have seal for companion did not care so much for bird a before at last bird came took possession of guano ground a usual went for fresh egg at same time found that female be scratching a if must make nest few day afterwards began to lay then thought that a soon a have young one must wish to go away so took egg be laid to prevent found that a fast a took away egg laid more did for nearly two month supplying with fresh egg long after wild bird have hatched left island male bird at time that female first laid egg tried wing in short flight in circle then flew away out to sea thought that be gone be deceived for returned in about quarter of hour with fish in beak laid down before mate be much pleased at resolved that in future must supply own food did not own food only enough for seal also when weather be fine when be rough must not obtain then be obliged to feed way obtained from extra supply of fish be that when first went out seized on return fish brought a often a did must go for more until female be fed have one difficulty to contend with be that at time bird must not obtain fish be when weather be rough must not a must not take bait after cogitation decided must divide portion of bathing pool farthest from shore by wall of loose rock water must flow through fish must not get out of must catch fish in fine weather to feed seal bird when weather be rough bad a soon a have finished curing stock of provision got safely housed in cabin set to work to make wall did not take very long while a water be not more than two foot deep pool about ten yard across a soon a be finished went out day when be fine caught a many fish a thought might require put into portion of bathing pool found plan answer well a fish lived have great difficulty in getting out when wanted for must not take bait a bird be no longer trouble to rather on contrary profit devoted whole time to seal required name for reading in book of natural history that certain lion be called nero thought very good name for seal bestowed on accordingly although what nero meant have idea of animal be now so tame that must cry if ever left must follow a far a must down rock there be one part of path leading to bathing pool be too difficult for there must remain cry till came back have more than once taken down to bathing pool to wash be much pleased when did now resolved must clear path of rock that might be able to follow down whole way for have grown so much that found too heavy to carry occupied week before must roll away remove smaller rock knock off others with axe finished at last be pleased to find that animal followed right down plunged into water have not be down since have made wall of rock to keep fish in a soon a be in dived came out with one of fish brought to land so now thought will know how to get fish when want will bring down nero may a well here observe that nero very soon obeyed order a faithfully a dog have little switch when did wrong must give slight tap on nose must shake head show teeth growl then come fondly to a used to follow day down to pool have to break of going after fish when did not want taken accomplished one who have not witnessed must imagine affection docility of animal love have for be companion playmate during day bedfellow at night be inseparable be at latter portion of second year of solitude that circumstance occurred that must now relate nero have gone down to pool with be standing fishing off rock when came out of pool plunged into sea playing sort of gambol whistling with delight did not think anything about plunged disappeared for few minute then must come up again close to where line be disturbed fish must not catch to drive further off pelted with piece of rock one of hit very hard dived down after time pulled up line whistling to to return although did not see went away to cabin fully expecting that must soon follow for now must walk after fashion from cabin to pool a pleased be early in morning busied with garden be now in great luxuriance for have dressed with guano observing about noon that have not returned became uneasy went down to pool to look for be not there looked on sea must not perceive anywhere called whistled be of use grew very much alarmed at idea that treasure have deserted must not be because threw piece of rock at thought must not leave for remained for two three hour watching for be in vain there be seal nero heart sank at idea of animal having deserted for first time in life a far a can recollect burst into flood of tear for first time in life may say felt truly miserable whole heart affection be set upon animal companion friend of solitude felt a if existence be burden without after while retraced step to cabin be miserable more so than can express must not rest quiet two hour before sunset went down again to rock called till be hoarse be in vain night closed in again returned to cabin threw down in bed place in utter despair thought loved said to myself loved a loved must not have left in way tear burst out anew at idea never must see poor nero again reader may think that grief be inordinate unwarrantable let put in position lad of sixteen alone on desolate island with only one companion true be animal must not speak be affectionate replied to caress be only companion friend only object loved cared about be intelligent thought loved a much a loved now have deserted have nothing else that cared about that cared for tear flowed for more than hour till at last be wearied fell asleep chapter eighteen be early in morning yet dark when felt something touch started up low cry of pleasure told at once be nero who be by side yes be nero who have come back having climbed up again steep path to cabin to return to master need say be overjoyed that hugged a if have be human being that wept over that in few minute afterwards be asleep together in same bed place such be fact never be there in after life so great transition from grief to joy oh now if have left said to next morning when got up naughty seal to frighten make so unhappy a did nero appeared quite a happy a be at re union be more affectionate than ever must now pas over many month in very few word just stating to reader what position be at end of three year during be alone upon island have now arrived at age of near seventeen be tall strong for year have left off wearing dress of skin of bird having substituted one of seaman shirt have found in chest however be whole of costume although have be longer must have be more correct still a have other companion nero be not necessary to be so very particular a if have be in society during three year think have read bible prayer book natural history book at least five six time quite through possessing retentive memory must almost repeat by heart still read bible a sealed book for did not understand having have one to instruct grace bestowed upon read for amusement nothing more garden be now in most flourishing condition climbing plant have overrun cabin so a to completely cover whole of roof portion of hung in festoon on side of doorway many of plant have taken up small when moved have proved to be tree be now waving to breeze high above cabin roof everything have planted from continual watering guano have grown most luxuriantly in fact cabin be so covered sheltered that original form have totally disappeared now looked like arbour in clump of tree from rock by bathing pool have very picturesque appearance have of course several time gone up ravine now that axe have become useful have gradually accumulated large stock of wood down by bathing pool more than must use for long while a seldom lighted fire cutting be employment employment be to great source of happiness have be several time to other side of island have have more encounter with seal of killed many for found skin very comfortable useful in cabin have collected about three dozen of finest skin be more than required have taken for same reason have collected firewood for sake of employment in instance may add for sake of excitement combat with seal afforded have not narrated of conflict a thought that might weary reader must however state what occurred on one occasion a although ludicrous nearly cost life have attacked large male seal with splendid fur for always looked out for best skinned animal be lying on rock close to water have gone into water to cut off prevent escape by plunging in a must otherwise have done a aimed usual blow at nose foot slipped on wet rock missed animal at same time fell down on rock with axe in hand animal be male of largest size seized hold of shirt then wore with teeth plunging with into sea dived down into deep water be fortunate that have seized shirt instead of body also must swim well carried along with shirt for few second drawn over head when disembarrassing of garment by slipping head arm out left in possession regained surface of water almost suffocated be fortunate that did not wear sleeve button have have must not have disengaged must have perished climbed rock again turning round perceived seal on surface shaking shirt in great wrath be sad discomfiture a lost not only shirt axe dropped when be dragged into water nothing be saved except knife carried by lanyard round neck why mention circumstance particularly be that having felt great inconvenience for want of sleeve button to hold wristband of shirt together have thought of making use of of mate reader may recollect have be given with watch into jackson care to take home to wife on second consideration thought very possible might lose decided that property be in trust have right to risk correct feeling on part therefore be probably saving of life have only now to mention bird of can merely say that went on a before bathed constantly at right season laid egg male bird caught fish brought to cabin be just a stupid uninteresting a be at first however never left indeed showed intention to leave after first season of bird returning to island be useful not very ornamental not at interesting to one who have intelligent companion a nero having new brought up history in few word until time referred to come to narrative of what occurred to produce change in condition have said that in chest there be spy glass have be wetted with salt water be useless jackson have tried to show how to use have shown correctly glass be dimmed by wet subsequent evaporation from heat have taken out glass cleaned except field glass a be called that being composed of two glass water have penetrated between still remained so dull that nothing must be distinguished through at time that jackson be showing how to use instrument be therefore put on one side a useless year afterwards took out from curiosity then discovered that moisture between two glass have be quite dried up must see very clearly through after little practice must use a well a anybody else still seldom did use a eyesight be particularly keen did not require a for vessel coming off island have gradually given up thought of be one evening when weather be very rough sea much agitated that thought saw something unusual on water about four mile distant supposed at first might be spermaceti whale for number used to play round island at certain season used to watch blowing gambol if may use term jackson often told long story about whale fishery ray of setting sun made object appear white ran for glass made out that be boat very small vessel with sail out running before gale right down to island watched till be dark with much interest with thought of various kind chasing other then began to consider what be best to do knew that in hour moon must rise a sky be not cloudy although wind sea be high must probably be able to see again never can get on shore on side of island thought with so much sea yes might if ran for bathing pool after thinking awhile decided must go down to bathing pool place lighted fagot on rock on side of entrance a must show where to run for how to get in waited little longer then taking spy glass tinder with went down to pool carried two fagot to rock on side having set on fire taken up others to replace a soon a be burnt out sat down with spy glass to see if must make out where boat might be a moon rose descried now within mile of island head directed towards beacon light made by burning fagot threw fagot on went down for further supply gale have increased spray now dashed over rock to where fagot be burning threatened to extinguish put on more wood kept up fierce blaze in quarter of hour must distinguish boat be now close to island perhaps three hundred yard distant steering not directly for light more along shore fact be that have hauled up not knowing how must land until have observed two light clear of other then understood why have be made moment afterwards bore up right for entrance to bathing pool came rushing on before rolling sea still trembled for a knew that if sea receded at time that came to ledge of rock at entrance boat must be dashed to piece although life might be saved fortunately for be not so on contrary came in borne upon huge wave carried clear over ledge right up to wall of rock have made across pool then boat grounded hurrah well done said voice from boat lower away sail lad right sail be lowered down then by light of fire discovered that there be several people in boat have be too much excited to say anything indeed did not know what to say only felt be more alone reader may imagine joy delight chapter nineteen a soon a sail be lowered men leaped over side of boat into water waded to rock who be said one of men addressing how many of be there here there be one on island replied be so glad that have come be then perhaps will tell how to get something to eat hearty replied oh yes wait little will bring plenty replied well then look smart be beauty for be hungry enough to eat if can find nothing better be about to go up to

by be will of heaven must submit to patiently continued so cruel so treacherous replied looking at fast receding boat grant most cruel most treacherous must leave to judgment of god what can expect from in way of mercy when have shown none tell candidly that think be better in present forlorn state upon rock than if in boat have taken with seed of discord of recklessness intemperance in attempt requires greatest prudence calmness unanimity fear there be little chance of ever being rescued from dangerous position be opinion thought so when first knew have found cask that liquor must prove ruin say again boat will never arrive at destination will perish miserably have pleased god that must leave here depend upon have be so decided for best replied looking again at boat be tired of being here be so anxious to get off now to be left have taken provision everything even fish in pool will starve hope not replied think not must exert trust to heaven must not heed heart be bursting sobbed a sat with hand covering up face gone cried one left yes replied one more who cried looking up god who be with always chapter twenty three heard what said head be too confused to weigh word remained silent where be few second elapsed spoke again frank henniker rise listen to will starve muttered a said one of male bird returned from sea with large fish of mr reichardt took possession a have seen do gannet flew away again to obtain more immediately afterwards other two bird returned with fish be in like way secured by companion see how unjust ungrateful be observed here be bird feeding a raven did elijah in wilderness at very time that be doubting goodness mercy of god there be meal for provided already head head exclaimed be bursting there be heavy weight rolling in can not see anything such be fact excitement have brought on determination of blood to head sens be rapidly departing mr reichardt knelt by side perceiving that what have said be case went into cabin brought out cloth wetted with water from spring laid across forehead temple remained motionless nearly senseless for hour during continued to apply fresh cold water to cloth by degree recovered from stupor in mean time weather being so fine water smooth gannet continued to return with fish caught almost of be taken from by companion until have collected more than dozen fish from pound to pound weight put away so that bird seal might not devour be still in half dozing state when breathing cold nose of nero touched cheek murmuring of favourite roused up opened eye be better now said to mr reichardt how kind have be yes be better still must remain quiet do think that must walk to bed place will try replied with assistance rose up when afterwards gained foot must have fallen if have not supported assisted by gained bed sank down again raised head higher then applied linen cloth cold water a before try now said if can not go to sleep when awake again will have dinner ready for thanked shut eye nero crawled to bed place with hand upon head fell asleep remained so till near sunset when awoke with very little pain in head much refreshed found mr reichardt by side be better now said can eat dinner must make friend with nero for have be disputing right to come near bedside teeth be rather formidable however gave inside of fish when cleaned be better friend already there be dinner mr reichardt placed before of fish broiled on ember ate very heartily be very kind of said to be working for when ought to be working for must not do again only share of work when be well replied share always will do can not be idle be strong enough to do great deal will talk about to morrow morning will be quite well by time hope oh feel well now replied only be very weak must put trust in god poor boy do ever pray to yes try little sometimes know how jackson never taught that then will will pray now for of will god hear be that said just before forgot everything morning told that there be here besides good gracious god who be always with always ready to come to assistance if call upon told god lived beyond star poor boy a if be god who be afar off did not attend to prayer such be not case be with always in spirit listening to prayer reading secret thought of heart be silent for time thinking upon what have told at last said then pray to mr reichardt knelt down prayed in clear fervent voice without hesitation stop prayed for protection support in desolate condition that might be supplied with thing needful for sustenance have happy deliverance from present position prayed that might be contented resigned until must please to rescue that might put whole trust confidence in submit without murmuring to might be will prayed for health strength for increase of faith gratitude towards for mercy thanked for having be preserved by being left on desolate rock instead of having left in boat with seaman surprised then prayed for entreating that might be humble instrument of leading to heavenly father that must be pleased to pour down upon holy spirit so might by faith in christ be accepted become child of god inheritor of eternal bliss there be something so novel to so beautiful in fervency of prayer that tear came into eye about minute after have finished said now recollect at least think do for memory of be very confused that mother used to kneel down by pray just a have done oh how wish have mother child replied promise that will be good obedient son will be mother to will oh how kind of yes will be wish will work for day night if be necessary will do everything if will be mother will do duty to a mother most strictly replied so that be agreed upon now have better go to sleep if can must first ask question why did thank god for seaman having left here instead of taking with because boat be overloaded a be because men having liquor must become careless desperate submit to control therefore think there be little chance of ever arriving anywhere safe that will perish miserably in way consider be probability unless almighty in mercy must be pleased to come to assistance allow to fall in with vessel soon after departure do think then that god prevented going with on purpose that might not share fate do god regulates everything have be better for that must have gone must have permitted willed otherwise must bow to will with full faith that order everything for best say that god will give that ask for in prayer yes if pray fervently in faith ask in name of jesus christ be will grant pray for be good for not what be not good for when ask anything know that be asking what be proper not doe may ask what must be hurtful to then in love for denies for instance suppose have be accustomed to pray must have prayed god that must permit to leave island in boat a be

circumstantial be often interrupted by question have not told quarter of what have to say chapter twenty seven mr reichardt have promised to give history of bible one day when weather kept at home thus commenced narrative bible be history of god doings for salvation of man commences with fall of man by disobedience end with sacrifice made for reinstatement a by one man adam sin came into world so by one man jesus christ be sin death overcome if will refer to third chapter of genesis at very commencement of bible will find at same time that adam receives punishment promise be made by lord that head of serpent will hereafter be bruised whole of bible from very commencement be announcement of coming of christ so that a soon a fault have be committed almighty in mercy have provided remedy nothing be unknown unforeseen by god recollect frank that bible contains history of god doings doe not often tell be why such thing be done must be sufficient for to know such be will of god when think proper allows to understand way to limited capacity most of doings be inscrutable be to suppose that because in foolishness can not comprehend reason that therefore must be cavilled at do understand frank yes replied do pretty well a pointed out to other day see blade of grass grow see flower how doe so know not if then be surrounded life with innumerable thing see can not comprehend when nature be mystery to even how can expect to understand dealing of god in other thing when therefore read bible must read with faith what be faith quite understand mother frank have often told of

something relative to other country must not understand came to asked if such be case must having found that told truth with regard to england believe that what have be told of other country be true if positively asserted that be so of course must mother well then frank must be faith belief in thing not only not seen can not understand to go on mention because people be so presumptuous a to ask why wherefore of god doings attempt to argue upon justice forgetting that little reason have be gift of god that must be endowed with intellect equal to almighty to enable to know perceive decides upon if god have not permitted to understand way still wherever can trace finger of god can always perceive that everything be directed by wise beneficent hand that although cause appear simple effect produced be extraordinary wonderful will observe a talk over history of jew in bible repeat that must study whole of bible with faith not be continually asking why be done if will turn to ninth chapter of epistle to roman will see what apostle paul say on subject nay o man who art thou that repliest against god ' will thing formed say to that formed why hast thou made thus ' do now understand in what spirit bible must be read yes do must read a word of god believe that read in exactly now will proceed after adam fall earth became so wicked that god destroyed leaving noah family to re people a soon a be done almighty prepared for original intention for future salvation of men selected abraham who be good man who have faith to be father of nation chosen for own people be jewish nation told that seed must multiply a star in heaven that nation of earth must be blessed in be that from descendant must christ be born who must be salvation of men abraham great grandchild be brought into egypt to live apart in land of goshen have read history of joseph brother oh yes know well well almighty wished jew must be nation apart from others for purpose brought into egypt observe frank by what simple natural cause be effected be by dream of joseph when told of irritated brother against sold a slave be sent into egypt there having explained dream of pharaoh be made ruler over

after joseph elevation be cruelly treated by egyptian who became afraid of rapid increase eventually king of egypt gave order that male child of jew must be destroyed be at time when be so oppressed cruelly treated by egyptian god interfered sent for moses moses like rest of jew knew nothing of true god be difficult to persuade be only by miracle that be convinced why did god keep jew apart from egyptian have thrown in bondage because wished to prepare to become own peculiar people by being descended from abraham having never intermarried with other nation have become pure race by being in bondage severely treated have suffered become united a people knew god worshipped by egyptian god be now intention of almighty to confound prove to jew a worthless at same time worked with own nation in mystery for when moses asked what god be to tell people that be almighty only replied by word be ' having name like false god worshipped by egyptian be now about to prove by wonderful miracle difference between false god what be miracle miracle be doing that man have power of doing proving that party who doe be superior to man for instance to restore dead man to life be miracle a none god empowered by god must do so miracle be necessary therefore to prove to jew that almighty be true god be resorted to by in instance a well a in coming of saviour when be also necessary to prove that be son of god when almighty sent moses to pharaoh to demand that israelite must have permission to sacrifice in desert purposely hardened heart of pharaoh that might refuse request why did so because wanted to prove to israelite that be only true god have pharaoh consented to going away there must have be opportunity of performing miracle by israelite be to be delivered by be to acknowledge a god

by saying that if expected to get through story must let proceed without further interruption for many thing must be mentioned by demanded explanation for one so completely unaware of existence a myself that must be impossible to make thoroughly acquainted with such thing within reasonable time proper explanation promised must follow then proceeded father may be thought have enough on hand in obscure country town be not unusual for one man to unite occupation of several be particularly case with father who in addition to office have enumerated be best cattle doctor bone setter within ten mile often earned bread at different kind of farmer work such a thatching hedging ditching like nevertheless found time to read bible bring up only daughter religiously daughter be what have become of mother asked a thought strange mr reichardt must only mention one parent have died very soon after birth answered be left at first to care of poor woman who nursed a soon however a must run about have exhibited sign of intelligence father began to get so partial to that very reluctantly allowed to go out of sight took great pain in teaching what knew though extent of acquirement be by mean great be sufficient to lay good foundation establish desire for more comprehensive information sought available mean to obtain remember at very early age exhibited extraordinary curiosity for child constantly asking question not only of father of friend visitor a seemed to consider quick lively child took pleasure in satisfying inquisitive spirit in way gained great deal of knowledge by observation of what passed around great deal more soon became source of pride gratification with father to ask to read bible to naturally led to good many inquiry on part numerous explanation on in course of time became

necessary to inform of us of several strange thing saw to select for own use what be most desirable being well acquainted with interior of ship having explained to numerous convenience must not admire ingenuity of man in creating such stupendous machine ship having much water in hold be forced to dive into armoury be first time have seen such thing handled musket pistol with vast deal of curiosity a companion explained to how be loaded fired at once saw advantage over bow arrow be selecting two three to carry away when hesitated on being assured must be perfectly useless without ammunition might have remained content with own savage weapon have already served so well have not mr reichardt in course of survey discovered several tin canister of powder perfectly uninjured with abundance of

when everything be prepared urged mr reichardt to accompany in voyage round island excursion hoped must turn out equally pleasant profitable found very averse to trusting farther from shore than be absolutely necessary raised kind of objection prominent among be want of seamanship for managing boat in open sea danger might arise from sudden squall coming on fear of getting amongst shoal of shark risk ran of driving against projecting rock overruled showed by taking little trip out to sea must manage boat with sail oar assured that by keeping close to island must run ashore before danger must reach that nothing must be easier than keeping out of reach of rock shark think quite convinced that fear be groundless repeated entreaty fineness of weather dislike to be again left on island whilst

captain man be now induced to ascend main top joyful cry of land woke up slumbering spirit of crew in way new world be first presented to attention of inhabitant of old appears to very unjust observed that so important discovery must have become known to not by name of original discoverer by of subsequent visitor to shore undoubtedly said mr reichardt be apparently unfair that americus vespucius must obtain honour christopher columbus alone have deserved of fame be natural right of whose courage enterprise procured unrivalled acquisition one can deprive gigantic discovery may always be known a america world acknowledges obligation to columbus know little beyond name of rival be immediate result of so large addition to geographical knowledge a beneficial to entire human race a ought to have be think be vast continent then thrown open to advance of civilisation may be divided into two portion south north former be inhabited by harmless effeminate race who enjoyed many of refinement

be evident that independent state must in time be absorbed by great republic have sprung up by peaceable mean a be at side whilst be content to be colony to what republic do allude may remember that told that entire continent be divided into south north exactly history of southern portion have rapidly sketched for that of northern will find of totally different character pray let hear when north america be first discovered be found to be inhabited by race of savage divided into several tribe have manufacture have knowledge of art science lived in impenetrable wood in hut having pretension to architecture went almost entirely naked be extremely warlike fond of hunting be known to devour enemy killed in battle to barbarous race came few adventurous men across stormy atlantic from distant island of england ah england exclaimed be country of parent be home of grandfather let hear anything have to say about england mr reichardt smiled at animation proceeded without making comment upon what have said england possessed at period many adventurous spirit who be ready to dare danger to obtain for country share in honour other land have assumed through enterprise of navigator by such men different portion of northern continent of america be discovered fame of new land wonderful productiveness admirable climate soon spread amongst countryman from time to time various ship left english port with small band of adventurer who made what be termed settlement in country of savage not by mercilessly massacring a spaniard have done in south then plundering of possessed by purchasing certain district piece of land from original occupant peacefully cultivated a number increased multiplied habitation obtained by barter of savage fresh accession of territory english showed much more humane people than spaniard observed did never come into collision with wild native of country frequently mr reichardt replied in measure be unavoidable a new settler from england landed in country required more land savage be now not inclined to barter have become jealous of stranger be desirous of driving back to ship before became too numerous act of hostility be committed by savage upon settler be often marked by great brutality exasperated latter who joined in warlike association notwithstanding number daring drove further further from neighbourhood till by conquest treaty purchase

north america form extensive district be however inconsiderable fraction of vast country still remaining under dominion of england territory lie in quarter of globe indeed sun never set upon immense empire empire with conquest of alexander of caesar most formidable state existed in ancient time can not for moment be compared when bear in mind that in various climate in far distant shore flag of country affords same protection to colonist a must enjoy in own land may entertain idea of vast power government posse can make respected at so many opposite point from source whence emanates be so much interested in description have neglected to notice rate at boat be driving through water now rose with great alacrity to shift sail a have got several mile from island if did not take care might be blown out of sight of land lost time in putting on tack have not proceeded far in direction when found wind lull presently sail drooped to mast there be dead calm became necessary now to take to oar be presently pulling with strength in direction of land went on for time till be tired be surprised at little progress have made lay on oar took refreshment then pulled with additional vigour began to suspect that be receding from land instead of approaching called mr reichardt attention to fact of island diminishing in size notwithstanding length of time have be pulling towards ah frank said in melancholy tone of voice have for time entertained suspicion that strength be being expended in vain be very clear that have got into current be moment taking further out to sea if breeze doe not soon spring up will lose sight of island then heaven only know what will become of shook out sail in hope of catching sufficient wind to lead out of current not breath of air be stirring did not

insignificant be two helpless human being who sat silent motionless in boat awaiting destiny star came out with marvellous brilliancy fancied that have never seen appear so bright probably gloominess of thought made look brighter by contrast seemed centre of glorious system of world revolving above with calm tranquil beauty appeared to reproach for giving way to despair in scene so lovely great mass of water scarcely moved by ripple now appeared up with countless fire purplish haze like low flame be visible in direction directed attention of companion to strange appearance notwithstanding intensity of anxiety immediately entered into explanation of phenomenon attributed to peculiarly phosphoric state of sea caused by myriad of creature posse quality of glowworm rising to surface of water made latter seem a though enveloped in flame sat long time watching singular appearance presented whenever dashed down oar looked a though be beating fire instead of water flame seemed to come from oar with drop fell from into sea in way hour passed by be still floating with current moon star be now coldly shining over head ocean around be still gleaming with phosphoric fire when mr reichardt advised to take nourishment then endeavour to go to sleep saying must keep watch apprise if anything happened of might be advantageous to avail only thing desired be appearance of vessel setting in of breeze of at present not sign existed felt disinclined either to eat to drink proposed that companion must make meal then go to sleep a be much more proper must keep watch than fact be be anxious that other must be first to diminish little stock of food a must be induced to do be decided that provision must be divided into certain portion be only to be taken at sunrise sunset that must during night relieve other three hour in keeping watch that if saw land ship wind must spring up might consult immediately a to course only succeeded in inducing to lie down at bottom of boat to obtain little sleep previously to taking place might so rest first said usual prayer for evening in joined in few minute be glad to hear by regular breathing that be obtaining that repose of be certain stood greatly in need be now sole observer of stupendous spectacle spread out around above most sublime feature in imposing scene appeared to be silence reigned supreme over heaven be a mute a sea looked a if earth have be engulfed by second deluge living nature have perished utterly from face of felt deep feeling of melancholy stealing over must not forbear reproaching for embarking in hazardous enterprise risking life be bound to preserve what must become of knew not be sensible that if be not speedily picked up made friendly shore there existed little hope of surviving many day made up mind that island must never see again though have be so anxious for so many year to quit now that fate have separated for ever must not console for loss of home endeared to by so many recollection great grief be loss of grandfather diamond have now chance of having restored to if be found must become property of discoverer must never know how daughter perished on rock how grandson be swallowed up by water of great deep then thought of glorious england have so long hoped to see heart sunk within a gazed out upon boundless prospect there be not voice to murmur consolation not hand to offer assistance be never to see white cliff have be so often described to must call to mind a clearly a if stood in pride beauty before eye how often have dreamed of approaching hallowed shore of england how often have heard cheerful voice of people welcoming little savage to natural home how often have be embraced by aged grandfather received into happy circle of friend with respect affection due to heir have dreamed happy dream seen blissful vision result be starvation in open boat on illimitable ocean mr reichardt still slept must not wake a long a be insensible to danger of position must exist in comparative happiness to disturb be to bring back to sense of danger misery recollection that folly have brought to hopeless state noticed that small cloud be making appearance in horizon almost at same instant observed felt breeze be just sufficient to flap sail against mast in few minute cloud have greatly increased wind filled sail fancied blew in direction contrary to current in belief that did so soon got boat round to great joy be presently scudding before wind at rate be sensibly increasing cloud presently began to envelop heaven thick darkness spread like veil in direction wind blew very fresh strained mast to sail have be fixed now began to entertain new fear sudden gust might take sail capsize tear from fastening must gladly have taken in sail considered a rather hazardous experiment mr reichardt lay in position prevented getting at without disturbing running risk of tipping boat over when must be sure to fill immediately sink with though must swim felt assured that if be once in water there must remain very little chance of protracting life beyond few hour boat therefore continued to run before wind at rapid rate slight mast creaking sail stretching so tight expected minute that must be upset at moment mr reichardt awoke quick eye immediately took in full extent of danger will be lost said hurriedly if take in sail be fully aware of have seen more of sailor peril than have knew better how to meet offered to assist in taking in sail directing to be very careful proceeded with assistance of awning to mast after good deal of labour at risk of being blown into sea succeeded in furling sail unshipping mast be now in quite a much danger from cause surface of sea have be so smooth during calm be now so violently agitated by wind that boat kept ascending one great billow only to descend into trough of often went down almost perpendicularly height seemed moment increasing time went thus plunging headlong into boiling water thought must be engulfed never to rise nevertheless next minute up ascended on crest of more fearful wave than have hitherto encountered down again plunged in dark unfathomable abyss walled in by foaming mountain of water appeared yawning to close over for ever be almost entirely dark must see only white foam of wave over be about to pas save be black below black above impenetrable darkness around mr reichardt sat close to with hand in mine uttered exclamation of feminine terror be more awe struck than frightened believe that be fully satisfied last hour have come for must hear murmuring prayer in commended soul to creator can not say be in great degree alarmed rapid up down motion of boat gave sensation of pleasure have never before experienced to say truth must have greatly enjoyed being thus at mercy of wind wave in midst of black stormy night on trackless ocean have not be for constant thought of companion bitter self reproach for having led into so terrible danger be now however called from reflection by necessity of active employment boat found shipped water at plunge if speedy mean be not taken to keep water under there be little doubt that must soon fill go down therefore seized iron kettle have brought with to cook dinner began rapidly baling out water be already over ankle continued to ship water sometimes more sometimes le mr reichardt actuated doubt by same motif a with tin pan now assisted in getting rid of treacherous element by united exertion kept water under hoped to be able to get rid of whole of about time began to rain very heavily although awning protected head so much fell into boat that notwithstanding labour continued to sit in pool be however glad to find that a rain fell wind abated a latter subsided sea became le violent shipped le water be now able by own exertion to keep boat tolerably dry mr reichardt ever provident spread out empty vessel have brought with to catch rain for a said did not know how valuable that water might become in short time rain continued to pour down in perfect torrent for several hour at end of sky gradually cleared sea though still rough presented none of mountainous wave that short time before have threatened to annihilate at descent there be just sufficient breeze to waft along at brisk rate with assistance of sail mr reichardt helped in putting up mast directly began to feel breeze insisted on taking refreshment be vitally necessary to for labour have be heavy for several hour therefore ate sparingly of provision washed down meal with pannikin of water mingled with little spirit chapter forty six morning dawned upon boundless expanse of sea first object presented to sight be enormous whale spouting water about quarter of mile distant from then observed then third subsequently several more presented singular picturesque appearance a one other of vast animal be continually throwing up column of water caught ray of sun looked very beautiful in distance looked in vain for land looked equally in vain for ship there be nothing visible shoal of whale mr reichardt endeavoured to cheer by describing importance of whale fishery to england peril men meet with who pursue fish for purpose of wounding with iron instrument called harpoon felt much interest in detail companion went into whole history of whaling expedition describing first discovery of huge fish from ship pursuit in boat harpooning of whale struggle after having be wounded being towed to ship side subsequent manufacture of oil from blubber of animal preparation of whalebone in attending to discourse completely forgot be being tossed about in open sea knew not where where might be in short time must be proved be equally ignorant perhaps must be corpse floating on surface of ocean waiting for tomb till shark came way perhaps must be suffering torment of hunger thirst perhaps cast lifeless upon rock where bleached bone must remain only monument must then declare that there once existed in latitude being a little savage where now must be island though long so anxious to quit now be thousand time more desirous of beholding felt that nothing must be more agreeable to than glimpse of wild rocky coast have so often appeared to wall of intolerable prison strained eye in vain in direction line of horizon stretched out uninterrupted by single break of kind around where must be often asked except that be on wide ocean companion have slightest idea of geographical position must have be blown considerable distance during storm much further than current have taken from island calculated that must have passed by many mile if have continued same course wind have shifted several time might be that be not so very long sail from must gain slightest knowledge of direction in be to be found be hopeless felt assured that must abandon idea of seeing again in midst of painful reflection companion directed attention to object at very considerable distance intimated impression that be ship luckily have brought glass with soon be anxiously directing to required point be ship at so great distance that be impossible a mr reichardt said for person on board to distinguish boat must have sailed in direction wind be contrary have therefore no alternative to wait till ship must approach near enough to make out passed several hour of deepest anxiety in watching course of distant vessel increased in size so must observe that be large ship by unassisted eye a be running before wind in totally different direction there seemed very little chance of communicating unless altered course mr reichardt mentioned that signal be made by vessel at distance to attract other attention described various way in communicated wish of respective captain only signal have be in habit of making be burning quantity of wood on shore pouring water on to make smoke be impossible in boat companion at last suggested must tie tablecloth to mast peculiar whiteness might attract attention sail be presently taken in tablecloth spread in place unfortunately soon afterwards came on dead calm breeze died away cloth hung in long fold against mast notice be taken of now took to oar pulled in direction of ship after several hour hard rowing strength have so suffered from previous fatigue that seemed to have made very little distance in short time sun set watched object of hope with most anxious eye till night set in hid from sight shortly afterwards light breeze again sprung up with renewed hope gave sail to wind bore in contrary direction when morning dawned saw more of ship wind have now again shifted bore briskly along where have fallen asleep during preceding night wearied out with labour anxiety did not wake till long after daybreak mr reichardt must not disturb in sleep be insensible to misery danger of position must not bring to disturb repose be at once so necessary to mind body fell into sweet dream of new home in dear england have prayed so often to see bright face smiled upon voice welcomed full of tenderness affection fancied that in one of face recognised mother of whose love have so early be deprived that be paler than others infinitely more tender affectionate then

be long time before must bring to believe have not beheld well known feature have not be stabbed by be not suffering from mortal wound have inflicted however at last shook off delusion to mr reichardt anxious inquiry replied only that have have disagreeable dream in short time began to doubt whether waking be more pleasant than dreaming vast ocean still spread before like mighty winding sheet fair sky beautiful a appeared in ray of morning sun must only regard a pall little bark be coffin in two helpless human being though still existing be waiting interment have god abandoned asked companion have forgotten that two of creature be in deepest peril of life from alone can save frank henniker exclaimed mr reichardt solemnly be impious god never abandon who be worthy of protection will either save at own appointed time if think more desirable will snatch from scene where so many danger surround place where there prevails eternal tranquillity everlasting bliss must rather rejoice added with increasing seriousness that be thought worthy of being so early taken from world in have met with so many trouble to die in way observed gloomily to be left to linger out day of terrible torture

have never left island mr reichardt never reproached never so much a reminded that be own fault merely added be will of god ate drank small ration companion always blessing meal offering thanksgiving for being permitted to enjoy noticed what be left have be extremely economical yet there be barely enough for day determined still further to reduce trifling portion allowed that might increase chance of escape chapter forty seven five day night have be drifting at mercy of wind wave small stock of food have be devoured though have hoarded crumb a miser hoard gold even rain water a well a water have brought with have drained to last drop weather continually alternated from dead calm to light breeze wind frequently shifted have strength left to attend to sail boat be abandoned to own guidance rather to of wind when becalmed lay still when breeze sprung up pursued course till sail no longer felt influence five long day night day of intolerable suffering night of inexpressible horror from sunrise to sunset strained eye along line of horizon nothing sky wave ever met gaze when became dark excited by deep anxiety have endured throughout day must not sleep fancied beheld through darkness monstrous form mocking gibbering high above be reared head of enormous python have combated in happy valley opened tremendous jaw a though to swallow displayed fold upon fold of immense form a if to

want of food suffered most from want of water for heat during day be tremendous became so frantic from thirst that nothing exhortation of mr reichardt must have prevented from dashing into sea drinking fill of salt water looked so tempting refreshing companion sought to encourage to hope long after hope have vanished then preached resignation to divine will in own nature gave practical commentary on text perceived that voice be getting more more faint that be becoming hourly more feeble be not able to move from seat at last asked to assist to lie down at bottom of boat then noticed that prayed fervently must often distinguish name in petition to throne of grace felt strange sensation in head tongue became in mouth a dry stick from be relieved by chewing sleeve of shirt head grew worse eye too be affected in strange manner continually fancied that saw ship sailing about at little distance from strove to attract attention by calling to voice be weak must create only kind of half stifled cry then thought beheld land fair forest green pasture spread before bright flower refreshing fruit grew around called to companion to make haste for be running ashore must presently be pulling clustering grape must lay down among odorous flower mr reichardt opened eye gazed at with more painful interest knew be haunted by chimera created by famine thirst seemed to have lost power of speech motioned to join in prayer however be too much occupied with prospect of landing paid attention to sign presently bright landscape faded away beheld nothing wide expanse of water circle of appeared to expand spread into sky sky seemed lost broken up in water for few minute be mixed together in wildest strangest confusion subsequently to must have dropped asleep for after while found huddled up in corner of boat must have fallen there from seat stared about for time unconscious where be bright sun still shone over head everlasting sea still rolled beneath foot looked to bottom of boat met upturned gaze of fellow voyager pale face have grown paler expression of painful eye have become le intelligent thought be a have seen in dream when changed from own likeness to of poor drowned girl buried in guano turned away gaze sight be too painful to look upon felt assured that be dying that in very short space of time faithful affectionate nature must part from for ever thought must make last effort though faint trembling burning with fever feeling deadly sick managed by support of awning to crawl to mast embracing with one arm raised glass with other hand looked carefully about hand be very unsteady eye seemed dim must discern nothing water must have sunk in despair to bottom of boat have not be attracted at moment by singular appearance in sky cloud be approaching of shape appearance have never observed before raised glass again after observing cloud for time with great attention felt assured that what considered to be long line of vapour be immense flock of bird discovery interested forgot intensity of suffering in observing motion of apparently endless flock a first file approached looked again to see if must make out what be god of heaven be gannet crawled back to companion a rapidly a feeble limb must allow to inform her of discovery have made ala found that be unheeded must not believe that fine spirit have fled no moved hand dull spiritless gaze seemed to warn that dissolution be fast approaching looked for spirit flask found few drop be still left there poured into mouth watched result with deepest anxiety have ever known since day of birth in few minute found that breathed more regularly distinctly presently eye lost that fixedness have made so painful to look upon then recognised took hold of hand regarding with sweet smile with be so familiar a soon a found that consciousness have returned told her of great flock of gannet be evidently wending way to customary resting place hope entertained that if must be kept in sight wind remained in same quarter boat might be led by to place where laid egg listened to with attention evidently understood what said lip moved thought be returning thanks to god accepting flight of bird a manifest proof that be still watching over in few minute seemed so much better that must sit up noticed for time watching gannet now approached in one vast cloud threatened to shut out from sky then turned gaze in opposite direction with smile of exultation lit up wan face a with glory stretched arm out pointing hand to distant portion of sea gaze quickly followed hers fancied discovered break in line of horizon did not look like ship pointed glass in direction felt joyful assurance that be within sight of land additional discovery gave increased strength rather hope now dawning upon gave impulse have not felt before in turn became consoler encouraged mr reichardt with argument of be master to think that must soon be in safety smiled something like animation again appeared in pale feature if must save felt must be blessed beyond measure object be worth striving for did strive know not how be that gained strength to do what did on day felt be supported from on high a speck of land that have first discovered gradually enlarged a approached exertion to secure speedy rescue for companion from jaw of death continued to increase breeze remained fair scudded along at spanking rate gannet keeping company way evidently bound to same shore kept talking to mr reichardt endeavouring to raise spirit with most cheering description of what must do when got ashore for god must be sure to direct to place where might without difficulty recover strength hitherto have not spoken a soon a began to distinguish feature of shore be approaching unclosed lip again same triumphant smile played around frank henniker do know that rock yes can be possible o what gracious providence have be watching over be rock of remarkable shape stood short distance from fishing pool must not be otherwise gannet have led to old haunt be approaching island looked at companion be praying immediately joined with in thanksgiving for signal mercy have be vouchsafed to in little more than hour have priceless satisfaction of carrying from shore to cottage then carefully nursed ourselves till recovered effect of dreadful cruise chapter forty eight numerous pursuit a stated in preceding chapter obliging to constant occupation kept from useless repining about destiny in being obliged to live so many year on far distant corner of earth have long ceased to look for passing ship scarcely ever thought about have given up speculation about grandfather reception of rarely went out to sea except to fish never cared to trouble about anything beyond limited space have become inheritance reader then may judge of surprise when one sultry day have be busily engaged for several hour cutting down field of wheat mr reichardt came running to with astounding news that there be ship off island boat full of people have just left be rowing towards rock hastily took glass have brought with a soon a must get to convenient position threw on ground on rock reconnoitred through glass appearance of newcomer soon noticed that part be well armed be not case with rest for be pinioned in such manner that must scarcely move hand foot concealed by lying length on grass a boat approached must discern that unarmed party belonged to superior class of men while many of others have countenance did not prepossess at in favour lay hid in long grass from must command view of approaching visitor think understand whispered mr reichardt there be mischief here have not better run home get arm asked replied have better not if be able to do good must do by stratagem let watch movement act with great caution companion advice be saw wisest must be pursued therefore remained in hiding place narrowly observing visitor a approached entered fishing pool must then distinctly not only see hear to extreme surprise one of first men who jumped out of boat be john gough who have brought mr reichardt to island looked older recognised in moment so did companion admonitory hush kept from betraying place of concealment so great be astonishment having long believed lawless associate to have be lost at sea be well armed evidently possessed authority nevertheless thought must detect air of concern in feature a offered to help one of captive out of boat latter however regarded with air of disdain though hand be tied behind leaped ashore without assistance be man of commanding stature with well bronzed face look of great energy of character wore band of gold lace round cap have on duck trouser blue jacket waistcoat come captain exclaimed john gough bear malice though have be rather hard upon wo leave to starve be deuced deal better off than desarves to be cried man from boat whom at once recognised a fellow on whom have drawn knife for hurting nero if have made walk plank a proposed be blowed if must have be much more to purpose than putting on here island with lot o prog everything calkilated to make domineering officer comfortable for rest of day hold tongue mutineering rascal exclaimed captain angrily rope end at yard arm will be desert before long thank ye kindly captain replied fellow touching hat in mockery must be pleased to remember ai caught yet mean to have many jolly cruise in ship get end o treasure before will think o latter end then mean to die like christian repent o sin make much more edifying example than must exhibit dangling at end of rope men laughed captain muttered something about pirate mutineer rest of officer wisely held tongue now noticed elderly man of very respectable appearance who be not pinioned like rest hair be quite white complexion very pale looked like one oppressed with deep sorrow anxiety rose from seat in boat be assisted out by john gough be very sorry that be obliged to leave here mr evelyn said gough see sir have alternative must keep with for many reason therefore have be obliged to make sharer in fate of officer werry painful be to feeling sir may believe said of mutineer mockingly be quite moloncholy a think on men again laughed person so addressed walked to side of captain without making observation other captive also left boat in silence be eight in four of be evidently common seaman by dress others be officer be well made strong men what precious pretty colony will make hearties exclaimed one of mutineer jeeringly a helped to land cask other package that have brought with be thousand pity ai got female associate that might marry settle bring up respectable family talking of woman cried one who have first spoken wonder what became of one left here so cleverly when be wrecked at here place six year ago john gough looked uneasy at inquiry a if recollection be not agreeable to little savage continued fellow what be going to send knife into rib for summat other forget what must have died long ago ai no doubt a unfortnitely left nothin ' to live upon doubt died hand in hand like babe in wood said still observed john gough seemed distressed at turn conversation have taken now mate said hurriedly let return to ship have done what came to do vote a will go see arter missionary woman little savage cried fourth must like somehow to see whether be living not stroll ashore wo do on harm will remain here till return said john gough threw on grass with back towards only few yard from place in be concealed rest after making fast boat started off on exploring expedition in direction of old hut chapter forty nine captive be grouped together sitting standing not one of looked dejected at fate though must see by movement that be impatient of bond tied attention be most frequently directed to old gentleman who have be addressed a mr evelyn notwithstanding grief expressed in countenance possessed air of benevolence kindness of heart that even settled melancholy did not conceal must not understand why felt deeper interest for person than for of others sort of yearning towards mingled with desire to protect from malice of enemy almost a soon a be gone john gough beckoned to mr evelyn to sit down by side possibly be done to prevent assisting companion to regain liberty a not being pinioned like rest might easily have done might have overpowered guard before companion must come to assistance gough be well armed rest being without weapon of kind be scarcely probable that must have risked life on so desperate attempt mr evelyn came quietly sat down in place indicated observed with increasing interest singular to relate more gazed on venerable face more strongly felt assured that have seen before of course be impossible nevertheless fancy took possession of experienced strange sensation of pleasure a watched change feature underwent john gough be sorry to see mixed up in miserable business said mildly addressing companion other did not answer a back be turned towards must not observe effect observation have upon men who have left know to be bad men continued speaker expect nothing wickedness from be aware have be better brought up responsibility therefore becomes greater in assisting in villainy have better not let hear mr evelyn replied gough at last in something like surly tone must not answer for consequence fear other answered result of transaction can make very little difference to man on verge of grave who have outlived relative have nothing left to fall back upon memory of misfortune to one in prime of life like who can boast of friend relative who feel interest in good name result must be serious indeed what must be feeling of respectable father when learns that have joined gang of pirate how intense must be grief of amiable mother when hears that have paid penalty must sooner later overtake for embracing so lawless life come mr evelyn exclaimed gough though with tremulousness in voice betrayed state of feeling have right to preach to have done a much a must for men must have made short work with if have not interposed pointed out to uninhabited island where seems left poor woman to be starved to death continued mr evelyn be fault of mine replied man did must to prevent must have be more manly if have remained with on rock left cowardly associate to take selfish course be weak irresolute john gough too easily persuaded into evil too slow to follow impulse of good murder of poor woman be a much deed a if have blown brain out before abandoned indeed know what latter must have be le criminal john gough made answer think however mind be quite easy under accusation for seemed restless kept playing with pistol with eye cast down complicity in mutiny too john gough be equally inexcusable continued mr evelyn be duty to have stood by captain manvers officer by must have earned eternal gratitude handsome provision from owner of vessel be use talking of thing now mr evelyn said gough hurriedly have taken course be too late to turn back must to god added dashing hand violently against brow have have nothing to do with be never too late john gough to do good here cried out mr reichardt a rose from place of concealment a much to surprise a of who must observe nothing must equal astonishment of gough when first caught sight of feature sprang to foot leaving pistol on ground clasping hand together exclaimed thank god be safe yes replied approaching taking hand kindly by interposition of providence be saved from guilt of one murder in name of god who have so signally preserved against command to abandon present wicked design man hesitated seemed a if must not take gaze from face be evident that presence exerted extraordinary influence over in mean time have made appearance on scene not le to astonishment of looker on first act be to take possession of pair of pistol gough have left on ground next to hurry to group of captive who have be regarding in state a be of perfect bewilderment with american knife to cut bond will do think proper said john gough believe have be reluctantly led into joined mutiny knowing must have be murdered if did not must endeavour to make what amends be in power continued mr reichardt by assisting officer in recovering possession of ship will gladly assist in may think feasible said man must first secure desperate fellow who have just left a be poorly provided with weapon that of will be service of slight danger to get possession of ship be afraid will be still more hazardous will find in front of danger here captain manvers others came up to where
