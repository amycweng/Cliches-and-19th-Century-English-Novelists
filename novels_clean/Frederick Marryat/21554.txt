when went off deck to dinner came down into top made bed for in one of top gallant studding sail desiring man who have look out to call before lieutenant be likely to come on deck very quietly began to prepare sacrifice to favourite deity somnus a look out man did not see lieutenant come up be caught napping just at dusk when lieutenant came on deck did honour to remember where have left looking at fore top mast head called down like milton devil who be found sleeping by one dread up sprung regained perch by topsail tie supposing rather hoping that must not see before mast in obscurity of evening be too lynx eyed have not presence of mind enough not to see what must not have seen called to three men in top inquired where be replied at mast head what exclaimed handstone with oath did not see moment go up by topsail tie sir said men be now asleep at mast head come down here lying rascal one of said lieutenant will teach to speak truth who have by time quietly resumed station be ordered down along with four stood on quarter deck while following interrogation be put to now sir said first lieutenant to captain of top how dare tell that young gentleman be at mast head when saw shining ' up by topsail tie be sorry for men who to save have got into jeopardy be just going to declare truth take whole odium upon when to utter astonishment man boldly answered be at mast head sir upon honour honour cried lieutenant with contempt then turning to other men put same question to in succession received same positive answer so really began to think have be at mast head time have be

constancy of martyr have consequence be on alone must have have hesitation in speaking truth lieutenant be to blame first by too great severity secondly by too rigid inquiry into subject not worth

hoped must have fun ashore a admiral be not come in must wait for tired of kicking about at sea must take dud with bring to anchor on shore not come afloat again till saluted flag first lieutenant believed one word of indeed always acted upon exact reverse of what said be well did so in instance after have anchored went ashore in about hour returned stated that admiral be not expected till next

surgeon report be more favourable be still unwilling to go on board captain sent affectionate message to say that if did not come must send file of marine to bring even came threatened when finding there be witness in room plainly told that if persisted in having on board must be to own destruction for be fully determined to bring to court martial for drunkenness unofficerlike conduct moment joined admiral told of state in have found recapitulated blasphemy lubberly conduct in losing two men stared endeavoured to explain be peremptory whined gave in seeing be in power well then dear

annoying to annoying so saying held out hand to shook with hearty good will sincerely hoping that might never meet again either in world next be afterwards brought to court martial for repeated act of drunkenness cruelty be finally dismissed service in giving detail of captain g peculiarity let not be imagined that even at period such character be common in service have already said that be singular impressment want of officer at early part of war gave opportunity of becoming lieutenant took weak side of admiral to obtain next step obtained command of sloop from repeated solicitation at admiralty by urging claim of long servitude service have received serious injury by admitting men on quarter deck from before mast occasioned there being two class of officer in navy namely who have rank connection who have entered by hawsehole a be described first be favoured when young did not acquire competent knowledge of duty second with few exception a advanced in grade proved from want of

precludes favouritism perfectly bar entrance to such men a captain g after battle of trafalgar when england europe be indebted for safety to british fleet navy became popular aristocracy crowded into forwarded still more melioration of service under succeeding naval administration silent certain gradual improvement in men officer ship took place subsequently navy have be still more fortunate in having officer called to council whose active constant employment at sea previous to peace of paris have given thorough insight into want abuse unconnected with party unawed by power have dared to do duty be highly to credit of first lord who have so long presided at board that suggestion of officer have met with due consideration can therefore assure reader that a long a advice be attended to

thompson be much applauded by on board asked why ventured life for people who have used so ill answered that mither bible taught to do good must a god have given strong arm hoped must always use for benefit of brother in need might have be supposed that act like must have prevented recurrence of further insult more american perceived thompson value more eager be to have a own second mate whom have already described a rough brutal fellow one day proposed to to belong to vessel certain added that must make fortune by capture of two if not three extra indiaman have information of on passage thompson looked man fully in face said did ye hear what telled captain ither day yes said man knew that be what call in country eye ' call so in country said caledonian at same time planting fist so full plump in left eye of mate that fell like humi bos covering very large part of deck with huge carcass man got up found face bleeding plentifully eye closed instead of resenting insult went off complained to captain many of american from hatred jealousy went along with clamorously demanded that englishman must be punished for striking officer when story however came to be fairly explained captain said be bound to confess that second mate be aggressor inasmuch a have acknowledged that knew penalty of transgression before committed act that captain have told thompson when made declaration that thought perfectly right consequently be bound to protect by law of hospitality a well a gratitude after service in saving life of countryman did not satisfy crew be clamorous for punishment mutiny be actually headed by second mate there be however large party on board who be in humour to see englishman treated with such indignity of what country be may readily be conjectured dispute ran high began to think that serious consequence might ensue for have continued from serving of grog at twelve o'clock till near two when casting eye over larboard quarter perceived sail told captain of instantly hailed look out man at mast head look out man have be so much interested with what be going on upon deck that have come down into maintop to listen see that sail on larboard

have just returned from maintop where have spent last quarter of hour in most intense absorbed attention to cut of stranger sail if e'er saw wood canvas put together before in shape of ship that there be one of john bull bellowing calf of ocean not le than forty four gunner what say to leftenant said captain oh a to said mate be very likely that be going to tell truth because must not have done in same situation said just so said mate in fact must own have particular wish to cruise for month in vessel go back for water at tristan d'acunha therefore did not use very best optical skill when gave opinion a saw stranger be nearing very fast although be steering same way made mind up must very soon be out of vessel on way to england where happiness prospect be centred chief mate took one more
