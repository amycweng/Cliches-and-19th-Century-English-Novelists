be not little proud of of praise received from edward old forester next day jacob stated intention of going to lymington to dispose of large portion of venison bring back sack of oatmeal for cake edward asked to accompany jacob replied edward must not think of showing at lymington where else for long while until be grown out of memory must be folly must risk sister brother life perhaps a well a own never mention again time will come when will be necessary perhaps if so can not be helped at present must be known immediately edward tell mean to do have little money left intend to buy gun that may learn to stalk deer without for recollect if accident must happen to who be there to provide for brother sister at lymington be known to many out of who know there be not one who know where cottage be know live in new forest supply venison purchase other article in return be that know may therefore go without fear will sell venison to morrow bring back good gun humphrey will have carpenter tool wish for for think by what doe with knife that have turn way may be useful must also get other tool for humphrey a will then be able to work together thread needle for alice for can sew little practice will make more perfect jacob went off to lymington a have proposed returned late at night with white billy well loaded have sack of oatmeal spade hoe saw chisel other tool two scythe two three pronged fork when edward came to meet put into hand gun with very long barrel believe edward that will find that good one for know where came from belonged to one of ranger who be reckoned

set in will keep well will practice at mark with gun that may be accustomed to for gun even best require little humoring edward who have often fired gun before proved next morning that have very good eye after two three hour practice hit mark at hundred yard almost time wish must let go out by said edward overjoyed at success must bring home nothing boy replied jacob have great deal to learn yet tell what will do time that be not in great want of venison will have first fire well will do replied edward winter now set in with great severity remained almost altogether within door jacob boy went out to get firewood dragged home through snow wish jacob said humphrey be able to build cart for must be very useful white billy must then have something to do ca make wheel there be harness be not bad idea of yours humphrey replied jacob will think about if ca build cart perhaps can buy one must be useful if be only to take dung out of yard on potato ground for have hitherto carried out in basket be hard work yes might saw wood into billet carry home in cart instead of dragging in way shoulder be quite sore with rope cut so well when weather break up will see what can do humphrey just now road be so blocked up that think must get cart from lymington to cottage although can horse perhaps if remained in door during inclement weather be not idle jacob took opportunity to instruct child in thing alice learned how to wash how to cook be true that sometimes scalded little sometimes burned finger other accident did from article employed being too heavy for to lift by practice dexterity compensated for want of strength fewer accident happened day humphrey have carpenter tool although at first have many failure wasted nail wood by degree learned to use tool with more dexterity made several little useful article little edith must now do something for made baked oatmeal cake saved alice good deal of time trouble in watching be astonishing how much child must do now that there be one to do for have daily instruction from jacob in evening alice sat down with needle thread to mend clothes at first be not very well done improved day edith humphrey learned to read while alice worked then alice learned thus passed winter away so rapidly that although have be five month at cottage did not appear a if have be there a many week be happy contented with exception perhaps of edward who have fit of gloominess occasionally showed sign of impatience a to what be passing in world of remained in ignorance that edward beverley have fit of gloominess impatience be not surprising edward have be brought up a heir of arnwood boy at very early age imbibes notion of position if promise to be high one be not two mile from property by right be own own mansion have be reduced to ash be hidden in forest must not feel position sighed for time when king cause must be again triumphant arrival at age when must in person support uphold cause longed to be in command a father have be to lead men on to victory to recover property to revenge on who have acted so cruelly toward be human nature much a jacob armitage must expostulate with try to divert feeling into other channel long a must preach to about forgiveness of injury patience until better time must come edward must not help brooding over thought if ever there be breast animated with intense hatred against puritan be that of edward beverley although be to be lamented must not create surprise wonder in old forester must do be a much a possible to reason with to soothe irritated feeling by constant employment try to make forget for time feeling of ill will have conceived one thing be however sufficiently plain to edward be that might be wrong have not power at present to redress feeling perhaps more than other held in sort of check a time when might have opportunity appeared far distant even to own sanguine imagination so by degree did contrive to dismiss from thought what be use to think about at present chapter v a have before said time passed rapidly with exception of one two excursion after venison remained in cottage jacob never went to lymington frost have broken up snow have long disappeared tree began to bud sun became powerful in month of may forest began again to look green now edward said jacob armitage one day at breakfast will try for venison again to sell at lymington for must purchase humphrey cart harness so let get gun go out fine morning stag be mostly by at season for doe be with young calf must find slot of deer track to lair will have first shot if like that however depends more upon deer than upon have walked four five mile when came upon slot track of deer jacob practiced eye pointed out to edward that be slot of young one not worth following explained to edward difference in hoof mark other sign by knowledge be gained proceeded onward until found slot jacob declared to be that of warrantable stag be one old enough to kill to be good venison must now track to lair edward took about mile farther when arrived at small thicket of thorn about acre in extent here be see edward let now see if be harbored walked round thicket must not find slot track by stag have left covert jacob pronounced that animal must be hid in now edward do stay here while go back to lee side of covert will enter with smoker stag will in probability when be roused come out to breast wind will then have good shot at recollect to fire so a to hit behind shoulder if be moving quick fire little before shoulder if slow take aim accurately recollect if come upon in covert will kill if can for want venison then will go after to give chance jacob then left edward went down to lee side of covert where entered with smoker edward be stationed behind thorn bush grew few yard clear of covert soon heard creaking of branch short time elapsed fine stag came out at trot turned head be just bounding away when edward fired animal fell remembering advice of jacob edward remained where be in silence reloading piece be soon afterward joined by jacob dog well done edward said forester in low voice covering forehead to keep off glare of sun looked earnestly at high brake between thorn tree about half mile to windward think see something there look edward eye be younger than mine be that branch of tree in fern be not see what mean replied edward be not move thought so eye be not so good a once be be stag depend upon how be to get near never can get across patch of clear grass without being seen can not get at from spot replied edward if be to fall back to leeward gain forest again think that there be thorn sufficient from forest to where lie to creep from behind one to other so a to get shot at will require care patience to manage think might be done will try be turn now know have better stay here with dog for only one can hide from thorn to thorn jacob ordering smoker to remain then set off have to make circuit of three mile to get to spot where thorn extended from forest edward saw more of although strained eye until stag sprung out gun be discharged edward perceived that stag be not killed severely wounded running toward covert near be hid down smoker said a cocked gun stag came within shot be coming nearer when seeing edward turned edward fired then cheered on dog who sprung after wounded animal giving tongue a followed edward perceiving jacob hastening toward waited for be hard hit edward cried jacob smoker will have must follow a fast a can caught up gun ran a fast a must when a entered wood heard dog at bay sha have far to go edward animal be done up smoker have at bay hastened on quarter of mile when found that stag have fallen on knee have be seized by throat by smoker mind edward now how go up to for

that have be occasionally looked into by humphrey edward only now then a have too much to do to find much time for reading although sometimes in evening did take up when be considered how young be

larger than hare rabbit must come help must take gun jacob suppose rheumatism be too bad to let come too think can manage be damp hurt so much frosty air will do good perhaps have be much better since snow fell now then let see what have caught will have to walk two mile said humphrey a went out can manage so lead way humphrey went on till came close to clump of large tree then brought to pitfall have dug about six foot wide eight foot long nine foot deep there large trap said humphrey see what have caught in looked down into pit perceived young bull in smoker who be with began to bark furiously at now what be to do think be hurt can get out said humphrey not very well if be calf might be too heavy if be to get out alive must kill after ward so have better shoot at once so think replied humphrey how did catch said edward read of in same book did about trap for hare replied humphrey dug out pit covered with bramble then put snow at top be thicket that herd come to chiefly in winter time be large dry large tree shelter so be why chose spot took large bundle of hay put on snow about pit then strewed more about in small handful so that cattle must find pick up knew must be glad to do now that snow be on ground now see have succeeded well humphrey beat will say said edward will shoot yes now that be looking up edward shot ball through forehead of animal fell dead be then obliged to go home for pony cart rope to get animal out of pit hard job have of too pony helped did get out at last will do easier next time said humphrey will make windlass a soon a can will soon hoist out like turn bucket of water up from well be nice young meat said jacob who be skinning bull not above eighteen month old must think have be full grown one like shot must have remained where be for never must have got out yes jacob must for must have gone down cut up in pit so that must have handed out by bit if must not have managed whole loaded cart with skin quarter of animal then drove home will go far to pay for gun humphrey said jacob if pay for more be glad of said humphrey hope will not be last take that reminds humphrey of one thing think must come back with cart carry away entrails of beast remove blood be on snow for have observed that cattle be very scared with smell sight of blood found that out by once twice seeing come to where have cut throat of stag a soon a have put nose down to where blood be on ground have put tail up galloped away bellowing at terrible rate indeed have heard say that if murder have be committed in wood want to find body that herd of cattle drove into will serve better than even bloodhound thank for telling that jacob for must never have supposed will tell what will also do will load cart with fern litter put at bottom of pit so that if must get heifer calf worth taking may not be hurt by fall must have taken long while to dig pit humphrey yes did a got deeper work be harder then have to carry away earth scatter about be more than month about from time began till be finished have ladder to go up down by at last carried basket of earth up for be too deep to throw out nothing like patience perseverance humphrey have more than have be sure have more than have will ever have be afraid replied edward during winter passed rapidly way very few circumstance of consequence occurred old jacob be more le confined to cottage by rheumatism edward hunted by occasionally with humphrey humphrey be fortunate enough to take bull cow calf in pitfall of about year fifteen month old by rude invention of by way of windlass contrived with assistance of edward to hoist uninjured out of pit be put into yard after having be starved till be tamed followed example of heifer calf became quite tame be important addition to stock a may well be imagined only mishap under labored be old jacob confinement to cottage a winter advanced prevented from going to lymington must not therefore sell venison humphrey by way of experiment smoked venison ham hung up with others there be point on felt anxiety be that jacob must not cross forest to get puppy have be promised time be passed for be now january when be to have called for edward humphrey pressed old man very hard to let one of go only answer must obtain be that 'd be better soon at last finding that got worse instead of better consented that edward must go gave direction how to proceed way be to take description of keeper lodge cautioned to call by name of armitage describe a grandson edward promised to obey jacob direction next morning set off mounted upon white billy with little money in pocket in case must want wish be going with said humphrey a walked by side of pony wish be humphrey for part feel a if be slave set at liberty do justice to old jacob kindness good will acknowledge how much be indebted to still to be housed up here in forest never seeing speaking to one shut out from world doe not suit edward beverley father be soldier right good one if be old enough think even now must escape join royal party broken a may be by account be at moment deer stalking be very well fly at higher game feel same a do replied humphrey recollect edward that old man very infirm what must become of sister if be to leave know well humphrey have idea of leaving may be sure wish be with relation in safety then must be free to act yes must edward recollect that be not yet men boy of fifteen thirteen can not do much although may wish to do much be true that be only fifteen replied edward be strong enough so be think if have fair cut at man head must make stagger under be a big a buffalo a young a have be to war know well recollect father promising must go with a soon a be fifteen what puzzle replied humphrey be fear that old jacob have of being seen at lymington why what fear be there can not tell more than in opinion fear be only in own imagination surely must not hurt if walked about without arm like other people because father have fought for king that have beheaded people be true then be plotting in king favor in other way opposed to parliament have gathered from jacob can not see what have to fear if remain quiet now come question edward for jacob have believe said more to on one subject than have to suppose be to leave forest what must be first step must take must of course state who be take possession of father property at arnwood be mine by descent exactly so jacob think say must be ruin for property be sequestered a call forfeited to parliament in consequence of father having fought against on king side no longer belongs to must not be allowed to take on contrary must in probability be imprisoned who know what might then take place see there be danger did jacob say to yes did told dare not speak to on subject be so fiery if heard that property be confiscated must certainly do rash act that thing of kind must be pretense for laying hold of then said that did not think that must live long for be weaker day that only hoped life must be spared year two that might keep quiet till better time came said that if supposed that be burned in house when be fired must give fair opportunity of calling impostor treating accordingly that there be so many anxious to have gift of property that must have thousand of people compassing death said that making known claiming property must be very conduct that enemy must wish to follow must be attended with most fatal consequence for said to prove that be edward beverley must declare that sister be in forest with disclosure must put whole family in power of bitterest enemy what must become of sister must be impossible to say most likely must be put under charge of puritan family who must have pleasure in ill treating humiliating daughter of such man a colonel beverley why did not tell be afraid to say thing to thought that must be so mad at idea of injustice that must do something rash said pray night that otherwise useless life may be spared for be to die know edward must quit forest never while sister be under protection replied edward be safe must be out of to morrow think edward there be great truth in what jacob say must do good for must not restore property by making seclusion known at present might do great deal of harm 'bide time ' be good advice in such troubled time therefore think must be very wary if be still think that there be fear of going out of forest in present dress under name of armitage one must recognize be grown tall so be be so tanned sunburned with air exercise that do look more like child of forest than son of colonel beverley humphrey speak very sensibly agree with be not quite so fiery a old man think if bosom burn with indignation at event have sufficient power to conceal feeling when be necessary can oppose art to art if becomes requisite from what have said believe now be really so one thing be certain that while king charles be prisoner a now be party dispersed gone abroad can hing to make known must only be to injure of keep quiet therefore certainly will also remain a be now under false name still must will mix up with other people know what be going on be willing to live in forest protect sister a long a be necessary so to do although will reside here will not be confined to forest altogether be exactly what think too edward what wish let not be too hasty even in now will wish pleasant ride edward if can procure of keeper small shot for much wish to have will not forget good by brother humphrey returned home to attend farmyard while edward continued journey through forest estimate of character of two boy may be formed from above conversation edward be courageous impetuous hasty in resolve still open to conviction brought up a heir to property felt more than humphrey must be expected to do mortification of being left pauper after such high prospect in early day vindictive feeling against opposite party be therefore more keen spirit mounted more from conviction under labored disposition be naturally warlike disposition have be fostered by father when be child still kinder heart more generous lad never existed humphrey be of much more subdued philosophical temperament not perhaps so well calculated to lead a to advise there be great prudence in united with courage be passive courage rather than active one courage if assailed must defend valiantly must be wary reflective before must attack humphrey have not that spirit of chivalry possessed by edward be younger son have to earn in way own fortune felt that inclination be more for peace than strife moreover humphrey have talent edward have not natural talent for mechanic inquisitive research into science a far a limited education must permit be more fitted for engineer agriculturist than for soldier although there be doubt that must have made very brave soldier if such be to have become avocation for kindness generosity of nature be equal to brother be reason why angry word never passed between for question between be not must have way must give up most to wish of other hardly need say that there never be two brother who be more attached who so mutually respected other chapter viii edward put pony to trot in two hour be on other side of new forest direction given to by jacob be not forgotten before be noon found at gate of keeper house dismounting hanging bridle of pony over rail walked through small garden neatly kept so early in year not over gay except that crocus snowdrop be peeping rapped at door with knuckle girl of about fourteen very neatly dressed answered summons be oswald partridge at home maiden said edward young man be not be in forest when will return toward evening be time unless be more than usually successful have come distance to find replied

time to come for have sent there be dog young old large small in kennel so far do know more fear then must wait till return replied edward will speak to father replied young girl if will wait one moment in minute two girl returned saying that father begged that must walk in must speak with edward bowed followed young girl who led way to room in be seated man dressed after fashion of roundhead of day steeple crowned hat lay on chair with sword beneath be sitting at table covered with paper here be youth father said girl having said crossed room took seat by side of fire man must rather say gentleman for have appearance of one notwithstanding somber peculiar dress wore continued to read letter have just opened edward who feared prisoner of roundhead when only expected to meet keeper be further irritated by neglect shown toward by party forgetting that be by own assertion not edward beverley relative of one jacob armitage colored up with anger a stood at door fortunately time that took other party to read through letter gave edward also time for recollecting disguise under appeared color subsided from cheek remained in silence occasionally meeting look of little girl who when eye met immediately withdrew glance what be business young man at last said gentleman at table came sir on private business with keeper oswald partridge to obtain two young hound promised to grandfather jacob armitage armitage said other party referring to list on table armitage jacob yes see be one of verderers why have not be here to call upon for what reason must call upon sir replied edward simply young man because new forest be by parliament committed to charge notice have be given for who be employed to come here that might be permitted to remain be discharged a may deem most advisable jacob armitage have heard nothing of sir replied edward be keeper appointed under king for two three year allowance have never be paid have lived on own cottage be left to by father being own property pray may ask young man do live with jacob armitage have done so for more than year a relation have received pay allowance a state pray by what mean have maintained how have other keeper maintained replied edward put question to sir replied gentleman be pleased to reply to mine what have be mean of subsistence of jacob armitage if think have mean of subsistence sir be mistaken replied edward have land of own cultivate have pony cart have pig cow have be sufficient have patriarch more replied edward be pithy at reply young man know something of jacob armitage know continued putting finger close to writing opposite name on list with whom have associated with whom have served now allow to put one question have come say for two young hound be service required for pig cow to what us be to be put have a good dog a there be in forest replied edward wished to have others in case must lose a good dog a in forest good for what for hunting then acknowledge that do hunt acknowledge nothing for jacob armitage may answer for replied edward allow to assure that if have killed venison one can blame perhaps will explain why nothing be more easy jacob armitage served king charles who employed a verderer in forest paid wage who must not have done so rebelled against king took authority from mean of paying employed be still servant of king for be not dismissed having other mean of support considered that good master must be too happy that must support by killing for subsistence that venison must no longer preserve for without eating then admit that jacob armitage have killed deer in forest admit nothing for jacob armitage admit that have killed will not answer question sir in first place be not here to criminate in next must know by what authority have right to inquire young man replied other in severe tone if wish to know authority malapert a be at remark edward started yet recollecting compressed lip stood still be commission appointing agent of parliament to take charge superintend new forest with power to appoint dismiss whom please presume must take word for a can not read write edward stepped up to table very quietly took up paper read have stated what be correct sir said laying down date of be perceive on th of last month december be therefore eighteen day old what inference must draw from young man replied gentleman looking up to with astonishment simply sir jacob armitage have be laid up with rheumatism for three month during time certainly have not killed venison now sir until parliament took forest into hand undoubtedly belonged to majesty if doe not now therefore jacob armitage for slaughter may have committed be up to present only answerable to sovereign king charles be easy to perceive school in have be brought up young man even if there be not evidence on paper that forefather served under cavalier colonel beverley have be brought up to way of thinking sir be base dog bite hand feed replied edward with warmth jacob armitage father before be retainer in family of colonel beverley be indebted to for situation held in forest indebted to for thing revere name uphold cause for fell a do young man if speak advisedly at event speak gratefully neither have word of disrespect to offer to memory of colonel beverley who be gallant man true to cause espoused although be not holy one in position can not in justice to whom serve give place emolument to who have be still be a may judge by expression adverse to present government sir replied edward language with respect to colonel beverley have made feel respect for confess did not at first what say be very just not that think harm jacob armitage a in first place know that must not serve under in next that be too old infirm to hold situation have occasion for a cottage land be own can not remove have title presume replied gentleman have title given to grandfather long before king charles be born presume parliament intend to invalidate act of former king may inquire what relation be to jacob armitage believe have said before grandson live with do if old man dy will inherit property edward smiled looking at young girl said now ask maiden if father doe not presume upon office young girl laughed said be in authority not over certainly not over grandfather for have dismissed be brought up at cottage young man sir be brought up at arnwood be playmate of child of colonel beverley educated with yes for a far a willfulness must permit chaplain be always ready to give instruction where be when arnwood be burned down be at cottage at time replied edward grinding teeth looking wildly nay nay can forgive expression of feeling on part young man when dreadful disgraceful deed be brought to memory be stain can never be effaced deed most diabolical what thought must call down vengeance of heaven if prayer must avert did avert be not wanting on side edward remained silent admission on part of roundhead prevented explosion on part felt that be not so bad a have imagined after long pause said when came here sir be to seek oswald partridge obtain hound have promised presume that journey be now useless why so because have control of forest will not permit dog for chase to be given away to who be not employed by power now govern have judged correctly in so far that duty be to prevent a promise be made previous to date of commission presume said smiling think have right to interfere a will be ex post facto case if do will not therefore interfere only must point out to that law be still same relative to who take deer in forest by stealth understand yes sir do if will not be offended will give candid reply speak then consider that deer in forest belong to king charles who be lawful sovereign own authority from hold answerable to alone for deer may kill feel sure of permission full forgiveness for what may do may be opinion good sir will not be opinion of ruling power if caught will be punished that by in pursuance of authority vested in well sir if so so be have dismissed armitages on account of upholding king can not therefore be surprised that uphold more than ever can be surprised if dismissed verderer becomes poacher can be surprised if poacher be caught that incurs penalty replied roundhead so now there be end of argument if go into kitchen will find wherewithal to refresh outward man if wish to remain till oswald partridge come home be welcome edward who felt indignant at being dismissed to kitchen nodded head smiled upon little girl left room well thought a went along passage came here for two puppy have found roundhead know how be be not angry with a thought must be little girl have nice smile be quite handsome when smiled be kitchen to thought lord of arnwood be dismissed by covenanter roundhead

have better go to kennel dog may hear ca repeat little thought to have met one here when came said edward will now tell passed between new intendant edward then related conversation have be bold said oswald perhaps be better be to retain situation so be two others there be many new hand coming in a ranger know nothing of that be little fitted for place rail against king day long suppose be chief merit in eye of who appoint however one thing be certain that if fellow can not stalk deer will do can to prevent others so must be on alert for punishment be severe fear not only difficulty be that will not be able to find sale for venison now replied edward oh never fear will give name of who will take venison off hand without risk on part except in killing of will meet in park lay down ready money take away know have idea that new intendant what may call be not so severe a pretend to be indeed permitting to say what did own word relative to colonel convince that be right in opinion formed

heel edward have much to reflect upon a rode back to cottage felt that position be one of more difficulty than before old jacob armitage must not last much longer be convinced even now poor old man be shrunk away to skeleton with pain disease that livelihood to be procured from forest must be attended with peril now that order have be restored forest be no longer neglected be certain rejoiced that humphrey have by assiduity intelligence made farm so profitable a promised to be indeed felt that if necessary must live upon proceeds of farm not run risk of imprisonment by stalking deer have told intendant that considered game a king property be resolved that must at event run risk although must no longer permit humphrey so to do if thing happens to thought edward humphrey will still be at cottage to take care of sister if be obliged to fly country will suit well feeling a can then offer service to who still support king with thought many others amused until late in evening arrived at

young only grown on southern aspect depend upon will fall in with not four mile from where now be if not nearer must stalk a do deer must not wo allow to approach within shot humphrey will said edward have to take chance edward will allow to advance within shot bull will then advance upon while herd increase distance on other hand if stalk may kill one then report of gun will frighten others away in first instance there be risk in second there be none there be more fatigue trouble choose a please will act a decide well humphrey since give choice think that time will take bull by horn a saying be be if there be tree near for if herd be in open place must not run risk if can fire upon fall back upon tree in case of bull charging will take openly with heart edward think will be very hard if with two gun smoker to back manage to be master of field however must survey well before make approach if can get within shot without alarming irritating of course will do so bull be very savage at spring time observed edward be so at time a far a can see of replied humphrey be near to now must think yes there be herd there be sure enough replied edward now have not to do with deer need not to be so very cautious still animal be wary keep sharp look out must approach quietly by slipping from tree to tree smoker to heel down quiet smoker good dog edward humphrey stopped to load gun then approached herd in manner have be proposed be very soon within two hundred yard of cattle behind large oak when stopped to reconnoiter herd contained about seventy head of cattle of various size age be feeding in direction scattered a young grass be very short although herd be spread over many acre of land edward pointed out to humphrey that full grown large bull be on outside a if ready to defend others in case of attack humphrey said edward one thing be clear a herd be placed at present must have bull nothing be impossible to get within shot of others without passing bull depend upon passage will be disputed moreover herd will take to flight will get nothing at well replied humphrey beef be beef a say beggar must not be chooser so let be bull if must be so let get nearer to then will decide what will do steady smoker advanced gradually hiding from tree to tree until be within eighty yard of one of bull animal did not perceive a be now within range again stepped behind tree to consult now edward think that must be best to separate can fire from where be will crawl through fern get behind tree very well do so replied edward if can manage get to tree with low branch then perhaps will be within shot of white bull be coming down in direction smoker lie down can not go with humphrey will not be safe distance of tree humphrey ventured to get to be one about one hundred fifty yard from where edward be standing humphrey crawled along for time in fern at last came to bare spot of about ten yard wide be not aware of where must not be concealed humphrey hesitated at last decided upon attempting to cross edward who be one moment watching motion of humphrey at of two animal nearest to perceived that white bull farthest from nearest to humphrey threw head in air pawed with foot then advanced with roar to where humphrey be on ground still crawling toward tree having passed open spot being now not many yard from tree perceiving danger that brother be in that moreover humphrey be not aware of hardly knew how to act bull be too far from to fire at with chance of success how to let humphrey know that animal have discovered be making toward without calling out did not know be thought of moment then edward determined to fire at bull nearest to have promised not to do till humphrey be also ready to fire after firing to call to humphrey therefore for one moment turned away from brother taking aim at bull fired gun probably from nerve being little shaken at idea of humphrey being in danger wound be not mortal bull galloped back to herd formed closed phalanx about quarter of mile distant edward then turned to where brother be perceived that bull have not made off with rest of cattle be within thirty yard of humphrey advancing upon that humphrey be standing up beside tree with gun ready to file humphrey fired a appeared also missed aim animal made at humphrey with great quickness dropped gun swinging by lower bough be into tree out of bull reach in moment edward smiled when perceived that humphrey be safe still be prisoner for bull went round round tree roaring looking up at humphrey edward thought minute then loaded gun ordered smoker to run in to bull dog who have only be restrained by edward keeping down at foot sprung forward to attack edward have intended by calling to dog to induce bull to follow till within gun shot before bull have be attacked edward observed that one two more of bull have left herd be coming at rapid pace toward under circumstance edward perceived that only chance be to climb into tree did taking good care to take gun ammunition with having safely fixed in forked bough edward then surveyed position of party there be humphrey in tree without gun bull who have pursued humphrey be now running at smoker who appeared to be aware that be to decoy bull toward edward for kept retreating toward in mean time two other bull be quite close at hand mingling bellowing roaring with first one of a near to edward a first bull be engaged with smoker at last one of advancing bull stood still pawing ground a if disappointed at not finding enemy not forty yard from where edward be perched edward took good aim when fired bull fell dead edward be reloading piece when heard howl looking round saw smoker flying up in air having be tossed by first bull at same time observed that humphrey have descended from tree

direction to artificer when revery be suddenly disturbed by holdfast barking springing forward in advance edward who have by time got over more than journey looked up perceived confronted by powerful man apparently about forty year of age dressed a verderer of forest thought at time that have seldom seen person with more sinister forbidding countenance how now young fellow what be doing here said man walking up to cocking gun held in hand a advanced edward quietly cocked own gun be loaded when perceived that hostile preparation on part of other person then replied be walking across forest a may perceive yes perceive be walking be walking with dog gun will now be pleased to walk with deer stealer be not longer permitted to range forest be deer stealer replied edward will be quite

think twice before act once let proceed in peace may lose place if by own rashness lose life there be something so cool so determined in edward quiet manner that verderer hesitated perceived that attempt to take edward must be at risk of own life knew that order be to apprehend poacher not to shoot people be true that resistance with firearm must warrant acting in self defense admitting that must succeed be doubtful still edward have not be caught in act of killing venison have witness to prove what have occurred also knew that intendant have given very strict order a to shedding of blood be most averse to under circumstance there be something in edward appearance manner so different from common person that be puzzled moreover edward have stated that be going to intendant house thing considered a found that bullying must not succeed thought advisable to change tone therefore said tell that be going to intendant house have business there presume if took prisoner be there must have conducted so young man may now walk on before thank replied edward walk on before will not if choose to half cock gun again walk by side will do same be term will listen to other so be pleased to make

where edward have be first received now said patience extending hand to edward thanks many thanks for preserving from so dreadful death know how unhappy have be at not being able to give poor thanks for courageous behavior hand still remained in edward while said rate what did too highly replied edward must have done same for one in such distress be duty a man cavalier be about to say checked sit

call down blessing on head what can do for begged partridge to bring here that might find out oh sir do pray let know how can show gratitude by something more than word have shown already mistress patience replied edward have not honored poor forester with hand in friendship even admitted to sit down before who have preserved life at risk of own becomes to a brother at least feel a sister toward debt be still debt whether indebted to king to forester mistress patience be real word that must not have hesitated to have used do imagine that be ashamed of calling to tell candidly truth then replied patience can not believe that be what profess to be mean to say that although forester now be never brought up a such father have opinion allied to mine thank for good opinion of fear can not raise above condition of forester nay from father coming down here new regulation have chance of sinking down to lower grade of deer stealer poacher indeed have not be that have gun with must have be seized a such very day a came over be not shooting deer be sir inquired patience be not have killed since last saw be glad that can say that to father replied patience will much please said to that thought capable of much higher employment than must be offered here only wished to know what must accept have interest great interest although just now at variance with ruler of country on account of murder of king must must have said mistress patience have heard how much be opposed to foul deed honor for how kind how truly kind be to say so said patience tear starting in eye what pleasure to hear father conduct praised by why of course mistress patience of way of thinking must praise father be in london hear yes be that reminds that must want refreshment after walk will call phoebe so saying patience left room fact be mistress patience be reminded that have be sitting with young man time alone with be not quite proper in time when phoebe appeared with cold viand retreated out of hearing remained in room edward partook of meal offered in silence patience occupying with work keeping eye fixed on unless when gave slight glance at table to see if thing be required when meal be over phoebe removed tray then edward rose to take leave nay go yet have much to say first let again ask how can serve never can take office under present ruler of nation so question be at rest be afraid that must answer so replied patience gravely think blame for many be there already who must gladly retrace step if be possible little thought when opposed king that affair must have ended a have done where do live sir at opposite side of forest in house belonging to now be inherited by grandfather do live alone surely not nay may tell thing for must never repeat what might hurt might not wish to

to have be soldier a soon a be old enough to bear arm perhaps be distantly related to late colonel beverley be not distantly related replied edward who began to feel uneasy at close cross examination still have colonel beverley be alive king still required service have doubt must have be serving under at time now mistress patience have answered so many question of yours may be permitted to ask little about in return have brother none be only child have only one parent alive only one what family be connected with patience looked up with surprise at last question mother name be cooper be

take leave before go let once more thank for saving worthless life said patience well must come again when father be here will be too glad to have opportunity of thanking one who have preserved only child indeed if knew father must feel a much regard for a do be very good although look so stern melancholy have seldom smiled since poor mother death a to father mistress patience will think a well a can of one who be joined to party hold in detestation can say more must not say know must perhaps find out that be not quite so wedded to party a suppose brother in law be great friend of cromwell can assure be in confidence that raise in estimation why then doe hold office did not ask be given to really believe because wished out of way accepted because be opposed to what be going on wished to be away at least infer so much from what have learned be not office of power trust league with present government only one opposes to malpractice replied edward laughing well mistress patience have shown great condescension to poor forester return many thanks for kindness toward will now take leave when will come see father can not say fear that will not be able very soon to look in injured face will not be well for poacher to come near replied edward however day may be taken brought before a prisoner know then be certain to see will not tell to kill deer replied patience if do kill one will harm know little of power father farewell then sir once more gratitude thanks patience held out hand again to edward who time like true cavalier raised respectfully to lip patience colored little did not attempt to withdraw edward with low obeisance quitted room chapter xiii a soon a be out of intendant house edward hastened to cottage of oswald partridge whom found waiting for for verderer have not failed to deliver message have have long talk with mistress patience said oswald after first greeting be glad of a give consequence here roundhead rascal whom met be inclined to be very precise about doing duty insisted that be certain that be on look out for deer stopped mouth by telling often took out with a be best shot in whole forest that intendant knew that did so think that if be caught in act of killing deer have better tell that killed by request will bear out if bring to intendant who will be sure thank for saying so might kill deer in forest after what have done for many thanks think can take advantage of offer let catch if can if do catch let take if can see sir that will accept favor from roundhead replied oswald however a be now head keeper will take care that men interfere with if can help wish be to prevent insult indignity being offered to not being aware who be a be many thanks oswald must take chance edward then told oswald of having taken gipsy boy in pit at appeared much amused what be name of verderer whom met in forest inquired edward james corbould be discharged from army replied oswald like appearance said edward face tell against replied oswald know nothing of have be here little more than fortnight can give corner to put head in to night oswald for will not start till to morrow morning may command have sir replied oswald fear there be little more than hearty welcome have doubt that must be lodged at intendant house if choose oswald young lady be alone will not trust to phoebe accommodation again will stay here if will permit welcome sir will put puppy in kennel at once edward remained that night at oswald at daylight rose having taken slight breakfast throwing gun over shoulder went to kennel for holdfast set off on return home be very nice little girl be word edward found constantly saying to a walked along be of grateful disposition must not have behaved a have done toward supposing to be of mean birth then thought of what have told relative to father edward felt animosity against roundhead wasting fast away be not likely to see again very soon thought edward unless indeed be brought to intendant a prisoner thus thinking upon one subject edward have gained above eight mile of journey across forest when thought that be sufficiently far away to venture to look out for venison remembering there be thicket not far from in there be clear pool of water edward thought very likely that might find stag there cooling for weather be now very warm at noonday therefore called holdfast to proceeded cautiously toward thicket a soon a arrived at spot crouched crept silently through underwood at last arrived close to cleared spot by pool there be stag there fast asleep upon turf lay james corbould sinister looking verderer who have accosted in forest on previous day holdfast be about to bark when edward silenced then advanced to where verderer be lying who having dog with to give notice of edward approach still remained snoring with sun shining on face edward perceived that gun be under on grass took up gently opened pan scattered powder then laid down again for edward said to that man have come out after that be certain a there be witness may be inclined to be mischievous for more wretched looking person never saw have be deer hunting must have brought dog be man hunting be evident now will leave must fall in with anything will not kill at first shot be certain if follows will have same chance of escape a anything else may fire at edward then walked out of covert thinking that if ever there be face proclaimed man to be murderer be that of james corbould a be threading way heard howl of dog on looking round perceived that holdfast be not with turned back holdfast came running to fact be that holdfast have smelled meat in pocket of verderer have be putting nose in to ascertain what be in so doing have wakened up corbould who have saluted with heavy blow on head occasioned puppy to give howl also occasioned corbould to seize gun follow stealthily in track of dog well knew to be one have seen day before with edward edward waited for short time not perceiving corbould made appearance continued on way home having now given up thought of killing venison walked fast be within six mile of cottage when stopped to drink at small rill of water then sat down to rest for short time while so doing fell into one of usual revery forgot how time passed away be however aroused by low growl on part of holdfast immediately occurred to corbould must have followed thinking a well to be prepared quietly loaded gun then rose up to reconnoiter holdfast sprung forward edward looking in direction perceived corbould partly hidden behind tree with gun leveled at heard trigger pulled snap of lock gun did not go off then corbould made appearance striking at holdfast with butt end of gun edward advanced to desired to desist must be worse for indeed younker may be worse for cried corbould might have be if gun have gone off replied edward did not aim at aimed at dog will kill brute if can not without danger to be not that aimed at gun be not pointed low enough to hit dog be leveled at sneaking wretch have only to thank own prudence sleepy head for having escaped with life tell candidly that threw powder out of pan while be asleep if served a deserve must now put bullet into can not kill man who be defenseless that save life set off a fast a can away from for if follow will show more forbearance away with directly continued edward raising gun to shoulder pointing at corbould if be off will fire corbould saw that edward be resolute thought proper to comply with request walked away till considered out of gunshot then commenced torrent of oath abusive language with will not offend reader before went farther swore that must have edward life before many day have passed then shaking fist went away edward remained where be standing till man be fairly out of sight then proceeded on journey be now about four o'clock in afternoon edward a walked on said to that man must be of very wicked disposition for have offended in nothing except in not submitting to be made prisoner be that offense to take man life for be dangerous man will be more dangerous after being again foiled by a have be to day doubt if will go home be almost sure that will turn follow when think that can without seeing if doe will find out where cottage be who know what mischief may not do how may alarm little sister will not go home till dark will now walk in direction may mislead edward then walked away more to north half hour shifted course so a to be walking in very different direction from where cottage stood in mean time grew gradually dark a became so now then when edward passed large tree turned round behind looked to see if corbould be following at last just a be dark perceived figure of man at great distance from who be following running from tree to tree so a to make approach oh be there thought edward now will give nice dance will see whose leg be tired soonest let see where be edward looked round then perceived that be close to clump of tree where humphrey have made pitfall for cattle there be clear spot of about quarter of mile between where now stood edward made up mind immediately walked out to cross clearing calling holdfast to heel be now nearly dark for there be only light of star still there be sufficient light to see way a edward crossed cleared spot once looked round perceived corbould be following nearer than be before trusting probably to increased darkness to hide approach will do thought edward come along fine fellow edward walked on till came to pitfall there stopped looked round soon discovered verderer at hundred yard distance edward held dog by mouth that must not growl bark then went on in direction so a to bring pitfall exactly between corbould having done so proceeded at more rapid pace corbould following also increased till arrived at pitfall must not perceive fell into headlong a fell into pit at same time edward heard discharge of gun crash of small branch laid over cry on part of corbould will do thought edward now may lie there a long a gipsy did will cool courage humphrey pitfall be full of adventure in case have done service now may turn go home a fast a can come holdfast old boy want supper can answer for one for must eat whole of pasty oswald set before morning edward walked at rapid pace quite delighted at issue of adventure a arrived near to cottage found humphrey outside with pablo on look out for soon joined soon after embraced alice edith who have be anxiously waiting for return who have wondered at being out so late give supper dear girl said edward then will know about a soon a edward have satisfied craving appetite for have not a reader must recollect eaten thing since departure early in morning from house of oswald partridge entered into narrative of event of day listened with great interest when edward have finished pablo gipsy boy jumped up said now be in pit to morrow morning take gun shoot pablo must not do replied edward laughing pablo said little edith go sit down must not shoot people shoot master then said pablo very bad man if shoot will be bad boy pablo replied edith who appeared to have assumed authority over pablo did not appear to understand obeyed order of little mistress resumed seat at chimney corner edward said what do propose to do hardly know idea be to let remain there for day two then send to oswald to let know where fellow be only objection to be replied humphrey that say gun went off a fell into pit may be probable that be wounded if so might die if be left there be right humphrey be possible must not have life of fellow creature on conscience think must be advisable edward must set off early to morrow on pony see oswald tell have occurred show where pitfall be believe must be best plan humphrey yes said alice must be dreadful that man must die in so wicked state let be taken out perhaps will repent wo god punish brother said edith yes dear sooner later vengeance of heaven overtakes wicked be very

offered up humphrey be off before daybreak at nine o'clock have arrived at cottage of oswald by whom be warmly greeted before cause of unexpected arrival be made known oswald be greatly annoyed at humphrey narration appeared to be very much of opinion of pablo be to leave scoundrel where be on remonstrance of humphrey set off with two of other verderers before nightfall humphrey arrived at pitfall where heard corbould groaning below who be there said oswald looking into pit be be corbould replied man be hurt yes badly replied corbould when fell gun went off ball have gone through thigh

when have polished up to satisfaction felt le inclined than ever to do thing so after dinner took gun walked out into forest that might indulge in revery walked on quite unconscious of direction in be going more than once finding hat knocked off by branch of tree have not perceived for best of possible reason because eye be cast on ground when ear be saluted with neighing of horse looked up perceived that be near to herd of forest pony first that have seen since have lived in forest roused looked about where can have be wandering to thought edward never fell in with of forest pony before must therefore have walked in direction quite contrary to what usually do know where be scenery be new to what fool be be lucky that nobody except humphrey dig pitfall must probably have be in one by time have brought out gun left dog at home well suppose can find way back edward then surveyed whole herd of pony be at great distance from there be fine horse two among appeared to be leader of herd allowed edward to approach to within two hundred yard then with mane tail streaming in air darted off with rapidity of wind now will puzzle humphrey when go back thought edward say that billy be getting old that wish must get pony will tell what plenty there be propose that must invent way of catching one will be poser for yet be sure that will try for be very ingenious now way be to turn to find way home think ought to be to north be north for there be sun out now perceive look very like rain wonder how long have be walking be sure know edward then hurried in direction considered might lead homeward walked fast once more fell into habit of castle building be talking to king proclaimed in scotland will come over of course will join army then thus went on again absorbed in news have gained from oswald till on sudden again recollected perceived that have lost sight of copse of tree on high hill to have be directing step where be turned round round at last found out that have be walking away from must dream more thought if do indulge in more daydream certainly will neither sleep dream to night be getting dark already here be lost in forest through own foolishness if star shine will not know how to direct step indeed if do know whether have walked south north be in pretty pickle not care for being out in forest on night like sister humphrey will be alarmed at absence best thing can do be to decide upon taking straight line continue in must then get out forest at last even if walk right across will be better than going backward forward round round a will otherwise do just like puppy running alter own tail so now shine out star edward waited until must make out charles wain well knew then polar star a soon a be certain of that resolved to travel by due north did so sometimes walking fast at others keeping up steady trot for half mile without stopping a be proceeding on travel observed under tree ahead of spark of fire emitted thought be glow worm at first be more like striking of flint against steel a saw second time stopped that might ascertain what might be before advanced farther chapter xv be now very dark a there be moon star be often obscured by cloud be heavy borne along by wind be very high light again appeared time edward heard clash of flint against steel be quite certain that be somebody striking light advanced very cautiously arrived at large tree behind remained to reconnoiter people whoever might be be not more than thirty yard from light spread ray for moment two must make out figure kneeling holding hat to protect from wind then burned brighter saw that lantern have be lighted then again of sudden be dark so edward immediately satisfied that dark lantern have be lighted then closed who party might be of course have idea be resolved that must ascertain if must before accosted asked way have dog thought edward must have growled before be lucky have none edward then crept softly nearer to wind be strong blew from where be to where edward stood so that there be le chance of hearing approach edward went on hand knee crawled through fern until gained tree within ten yard of from where must hear what might say be thus cautious a have be told by oswald that there be many disbanded soldier who have taken up quarter in forest have committed several depredation upon house adjacent to always returning to forest a rendezvous edward listened heard one say be not time yet too soon by hour more people from lymington who buy what want always bring to at night that retreat may not be discovered sometimes leave cottage till two hour after dark for leave lymington to go there till be dark do know who be who supply with food yes people at inn in parliament street forget sign oh know yes landlord be downright malignant in heart might squeeze well if dared show ourselves in lymington yes must squeeze neck tighter than must be agreeable expect replied other be sure that have money quite sure for peeped through chink of window shutter saw pay for thing brought to be from canvas bag be gold that took out where did put bag after have paid that ca tell for a knew that must come out a soon a be paid be obliged to beat retreat lest must be seen well then how be to be managed must first tap at door try if can get in a benighted traveler if wo do fear will not while remain begging for admittance at

there body else besides in cottage yes lad who attends go to lymington for woman not one do think two be sufficient have not better get more help there be broom black gipsy at rendezvous can go for be back in time be stout true stout enough not true want sharer in business know how ill behaved in last affair will swear that only produced swag like honor between gentleman soldier be why have chosen know can trust benjamin be time now what do say be two to one for count boy a nothing will start be with say there be bag of gold be worth fighting for yes ben will tell with what have got buried share of bag will have enough think will start for low country for england getting rather too warm for well sha go yet replied benjamin like foreign part have good ale ca understand talk 'd sooner

will will start for north where know for if go wo stay here two men then rose up one whose name appeared to be will first examined if candle in dark lantern burned well then set off followed by edward who have heard quite enough to satisfy that be bent upon burglary if not murder edward followed so a to keep form indistinctly in sight be a much a must do at twenty yard distance fortunately wind be so high that did not hear footstep although often trod upon rotten stick snapped a broke in twain a near a edward must guess have tracked about three mile when stopped perceived that be examining pistol took from belt then went on again entered small plantation of oak tree of about forty year growth very thick very dark with close underwood below followed other through narrow path until came to cleared place in middle of plantation in there stood low cottage surrounded with covert on side with exception of thirty yard of land around be still a dark a pitch edward remained behind tree when two men again stopped be not six foot from consulted in low tone wind be so high that must not distinguish what said at last advanced to cottage edward still keeping within tree shifted position so that must be opposite gable end of cottage observed one man to go up to front door while other went round to door behind a have be agreed edward threw open pan of lock of gun reprimed that might be sure then waited for what be to follow heard man will at front door talking asking for shelter in plaintive loud voice shortly afterward perceived light through chink of shutter for edward be continually altering position to see what be going on in front in back at one time thought of leveling gun killing one of men at once must not make up mind to do a burglary although intended have not yet be committed so remained passive until attack be really made when resolved that must come to rescue after minute of entreaty that must open door man in front commenced thumping beating against a if must make open door by force be to attract attention of within divert from attempt that other be making to get in behind edward be aware of now kept eye upon what be going on at back advancing nearer ventured to do now that men be so occupied perceived that fellow have contrived to open window close to back door be remaining quite close to with pistol in hand apparently not wishing to run risk of climbing in edward slipped under eaves of cottage not six foot from man who remained with back partly turned to edward then finding have obtained position unperceived crouched down with gun ready pointed a edward remained in position heard shrill voice cry out be getting in behind movement in cottage man near who have pistol in hand put arm through window fired inside shriek be given edward fired gun into body of man who immediately fell edward lost time in reloading gun during heard bursting open of front door report of firearm then be silent for moment excepting wailing of somebody within a soon a gun be reloaded edward walked round to front of cottage where found man who be called ben lying across threshold of open door stepped across body looking into room within perceived body stretched on floor young lad weeping over be alarmed be friend said edward going in to where body lay taking light be at farther end of chamber placed on floor that might examine state of person who be breathing heavily apparently badly wounded rise up lad said edward let see if can be of use ah cried boy throwing back long hair from temple bleeds to death bring water quick said edward there be good lad while see where be hurt boy ran up to fetch water edward discovered that ball have entered neck above collar bone that blood poured out of man mouth who be choking with effusion although ignorant of surgery edward thought that wound must be mortal man be not only alive sensible although must not utter word spoke with eye with sign raised hand pointed to first shook head a if to say that be over with then turned round head a if looking for lad who be now returning with water when lad again knelt by side weeping bitterly man pointed to gave imploring look edward immediately comprehended what wished be to ask protection for boy must not be misunderstood must edward do otherwise than promise to dying man generous nature must not refuse said understand wish to take care of boy when be gone be not so man signified assent promise will do so will take into own family will share with man raised hand again gleam of joy passed over feature a took hand of lad put into of edward eye be then fixed upon edward a if to scrutinize into character by feature while former bathed temple washed blood from mouth with water brought by boy who appeared in state of grief so violent a to paralyze sens after minute two effusion of blood choked wounded man who after short struggle fell back dead be gone thought edward now what be to be done must first ascertain whether two villain be dead not edward took light examined body of ben lying over threshold of door man be quite dead ball having entered brain be proceeding round outside of cottage to examine state of other man whom have shot wind nearly blew out light therefore returned to chamber placed on floor near to where boy lay insensible over corpse of man who have died in arm of edward then went out without light with gun to other side of cottage where other robber have fallen a approached man faint voice be heard to say ben ben water for love of god ben be done for edward without giving answer went back to room for water took round to man put to lip felt that be bound by humanity so to do to dying man scoundrel though might be be still dark not so dark a have previously be for late moon be just rising man drank water eagerly said ben can speak now sha long then pulled basin toward again after have drank ho said in broken sentence feel that be bleeding to death inside then paused know oak struck by lightning mile north of oh be going fast three yard from south buried money be yours oh drink man again attempted to drink out of basin proffered by edward a made attempt fell back with groan edward perceiving that be dead returned to cottage to look after lad who still remained prostrate embracing corpse in chamber edward then reflected upon what have best be done after time decided upon dragging away body of robber named ben outside of threshold then securing door with trouble effected then made fast window have be forced open behind before removed boy who lay with face buried on corpse appeared to be in state of insensibility edward examined corpse a lay although plainly dressed yet be evident that be not body of rustic feature be fair beard be carefully cut hand be white finger long evidently have never be employed in labor that body be that of superior person disguised a rustic be evident be corroborated by conversation took place between two robber ala thought edward family of arnwood appear not to be only people who be in disguise in forest that poor boy must not remain there edward looked round perceived that there be bed in adjoining room door of be open lifted up boy carried still insensible into room laid on bed then went for more water found threw into face poured little into mouth gradually boy stirred recovered from stupor then edward held water to mouth made drink did then suddenly aroused to recollection of what have passed boy gave shriek of woe burst into paroxysm of tear ended in convulsive sobbing low moanings edward felt that must do more at present that must be better if be left for time to give vent to grief edward sat down on stool by side of orphan remained for time in deep melancholy thought how strange thought at last be must feel so little a do now surrounded by death compared to what did when good old jacob armitage died then felt deeply there be awe in death now no longer dread be because loved good old man felt that have lost friend can not be cause may have felt more grief not awe dread be because be first time have seen death be first sight of death occasion awe be because day have fancied on battle field with hundred lying dead wounded around in dreaming know not poor old jacob died peaceably in bed like good christian trusting after blameless life to find mercy through savior two of who be now dead out of three have be summoned away in height of wickedness in very commission of crime third have be foully murdered out of three lying dead one have fallen by own hand yet feel not so much a when attended couch listened to parting word of dying christian can not account for reason why only know that be so now look upon death unconcerned well be kind of preparation for wholesale murder horror of battlefield have so long sighed for god forgive if be wrong poor boy have promised to protect will must fail promise must imaging spirit of father a presume be looking down upbraiding will protect brother sister have be preserved protected be indeed vile if did not do to others a have be done by now let reflect what be to be done must not take boy away bury body person have friend at lymington will come here murder have taken place in forest then must let intendant know have occurred will send over to oswald humphrey will go poor fellow what state of anxiety must little sister be in at not returning home have quite forgotten that can not be helped will wait till sunrise then see if boy will be more probably from will be able to find out what part of forest be in edward took up candle went into room in have laid boy on bed found in sound sleep poor fellow said edward have for time forgotten misery what beautiful boy be long to know history sleep on poor fellow will do service edward then returned to other room recollected rather be reminded that have have supper be now nearly dawn of day looked into cupboard found plenty of provision flask of wine have earned supper thought will not therefore deny so ho brought out viand flask of wine made hearty meal be long since have tasted wine thought maybe long ere drink again have little relish for now be too fiery to palate recollect when child how father used to have at table give stoup of claret must hardly lift to lip to drink to health of king memory of king raised other thought in edward mind again sunk into one of revery lasted till fell into slumber when woke up be at voice of boy who in sleep have cried out father edward started up found that sun be hour high that must have slept time gently opened cottage door looked at body of two men then walked out to survey locality of cottage have faintly made out during night found that be surrounded by thicket of tree underwood so close thick that there appeared to outlet in direction what place for concealment thought edward still prowling thief discovered why troop of horse might scour forest for month never discover such hiding place edward walked round by side of thicket to find out track by robber have entered when followed at last succeeded in doing so followed path through thicket until be clear of again in forest scenery outside be unknown

room intendant said a concluded edward must now perceive that for present nothing more can be done if plea lord time will come when monarch will be reseated on throne at present must bow to power be tell frankly be opinion that cromwell aim at sovereignty will obtain perhaps may be better that must suffer infliction for time a for time only can be upheld may be cause of king being more schooled more fitted to reign than by what have told in course of narrative at present appears to be perhaps so sir replied edward must say that short campaign have gone through have very much opened eye have seen little true chivalric feeling much of interested motif in who have joined king force army collected be composed of most discordant element be so discontented so full of jealousy ill will be not surprised at result one thing be certain that there must be much better feeling existing between party before such man a cromwell can ever be moved from position for present cause may be considered a lost be right edward replied intendant must be better a be let make best of have now seen enough to have subdued that fiery zeal for cause previously occupied whole thought now let be prudent try if can not be happy chapter xxiv be only to oswald edward made known what have occurred knew that be to be trusted next day edward resumed forester dress while one be preparing for went over to cottage where with consent of intendant proposed remaining for few day of course edward have not failed to acquaint intendant with proposed plan relative to chaloner grenville received consent at same time advising that must gain other side of channel a soon a possibly must edward found very anxious for arrival humphrey pablo have be to cottage have found undisturbed since capture of robber made thing ready for reception of two cavalier a on first journey took with cart load of what knew must be necessary chaloner grenville appeared to be quite at home already not very willing to shift quarter of course still retained trooper clothes a have other to wear until must be procured from lymington a have before mentioned be in want of money have be amusing girl humphrey with description of what have occurred during campaign edward found that have little to tell a chaloner have commenced narrative with account of first meeting with edward when have be attacked by highwayman a soon a must get away edward went out with humphrey to have conversation with now humphrey a have pretty well heard adventure since separation let hear what have be doing have such tale of stirring interest to narrate a chaloner have be doing a deputy edward replied humphrey can say be that have have visitor that have longed for return that have not be idle since quitted what horse be in stable said ed ward that turned out to make room for ours when arrived humphrey laughed then informed edward of manner in have succeeded in capturing well really deserve credit humphrey certainly be not born to be secluded in forest rather think have found that be born for replied humphrey although must confess that since have quitted have not felt so contented here a did before have returned have idea what alteration see in since have mixed with world have be party in such stirring scene perhaps so humphrey replied edward yet do know that although so ardently wished to mix with world to follow war be thing satisfied with what have seen of so far from feeling inclination to return to rather feel more inclined to remain here remain in quiet in peace have be disappointed be truth there be great difference between world such a fancy when be pining for world when actually be placed within vortex perceive secret spring of men action have gained lesson not satisfactory one humphrey may be told in very few word be most deceitful hollow world be said in few word what very agreeable pleasant young men be master chaloner grenville observed humphrey chaloner know well replied edward be to be trusted be only one in whom have be able to place confidence therefore be most fortunate in falling in with a did on first starting grenville know little about met often be true be in presence of king being of on staff at same time must acknowledge that know nothing against do know be that be brave edward then narrated what have passed between intendant since return how well satisfied intendant have be with ruse in returning to in dress of trooper talking about edward do not think likely that will have trooper down here in search of king wonder have not have already replied edward what will do if arrive be prepared for replied edward although till mentioned have quite forgotten intendant be talking with on subject last night here be appointment for a verderer signed by be to use a may find necessary here be missive ordering to receive into house two of trooper who may be sent down here find quarter victual not to be compelled to receive more until search be over chaloner grenville must retain accouterment remain with humphrey if have not made use of clothes left here mean first dress have made when be appointed secretary thought rather too faded to wear longer will put on now a must military come here a scouter to intendant will have authority over be in chest where left edward girl did propose to make two joseph out of for winter wear never have thought of since have not have time by by have not told what think of alice edith after long absence think be very much grown very much improved replied edward must confess to that think be high time that be if possible removed from present homely occupation instructed a young lady must be how edward be that to be can not yet tell grief that can not still see necessity of if ever be to return to position in society be ever to return know thought little of before went away mixed in society since have be in world have be compelled to feel that dear sister be not in sphere have resolved upon trying if can not find more suitable position for have be successful must have have difficulty now hardly know what to do have not inquired about mistress patience brother how be be a good a handsome a ever very much grown indeed be becoming quite womanly clara oh perceive difference in think be grown hardly observed here come chaloner will tell of arrangement in case be disturbed by military party be most excellent arrangement said chaloner when edward have made communication be lucky day when first fell in with beverley not beverley pray that name be to be forgotten be only revived for occasion very true then master secretary armitage think arrangement excellent only point will be to find out what troop be sent down in direction a must of course belong to other regiment have be pursued from field of battle must think that lambert squadron will not be way will soon ascertain that let horse be saddled accoutered so that must of make appearance horse may be at door be opinion that will be here time to day fear that will be almost impossible for king to escape observed chaloner hardly know what to think of leaving in way have reflected upon replied edward think be perhaps prudent be to be trusted not be impossible to know who be who be not therefore trusted nobody besides chance of escape if quite alone be greater than if in company yet feel little mortified that did not trust continued edward life be at service must no more read heart than must mine others observed chaloner selection must have be invidious on whole think acted wisely trust that will prove so one thing be certain be that be over now that for long while may let sword rest in scabbard indeed be sickened with after what have seen must gladly live here with help to till land away from world vexation what say edward will brother take a laborer till be quiet again must soon tire of chaloner be made for active exertion bustling in world nevertheless think under two such amiable pretty mistress must stay well contented here be almost arcadian still be selfish for to talk in way indeed feeling be contrary to word how do mean chaloner to be candid with edward be thinking what pity be that two such sweet girl a sister must be employed here in domestic drudgery remain in such uncultivated state if may be pardoned for speaking so freely do so because be convinced that if in proper hand must grace court must feel that be right do not think that same feeling have passed in mind chaloner indeed will tell that be speaking on same subject hour ago must however be aware of difficulty be in be in possession of arnwood domain then indeed be over now presume will shortly see own property whose wood be now in sight of made over to roundhead for good service against cavalier at worcester edward replied chaloner have to say to can say because know that be indebted to for life be debt that nothing can cancel if at time determine upon removing sister from recollect maiden aunt at portlake can not be in better hand can not be in hand of person who will more religiously do duty toward be pleased with trust confided to be rich in spite of exaction in time woman be not fined plundered a men be have be well able to afford have be taken from that have voluntarily given to assistance of party be alone really believe that nothing must make more happy than to have care of two sister of edward beverley be sure of will be more sure of if will find mean of sending to letter will write to tell that will do favor that if accept offer will sacrifice sister welfare to own pride think must do most certainly will not do replied edward be fully sensible of kind offer can say more until hear what good aunt may reply to letter mistake much chaloner if think that sense of obligation must prevent from seeing sister removed from position so unworthy of circumstance have driven to that be pauper be undeniable never will forgot that sister be daughter of colonel beverley be delighted with reply edward fear not that of good aunt will be great happiness to when be wandering abroad to know that sister be under roof be being educated a ought to be what be matter pablo said humphrey to former who came running out of

approved of what have done strongly advising that chaloner grenville must not attempt to go to continent till pursuit be over here be letter have received from government edward highly commending vigilance activity in pursuit of fugitive appears that officer fell in with have written up to state what admirable disposition have made be pity be not edward that be compelled to be thus deceitful in world nothing time wish to do good must warrant meet wicked fight with own weapon although be treating a deserve conscience must tell that be not right surely sir to save life of people who have committed other fault except loyalty to king will warrant so doing at least hope so according to scripture fear will not be difficult question for to decide let be guided by own conscience if reproach can not be far from right edward then produced letter have received from chaloner requesting that intendant must have kindness to forward see replied intendant can forward through langton presume be to obtain credit for money will go on thursday conference be then broken up edward went to see oswald chapter xxv for several day edward remained at home anxiously awaiting news arrived expecting time that capture of king must be announced with great joy finding that hitherto effort have be unsuccessful there be question now arose in edward mind be cause of deep reflection since proposal of sending sister away have be started felt great inconvenience of still representing to intendant a grandson of armitage sister if sent to lady at portlake must be sent without knowledge of intendant if so discovery of absence must soon take place a patience heatherstone must be constantly going over to cottage now asked question whether after kindness confidence intendant have shown be right in longer concealing from birth parentage felt that be doing intendant injustice in not showing to that confidence ho deserved that be justified in so doing at first felt since joining king army event have followed considered that be treating intendant ill now resolved to take first opportunity of making confession to do formally without opportunity might offer felt awkward at last thought that must at once make confession to patience under promise of secrecy that might do at once after have done so intendant must not tax with want of confidence altogether have now analyzed feeling toward patience felt how dear have become to during time be with army have seldom be out of thought although be often in society of well bred woman saw not one that in opinion must compare with patience heatherstone still what chance have of supporting wife at present at age of nineteen be preposterous thought like ran in mind chasing other followed by others a vague unsatisfactory in end edward came to conclusion that be without penny that being known a heir of beverley must be to disadvantage that be in love with patience heatherstone have chance at present of obtaining that done well up to present time in concealing who be from intendant who must safely attest that knew not that be protecting son of so noted cavalier that must confess to patience who be give a reason for not telling father that did not wish to commit by letting know who be that be under protection how far reader may be satisfied with argument edward be satisfied with can not pretend to say be young hardly knew how to extricate from cloak necessity have first compelled to put on edward be already satisfied that be not quite looked upon with indifference by patience heatherstone be not yet certain whether be not grateful feeling that have toward more than other that believed to be beneath in birth felt convinced therefore must have idea that be edward beverley be not till several day after have made up mind that have opportunity of being with alone a clara ratcliffe be constant companion however one evening clara went out staid out so long carelessly wrapped up that caught cold following evening remained at home leaving edward patience to take usual walk unaccompanied by have walked for minute in silence when patience observed be very grave edward have be very grave ever since return have thing to vex beyond failure of attempt yes have patience have much on conscience know how to act want adviser friend know not where to find one surely edward father be sincere friend not bad adviser grant question be between father can not advise with for reason then advise with edward if be not secret of such moment that be not to be trusted to woman at event will be advice of sincere friend will give credit for yes for much more for think will have good advice will therefore accept offer feel patience that although be justified on first acquaintance with father in not making known to secret of importance yet now that have put such implicit confidence in be doing injustice in not making communication be a far a confidence in be concerned consider that have right to know yet feel that must be prudent on part that must not know a knowledge might implicate with with whom be at present allied secret sometimes be dangerous if father must not say that on honor knew not of secret might harm if secret became afterward known do understand can not say that exactly do have secret that wish to make known to father think knowledge of may harm can not imagine what kind of secret may be well can give case in point suppose now that knew that king charles be hidden in stable loft such might be case father be ignorant of assertion of ignorance must be believed if be to tell father that king be there be afterward discovered do not see that by confiding secret to must do harm perhaps bring into trouble perceive now edward do mean to say that know where king be concealed for if do must beg of not let father know thing about a say must put in difficult position must eventually harm much there be great difference between wishing well to cause supporting in person father wish king well believe at same time will not take active part a have already seen at same time be convinced that must never betray king if knew where be say therefore if be secret keep from for sake for mine edward if regard know not how much regard patience saw many highborn woman when be away none must see equal to patience heatherstone in opinion patience be ever in thought during long absence thank for kind feeling toward replied patience master armitage be talking about secret master armitage rejoined edward how well know how to remind by expression of obscure birth parentage whenever be apt to forget distance ought to observe be wrong replied patience flattered so grossly that called master armitage to show that disliked flattery be dislike flattery from who be above in rank a well a who be below must have done same to other person condition might be forget what said did not mean to vex only to punish for thinking so silly a to believe such nonsense humility may construe into flattery be said by in perfect sincerity truth can not help replied edward might have added much more yet have be sincere if have not reminded of not being of gentle birth might have have presumption to have told much more have be rebuked edward finished speaking patience made reply walked on for several moment without exchanging syllable at last patience said will not say who be wrong edward do know that one who first offer olive branch after misunderstanding can not be right offer now ask whether be to quarrel about one little word let ask give candid answer have ever be so base a to treat a inferior one to whom have be so much obliged be who be in fault patience replied edward have be dreaming for long while pleased with dream forgetting that be dream not likely to be realized must now speak plainly love patience love so much that to part from must be misery to know that love be rejected a bitter a death be truth can conceal no longer now admit have right to be angry see cause for anger edward replied patience have not thought of a friend benefactor must have be wrong to have done otherwise be young person must be guided by father must not offend by disobedience thank for good opinion of yet wish have not said what have be to understand from reply that if father raised objection lowly birth must be none in opinion birth have never come into head except when reminded of by then patience let return for present to what have to confide to be here come father edward said patience surely have done wrong for feel afraid to meet mr heatherstone now joined said to edward have be looking for have news from london have rejoiced much have at last obtained what have time be trying for indeed may say that prudence boldness in returning home a trooper added to conduct in forest have greatly advanced ultimately obtained for suit there be suspense before conduct have removed now will have plenty to do walked to house intendant a soon a have gained own room said to edward there be grant to of property have long solicited for service read edward took up letter in parliament informed mr heatherstone that application to property of arnwood have be acceded to signed by commissioner that might take immediate possession edward turned pale a laid document down on table will ride to morrow edward look over intend to rebuild house edward made reply be not well said intendant with surprise yes sir replied edward be well believe confess to that be disappointed did not think that must have accepted property from such source so unjustly sequestrated be sorry edward replied intendant must have fallen in good opinion allow to observe that be so far right that never must have accepted property to there be living claimant be different case for instance ratcliffe property belongs to little clara be sequestrated do think must accept never here be property without heir whole family perished in flame of arnwood there be living claimant must be given to somebody remain with government property therefore property only out of sequestrated selected a felt that in obtaining did harm to one have be offered others have refused must accept of only be reason why application have hitherto be attended with success trust believe edward in what assert first answer one question mr heatherstone suppose be proved that whole of family did not a be supposed perish at conflagration of arnwood suppose rightful heir to must at time appear must then resign property to a hope for heaven edward must replied intendant solemnly raising eye upward a spoke then must think that have be instrument to keep property out of other hand le scrupulous must surrender a trust have be confided to for time only with such feeling mr heatherstone can now congratulate upon having obtained possession of property replied edward yet deserve so much credit a there be little chance of sincerity being put to test edward there be doubt that family perished arnwood will become dower of patience heatherstone edward heart beat quick moment thought told situation have be prevented by interruption of mr heatherstone from making confession to patience now must not make to body without rupture with intendant compromise by asking what so earnestly desired hand of patience mr heatherstone observing to edward that did not look well said supper be ready that have better go into next room edward mechanically followed at supper be tormented by incessant inquiry of clara a to what be matter with did not venture to look at patience made hasty retreat to bed complaining a might well do of severe headache edward threw on bed to sleep be impossible thought of event of day over over again have reason to believe patience returned affection reply be too calm too composed to make suppose now that must be heiress there must be want of pretender to hand must lose property at same time be true that intendant have declared that must renounce property if true heir appeared be easy to say upon conviction that heir must appear even if did renounce parliament must receive again rather than must fall into hand of beverley oh have never left cottage thought edward might then at least have become resigned contented with lot now be miserable whichever way turn see prospect of being otherwise one thing only can decide upon be will not remain longer than can help under roof will go over consult with humphrey if can only place sister a want humphrey will seek fortune edward rose at daylight dressing went down saddled horse desiring sampson to tell intendant that have gone over to cottage must return by evening rode across forest arrived just a be sitting down to breakfast attempt to be cheerful before sister did not succeed be grieved to see look so pale haggard a soon a breakfast be over edward made sign humphrey went out what be matter dear brother said humphrey will tell listen to replied edward who then gave detail of have passed from time have walked out with patience heatherstone till went to bed now humphrey know what will do remain there can not if patience heatherstone have professed regard for replied humphrey affair have be simple enough father must have objection to match must at same time have acquitted conscience a to retaining of property say showed none told very calmly that be sorry that have said what did do woman always mean what say brother said humphrey doe at event replied edward be truth can not deceive feel deep debt of gratitude for service rendered that prevented from being more harsh in reply than what be if knew that be edward beverley do not think must make difference in if did must be too humiliating to think be only married for rank station considering of mean birth may not have checked feeling considered under circumstance improper to indulge where there be such sense of propriety there can be little affection know nothing about thing edward replied humphrey have be told that woman heart be not easily read if have not be told have read dreamed what do propose to do what fear will not approve of humphrey be to break up establishment altogether if answer be favorable from miss conynghame sister will go to that have agreed upon already then for intend to go abroad resume name obtain employment in foreign service will trust to king for assisting to be worst part of edward if peace of mind depends upon will not oppose humphrey may come with share fortune do what think more preferable think then edward that will not decide rashly must have remained here with pablo if sister have gone to lady conynghame have remained with intendant will therefore till hear from remain where be will be able to observe what be going on here let know be so replied edward let only see sister well placed will be off next day be misery to remain there now after more conversation edward mounted horse returned to intendant did not arrive till late for supper be on table intendant gave letter for mr chaloner be inclosed in one from mr langton further informed edward news have arrived of king having made escape to france thank god for exclaimed edward with leave sir will to morrow deliver letter to party to whom be addressed a know

very great edward reasoned with alice consoled although with edith be more difficult task not only lamented brother cow pony kid dumb animal be friend favorite of edith even idea of parting with pablo

humphrey rather abruptly be brother phoebe retired humphrey be alone with brother be indeed unhappy day when came to house exclaimed humphrey a tear rolled down cheek poor poor edward edward now began to talk incoherently attempted to rise from bed effort be unavailing be too weak raved of patience heatherstone called edward beverley more than once talked of father of arnwood if have raved in manner thought humphrey have not many secret left to disclose will not leave will keep others away if can humphrey have be sitting hour with brother when surgeon came to see patient felt pulse asked humphrey if be nursing be brother sir replied humphrey then good sir if perceive sign of perspiration think now that there be little keep clothes on let perspire freely if so life will be saved surgeon withdrew saying that must return again late in evening humphrey remained for two hour at bedside then feeling that there be sign of perspiration obeyed injunction of surgeon held on clothes against edward endeavor to throw off for short time perspiration be profuse restlessness of edward subsided into deep slumber thank heaven there be then hope did say there be hope repeated voice behind humphrey turned round perceived patience clara behind who have come in without observing yes replied humphrey looking reproachfully at patience there be hope by what surgeon said to hope that may yet be able to quit house be so unfortunate a to enter be harsh rude speech of humphrey considered that patience heatherstone have be cause of brother dangerous state that have not behaved well to patience made reply falling down on knee by bedside prayed silently be heart smote for what have said to can not be so bad thought humphrey a patience clara quitted room without least noise shortly afterward intendant came up into room offered hand to humphrey who pretended not to see did not take have got arnwood be enough for thought humphrey hand in friendship will not receive intendant put hand within clothes feeling high perspiration that edward be in said thank thee o god for thy mercy thou hast be pleased to spare valuable life how be sister master humphrey said intendant daughter

found lonely in forest master heatherstone wished to see london so have taken there put into care of who have promised that will be well placed intendant appeared to be much disturbed surprised said nothing soon afterward quitted room almost immediately returned with surgeon who a soon a felt edward pulse declared that crisis be over that when awoke must be quite sensible having given direction a to drink of patient medicine be to take surgeon then left stating that must not call until next evening unless be sent for a considered danger over edward continued in quiet slumber for major portion of night be just break of day when opened eye humphrey offered drink edward took greedily seeing humphrey said oh humphrey have quite forgotten where be be so sleepy with word head fell on pillow be again asleep when be broad daylight oswald came into room master humphrey say that danger be over now that have remained here night will relieve now if will let go take walk in fresh air will revive will oswald many thanks brother have woke up once thank god be quite sensible will know when wake again then do send for humphrey left room be glad after night of close confinement in sick room to feel cool morning air fanning cheek have not be long out of house before perceived clara coming toward how d 'ye do humphrey said clara how be brother morning be better clara hope now out of danger humphrey continued clara when came into room last night what made say what did recollect said thing yes did said that there be now hope that brother must be able soon to quit house have be so unfortunate a to enter do recollect may have said so clara replied humphrey be only speaking thought aloud why do think so humphrey why have edward be unfortunate in entering house be what want to know patience cried so much after left room because said that why did say so did not think so short time ago dear clara did not do now can not give reason so must say no more about clara be silent for time then said patience tell that sister have gone away from cottage told father so be very true have gone why have gone what have gone for who be to look after cow goat poultry who be to cook dinner humphrey what can do without why did send away without letting patience know that be going so that at least might have bid farewell dear clara replied humphrey who feeling little difficulty in replying to question resolved to cut matter short by appearing to be angry know that be daughter of gentleman so be patience heatherstone be of gentle birth sister know be only daughter of forester brother edward be better doe not become mistress patience to be intimate with such a be especially now that mistress patience be great heiress for father have obtained large property of arnwood will be hers after death be not fit that heiress of arnwood must mix up with forester daughter a have friend near lymington who offered to assist take sister under charge thought better that must go for what must become of if accident be to happen to edward to now will be provided for after have be taught will make very nice tirewomen to lady of quality added humphrey with sneer think will pretty clara clara burst into tear be very unkind humphrey sobbed have right to send away sister believe be more clara ran away into house chapter xxvi reader may think that humphrey be very unkind be to avoid being questioned by clara who be evidently sent for purpose that be so harsh at same time must be admitted that mr heatherstone having obtained possession of arnwood rankled doubt in mind of brother act now on part of family be viewed in false medium feeling be not always at control edward be naturally impetuous humphrey so much attached so much alarmed at brother danger that be even more excited blow fell doubly heavy a appeared that at very same time patience have rejected brother taken possession of property have be held by family for century what made case more annoying be that explanation if there be to offer on side be under present circumstance almost impossible soon after clara left humphrey returned to brother room found awake talking to oswald ardently pressing brother hand edward said dear humphrey will soon be well now able trust to quit house what fear be that explanation will be asked for by intendant not only relative to sister having left also upon other point be what wish to avoid without giving offense think that intendant be so much to blame in having obtained property a doe not know that beverley existed can not bear to have further intimacy with especially after what have taken place between daughter what have to request be that will never quit room while be still here unless be relieved by oswald so that intendant body else may have opportunity of having private communication with forcing to listen to what may have to say made known to oswald before came in depend upon will be so edward for be of opinion clara came to just now have much trouble be compelled to be harsh to get rid of importunity when surgeon called pronounced edward out of danger that attendance must be no longer necessary edward felt truth of that required be strength that trusted in few day to obtain oswald be sent over to cottage to ascertain how pablo be going on by found that thing be correct pablo although felt proud of responsibility be very anxious for humphrey return a found very lonely during oswald absence on day humphrey never quitted room although intendant came up several time never must find opportunity of speaking to edward evidently wished to do to inquiry made a to how be edward always complained of great weakness for reason will soon be understood several day elapsed edward have often be out of bed during night when not likely to be intruded upon now felt strong enough to be removed object be to leave intendant house without knowledge so a to avoid explanation one evening pablo came over with horse after be dark oswald put into stable morning proving fine clear little before break of day edward came softly down stair with humphrey mounting horse set off for cottage without one in intendant house being aware of departure must not be supposed however edward took step without degree of consideration a to feeling of intendant on contrary left letter with oswald to be delivered after departure in thanked intendant sincerely for kindness compassion have shown toward assured of gratitude kind feeling toward daughter said that circumstance have occurred of explanation must be given without great pain to party rendered advisable that must take apparently unkind step a to leave without bidding farewell in person that be about to embark immediately for continent to seek fortune in war that wished

thing passed between edward armitage patience made reply sobbed aloud might not have shown so much emotion must be remembered that for last three week since edward have spoken to during subsequent illness have be very unhappy reserve of humphrey expression have made use of repulse of clara not having seen anything of edward during illness added to sudden unexpected departure without word to have broken spirit sank beneath load of sorrow intendant left to recover before again addressed when have ceased sobbing father spoke to in very kind voice begging that must not conceal thing from a be most important to that real fact must be known now tell child what passed between edward told just before came up to that evening that loved what be reply hardly know dear father what be that said

edward beverley who with brother sister be supposed to have be burned to death at arnwood patience removed handkerchief from face looked at father with astonishment tell have strong suspicion of dear child first from noble appearance forest garb must disguise what gave further conviction be that when at lymington happened to fall in with one benjamin who have be servant at arnwood interrogated closely really believed that child be burned be true that asked particularly relative to appearance of child how many be boy how many be girl age c strongest proof be that name of four child corresponded with name of child of forest a well a age went to church register extracted now be almost amounting to proof for be not likely that four child in forest cottage must have same age name a of arnwood after have ascertained point engaged edward a know wishing to secure for be once acquainted with father at event well acquainted with colonel merit remained in house together be with pleasure watched intimacy between then exerted to get arnwood restored to must not ask for prevented being given to other by laying claim to have edward remained with might have succeeded a wished
