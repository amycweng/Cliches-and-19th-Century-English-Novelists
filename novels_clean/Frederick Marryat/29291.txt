captain cain of avenger pirate be not among book one most willingly re read out of marryat very respectably lengthy list of story be not without gaiety a be ever case with man of war scene be alive captain plumpton mr markital first lieutenant edward templemore midshipman be credible whenever marryat have to introduce to man of war must draw on inexhaustible treasure of reminiscence of what be

be not what marryat might have made if have written in spirit in be to write snarley yow in three cutter marryat allowed to take little holiday in company with kind of sea malefactor whom knew intimately well have already played with smuggler in king own in little story reintroduces to m'elvina somewhat disguised in altered circumstance essentially same three cutter may be supposed to have be written to fill out volume containing pirate twenty engraving from drawing by clarkson stanfield still make first edition desirable possession function whether be originally designed not be very agreeably fulfilled by history of arrow active happy go lucky although wrote very few of marryat have happy hand with short story s w by w w wind moonshine be very happy example of magazine story three cutter be somewhat longer than either difference in bulk be due le to greater amount of pure story there be than to care with marryat introduces three vessel sketch respective starting place plymouth portsmouth st malo here again be to be noted that marryat be far more at home in man of war than in smuggler yacht mr appleboy with forty five year service interesting story remains untold of something took place in ' seventeen daily tumbler of gin toddy mate midshipman be part not inferior one of marryat inimitable naval gallery happy go lucky be perhaps rather smuggler of pay bleu than of british channel be sufficiently in place in story not intended to be too slavishly faithful to life morrison sailing master with augury of blue pigeon be real nothing can be more consistent with human nature than that must have cursed bird when did finally find in prison a for adventure belong to region of fantastic doe not pretend to be anything else idea of yacht endeavour capture of smuggler be made prize by be of course motive for farce scene on board captive yacht be not exactly horse play there be too many lady concerned marryat in spite of occasional lapse of taste preferred to write like gentleman if there be horse play there be great deal of what hope be permissible to describe a 'lark sour old maid miss ossulton niece cecilia who if have not much character be still very nice girl frisky widow mr lascelles make capital trio given gallant dashing smuggler who be really gentleman in disguise in possession of yacht determined to revenge on owner by taking little harmless amusement follows that lively incident be to be expected marryat did not work situation out at length probably because felt that stuff must not bear much handling if cut story short for reason be undoubtedly right be so difficult a to be quite impossible for majority of writer to hang just on border of outrageously impossible for more than few page while last be very good fun reformation of pickersgill through influence of mr lascelles be quite in marryat manner hero when need reformation be commonly brought into right path by combined influence of pretty woman round sum of money mr lascelles too be unquestionably just woman to marry pickersgill having married old man to please parent having inherited money have decided to marry again to please in second husband experience show that mr lascelles of real life not uncommonly fall into hand of ruffian adventurer marryat be not making study of real life be too fond of puppet besides must have be story must have be superfluous considering that marryat wanted to end one so mr lascelles have fine dashing seaman who stood six foot odd in stocking be also gentleman in disguise of course be happy ever after one have haunting suspicion that story be not only written to fill out volume also to accompany clarkson stanfield three very pretty plate of plymouth portsmouth st malo if so that only prof that when man

fell in love for butler be guilty of indiscretion a well a master fair flame who be lady maid in family notwithstanding that have witnessed consequence of error in others must take warning gave warning married like most butler lady maid who pair off set up public house be justice to lady maid to say that must have preferred eating house be overruled by jonathan who argued that although people must drink when be not dry never must eat unless be hungry now although there be truth in observation be certain that business did not prosper have be surmised that jonathan tall lank lean figure injured custom a people be too much inclined to judge of goodness of ale by rubicund face rotundity of landlord therefore inferred that there must be no good beer where mine host be picture of famine there certainly be much in appearance in world appears that in consequence of jonathan cadaverous appearance very soon appeared in gazette what ruined jonathan in one profession procured immediate employment in appraiser upholsterer undertaker who be called in to value fixture fixed eye upon jonathan knowing value of peculiarly lugubrious appearance having half brother of equal height offered immediate employment a mute jonathan soon forgot to mourn own loss of few hundred in new occupation of mourning loss of thousand erect stiff statue like carriage long melancholy face a stood at portal of who have entered portal of next world be too often sarcasm upon grief of inheritor even grief be worth nothing in trafficking world unless be paid for jonathan buried many at last buried wife so far be well at last buried master undertaker be not quite so desirable although jonathan wept not yet did express mute sorrow a marwilled to long home drank to memory in pot of porter a returned from funeral perched with many others like carrion crow on top of hearse now jonathan be thrown out of employment from reason most people must have thought highest recommendation undertaker refused to take because must not match in unfortunate dilemma jonathan thought of mr witherington junior have served have buried mr witherington father lady mary mother felt that have strong claim for such variety of service applied to bachelor fortunately for jonathan mr witherington butler incumbent be just about to commit same folly a jonathan have done before jonathan be again installed resolving in own mind to lead former life have nothing more to do with lady maid from habit jonathan still carried a mute on ordinary occasion never indulging in approximation to mirth except when perceived that master be in high spirit then rather from sense of duty than from real hilarity of heart jonathan be mean scholar for station in life during service with undertaker have acquired english of latin motto be placed upon hatchments motto when considered a apt be very apt to quote left jonathan standing at door have closed handle still remained in hand 'jonathan said mr witherington after long pause ' wish to look at last letter from new york will find on dressing table ' jonathan quitted room without reply made reappearance with letter 'it be long time have be

heir will be obliged to marry must be very uncomfortable ' little comfort echoed jonathan wife be dead in coelo quies 'well must hope for best suspense be anything comfortable ' observed mr

be united have therefore one proposal to make to be let sentence go by vote ballot if please whatever sentence may be will be guided by can say more bey lad replied francisco when captain have done speaking ' think better that must accept proposal rather than blood must be shed life be of little consequence say then will agree to vote submit to law a captain say have be laid down to regulate discipline of vessel ' pirate on francisco side looked round among party perceiving that be most numerous consented to proposal hawkhurst stepped forward observed course kroumen can have vote a belong to vessel objection be important a amounted to twenty five after number be deducted in probability francisco adherent must have be in minority pirate with francisco objected again assumed attitude of defence 'one moment ' said francisco stepping in advance 'before point be settled wish to take sense of of a to of law ask hawkhurst who be now opposed to whether have not one law be blood for blood ' 'yes yes shouted pirate let captain stand forward answer to charge if dare ' cain curled lip in derision walked within two yard of francisco 'well boy be here what be charge ' ask captain cain who be

if one pirate wounded other be at liberty to take life without punishment prevented constant affray between party whose knife must otherwise have be answer to affront be more debased law of duelling kept such profligate associate on good term finding therefore that feeling predominated even among who be opposed to francisco on other question hawkhurst thought advisable to parley illustration 'blood for blood ' cried francisco a fired pistol at cain who staggered fell on deck 'hawkhurst said francisco ' have one request to make if complied with will put end to contention be that will put on shore at first land that make if party engage to do will desire who support to return to obedience ' ' grant ' replied hawkhurst 'and so will others will not men 'agreed agreed upon side cried

loose sand remained in deep melancholy reverie until scorching heat reminded of situation afterwards rose turned thought upon present situation to what must be measure most advisable to take hauled

by tremendous wave at next receding water undertow swept back of many who have be swimming one half have disappeared to rise more francisco watched with agony a perceived that number decreased that none have yet gained shore at last snatched up haulyards of boat sail be near hastened down to spot to afford such succour a might be possible be effort in vain a sea washed apparently inanimate body on shore must then have again swept away to return in mockery caught hold of dragged safe on bank thus did continue exertion until fifteen of body of negro be spread upon beach although exhausted senseless be not dead long before have dragged up last of number many of previously saved have without other assistance than heat of sun recovered from insensibility francisco must have continued task of humanity parted vessel have now be riven into fragment by force of wave whole beach be strewed with timber store be dashed on shore by water then swept back again by return in short time severe blow received from fragment disabled from further exertion sank exhausted on sand indeed further attempt be useless on board vessel have be launched into sea at same moment who be not now on shore be past succour francisco walked up to who have be saved found twelve of be recovered sitting on ham rest be still in state of insensibility then went up to knoll where chest provision have be placed

rescued be sitting not more than thirty yard from be sickly emaciated form belonging to tribe who inhabited coast who having be accustomed from infancy to be day in water have supported better than other slave who have be procured from interior european crew of vessel of whom have perished african appeared to recover fast by heat of sun so oppressive to francisco be now exchanging few word with

assistance of negro attempt to gain mainland lay down for second night on eventful spot of desolation commending to almighty protection be soon in deep slumber be not until powerful ray of sun blazed on eye of youth that awoke so tired have be with anxiety fatigue of preceding day sleepless harrowing night have introduced rose seated upon sea chest how different be scene from of yesterday again ocean slept sky be serene not cloud to be distinguished throughout whole firmament horizontal line be clear even well defined soft breeze just rippled over dark blue sea now have retired to former

with water cask other article in part heaped thrown up one upon among lay jammed mangled body of many who have perished in other part there be corps thrown up high dry still rolling turning to rippling wave be scene of desolation of death negro who have be saved be huddled up together apparently in deep sleep francisco quitted elevated position walked down to low beach to survey mean disaster of others afforded for own escape to great joy found not only plenty of cask many of full of fresh water provision also in sufficiency indeed everything must be required to form raft a well a mean of support for considerable time for negro who have survived then walked up to called to answered not even moved pushed in vain heart beat quick for be fearful that be dead from previous exhaustion applied foot to one of be not until have used force in other case must have dispensed with negro awoke from state of lethargy looked vacantly about francisco have little knowledge of

ceremony with comrade remainder of be awakened palaver ensued francisco soon made understand that be to make raft go back to own country explaining to that if remained there water provision must soon be exhausted must perish poor creature hardly knew whether to consider supernatural being not talked among remarked at having brought fresh water day before knew that did not belong to vessel in have be wrecked be puzzled might be speculation have one good effect be that looked upon youth a superior friend most willingly obeyed led up to knoll desiring to scrape away sand supplied again with fresh water biscuit perhaps very supply way in be given to excited astonishment a much a anything francisco ate with selecting from sea chest few tool in possession desired to follow cask be collected rolled up empty one arranged for raft spar be hauled up cleared of rigging be carefully separated for lashing one two sail have be found rolled up on spar be spread out to dry provision article of clothing might be useful laid together on one side negro worked willingly showed much intelligence before evening closed everything might be available be secured wave now only tossed about lifeless form small fragment of timber must not be serviceable must occupy too much time be to detail proceeding of francisco negro for space of four day during laboured hard necessity be truly mother of invention many be ingenious resource of party before must succeed in forming raft large enough to carry provision with mast sail well secured at length be accomplished on fifth day francisco men embarked having pushed clear of bank with pole be at last able to hoist sail to fine breeze steer for coast before wind at rate of about three mile hour be not until have gained mile from bank that be no longer annoyed by dreadful smell arising from putrefaction of so many body for to bury must have be work of too great time last two day of remaining on island effluvium have become so powerful a to be source of greatest horror disgust even to negro before night when raft be about eight league from sand bank fell calm continued so for next day when breeze sprang up from south east to trimmed sail with head to northward wind course steered sent off from land there be help for francisco felt grateful that have ample supply of provision water a to enable to yield to few day contrary wind without danger of want breeze continued steady fresh be now crossing bight of benin weather be fine sea smooth flying fish rose in shoal dropped down into raft still forced way through water to northward thus did francisco negro crew remain for fortnight floating on wide ocean without object meeting view day after day be same dreary beky water ' by reckoning of francisco must not be far from land when on fifteenth day perceived two sail to northward francisco heart bounded with joy gratitude to heaven have telescope to examine steered directly for about dark made out to be ship schooner hove to a francisco scanned surmising what might be sun set behind two vessel after have sunk below horizon form be for few minute delineated with remarkable precision clearness there must be mistake francisco felt convinced that schooner be avenger first impulse be to run to sweep with be steered put head of raft again to northward moment reflection determined to act otherwise lowered down sail that might escape observation watched motion of vessel during few minute of light remained that ship bad be captured that capture have be attended with usual scene of outrage violence have doubt be now about four mile from just a be vanishing from straining eye perceived that schooner have made sail to westward francisco feeling that be then secure from being picked up by again hoisted sail with hope of reaching ship if not scuttled intended to remove on board of then make sail for first port on coast hardly have raft regained way when horizon be lighted up perceived that pirate have set fire to vessel then be useless to proceed towards francisco again thought of putting head of raft to northward when idea struck knowing character cruelty of pirate that there might be unfortunate people left on board to perish in flame therefore continued course watching burning vessel flame increased in violence mounting up to mast catching sail one after wind blew fresh vessel be kept before wind circumstance assured francisco that there be people on board at first appeared to leave raft a sail one after be consumed by element so did decrease speed francisco in about hour be close to under counter illustration flame increased in violence mounting up to mast catching sail one after ship be now one mass of fire from bow to mainmast volume of flame poured from main hold rising higher than lower mast ending in huge mass of smoke carried by wind ahead of quarter deck be still free from fire heat on be so intense that on board be collected at taffrail there remained violent others in mute despair for avenger people in barbarity have cut away destroyed boat to prevent escape from light thrown round vessel on board have perceived approach of francisco to rescue immediately that be under counter sail lowered almost of have descended by rope stern ladder gained place in in few minute without scarcely exchange of word be out of brig francisco pushed off just a flame burst from cabin window darting out in horizontal line like tongue of fiery serpent raft now encumbered with twelve more person be then steered to northward a soon a who have be saved have be supplied with water so much needed francisco obtained intelligence desired ship be from carthagena south america have sailed from thence to lisbon with don cumanos who have large property up magdalen river have wished to visit part of family at lisbon from thence have sailed to canary isle where also have property in way from lisbon to south america have be beaten by stress of weather to southward afterwards have be chased by avenger being very fast sailer have run down several degree before have be captured when pirate took possession found that have little cargo of value to for hold be chiefly filled with furniture other article for use of don cumanos angry at disappointment have first destroyed boat then set fire to vessel taking care not to leave until chance of fire being put out be hopeless thus have miscreant left innocent unfortunate people to perish francisco narrative of don cumanos then informed in what manner have left schooner subsequent adventure francisco be now very anxious to make land obtain succour from vessel many who be now on board time that have already be at sea obliged to reduce allowance of water fortune favoured after trial on third day vessel hove in sight be seen by made sail for took on board be schooner trafficking on coast for gold dust ivory magnificent offer of don cumanos induced to give up voyage run across atlantic to carthagena to francisco be of little moment where went in don cumanos have found sincere friend 'you have be preserver ' said spaniard 'allow to return obligation come live with a francisco be equally pleased with don cumanos accepted offer arrived safely at carthagena from thence proceeded to estate on magdalen river chapter xii lieutenant when last mentioned edward templemore stated that be lieutenant of admiral ship on west india station commanding tender now name of tender be enterprise be singular that be one of two schooner built at baltimore remarkable for beauty good quality yet how different be employment have originally be built for slave trade now one hoisted english pennant cruised a enterprise other threw out black flag scoured sea a avenger enterprise be fitted much in same way a have already described sister vessel be with one long brass gun amidships smaller one for broadside in number of crew there be great disparity enterprise not being manned with more than sixty five english sailor belonging to admiral ship be employed a most admiral tender usually be sometimes carrying tender made for supply of provision tender of service if required from admiral if not particularly wanted with important charge of tender billet doux to fair friend be tender subject to touch upon in meantime must be understood that have same commission to sink burn destroy a other of majesty vessel if anything came in way a usually carried despatch real importance of be of course unknown be not to go out of way upon such service edward templemore did however occasionally go little out of way have lately captured very fine privateer after smart action for anticipated promotion admiral thought too young therefore gave next vacancy to own nephew who admiral quite forgot be much younger edward laughed when heard of upon arrival at port royal admiral who expected that must make appearance pouting with disappointment when came up to penn to report be so pleased with good humour that made vow templemore must have next vacancy also quite forgot because edward happened to be at time occurred on long cruise 'out of sight out of mind ' be proverb so well established that may be urged a excuse for person who have so many other thing to think of a admiral entrusted with command of west india station lieutenant templemore have in consequence commanded enterprise for nearly two year without grumbling for be of happy disposition passed very happy sort of life mr witherington be very indulgent to allowed to draw liberally have plenty of money for for friend who required have plenty of amusement amongst other diversion have fallen most desperately in love for in one of trip to leeward isle so called from being to windward have succoured spanish vessel have on board new governor of porto rico with family have taken upon to land on island in safety for service english admiral received handsome letter concluding with moderate wish that excellency might live thousand year edward templemore invitation to go see whenever might pas way like most general invitation be a much compliment a wish wound up letter to admiral did however so happen that spanish governor have very beautiful only daughter carefully guarded by duenna monk who be depositary of sin of governor establishment be with daughter edward templemore fell into heresy of love be indeed very beautiful like country woman be ardent in affection few day that be on board schooner with father during time that enterprise convoyed spanish vessel into port be quite sufficient to ignite two such inflammable being a clara d'alfarez edward templemore monk have be left on board of leaky vessel there be accommodation in schooner for duenna don felix de maxos de cobas de manilla d'alfarez be too busy with cigar to pay attention to daughter when be landed edward templemore be asked to residence be not in town at lovely bay on south side of island town mansion be appropriated to business ceremony of court be too hot for permanent abode governor only went there for few hour day edward templemore remained short time at island at departure received afore mentioned letter from father to english admiral assurance of unalterable fidelity from daughter to english lieutenant on return presented letter admiral be satisfied with conduct when ordered out to cruise always be when there be nothing else to do submitted to admiral whether if must happen to near porto rico must not leave answer to spanish governor letter admiral who knew value of keeping up good understanding with foreign relation took hint gave one to deliver if convenient second meeting be a may be supposed more cordial than first on part of young lady not so however on part of duenna holy friar who soon found out that charge be in danger from heretical opinion caution became necessary a secrecy add charm to amour clara received long letter telescope from edward letter informed that whenever must must make appearance in schooner off south of island await signal made by at certain window acknowledging recognition of vessel on night of signal must land in boat meet at appointed spot be very delightful so happened that edward have four five time contrived during last year to meet clara without discovery again again to exchange vow be agreed between that when quitted station must quit father home trust future happiness to englishman heretic illustration don felix de maxos de cobas de manilla d'alfarez too busy with cigar to pay attention to daughter may be matter of surprise to of reader that admiral must not have discovered frequent visit of enterprise to porto rico a edward be obliged to bring log for examination time that returned admiral be satisfied with edward conduct anxiety to cruise when there be nothing else for to do log be brought on shore to admiral secretary carefully rolled sealed up admiral secretary threw package on one side thought more of matter edward have always ready story to tell when took seat at admiral dinner table besides be very unfit person to command vessel who doe not know how to write log will bear investigation certain latitude be always allowed in degree of latitude a well a longitude enterprise have be despatched to antigua edward thought excellent opportunity to pay visit to clara d'alfarez therefore upon return hove to off usual headland soon perceived white curtain thrown out of window be sir ' said one of midshipman who be near for have be there so often that whole crew of enterprise be aware of attachment behe have shown flag of truce ' ' truce to nonsense mr warren ' replied edward laughing 'how came to know anything about ' ' only judge by cause effect sir know that will have to go on shore wait for to night ' 'that be not unlikely let draw foresheet must now get behind headland ' youngster be right that evening little before dark attended commander on enterprise lying to with lantern at peak 'once more dearest clara ' said edward a threw off long

cave where can wait time must be there ' will be there dearest be not too near beach will not be afraid of men in boat who might see ' 'but can leave beach be ricardo alone be in dread of donna maria merciful heaven must father know must be lost be separated for ever clara laid forehead on edward shoulder a tear fell fast 'there be nought to fear clara hush heard rustling in orange tree listen ' 'yes yes whispered clara hastily 'there be one away dear edward away ' clara sprang from side hastened up grove edward made retreat flying down rocky narrow path through underwood be soon on beach into boat enterprise arrived at headquarters edward reported to admiral have work for mr templemore ' said admiral must be ready to proceed on service immediately have found match ' hope may find sir ' replied lieutenant hope so too for if give good account of will put swab on shoulder pirate schooner have so long infested atlantic have be seen chased off barbadoes by amelia appears that there be not vessel in squadron can come near unless be enterprise have since captured two west indiaman be seen steering with towards coast of guiana now be going to give thirty additional hand send after 'thank sir ' replied edward countenance beaming with delight soon will be ready ' inquired admiral morrow morning sir ' good tell mr hadley to bring order for men sailing order will sign recollect mr templemore will have awkward customer be prudent brave know to be ' edward templemore promised everything a most people do in such case before next evening enterprise be well in offing under heavy

fire volley of more than dozen musket at time opponent imagined force to be much le than really be now made other arrangement spread in semicircle in front of veranda kept up continued galling fire be returned by party under francisco for nearly quarter of hour a musket be now called into action pirate found out that have more formidable enemy to cope with than have anticipated be now quite dark not figure be to be distinguished except by momentary flashing of firearm cain hawkhurst leaving men to continue attack have gained house position under veranda examining window door there appeared little chance of forcing entrance immediately occurred to under veranda men must not be exposed that might fire through wooden floor of upon above hawkhurst hastened away returned with about men leaving others to continue attack a before advantage of manoeuvre be soon evident musket ball of pirate pierced plank wounded many of spaniard severely francisco be at last obliged to order men to

safe ' thought a withdrew from window now know whether loss of veranda may not prove gain to ' be intention of pirate be difficult to ascertain for time have left off firing francisco returned to comrade smoke have gradually cleared away be able to resume position above a pirate did not fire of course must hing a be only by flashing of musket that enemy be to be distinguished further attempt be made at door window below francisco in vain puzzled a to intended plan of assailant nearly hour of suspense passed away of spaniard be of opinion that have retreated to boat gone away francisco

'there can not blame to avoid will be easy must think avenger outsails everything ' believe enterprise be sister vessel by heaven be fair match continued cain feeling of combativeness returning for moment 'and will look like craven to refuse fight fear not francisco have promised will keep word illustration bless boy god bless ' said cain 'but leave now ' cain went on deck surveyed vessel through glass must be ' said aloud so a to be heard by pirate have be sent out by admiral on purpose full of best men what pity be so short handed ' 'there be enough of sir ' observed boatswain

enough of fighting be not stimulated by presence of hawkhurst wish of captain now showed a much anxiety to avoid a usually did to seek combat at first trial of sailing between two schooner there be perceptible difference for hour continued on wind when edward templemore examined sextant second time must not perceive that have gained upon avenger one cable length 'we will keep away point ' said edward to second in command 'we can afford still hold weather gage ' enterprise be kept away increased speed neared avenger more than quarter of mile be nearing ' observed francisco 'we must keep away point away went avenger must have recovered distance enterprise be again steered more off wind thus did continue altering course until studding sail below aloft be set by position of schooner be changed enterprise now being on starboard instead of larboard quarter of avenger relative distance between two schooner be however nearly same be about three mile half from other there be prospect of long weary chase on part of enterprise who again kept away point to near avenger vessel be now running to eastward be about hour before dark that sail hove in sight right ahead of avenger be clearly made out to be frigate pirate be alarmed at unfortunate circumstance a there be little doubt that must prove british cruiser if not have equally reason to expect that must assist in capture have evidently perceived two schooner have made sail tacking quarter of hour so a to keep relative position enterprise who have also made out frigate to attract attention though not within range of avenger commenced firing with long gun 'this be rather awkward ' observed cain 'it will be dark in le than hour ' observed francisco be only chance ' cain reflected minute 'get long gun ready lad will return

for attempt to escape now if be to fire broadside gun difference of report between one of large calibre fired by other schooner must induce to think that be american vessel true replied cain 'and a america be at peace with world that antagonist be pirate hold fast long gun there unship starboard port see that ensign blow out clear ' avenger commenced firing occasional gun from broadside report of be hardly to be heard by on board of frigate while long gun of enterprise reverberated along water loud resonance be swept by wind to frigate to leeward such be state of affair when sun sank down in wave darkness obscured vessel from other sight except with assistance of night telescope 'what do propose to do captain cain ' said francisco ' have made up mind to do bold thing will run down to

pursuer far behind there be not speck on horizon when on second morning francisco who have resumed berth in captain cabin went up on deck notwithstanding request of cain francisco refused to take part in command of schooner considering a passenger prisoner on parole have not be on deck few minute when observed two spanish fisherman belonging to establishment of don cumanos conversing together forward capture have quite escaped memory went forward to speak to surprise at seeing be great until francisco informed of what have passed then recounted what have occurred to showed thumb have be put into screw to torture from truth francisco shuddered consoled by promising that must soon be at liberty return to former master a francisco returned from forward found hawkhurst on deck eye met flashed in enmity hawkhurst be pale from loss of blood evidently suffering have be informed of apparent reconciliation between francisco captain must no longer remain in bed knew also how captain have avoided combat with enterprise something told that there be revolution of feeling in more than one point suffering a be resolved to be spectator of what passed to watch narrowly for francisco cain have imbibed deadly hatred be watching for opportunity to wreak revenge at present be too powerful felt that time be coming when might be triumphant francisco passed hawkhurst without speaking 'you be at liberty again see ' observed hawkhurst with sneer ' be not at event indebted to for ' replied francisco haughtily 'nor for life 'no indeed believe that be indebted to for bullet in shoulder ' replied mate be ' replied francisco coolly 'and depend upon debt will be repaid with usury ' have doubt of if ever be in power fear not ' a francisco made reply captain came up ladder hawkhurst turned away walked forward 'there be mischief in man francisco ' said captain in undertone ' hardly know whom to trust must be watched be tampering with men have be for time not that be of much consequence if doe remain quiet for little while command of vessel be welcome to very soon if attempt too early ' have can trust to replied francisco go below ' francisco sent for pompey krouman gave direction in presence of captain night to surprise of hawkhurst kept watch notwithstanding fatigue appeared day to be rapidly recovering from wound nothing occurred for several day during avenger still continued

prize money cain must not of course raise objection must have be so different from general practice that must have strengthened suspicion already set afloat by hawkhurst cain be most anxious just then to remove ordered girl to be taken down into cabin hoisted in boat breeze springing up again made sail in meantime francisco be consoling unfortunate clara assuring that need be under alarm promising protection from captain poor girl wept bitterly be not until cain came down into cabin corroborated assurance of francisco that must assume degree of composure to find friend when have expected insult degradation for francisco have acknowledged that vessel be pirate be consolation kindness attention of francisco restored to comparative tranquillity next day confided to reason of coming to beach

fortnight examination of inlet bay of island of st domingo without success provision water being nearly expended returned in very happy mood to port royal in meantime disappearance of clara have created greatest confusion in porto rico upon examination of attendant who be confronted by friar duenna amour of mistress be confessed appearance of avenger off coast on evening confirmed idea that donna clara have be carried off by english lieutenant don alfarez immediately despatched vessel to jamaica complaining of outrage demanding restoration of daughter vessel arrived at port royal few day before enterprise admiral be very much astonished returned very polite answer to don alfarez promising investigation immediately upon arrival of schooner to send vessel with result of said investigation 'this be pretty business ' said admiral to secretary madcap sent to look after pirate go after governor daughter by lord harry mr templemore will have account to settle ' can hardly believe sir ' replied secretary 'and yet doe look suspicious on so short acquaintance ' know that mr hadley send for log let examine may have be keeping up acquaintance ' log of enterprise be examined there be fatal word porto rico porto rico bearing in division of compass in separate cruise nay even when schooner be charged with despatch 'plain enough ' said admiral 'confounded young scamp to embroil in way not that marrying girl be business of mine will punish for disobedience of order at event try by court martial by heaven secretary made reply knew very well that admiral must do such thing 'the enterprise anchored at daylight sir ' reported secretary a admiral sat down to breakfast 'and where mr templemore 'he be outside in veranda have told below of what have be accused swears be false believe sir for appears half mad at intelligence ' moment have looked over log ' 'yes sir appears that be off porto rico on th spanish governor letter say that be there on th again made appearance on th mentioned to declares upon honour that be only there on th a stated in log ' let come in speak for ' edward came in in state of great agitation 'well mr templemore have be playing pretty trick what be sir where be girl sir governor daughter ' be sir can not pretend to say feel convinced that have be carried off by pirate 'pirates poor girl pity pity too edward come sit down here tell have happened ' edward knew admiral character so well that immediately disclosed have passed between clara then stated how avenger have escaped by deceiving frigate agreement made with clara to meet for future on beach with conviction that pirate schooner so exactly similar in appearance to enterprise must have preceded at porto rico have carried off object of attachment although edward might have be severely taken to task yet admiral pitied therefore said nothing about visit to porto rico when breakfast be over ordered signal to be made for sloop of war to prepare to weigh enterprise to be revictualled by boat of squadron edward comus will sail in company after rascally pirate trust will give good account of also of governor daughter cheer up boy depend upon will try for ransom before do injury that evening enterprise comus sailed on expedition having run by porto rico delivered letter to governor steered to northward early next morning made land of caicos just a avenger have skirted reef bore up for narrow entrance be ' exclaimed edward be by heaven making signal for enemy be immediately answered by comus chapter xvi caicos small patch of island called caicos cayques be situated about two degree to northward of st domingo be nearly southernmost of chain extends up to bahamas most of island of chain be uninhabited be formerly resort of piratical vessel reef shoal with be surrounded afforded protection from larger pursuer passage through dangerous navigation being known only to pirate who frequented proved additional security largest of caicos island form curve like opened horse shoe to southward with safe protected anchorage when once in bay on southern side previous to arriving at anchorage there be coral reef extending upwards of forty mile through be necessary to conduct vessel passage be extremely intricate be well known to hawkhurst who have hitherto be pilot cain be not so well acquainted with required greatest care in taking in vessel a on present occasion hawkhurst must not be called upon for service island for there be several of be composed of coral rock few cocoa tree raised lofty head where there be sufficient earth for vegetation stunted brushwood rose up between interstice of rock chief peculiarity of island rendered suitable to who frequented be numerous cave with rock be perforated above high water mark majority with sea water flowing in out of in case merely rushing in at high water filling deep pool be detached from other when tide receded in others with sufficient depth of water at time to allow to pull in with large boat be hardly necessary to observe how convenient higher dry cave be a receptacle for article be intended to be concealed until opportunity occurred for disposing of in last chapter stated just a avenger have entered passage through reef comus enterprise hove in sight discovered will be necessary to explain position of vessel avenger have entered southern channel with wind from southward have carefully sounded way for about four mile under little sail enterprise comus have be examining turk island to eastward of caicos have passed to northward of on larboard tack standing in for northern point of reef joined on to great caicos island be therefore in situation to intercept avenger before arrived at anchorage have not be for reef barred passage only plan english vessel must act upon be to beat to southward so a to arrive at entrance of passage when enterprise must of course find sufficient water to follow avenger for a passage be too narrow to beat through wind be from southward avenger must not possibly escape be caught in trap that have to trust to be defence might be able to make in stronghold against force must be employed in attack breeze be fresh from southward appeared inclined to increase when comus enterprise made sail worked in short tack outside reef on board avenger enemy motion be clearly distinguished cain perceived that be in awkward dilemma that must be attacked have doubt although at other time must almost have rejoiced in such opportunity of discomfiting assailant yet now thought very differently must have sacrificed almost everything to have be able to avoid rencontre be permitted quietly to withdraw from associate without spilling of more blood francisco be equally annoyed at unfortunate collision word be exchanged between pirate captain during time that be on deck be about nine o'clock when having safely passed nearly half through channel cain ordered kedge anchor to be dropped sent down people to breakfast francisco went down into cabin be explaining situation to clara when cain entered threw on locker appeared lost in deep sombre meditation 'what do intend to do ' said francisco ' know will not decide francisco ' replied cain 'if be to act upon own judgment probably must allow schooner to remain where be can only attack in boat in such case fear whereas if run right through allow other schooner to follow without defending passage may be attacked by in deep water inside overpowered by number of men two vessel will be able to bring against on other hand certainly may defend schooner from shore a well a on board be weak handed will however call up ship company let decide god know if left to must not fight at there way of escape ' resumed francisco 'yes might abandon schooner night when must not expect run with boat through channel between great island north cayque dare not propose men must not listen to indeed very much doubt if enemy will allow time knew morning long before saw vessel fate must be decided before sun went down 'what do mean ' mean francisco ' said cain 'that mother who always have visited in dream whenever anything dreadful now to think of be about to take place appeared to last night there be sorrow pity in sweet face a mournfully waved hand a if to summon to follow yes thank god no longer looked upon a for many year have done ' francisco made answer cain again seemed to be lost in meditation after little while cain rose taking small packet from one of drawer put into hand of francisco 'preserve ' said pirate captain behould accident happen to will tell who be mother also contains direction for finding treasure have buried leave everything to francisco have be unfairly obtained be not guilty party there be none to claim answer now may find friend whom will make after be gone of same opinion a be tell again be careful of packet ' see little chance of availing ' replied francisco 'if live will not be considered a pirate ' 'no can prove contrary have doubt god will be done 'yes god will be done said cain mournfully dared not have said that month ago pirate captain went on deck followed by francisco crew of avenger be summoned aft called upon to decide a to measure considered to be most advisable preferred weighing anchor running into bay where must be able to defend schooner in opinion much better than by remaining where be crew of pirate schooner weighed anchor continued precarious course breeze have freshened water be in strong ripple so that must no longer see danger beneath bottom in meantime sloop of war enterprise continued to turn to windward outside reef by noon wind have considerably increased breaker now turned broke in wild foam over coral reef in direction sail be still more reduced on board avenger difficulty increased from rapidity of motion storm jib be set others hauled down yet even under small sail flew before wind cain stood at bowsprit giving direction to helmsman more than once have grazed rock be clear again spar be towed astern mean resorted to to check way have guide breaking of wild water on side of 'why must not hawkhurst who know passage so well be made to pilot ' said boatswain to who be near on forecastle be sure let have up ' cried several of crew of went down below in minute reappeared with hawkhurst whom led forward did not make resistance crew demanded that must pilot vessel suppose will not ' said hawkhurst coolly 'then lose passage be ' replied boatswain not so lad continued appealing to crew 'yes take safe in overboard ' replied several mind that threat lad replied hawkhurst 'you have known a good man true be not likely that will desert now well since captain there can not save suppose must exclaimed looking about 'how be out of passage already yes whether can get into again can not tell ' 'we be not out of passage said cain 'you know be not then if captain know better than have better take through ' rejoined hawkhurst crew thought differently insisted that hawkhurst who well knew channel must take charge cain retired aft a hawkhurst went out on bowsprit will do best lad said hawkhurst recollect if strike in trying to get into right channel blame starboard little starboard yet steady so there be true passage lad cried pointing to smoother water between breaker 'port little steady hawkhurst who knew that be to be put on shore a soon a convenient have resolved to lose schooner even if own life be forfeited be now running out of passage on rock minute after have conned struck heavily again again third time struck came broadside to wind heeled over sharp coral rock found way through slight timber planking water poured in rapidly during there be dead silence on part of marauder lad said hawkhurst ' have done best now may throw overboard if please be not fault ' continued pointing to captain be of little consequence whose fault be mr hawkhurst replied cain 'we will settle point by by at present have too much on hand out boat men a fast a can let man provide with arm ammunition be cool schooner be fixed hard enough will not go down will save everything by by ' pirate obeyed order of captain three boat be hoisted out lowered down in first be placed wounded men clara d'alfarez who be assisted up by francisco a soon a men have provided with arm francisco to protect clara offered to take charge of boat shoved off men of war have seen avenger strike on rock preparation of crew to take to boat immediately hove to hoisted out manned own boat with hope of cutting off before must gain island prepare for vigorous defence for although vessel must not approach reef there be sufficient water in many place for boat to pas over shortly after francisco in first boat have shoved off from avenger boat of men of war be darting through surf to intercept pirate perceived hastened arrangement second boat soon left into hawkhurst leaped a be shoving off cain remained on board going round lower deck to ascertain if of wounded men be left then quitted schooner in last boat followed others being about quarter of mile astern of second in hawkhurst have secured place at time cain quitted schooner be difficult to say whether men of war boat must succeed in intercepting of pirate boat party exerted to utmost when first boat with francisco clara landed headmost of assailant be not much more than mile from willow water intervening there be delay be favourable to pirate hawkhurst landed in boat a launch of comus fired eighteen pound carronade last boat be yet two hundred yard from beach when shot from comus launch have be unable hitherto to find passage through reef struck on counter filled went down 'he be gone ' exclaimed francisco who have led clara to cave stood at mouth of to protect 'they have sunk boat be swimming to shore will be here now long before english seaman can land ' be true cain be breasting water manfully making for small cove nearer to where boat be sunk than one in francisco have landed with clara wounded men divided from other by ridge of rock separated sandy beach extended way into water before be submerged francisco must easily distinguish pirate captain from other men who also be swimming for beach for cain be far ahead of a gained nearer to shore be shut from francisco sight by ridge of rock francisco anxious for safety climbed up rock be watching cain be within few yard of beach when there be report of musket pirate captain be seen to raise body convulsively half out of water floundered clear blue wave be discoloured sank be seen no more francisco darted forward from rock perceived hawkhurst standing beneath with musket in hand be recharging 'villain ' exclaimed francisco 'you will account for hawkhurst have reprimed musket shut pan to '

reviving form edward must bear no more covered eye now maddened with jealousy in voice of thunder called out 'give way lad for life give way ' gig be within dozen stroke of oar from beach clara unconscious of wrong have just taken packet of paper from francisco vest when hawkhurst made appearance from behind rock separated two little sandy cove francisco have recovered breath perceiving approach of hawkhurst sprang upon foot to recover musket before must succeed have closed in with short dreadful struggle ensued must soon have terminated fatally to francisco for superior strength of hawkhurst have enabled to bear down body of opponent with knee be fast strangling by twisting handkerchief round throat while clara shrieked attempted in vain to tear pirate from a prostrate francisco be fast blackening into corpse maiden screamed for pity became frantic in effort for rescue boat dashed high up on sand with bound of maddened tiger edward sprang upon hawkhurst tearing down on back severing wrist with sword blade until hold of francisco be relaxed wrestled in own defence lad said edward pointing with left hand to hawkhurst a with sword directed to body of francisco bitterly continued 'this victim be mine ' be intention be frustrated by clara recognition who shrieked out bey edward ' sprang into arm be immediately in state of insensibility seaman who have secured hawkhurst looked upon scene with curious astonishment while edward waited with mingled feeling of impatience doubt for clara recovery wished to be assured by that be mistaken turned again again from face to of francisco who be fast recovering during painful suspense hawkhurst be bound made to sit down illustration clara sprang into arm be immediately in state of insensibility 'edward dear edward said clara at last in faint voice clinging more closely to 'and be then rescued by thee dearest edward felt appeal jealousy have not yet subsided 'who be that clara ' said sternly 'it be francisco

pirate eh well what will woman not swear to to save dote upon ' 'if captain son ' said edward 'why be contending ' 'because just now shot scoundrel father ' 'edward said clara solemnly 'this be time for explanation a hope for mercy what have said be true believe not that villain ' 'yes said francisco who be now sitting up 'believe when say that shot captain for be true sir if value own peace of mind believe nothing to prejudice of young lady ' hardly know what to believe ' muttered edward templemore a lady say be time for explanation with permission madam ' said to clara bey coxswain will

joined by launch of comus crew of be with officer wading to beach men of gig remained until have given hawkhurst francisco in charge of other seaman then shoved off with clara for schooner edward templemore gave one look at gig a conveyed clara on board ordering hawkhurst francisco to be taken to launch guard to be kept over went up with remainder of men in pursuit of pirate during scene have described other boat of men of war have landed on island avenger crew deprived of leader scattered in direction be many of slain captured in about two hour be supposed that majority of pirate have be accounted for prisoner being now very numerous be decided that boat must return with to comus captain of vessel a commanding officer must then issue order a to future proceeding captured pirate when mustered on deck of comus amounted to nearly sixty out of number one half be who have be sent on shore wounded have surrendered without resistance of killed there be fifteen be conjectured that a many more have be drowned in boat when be sunk by shot from carronade of launch although by account given by captured pirate majority be secured yet there be reason to suppose that be still left on island concealed in cave a captain of comus have order to return a soon a possible decided to sail immediately for port royal with prisoner leaving enterprise to secure remainder if there be recover anything of value might be left in wreck of avenger then to destroy with usual celerity of service order be obeyed pirate among whom francisco be included be secured boat hoisted up in hour comus displayed ensign made sail on wind leaving edward templemore with enterprise at back of reef to perform duty entailed upon clara who be on board of schooner to remove suspicion jealousy have arisen in bosom of lover chapter xvii trial in week comus arrived at port royal captain went up to penn to inform admiral of successful result of expedition god ' said admiral 'we have caught villain at last little

have be permitted to turn king evidence have be on board of avenger few month still testimony a to murder of crew of three west india ship attack upon property of don cumanos be quite sufficient to condemn remainder much time be necessarily expended in going through form of court in pirate answering to various name lastly in taking down detailed evidence of above men be late when evidence be read over to pirate be asked if have anything to offer in defence question be repeated by judge when hawkhurst be first to speak to save must scarcely hope only object be to prevent francisco pleading cause successfully escaping same disgraceful death illustration pirate at bar hawkhurst declared that have be time on board avenger that have be taken out of vessel forced to serve against will a must be proved by captain son who stood there pointing to francisco who have be in schooner since first fitting out that have always opposed captain who must not part with because be only one on board who be competent to navigate schooner that have intended to rise against take vessel having often stimulated crew so to do that a other men a well a captain son must prove if choose actually be in

of being wrecked in fact to ascertain where booty be to assist pirate in attack francisco have taken opportunity of putting bullet through shoulder be well known to other pirate francisco must not venture to deny trusted that court must order torture to francisco then must probably speak truth at event let speak now when hawkhurst have ceased to address court there be anxious pause for minute day be fast declining most part of spacious court house be already deeply immersed in gloom while light sober solemn almost sad gleamed upon savage reckless countenance of prisoner at bar sun have sunk down behind mass of heavy yet gorgeous cloud fringing edge with molten gold hawkhurst have spoken fluently energetically there be appearance of almost honesty in coarse deep toned voice even occasional oath with speech be garnished have omitted seemed to be pronounced more in sincerity than in blasphemy gave more forcible impression to narrative have said that when concluded there be profound silence amid fast falling shadow of evening who be present began to feel for first time awful importance of drama before number of life be trembling upon verge of existence depending upon single word of 'guilty ' painful silence harrowing suspense be at last broken by restrained sob from female owing to obscurity involving body of court person must not be distinguished wail of woman so unexpected for who must there be of sex interested in fate of desperate men touched heart of auditor appeared to sow first seed of compassionate humane feeling among who have hitherto expressed felt nothing indignation towards prisoner judge upon bench counsel at bar jury impannelled in box felt force of appeal softened down evil impression created by address of hawkhurst against youthful

indeed challenge love of woman in pride lament in disgrace a regard be directed towards sun have be obscured now pierced through break in mass of cloud threw portion of glorious beam from window opposite upon alone while other prisoner who surrounded be buried more le in deep shadow be at once evident that associate be bold yet commonplace villain men who owed courage only virtue perhaps to habit to physical organisation influence of around be mere human butcher with only adjunct now that trade be to be exercised upon must bear with sullen apathy feeling how far removed from true fortitude even hawkhurst though more commanding than rest with daring mien scowl of defiance looked nothing more than distinguished ruffian with exception of francisco prisoner have wholly neglected personal appearance in squalid sordid look of mendicant seemed allied with ferocity of murderer francisco be not only exception formed beautiful contrast to others a evening beam lighted up figure stood at bar if not with splendour of hero of romance certainly most picturesque interesting personage elegantly if not richly attired low sob at interval repeated a if impossible to be checked seemed to rouse call to sense of important part be called upon to act in tragedy there then performing face be pale yet composed mien at once proud sorrowful eye be bright yet glance be not upon in court far away fixed like eagle upon gorgeous beam of setting sun glowed upon through window be in front of at last voice of francisco be heard in wide court started at sound deep full melodious a evening chime ear of present have in profound silence just recovered from harsh deep toned barbarous idiom of hawkhurst address when clear silvery yet manly voice of francisco riveted attention jury stretched head counsel in court turned anxiously round towards prisoner even judge held up forefinger to intimate wish for perfect silence lord gentleman commenced francisco first found in degrading situation have not thought to have spoken to have uttered one word in defence have just now accused have recommended torture to be applied have already have wish for what torture can be more agonising than to find where now be so tortured indeed have be through short yet wretched life have often felt that anything short of self destruction must release must be blessing within few minute have be made to acknowledge have still feeling in unison with fellow creature be not yet fit for death too young too unprepared to die for who must not reluctantly leave world while there be such beauteous sky to

who be have lost deeply have felt loss one only fact gained from whom must call father be that with own hand slew yes basely slew mother ' address of francisco be here interrupted by low deep groan of anguish startled whole audience be now quite dark judge ordered court to be lighted previous to defence being continued impatience anxiety of present be shown in low murmur of communication until light be brought in word beilence ' from judge produced immediate obedience prisoner be ordered to proceed francisco then continued address commencing with remembrance of earliest childhood a warmed with subject became more eloquent action became energetical without violence pallid modest youth gradually grew into impassioned inspired orator recapitulated rapidly yet distinctly with terrible force startling event in fearful life there be truth in tone of voice there be conviction in animated countenance there be innocence in open expressive brow who heard believed scarcely have concluded address when jury appeared impatient to rise give verdict in favour judge stood up addressing jury told that be most painful duty to remind that a yet have heard assertion beautiful almost convincing assertion truly still be not proof 'alas observed francisco evidence can bring forward except evidence of around at bar will not be admitted can recall dead from grave can expect who have be murdered to rise again to assert innocence can expect that don cumanos will appear from distant league to give evidence on behalf ala know not how be situated must have flown to succour not even can expect that sweet spanish maiden last to whom offered protection will appear in such place a to meet bold gaze of hundred behe be here ' replied manly voice passage be made through crowd clara supported by edward templemore dressed in uniform be ushered into box for witness appearance of fair girl who looked round with alarm created great sensation a soon a be sufficiently composed be sworn gave evidence a to francisco behaviour during time that be prisoner on board of avenger produced packet have saved life of francisco substantiated great part of defence extolled kindness generosity when have concluded one asked of 'can young man be pirate murderer ' reply be 'it be impossible illustration a soon a be sufficiently composed be sworn gave evidence bey lord ' said edward templemore ' request permission to ask prisoner question when be on board of wreck of avenger found book floating in cabin wish to ask prisoner whether a young lady have informed be ' edward templemore produced bible 'it be mine ' replied francisco ask by what mean came into possession 'it be only relic left of one who be now no more be consolation of murdered mother have since be mine give to sir may probably need support now more than ever mother murdered say ' cried edward templemore with much agitation have already said so now repeat ' judge again rose recapitulated evidence to jury evidently friendly to francisco be obliged to point out to that although evidence of young lady have produced much might be offered in extenuation induce to submit to majesty in hope of gracious pardon after condemnation yet that many act in prisoner have be involved have endangered life testimony have be brought forward to prove that have not at one time acted with pirate although might since have repented must of course remember that evidence of mate hawkhurst be not of value must dismiss impression might have made against francisco at same time have unpleasant duty to point out that evidence of spanish lady be so far prejudicial that pointed out good term subsisting between young man pirate captain much a be interested in fate must reluctantly remind jury that evidence on whole be not sufficient to clear prisoner considered duty to return verdict of guilty against prisoner at bar lord ' said edward templemore few second after judge have resumed seat beay not content of packet seal of have not ventured to break afford evidence in favour of prisoner have objection that must be opened previous to jury delivering verdict ' 'none ' replied judge what be supposed content 'the content lord ' replied francisco 'be in writing of pirate captain delivered that packet into hand previous to quitting schooner stating that must inform who be parent lord in present situation claim that packet refuse that content will be read in court if be to die ignominious death at least who be connected with will not have to blush at disgrace for secret of parentage will die with ' 'nay nay be ruled by ' replied edward templemore with much emotion 'in narrative handwriting of can be proved by king evidence there may be acknowledgment of have stated will be received a evidence will not lord ' 'if handwriting be proved must think may ' replied judge 'particularly a lady be present when packet be delivered heard captain assertion will allow to be offered a evidence young man lord ' replied francisco 'unless have permission first to peruse will not have content divulged unless be sure of honourable acquittal jury must deliver verdict ' jury turned round to consult during edward templemore walked to francisco accompanied by clara to entreat to allow packet to be opened francisco be firm against entreaty at last foreman of jury rose to deliver verdict solemn awful silence prevailed throughout court suspense be painful to degree lord ' said foreman of jury verdict be betop sir ' said edward templemore a clasped one arm round astonished francisco extended other towards foreman sir harm not for be brother ' preserver ' cried clara kneeling on other side of francisco holding up hand in supplication announcement be electrical foreman dropped into seat judge whole court be in mute astonishment dead silence be followed by confusion after time judge in vain attempted to put stop to edward templemore clara francisco continued to form same group never be there one more beautiful now that be together one in court perceived strong resemblance between two young men francisco complexion be darker than edward from constant exposure from infancy to tropical sun feature of two be same be time before judge must obtain silence in court when have be obtained be puzzled how to proceed edward francisco who have exchanged few word be now standing side by side bey lord ' said edward templemore 'the prisoner consent that packet will be opened ' do said francisco mournfully have little hope from content ala now have everything to live for now that cling to life feel a if chance be gone day of miracle have passed nothing miracle of reappearance of pirate captain from grave can prove innocence ' 'he reappears from grave to prove thine innocence francisco ' said deep hollow voice startled whole court most of hawkhurst prisoner at bar still more did fear horror distort countenance when into witness box stalked giant form of cain be no longer figure have described in commencement of narrative beard have be removed be pale wan emaciated sunken eye hollow cheek short cough interrupted speech proved that day be nearly at close lord ' said cain addressing judge be pirate cain be captain of avenger still be free come here voluntarily that may attest innocence of young man a yet hand have not known manacle foot gyves be not prisoner included in indictment at

lord gentleman of jury have be in court since commencement of trial declare that word francisco have uttered in own defence be true be totally innocent of act of piracy murder packet must indeed have proved a much in packet there be secret wished to remain unknown to francisco rather than must be opened have come forward how young officer discovered that francisco be brother know not if also be son of cecilia templemore be true packet will explain 'and now lord that evidence be received be content have done one good deed before die surrender a pirate foul murderer to justice true life be nearly closed thanks to villain there prefer must meet that death merit a expiation of many deed of guilt ' cain then turned to hawkhurst who be close to mate appeared to be in state of stupor have not recovered from first terror still imagined appearance of cain to be supernatural 'villain exclaimed cain putting mouth close to hawkhurst ear 'doubly d d villain thou'lt die like dog unrevenged boy be safe be alive thou really living ' said hawkhurst recovering from fear 'yes living yes flesh blood feel wretch feel arm be convinced thou hast felt power of before now continued cain sarcastically 'and now lord have done francisco fare thee well loved thee have proved love hate not then memory forgive yes forgive when be more said cain who then turned eye to ceiling of court house there be francisco there be see ' cried extending arm above head smile upon yes francisco sainted mother smile pardon illustration 'blood for blood ' sentence be not finished for hawkhurst when cain arm be upheld perceived knife in girdle with rapidity of thought drew out passed through body of pirate captain cain fell heavily on floor while court be again in confusion hawkhurst be secured cain raised from ground thank thee hawkhurst ' said cain in expiring voice murder thou hast to answer for have saved from disgrace not of gallows of gallows in thy company francisco boy farewell cain groaned deeply expired thus perished renowned pirate captain who in life have shed so much blood whose death produced murder 'blood for blood ' body be removed now remained for jury to give verdict prisoner be found guilty with exception of francisco who left dock accompanied by newly found brother congratulation of individual who must gain access to chapter xviii conclusion first object will be to explain to reader by what mean edward templemore be induced to surmise in francisco whom have considered a rival have found brother also to account for reappearance of pirate cain in pursuance of order edward templemore have proceeded on board of wreck of avenger while men be employed in collecting article of great value be on board of have descended into cabin be partly under water here have

surprise than fear at pickersgill mr hautaine dress became be handsome fine looking man have nothing of ruffian in appearance unless like byron corsair be half savage half soft must not help thinking that have met many with le pretension a far a appearance went to claim of gentleman at almack other fashionable circle have ventured on deck sir ' said cecilia with little tremulousness in voice request a favour that will inform what intention may be with regard to vessel with regard to lady 'and feel much obliged to for so doing assure will a far a have made up own mind answer candidly

intention to whole party on board feel may trust for have courage where there be courage there generally be truth must first tell whether will condescend to accept term cecilia demurred moment idea of being confidant of smuggler rather startled still knowledge of what intention be if might not reveal might be important a perhaps might dissuade must be in worse position than be now might be in much better conduct of pickersgill have be such up to present a to inspire confidence although defied law appeared to regard courtesy of life cecilia be courageous girl at length replied 'provided what desire to keep secret will not be injurious to one compromise in peculiar situation consent ' ' must not hurt fly miss ossulton in self defence have too much respect for from conduct during short meeting to compromise allow now to be very candid then perhaps will acknowledge that in situation others must do same perhaps not show half so much forbearance father without right interferes with calling attempt to make prisoner to have thrown in jail heavily fined perhaps sent out of country will not enter into defence of smuggling be sufficient to say that there be pain penalty attached to infraction of certain law choose to risk lord b be not empowered by government to attack be gratuitous act have thrown crew into sea must have be justified for be in short act of piracy on part now a father have thought to turn yacht into revenue cutter can not be surprised at retaliating in turning into smuggler a have mixed up looking after revenue with yachting can not be surprised if retaliate by mixing up little yachting with smuggling have dressed male companion a smuggler have sent in smuggling vessel to cherbourg where will be safely landed have dressed only person whom must join with in frolic a gentleman in place object be twofold one be to land cargo have now on board be very valuable other be to retaliate upon father companion for attempt upon by stepping into shoe enjoying for day two luxury be intention to make free with nothing lordship wine eatable that may be assured of will have pleasure if lady sit down to dinner table with a did before with father friend 'you can hardly expect that sir ' said cecilia 'yes do that will be not only price of early release of yacht will also be only mean by will obtain anything to eat observe miss ossulton sin of father be visited on child have now told what mean to do what wish leave to think of decide whether will not be best for party to consent have permission to tell other lady that may be conduct be a secure from ill treatment rudeness a if be in grosvenor square can not answer that will not be hungry if after such forbearance in point show so little gratitude a not to honour with company 'then be to understand that be to be starved into submission ' 'no not starved miss ossulton recollect that will be on bread water detained until do consent detention will increase anxiety of father ' 'you know how to persuade sir ' said cecilia 'as far a be concerned trust will ever be ready to sacrifice feeling of pride to spare father so much uneasiness with permission will now go down into cabin relieve companion from worst of fear a for obtaining what wish can only say that a young person be not likely to have much influence with older than must inevitably be overruled a have not permission to point out to reason might avail must so far allow to be relieved from promise a to communicate have said to to only married woman on board think then might obtain wish must candidly tell will attempt to effect only because be most anxious to rejoin friend 'and be relieved of company replied pickersgill smiling ironically 'of course be must will have petty revenge although may probably will detest at event will not have very formidable charge to make against before go below miss ossulton give permission to add married lady to number of confidant must permit to introduce friend mr ossulton ' pickersgill waved hand in direction of corbett who took off hat made low obeisance be impossible for cecilia ossulton to help smiling 'and continued pickersgill 'having taken command of yacht instead of lordship be absolutely necessary that also take lordship name while on board be lord b allow to introduce under name can not be addressed otherwise depend upon miss ossulton that will have most paternal solicitude to make happy comfortable ' have cecilia ossulton dared to have given vent to real feeling at time must have burst into fit of laughter be too ludicrous at same time very burlesque reassured still more went into cabin with heavy weight removed from heart in meantime miss ossulton mr lascelles remained below in greatest anxiety at cecilia prolonged stay knew not what to think
