precept softening down a much a must fierce occasionally cruel temper of wild untutored race among other advantage shoshone derived from missionary be introduction of vaccination at first be received with great distrust indeed violently opposed good sense of indian ultimately prevailed believe that there be one of shoshone born since settlement be formed who have not be vaccinated process be explained by padre marini polidori to native medical men be now invariably practised by may a well here finish history of good missionary when be sent upon expedition to monterey will soon have to detail padre marini accompanied having failed with shoshone considered that might prove useful by locating in spanish settlement of california parted soon after arrived at monterey have never seen heard of since will however have to speak of again during journey sojourn at town other padre antonio died at settlement previous to journey to monterey indian still preserve robe missal crucifix a

be made to procure few mexican canadian to carry on agricultural labour for may here a well observe prince father have long made up mind to live die among indian expedition be to be undertaken by trip be to be long one in case must not succeed in monterey in enlisting party required be to proceed on to santa fe either with party of apache indian who be always at peace with shoshone else with one of mexican caravan in santa fe there be always great number of french canadian who came year from st louis hired by fur company so that have chance of procuring if however endeavour must prove fruitless a must already have proceeded too far to return alone be to continue on from santa fe with fur trader returning to st louis on mississippi where be to dispose of valuable jewel hire men to form strong caravan return to settlement by astoria trail a adventure may be said to commence at departure upon commission will before enter upon narrative give reader insight into history record of shoshone

other tribe that shoshone be parent tribe of comanche arrapahoes apache bedouin of mexican desert speak same beautiful harmonious language have same tradition indeed so recent have be subdivision that point out exact period by connecting with various event of spanish inland conquest in northern portion of sonora be not intention to dwell long upon speculative theory must observe that if tradition be to be received with confidence must proceed from nation tribe who have long be stationary that northern continent of america be first peopled from asia there can be little doubt if so be natural to suppose that who first came over must settle upon nearest most suitable territory emigrant who upon landing found in climate country a california be not very likely to quit in search of better that such be case with shoshone that be descendant from earliest emigrant that have never quitted settlement made by ancestor have doubt for tradition confirm must be cautious how put faith in remark of missionary traveller upon race of people little known seldom come into contact with better higher class who have information knowledge be only by becoming one of not one of tribe one of chief received into aristocracy that correct intelligence can be gained allow stranger be to arrive at wapping elsewhere in great britain question met in such locality a to religion law history of english how

eastern tribe collected a have occasionally be previous to extinction be trifling absurd why so because driven away to east finding other tribe of indian who have be driven there before already settled there have immediately commenced life of continual hostility change of domicile when people have thus be occupied for generation in continual warfare change be natural to suppose that in life of constant action have have time to transmit tradition ultimately have be lost to tribe must then look for record in quarter where population have remained stationary for age must be in south west of oregon in northern part of upper california sonora that philosopher must obtain eventful history of vast warlike nation of rise of fall western apache shoshone with antiquity ruin of departed glory

who have gone to settlement for fire arm must return in short time till then have nothing to do to be cautious to wait for enemy even beat first attack without using firearm that might not suspect strength inside one of old men cunning fellow who have served time a brave warrior hit upon plan followed proposed that man must accompany to neighbourhood of place where canoe have be concealed keep up fire so that smoke must lull suspicion umbiquas on arrival before post must indubitably send one of men to call canoe keeper one must endeavour to take alive bring to post one of canoe be consequently launched in river late in evening two indian well armed with fusil started on expedition chapter eight umbiquas came at last want of precaution shewed certainty of success at event did not suspect there be fire arm in block house for halted within fifty yard from eastern tower required more than persuasion to prevent roche from firing horse be not with before long saw animal on other side of river in little open prairie under care of two of party who have swum over two three mile above for double purpose of having at hand in case of emergency of giving advantage of better grazing than must possibly find on side be event have not reckoned upon yet after proved to be great advantage to savage making very close inspection of outer building soon became convinced of utter

three men while others be lingering about giving direction more by sign than word often looked toward loop hole light of day be yet too faint for glance to detect besides be lulled into perfect security by dead silence have kept during whole night indeed thought boat house have be deserted certain degree of caution with proceeded be more effect of savage cunning nature than fear of being seen of meeting with kind of resistance two ladder be fixed against one of tower indian ascended upon at first cast inquisitive glance through hole upon side of door concealed then umbiquas formed in circle round ladder with bow spear watching loop hole at chief command first blow be struck indian on ladder began to batter door with tomahawk while in act of striking for third time umbiqua on eastern door staggered fell down ladder breast have be pierced by arrow at same moment loud scream from other tower showed that here also have have same success umbiquas retired precipitately with dead uttering yell of disappointment rage to three of boy being ordered so to do responded with shrill war whoop of defiance made umbiquas quite frantic be now more prudent arrow have killed comrade be child arrow still there must be doubt that have be shot by warrior retired behind projecting rock on bank of river only thirty yard in front quite protected from missile there formed council of war

coolly to take scalp regardless of shower of arrow from yelling disappointed umbiquas be in rage anxiety enemy have exposed beyond protection of rock presented fair mark just a chief be looking behind to see if there be movement to fear from boat house four more of men fell under fire horrible yell followed can never describe although event of first fight be yet fresh in mind umbiquas took dead turned to east in direction of mountain believed must be only mean of escaping destruction be now reduced to only ten men appearance be melancholy dejected felt that be doomed never more to return to

be stern law sometimes brings with execution many great calamity vengeance have often become hereditary from generation to generation murder have succeeded murder till of two family have deserted

murderer life war between two tribe may be said to have commenced most usually however pipe of peace be accepted in preference to proceeding to such extremity will now mention arm accoutrement of shoshone warrior observing at same time that remark refer equally to apache arrapahoes comanche except that great skill of shoshone turn balance in favour shoshone be always on horseback firmly sitting upon small light saddle of own manufacture without stirrup indeed prefer not to have only indian using being chief celebrated warrior who have a mark of distinction more so that saddle stirrup

expert for have often seen at distance of ten foot bury one more than two foot deep in flank of buffalo to complete offensive weapon have lasso leather rope fifty foot long a thick a woman little finger hanging from pommel of saddle be terrible arm against there be little possibility of contending even if adversary posse rifle for casting of lasso be done with rapidity of thought attempt to turn round fire must indubitably seal fate only mean to escape fatal noose be to raise rein of horse to top of head hold thing diagonally from body such a lance carbine thing except knife must hold in sight hand ready for use chance then be if lasso fall above head must slip then be lost throw if be quick enough to pas knife through noose cut a be dragged back then advantage becomes yours at least be equally divided for then may turn upon enemy whose bow lance rifle for better management of lasso have be left behind too firmly tied about to be disengaged used in so short time can only oppose with knife tomahawk if choose may employ own lasso in case position be reversed still conquest belongs to most active of two often happens that after having cut lasso turned upon foe indian without diminishing speed of horse will pick up from ground where have dropped rifle lance then of course victory be in hand escaped once from being lassoed in way be pursued by crow indian first throw failed so did second third on fourth cut rope wheeling round upon gave chase shot through body with one of pistol noose at cast formed exact circle fell with such precision centre above head circumference reaching from neck to tail of horse that if have not thrown away rifle lance bow quiver must immediately have be dragged to ground western indian mexican be admirably expert in handling deadly weapon before arrival of prince seravalle shoshone have buckler soon cast aside a incumbrance skill be wasted upon proper management of defensive armour being now applied to improved use of lance doubt much whether in tournament of day of chivalry gallant knight must show to lady love greater skill than shoshone can exhibit when fighting against arrapahoe crow crow neighbour who be of dacotah race be also excellent horseman most admirably dressed fond of show can not be compared to shoshone have not same skill moreover abuse change horse so often that poor brute be never accustomed to master most wonderful feat of shoshone also of comanche apache be facility with will hang alongside horse in charge upon enemy being perfectly invisible to quite invulnerable except through body of horse yet in difficult dangerous position will use of arm with precision skill way in keep balance be very simple pas right arm to very shoulder through fold of lasso a have said be suspended to pommel round neck of horse for foot find support in numerous loop of deer skin hanging from saddle thus suspended left arm entirely free to handle bow right one very nearly so to draw arrow watch opportunity unless previously wounded seldom miss aim have said that shoshone threw away buckler at instigation of prince seravalle who also taught european cavalry tactic have sense enough to perceive advantage must gain from be immediately incorporated a far a possible with own shoshone now charge in squadron with lance form square wheel with wonderful precision execute many difficult manoeuvre a combine european tactic with own indian mode of warfare one of most singular sight be to witness disappearance behind horse after indian fashion of whole body of perhaps five hundred horse when in full charge effect be most strange at one moment see horse mounted by gallant fellow rushing to conflict at given signal man have disappeared horse in perfect line appear a if charging without rider of own accord upon rank of enemy have dwelt perhaps too long upon manner habit of people can not help however giving reader proof of knowledge higher class among really posse have said that be good astronomer may add that intuitive knowledge of geometry be remarkable once asked young chief what considered height of lofty pine be in afternoon about three o'clock walked to end of shadow thrown by pine tree fixed arrow in ground measured length of arrow then length of shadow thrown by then measuring shadow of pine deducted from in same proportion a difference between length of arrow length of shadow gave result worked rule of three without knowing most remarkable instance occurred when be about to cross wide rapid river required rope to be thrown across a stay to men horse question be what be length of rope required ie be width of river old chief stepped horse forward to solve problem did a follows went down to side of river fixed upon spot a centre then selected two tree on right left on other side a near a eye must measure equidistant from where stood having so done backed horse from river until came to where eye told that have obtained point of equilateral triangle thus in diagram selected two tree b walked back to e there fixed lance then fell back in direction e d until have a nearly a must tell made distance from e equal to from e d fixed lance same be repeated to e c when last lance be fixed then have parallelogram a distance from f to e be exactly equal to distance from e to g have to measure space between bank of river f deduct from e g obtained width of river required think that calculation proved to be perfectly correct occupied old chief more than three minute must be remembered that be done in face of enemy resume own history chapter ten in narrating unhappy death of prince have stated that crow bore good will to white men established among shoshone that feeling however be not confined to tribe be shared by others within two three hundred mile from buona ventura river be not surprising since arrival tribe have acquired certain degree of tactic unity of action be sufficient in to bear down enemy independent of immense power have obtained from quantity of fire arm almost inexhaustible ammunition other nation be jealous of strength resource jealousy being now worked up to climax determined to unite strike great blow not only to destroy ascendancy shoshone have attained also to posse of immense wealth foolishly supposed european have brought with to settlement for long time previous to crow umbiqua expedition have detailed messenger have be passing between tribe tribe strange to say have buried private animosity to form league against common enemy a be considered shoshone be doubt owing to arrangement that crow umbiquas shewed so hardy prompt successful retaliation of shoshone cooled little war spirit be fomenting around however arrapahoes having consented to join league united confederate at once opened campaign broke upon country in direction be taken by surprise for first three week carried thing before for majority of warrior be still hunting having be apprised of danger returned in haste aspect of affair soon changed lost ground be regained inch by inch arrapahoes having suffered great deal retired from league having now nothing to fear from south turned against assailant on northern boundary notwithstanding desertion of arrapahoes united tribe be still three time number wanted union did not act in concert mustered about fifteen thousand warrior from umbiquas callapoos cayuse nez perces bonnaxes flat head of crow who have not yet gained prudence from last brushing superiority of arm tactic discipline art of intrenchment together with good service of two clumsy old spanish four pounder enabled not only in short time to destroy league also to crush annihilate for ever of treacherous neighbour a must be tedious to stranger to follow movement of whole campaign will merely mention that part of in assisted system of prairie warfare be so different from ours that campaign have just related will not be easily understood by acquainted only with european military tactic when european army start upon expedition be always accompanied by waggon carrying store of provision ammunition of kind there be commissariat appointed for purpose of feeding troop among indian there be such thing except few piece of dried venison pound weight of powder corresponding quantity of lead if have rifle if not with lance bow arrow tomahawk warrior enters war path in closer country for water fuel trust to stream to tree of forest mountain when in prairie to mud hole chasm for water to buffalo dung for fire rifle arrow will always give enough of food supply must not of course be sufficient for great number of men ten thousand for example water hole must be drained by first two three hundred men might arrive remainder must be obliged to go without then unless perchance must fall upon large herd of buffalo must never be able to find mean of sustaining life buffalo three four deer can be killed day by hunter out of tract of expedition supply must suffice for small war party must never do for army except in buffalo range where comanche apache southern shoshone will often go by band of thousand generality of indian enter path in kind of echelonage be to say supposing shoshone to send two thousand men against crow must be divided into fifteen twenty band commanded by inferior chief first party will start for reconnoitring next day second band accompanied by great chief will follow in track so on with third till three hundred three hundred fifty be united together then will begin operation new party coming to take place of who have suffered till retire to make room for others new comer brings supply of provision produce of chase in coming so that who be fighting need be in fear of wanting necessary of life by reader will see that band of two thousand warrior only four five hundred be effectually fighting unless number of warrior agreed upon by chief prove too small when new reinforcement be sent forward be divided into four war party one acted against bonnaxes flat head in north east second against cayuse nez perces at fork of buona ventura calumet river third remained near settlement to protect from surprise while fourth very small one under father command to be attached remained in about boat house at fishing station independent of four party well armed band be despatched into umbiqua country by land sea in beginning warfare on shore of pacific amounted merely to skirmish by by callapoos having joined umbiquas with numerous party game assumed more interest not only lost advantage in umbiqua country be obliged little by little to retire to post however proved to be salvation be one hundred six men whilst adversary mustered four hundred eighty yet full one fifth of number be destroyed in one afternoon during desperate attack made upon post have be put into admirable state of defence roof have be covered with sheet of copper hole have be opened in various part of wall for use of cannon of possession of enemy be ignorant first assault be gallantly conducted one of loophole be choked with ball arrow on advanced in close thick body with ladder torch yelling like million of demon when at distance of sixty yard poured upon content of two gun be heavily loaded with grape shot produced most terrible effect enemy did not retreat raising war whoop a rushed with determination truly heroical gun be again fired also whole of musketry after party of forty of men made sortie last charge be sudden irresistible enemy fled in direction leaving behind dead wounded that evening received reinforcement of thirty eight men from settlement with large supply of buffalo meat twenty fine young fat colt be great comfort to a for several day have be obliged to live upon dried fish during seven day saw nothing of

resolved not to confine more within wall of post formed spacious camp to east of block house with breastwork of uncommon strength plan probably saved from contagious disease indeed bad smell of dried fish rarefied air in building have already begun to affect many of men especially wounded at end of week enemy re appeared silent determined have returned for revenge for death struggle be to be fearful one encamped in little open prairie on other side of river mustered about six hundred men first war party have overthrown dispersed bonnaxes a be on way to join flat head former tribe not being able to effect intended junction threw among cayuse nez perces three combined nation after desultory warfare gave way before second war party bonnaxes being now rendered desperate by loss certainty that must be exterminated if shoshone must conquer joined callapoos umbiquas to make one more attack upon little garrison nothing must have saved have flat head held out longer black foot irreconcilable enemy seizing opportunity have entered territory sued to for peace then detachment from war party hastened to help of be apprised by runner having previously concerted measure with father started alone to meet detachment in pass of mineral mountain returning warrior be seven hundred strong have not lost more than thirteen men in two expedition divided into three band succeeded

shone above prairie mild beam be cast upon four hundred corps whole of bonnax umbiqua party be entirely destroyed callapoos suffered little having dispersed run toward sea shore at beginning of affray

of montezuma with disgust consequently have remained unnoticed advancing not step used now then in time of danger neglected when longer required must plainly perceive how little unity there be prevailing among leader of opponent at time position of army showed superior military genius at others infantry be exposed cavalry performing useless evolution be evident that two power be struggling with other one endeavouring to maintain regular discipline other following only impulse of unsteady overbearing temper discovery of course rendered somewhat more confident be with small pride reflected that in army alone commanded be pretty sight to look at shoshone who already understood strength gained by simultaneous action apache too in frequent encounter with regular troop have acquired certain knowledge of cavalry tactic traveller in mexico who have met with intrepid warrior have wondered at gallant uniform bearing californian also having now so much at stake have assumed demeanour quite contrary to usual indolent nature confidence in be much increased since success against fonseca comparison must now make between disposition arrangement of opposed force so elated indeed be so positive of success that frequently urged to immediate attack have determined upon line of conduct to adhered arrapahoes showed little unruly brave such excellent horseman a almost to realise fable of centaur charging enemy with impetuosity of lightning disappearing with quickness of thought requested moment to engage know too well value of regular infantry how ineffectual must be effort of light cavalry against bayonet be obliged to restrain ardour by argument must muster principally by giving to understand that by hasty attack must certainly lose booty moment came at last prudence of old commander having be evidently overruled by ignorant coadjutor infantry be put in motion flanked on one side by cavalry on other by artillery be indeed pitiful movement for paid dearly despatched arrapahoes to out flank charge cavalry of enemy when signal must be made apache slowly descended hill in face of infantry upon opened destructive fire with four field piece infantry behaved

penetrate chance however be still ours mexican artillery be in power cavalry dispersed almost out of sight infantry though admirably disciplined be very hardly pressed in flank in front at juncture sent gabriel to bring back arrapahoes to scene of conflict for knew that mexican cavalry must never form again until have reached border of senora of course coadjutor of martinez have disappeared with fugitive cavalry leaving old general to regain lost advantage to bear consequence of own cowardice folly now left master of action talented officer did not yet despair of success by admirable manoeuvre threw infantry into two division so a to check body of cavalry until must form into solid square charging with impetuosity through shoshone regained possession of piece of artillery after retreating slowly succeeded in reaching without further loss ground have occupied previous to advance from more broken uneven nature enabled infantry to resist charge of cavalry with considerable advantage manoeuvre of old general extricated troop from dangerous position recovered field piece have also advantage of rendering artillery of further service a must not move down hill a battle be still to be fought resolved to attack before have time to breathe while be yet panting exhausted with recent exertion till then californian have be merely spectator of conflict now put at head charged mexican square in front while shoshone did same on left apache on right five six time be repulsed repeated charge old commander everywhere giving direction encouraging men roche be wounded fifteen of californian dead rank of shoshone much thinned by unceasing fire of artillery apache be giving way in confusion be beginning to doubt of success when gabriel having succeeded in recalling arrapahoes from pursuit of fugitive cavalry re formed made furious charge upon mexican on only side of square not already assailed precisely at moment when last desperate effort of shoshone own body of californian have thrown rank opposed to into confusion brave old commander perceiving must no longer keep ground retreated slowly with intention of gaining rugged broken ground at base of mountain behind where cavalry must no longer assail perceiving intention determining if possible to prevent retreat arrapahoes having now rejoined formed into one compact body made final decisive charge proved irresistible broke through rank dispersed for time command power ceased indian be following own custom of killing without mercy scalping dead one half of enemy be destroyed martinez succeeded with remainder in reaching intended position mexican troop considered useless to contend more shortly afterwards old general rode towards with flag to ascertain condition under must accept surrender poor man be truly estimable officer indian opened rank to let pas while californian who felt for mortification uncovered a mark of respect old general demanded free passage back to senora big tear be in eye a made proposal speaking of younger associate never used word to disparagement though slight curl of lip showed plainly how bitter be feeling knew too that fate be sealed that alone must bear disgrace of defeat so much be respected by californian that request be immediately granted upon assurance that under circumstance must return to california a foe a martinez departed shoshone chief

apache comanche shoshone arrapahoes be so clean so very nice in arrangement of domestic comfort that suffered very little not at at least remember single case brought death in tribe indeed a have before mentioned shoshone vaccinate such be not case with club indian of colorado of west with crow flat head umbiquas black foot last suffered great deal more than people in world ever suffered from plague pestilence to be sure mandans have be entirely swept from surface of earth be few while black foot be undoubtedly most numerous powerful tribe in neighbourhood of mountain war party ranged

hundred village thousand thousand of horse numbered more than six thousand warrior name have become by word of terror on northern continent from shore to shore little child in eastern state who knew

nay week together will when have opportunity eat to repletion stomach being always in disordered state principal physical cause of fierceness ferocity be wonder that fell victim with such predisposition to disease will require many generation to recover number of indian perished in year a have said a long a live will form epoch era to will for century refer note there be prospect of north western tribe remaining in present primitive state indeed of gradual improvement for nothing can induce to touch spirit know that eastern indian have be debased conquered by use of consider

offering ransom answered war whoop of apache representing companion a friend requesting help protection be immediately given be once more unbound free hardly need say that be most agreeable change in state of affair for have doubt have arrived at destination must either have be gibbeted died somehow in prison if change be satisfactory to be not so to joachem texada louis ortiz who changed note with change of condition scoundrel who have amused with reminding that have to expect be ignominious death be now devoted humble servant cleaning brushing own mule for use holding stirrup begging for interference in behalf with apache such wretch did not deserve good office therefore said nothing for against leaving apache to act a pleased about week after liberation apache halted a be about to divide force into two band one of be to return home with booty have captured while other proceeded to border of texas have stated that shoshone arrapahoes apache have entered into confederation comanche be too far distant for to have have opportunity of making proposal to a union be always uppermost in mind resolved must now visit comanche with view to furtherance of object country on east side of rio grande be one dreary desert in water be to be procured believe indian have ever done more than skirt border indeed a assert that be inhabited by spirit demon be clear that can not have visited to proceed to comanche country be therefore necessary that must follow rio grande till came to presidio of rio grande belonging to mexican from there cross over take road to san antonio de bejar last western city of texas proceed through texian country to where comanche be located therefore decided that must join band of apache who be proceeding towards texas during excursion apache have captured many horse arm from trading party have surprised near chihuahua with accustomed liberality furnished with steed saddle arm blanket clothes indeed be so generous that must easily pas off a merchant returning from trading expedition in case be to fall in with mexican have to undergo examination took leave of generous apache chief who be returning homewards joachem texada louis ortiz be with rest of escort led away a captive what became of can not say travelled with other band of indian until have passed presidio del rio grande strong mexican fort day afterwards took farewell of having joined band of smuggler who be on way to texas ten day afterwards entered san antonio de bejar have nothing more to fear a be now clear of mexican territory san antonio de bejar be by far most

bishopric wealthy mission have fallen to rank of small english village still carry on considerable trade appearance of prosperity be deceptive must caution emigrant not to be deceived by texian account of place immense profit have be made to be sure now even mexican smuggler bandit be beginning to be disgusted with universal want of faith probity mexican be very fond of garden of surrounding

allowing superstition of indian to be mixed up with rite of church sort of half breed religion became general upon principle presume that loaf be better than bread anomalous consequence of policy be to be seen in indian ceremony even to day to afford adequate protection to roman catholic missionary settlement be established still bear name of mission be very numerous throughout california there be several in texas alamo at san antonio be one of great importance there be others of le consideration in neighbourhood a mission of conception of san juan san jose la espada edifice be most

principal square of town be marked more le by shot one among have suffered very much be government house celebrated for one of most cowardly massacre ever committed by nation of barbarian will here relate after skirmish betwixt comanche texians in former have always have advantage latter thought advisable to propose treaty of alliance messenger with flag of truce be despatched among indian

fine mexican texture command in market from fifty to one hundred fifty dollar apiece horse be noble animal of great value saddle richly embossed with gold silver display of so much wealth excited

pistol knife began work of murder indian fell except one who succeeded in making escape though comanche be quite unarmed sold life dearly for eighteen texians be found among slain will close chapter with few remark upon now acknowledged republic of texas dismenmberment of texas from mexico be effected by report of extensive gold mine diamond etcetera be to be found there raised cupidity of eastern speculator land jobber of united state in probability appropriation must never have taken place if have not be that southern state of america have with very different view given encouragement to attempt people of louisiana southern state knew exact value of country laughed at idea of immense treasure acted from deep although eventually have turned out to have be false policy considered that texas once wrested from mexico must be admitted into union subdivided into two three state one of must of course be slave holding state send member to congress must have given slave holding state preponderance in union event have turned out differently planter of south now deplore untoward policy want of foresight a have assisted in raising up formidable rival in production of staple commodity injurious to even in time of peace in case of war with england still more inimical to interest be much to be lamented that texas have not be populated by more deserving class of individual might have be even by time country of importance wealth have from commencement be resort of vagabond scoundrel who must not venture to remain in united state unfortunately texian character be fixed established a community wholly destitute of principle probity before emigration of more respectable settler have commenced consequence have be most disastrous be to be questioned whether of will ever be removed at period of independence population of texas be estimated at about forty thousand now if be to credit texian government have increased to about seventy five thousand such however be not fact although of course suit member of republic to make assertion instead of increase stated by population of texas have decreased considerably be not now equal to what be at independence may appear strange after so many thousand from united state england germany have be induced to emigrate there fact be that after having arrived in country having discovered that be at mercy of band of miscreant who be capable of dark deed have quitted country to save remainder of substance have passed over into southern united state anywhere else where have chance of security for life property among population of texas be counted many thousand mexican who remained in country trusting that order law must soon be established disappointed in expectation have emigrated to mexico eight thousand have quitted st antonio de bejar void have be filled up by six seven hundred drunkard thief murderer same desertion have taken place in goliad velasco nacogdoches other town be formerly occupied by mexican family may give reader idea of insecurity of life property in texas when state that there be numerous band of robber continually on look out to rifle murder traveller that be of frequent occurrence for house to be attacked plundered woman violated individual afterwards murdered by miscreant who to escape detection dress paint a indian of course what have now stated although well known to be fact be not likely to be mentioned in texian newspaper serious evil arising from lawless state of country be that indian who be well inclined towards texians a being with mutual enemy of mexican be now hostile to extermination have mentioned murder of comanche chief in government house of san antonio in be sufficient such have be disgraceful conduct of texians towards indian that white man be now considered by a term of reproach be spoken of by indian a dog be generally hung shot whenever be fallen in with century can not repair serious evil texians have made bitter implacable foe of who must have be friend distinction be made between american texian texians have raised up foe to united state may hereafter prove not little troublesome in point texas have be seriously injured by total want of probity principle have western texas be settled by people of common honesty must from topographical situation have soon become very important country a mercantile transaction with north central province of mexico must have be secured to from presidio del rio grande there be excellent road to san antonio do bejar to south of san antonio lie chihuahua so that nearest most accessible route overland from united state to centre of mexico be through san antonio overland route can be shortened by discharging vessel at linville la bacca from thence taking good to san antonio distance of about one hundred forty mile western boundary line of texas at time of declaration of independence be understood to be river nueces if so nothing must have prevented san antonio from becoming inland depot of much commercial importance numerous party of mexican trader have long be accustomed to come to san antonio from rio grande be generally very honest in payment showed very friendly spirit have trade be protected a must have be by putting down band of robber who rendered road unsafe by depredation atrocity must have become of more value than trade to santa fe recognised unrecognised texas must have carried on trade merchant must have settled in west to participate in emigrant must have collected in district where soil be rich climate healthy be true trade must have be illicit such be ever inevitable consequence of high ill regulated tariff must nevertheless have be very profitable must have conciliated population of rio grande towards texians in probability have forced upon mexican government establishment of friendly relation between two country trade have be totally destroyed indian now seize plunder caravan to from san antonio texian robber lie in wait for if escape indian must mexican trader escape with good from have still to undergo chance of being swindled by soi disant texian merchant if ever there be proof from result of pursuing opposite course that honesty be

fifteen mile along ravine have impeded journey during preceding day when fell in with small creek there horse drank incredible quantity of water a position be not yet very safe again resumed march at brisk trot travelled three four more mile along foot of high ridge discovered what seemed to be indian trail leading in zigzag course up side of followed soon found on summit of ridge there be again gratified at finding spread out before perfectly level prairie extending a far a eye must reach without tree to break monotony of scene halted few minute to rest horse for time watched what be passing

hind leg unseen by gabriel have crept up close on opposite side of horse have noosed animal with lasso a be pulling trigger of pistol bruin soon disengaged from lasso made towards roche who brought down with single shot below ear gabriel then went on ahead to select place for passing night leaving friend behind to cut up meat have not gone mile when progress be suddenly checked by yawning abyss chasm two hundred yard across probably six hundred foot in depth bank at place be nearly perpendicular from side projected sharp rock now then tall majestic cedar travelled mile more along bank perceiving be too late to find passage across encamped in little hollow wider cluster of cedar there be soon joined by roche be indebted to bruin for excellent repast immense chasm before ran nearly north south perceived that current of stream rather torrent below ran towards former point next morning determined to direct step to northward have gone few mile before large buffalo indian trail be seen running in south west direction a travelled on others be noticed bearing more to west obliged to keep out distance from ravine to avoid small gully emptying into various elbow made about noon struck upon large trail running directly west followed on reaching main chasm found that led to only place where there be chance of crossing here too found that innumerable trail joined coming from direction proof conclusive that must cross here travel many weary mile out of way dismounting from animal looked at yawning abyss before first impression be that passage be impracticable that buffalo mustang very probably indian horse have crossed here be evident enough for zigzag path have be worn down rocky precipitous side three horse be unused to sliding down climbing precipice drew back on being led to brink of chasm after many unsuccessful attempt at last persuaded steed to take path others followed in place went along very verge of rocky edge where false step must have precipitated hundred of foot down to instant death in others be compelled to slide down pass nearly perpendicular gabriel horse be much bruised after hour severe toil gained bottom without sustaining serious injury here remained couple of hour to rest weary animal find trail leading up opposite side discovered after great exertion succeeded in clambering up to top where again found upon smooth level prairie on looking back shuddered to behold frightful chasm have so successfully passed thought miracle that have got safely across very short time afterwards be convinced that feat have just accomplished be mere nothing after giving animal rest resumed journey across dreary prairie not tree bush must be seen in direction green carpeting of short grass be spread over vast scene with naught else to relieve sight people may talk of solitude of forest a much a please there be company in tree one miss upon prairie be in prairie with ocean like waving of grass like vast sea without landmark that traveller feel sickly sensation of loneliness there feel a if not in world although not out of there find sign trace to tell that there be beyond behind country where million of own kindred be

part of prairie driven out doubtless by scarcity of water have not be for occasional shower while travelling through dreary waste must most inevitably have perished for even immense chasm have water in except temporarily supplied by rain chapter twenty two morning broke bright cloudless sun rising from horizon in majesty having saddled horse pursued journey in north east direction have scarcely proceeded six mile before suddenly came upon immense rent chasm in earth far exceeding in depth one have so much difficulty in crossing day before be not aware of existence until be immediately upon brink when spectacle exceeding in grandeur thing have previously witnessed burst upon sight not tree bush outline whatever marked position course be lost in amazement wonder a rode up peered into yawning abyss in depth must not have be le than one thousand foot in width from three to five hundred yard at point where first struck side be nearly perpendicular sickly sensation of dizziness be felt by three of a looked down a be into very bowel of earth below occasional spot of green relieved eye stream of water now visible now concealed behind huge rock be bubbling foaming along immense wall column in place what appeared to be arch filled ravine worn by water undoubtedly so perfect in form that must with difficulty be brought to believe that hand of men genius have not be employed in raising rain of century falling upon extended prairie have here found reservoir vent sapping undermining of different vein of earth stone have formed strange fanciful shape before reaching chasm have crossed numerous large trail leading little more to westward than have be travelling be at once convinced that centred in common crossing close at hand in conjecture be not disappointed hour trotting brought into large road thoroughfare for year of million of indian buffalo mustang perilous a descent appeared well knew there be other near horse be again started ahead while two others followed once in narrow path led circuitously down deep descent there be possibility of turning back maddened animal finally reached bottom in safety several large stone be loosened from under foot during frightful descent must leap dash thunder down precipitous side strike against bottom far below with terrific crash found running stream at bottom on opposite side of romantic dell covered with short grass few scattered cotton wood tree large body of indian have encamped on very spot few day previous blazed limb of tree other sign shewing that have made resting place too halted couple of hour to give horse opportunity to graze rest trail led up to prairie on opposite side be discovered short distance above to south a journeyed along chasm be struck with admiration at strange fanciful figure made by washing of water during rainy season in place perfect wall formed of reddish clay be to be seen standing in other locality must have be impossible to believe that have be raised by hand of man stratum of wall be composed be regular in width hard running perpendicularly where softer sand have surrounded have be washed away stratum still remained standing in place one hundred foot high three four hundred in length here there be column such be architectural regularity so much of chaste grandeur be there about that be lost in admiration wonder in other place breastwork of fort must be plainly visible then again frowning turret of castle of olden time cumbrous pillar apparently ruin of mighty pile formerly raised to religion royalty be scattered about regularity perfect design be strangely mixed up with ruin disorder nature have done niagara have be considered one of wildest freak niagara fall into insignificance when compared with wild grandeur of awful chasm imagination carried back to thebe to palmyra edomite paetra must not help imagining be wandering among ruin passage out of chasm be effected with greatest difficulty be obliged to carry rifle saddle bag in hand in clambering up steep precipice roche horse striking shoulder against projecting rock be precipitated fifteen twenty foot falling upon back thought must be killed by fall singular enough rose immediately shook second effort in climbing proved more successful animal have not received slightest apparent injury before evening be safely over having spent five six hour in passing chasm once more found upon level

horse have a yet suffered le than for grazing in prairie have be good now hurried march difficult crossing of immense chasm began to tell upon at sunrise halted near small pond of water to rest animal allow hour to feed while stretched upon ground perceived large antelope slowly approaching now stopping now walking few step nearer evidently inquisitive a to who rather what might be curiosity cost life with well directed shot gabriel brought down none starved man must appreciate delight cooked best part of animal made plentiful dinner resumed journey for three day more same dreary spectacle of boundless prairie be still before not sign be visible that be nearing edge journeyed rapidly on till near middle of afternoon of third day when noticed dark spot mile half ahead of at first thought to be low bush a gradually neared have more appearance of rock although nothing of kind have be seen from time first came on prairie with exception of at chasm buffalo cried roche whose keen eye at last penetrated mystery buffalo lying down asleep here then be chance for making good meal felt courage invigorated gabriel went ahead on foot with rifle in hope that must at least get near enough to wound animal while roche made preparation for chase disencumbering horse of pound of superfluous weight started for sport rendered doubly exciting by memory of recent suffering from starvation for mile beyond where buffalo lay prairie rose gradually knew nothing of nature of ground beyond gabriel crept till within hundred fifty yard of animal now began to move show sign of uneasiness gabriel gave shot evidently hit rose from ground whisked long tail looked for moment inquiringly about still kept position few hundred yard from gabriel who reloaded piece shot followed buffalo again lashed side then started off at rapid gallop directly towards sun evidently wounded not seriously hurt roche started in pursuit keeping close together until have nearly reached top of distant rise in prairie here horse being of superior mettle passed that of roche on reaching summit found buffalo still galloping rapidly at quarter of mile distance descent of prairie be very gradual must plainly see object

work more kindly soon appeared to take great interest in exciting race let fall back little then by dashing spur deep into side brought up directly alongside within three four yard of infuriated beast fired other pistol buffalo shrank a ball struck just behind long hair on shoulder be under such headway when fired be obliged to pas animal cutting across close to head then again dropping behind at

reader may perceive there be not much difference between printed record tradition of comanche chapter twenty five be during convalescence that fate of texian expedition to santa fe be decided a real fact have be studiously concealed intelligence gained from indian who be disinterested party be afterwards fully corroborated by irish gentleman who have be persuaded to join may a well relate here assuming character of friendly trader with hundred dollar worth of good a blind to real intention be to surprise mexican during neutrality have be agreed upon about five hundred men be collected at austin for expedition although report be everywhere circulated that be to be trading experiment expedition when quitted austin certainly wore very different appearance men have be supplied with uniform general colonel major be dashing about in direction quitted capital of texas with drum beating colour flying deceived by texians few respectable european be induced to join expedition for scientific research desire to visit new unexplored country under such protection little imagining that have associated with large band of robber for other name can be given to lawless plunderer if force made tolerable appearance on quitting capital few hour march put end to discipline restraint although country abounded with game be killed from mere wantonness such be improvidence that be obliged to resort to salt pork other provision a in thirty day forty large cask of whisky be consumed be easy to suppose be indeed fact that night that halted camp be scene of drunkenness riot during last few day of march through game country killed more than hundred buffalo yet three day after have quitted prairie have entered dreary northern desert have provision left be compelled to eat worn out miserable horse true account of horrible suffering must beggar description became so weak so utterly helpless dozen mexican well mounted must have destroyed yet miserable a be under necessity of conciliating indian must not forego piratical thieving propensity fell upon small village of wakoes whose warrior hunter be absent not satisfied with taking away eatable must carry amused with firing indian store shooting child did not leave until village be reduced to heap of burning ash act of cowardice sealed fate of expedition be so constantly harassed by wakoe warrior have lost already so many scalp afterwards meeting with small party of mexican surrendered to that might escape well deserved unrelenting vengeance of warlike wakoes such be fate of texian expedition there be portion of history have be much talked of in united state mean history of captivity suffering while on road from santa fe to mexico mr daniel webster hath made government question mr pakenham british ambassador in mexico have employed influence of own position to restore to freedom half dozen of englishman who have joined expedition of course knew nothing of circumstance except from report of texians now be just that mexican version must be heard also latter be true one at least so far a can judge by what saw what heard upon spot from mexican document yet in possession day before capture texians who for last thirteen day have suffered pang of hunger came suddenly upon flock of several thousand sheep belonging to mexican government a usual flock be under charge of mexican family living in small covered waggon in must remove from spot to spot shifting pasture ground a required in country very few individual be employed to keep largest herd of animal be always accompanied by number of noble dog appear to be particularly adapted to protect guide animal dog run about never bark bite on contrary will walk gently up to one of flock happens to stray take carefully by ear lead back to companion sheep show least fear of dog be there occasion for useful guardian be cross of newfoundland st bernard breed of very large size very sagacious now if texians have asked for hundred sheep for money in barter sheep be worth about sixpence must have be supplied directly a soon a flock be perceived one of texian leader exclaimed with oath mexican property welcome booty upon boy upon mercy one of poor mexican who have charge be shot through head others succeeded in escaping by throwing down among thick rank of affrighted animal till out of rifle distance then began carnage without discrimination texians never ceased firing until prairie be for mile covered with body of victim yet grand victory be not purchased without severe loss for dog defended property intrusted to care scorned to run away before must all be killed have torn to piece dozen of texians dreadfully lacerated a many more evening be of course spent in revelry danger fatigue delay vexatious of march be now considered over high be anticipation of rich plunder in perspective be only feat accomplished by texian expedition mexican have not be deceived have have intelligence of real nature of expedition advanced party have be sent out to announce approach twenty four hour after have regaled with mutton one of party amounting to about one hundred men made appearance excitement of previous evening have evaporated texians sent out flag of truce three hundred of surrendered unconditionally to small mexican force on one point european nation have be much deceived be a to character of mexican soldier who appears to be looked upon with degree of contempt be great mistake have arisen from false report unfounded aspersion of texians a to result of many of engagement can boldly assert although opposed to that there be not braver individual in world than mexican in opinion far superior to texian although probably not equal to in knowledge use of fire arm one great cause of mexican army having occasionally met with defeat be that mexican who be of oldest best castile blood retain pride of spanish race to absurd degree son of old nobility be appointed a officer learn nothing know nothing of military tactic know how to die bravely be battle of st jacinta decided separation of texas have be greatly cried up by texians fact be be battle at be commanded by santa anna who have great military talent mexican reposed full confidence in santa anna feeling very unwell went to farm house at small distance to recover be captured by dozen texian robber who took on to texian army loss of general with knowledge that there be one fit to supply place dispirited mexican retreated since time have proved to texians how insecure be even at moment england other european government have thought proper very hastily to recognise texas mexico have not will not expedition to santa fe by texians broke peace occurred in autumn of mexican army entered texas in spring of sweeping thing before from st antonio di bejar to colorado texians have sent emissary to yucatan to induce province to declare independence war in yucatan obliged mexican army to march back in direction to quell insurrection did then returned to texas again took possession of st antonio di bejar in september of same year taking many prisoner of consequence away with be intention of mexican to have returned to texas in spring of year fresh disturbance in yucatan prevented santa anna from executing project texas be therefore by mean secure population be decreasing who have respectability attached to character have left hardly need observe that texian national debt now amounting to thirteen million of dollar may for many reason turn out to be not very profitable investment see note to return to santa fe expedition texians be deprived of arm conducted to small village called anton chico till order must have be received a to future disposition from general armigo governor of province be not to be supposed that in small village of about one hundred government shepherd several hundred famished men must be supplied with necessary superfluity of life texians accuse mexican of having starved in anton chico forgetting that texian have same ration of provision a mexican soldier of course texians now attempted to fall back upon original falsehood that be trading expedition have be destroyed plundered by indian unfortunately assault upon sheep cowardly massacre of shepherd be not to be got over a governor armigo very justly observed to if be trader have committed murder if be not trader be prisoner of

lightning boy grows to manhood family tradition be deeply engraved in memory when alone in solitude near haunted place morbid imagination embodies phantom of diseased brain wonder then that such men must tamely yield to superior will of one like joe smith who to knowledge wanders alone by moonlight in solitude of forest who in firm belief hold communication with spirit of world for be observed smith posse quality exercise trick of necromancer during middle age speech be ambiguous solemn often incomprehensible great proof to vulgar of mystical vocation cattle horse lost for many month have

smith gang ever rambling in wood glen be well acquainted with retired shady spot usual abode of wild a well a of tame animal who seek there during summer shelter against hot ray of sun thus notwithstanding bad conduct smith have spread renown for hundred of mile a of strange man when started new religion declared prophet of god people did not wonder have rigdon other presented instead of joe mormonism must never have be established in performer of mysterious deed seemed natural consequence a stone have mentioned did much in raising joe to present high position will here insert affidavit made relative to joe smith obtaining possession of miraculous treasure manchester ontario county new york became acquainted with smith family known a author of mormon bible in year at time be engaged in money digging business followed until latter part of season of in year be engaged in digging well employed joe smith to assist after digging about twenty foot below surface of earth

joe brother came to wished to borrow same stone alleging that wanted to accomplish business of importance must not very well be done without aid of stone told be of particular worth to merely wished to keep a curiosity if must pledge word honour must have when called for might have did took stone thought must rely on word at time a have made profession of religion in be disappointed for disregarded word honour in fall of friend called upon wished to see that stone about so much have be said told if must go with to smith distance of about mile might see to surprise however on asking smith for stone said can not have ' told belonged to repeated to promise have made at time of obtaining stone upon faced with malignant look said care who devil belongs to will not have ' colonel nahum howard chapter thirty nine must pas over many detail interesting in too long to insert in work must suffice to say that after time joe smith stated that have possession of golden plate have received from heaven pair of spectacle by mean of unknown character must be decyphered by may appear strange that such absurd assertion must be credited reader must call to mind credence given in country to joanna southcote infatuation displayed by proselyte to very last origin of mormonism deserves peculiar examination from success have attended imposture prospect have of becoming firmly established a new creed at first organisation took place at time that golden plate be translating reader may suppose be nothing more than content of book that rigdon have obtained possession of have be originally written by s spalding there be six member of new creed first member consisting mostly of person who be engaged with smith in translation of plate forthwith applied with great zeal to building up church first effort be confined to western new york pennsylvania where met with considerable success after number of convert have be made smith received revelation that follower must go to

inasmuch a ye be humble faithful call on name behold will give victory give unto promise that will be delivered once out of bondage inasmuch a obtain chance to loan money by hundred thousand even till have obtained enough to deliver out of bondage be command to borrow money in order to free from debt oppressed made attempt failed to get sufficient to meet exigency led to expedient in smith rigdon others formed mercantile house purchased good in cleveland in buffalo to very large amount on credit of six month in fall other house be formed good purchased in eastern city to still greater amount great part of good of house went to pay workman on temple many be sold on credit so that when note came due house be not able to meet smith rigdon co then attempted to borrow money by issuing note

cash when note be first issued be current in vicinity smith took advantage of credit to pay off with debt brother have contracted in neighbourhood for land other purchase eastern creditor however refused to take note led to expedient of exchanging for note of other bank accordingly elder be sent off country to barter kirkland money did with great zeal continued operation until note be not worth sixpence to dollar a might have be expected institution exploded after few month involving smith brother in inextricable difficulty consequence be that most of member of church set off in spring of for missouri pursued by creditor to effect must now go back for short period to state circumstance in endowment meeting solemn assembly be called to be held in temple at kirkland be given out that

church be salt that dissenter be salt have lost flavour that be literally to be trodden under foot of church until bowel must gush out in one of meeting of danite band one of leader informed that time be not far distant when elder of church must go forth to world with sword at side that must soon have to go through state of missouri slay man woman child have in contemplation at one time to prophesy dreadful pestilence in missouri then to poison water of state to bring about thus to destroy inhabitant in early part of fall of year last disturbance between mormon missourian commenced have origin at election in davy county where of mormon have located citizen of davy in conversation with mormon remarked that mormon voted one way be denied with warmth violent contest ensued when at last mormon called missourian liar came to blow quarrel be followed by row between mormon missourian day two after smith with company of men from far west went into davy county for purpose a said of quelling mob when arrived mob have dispersed citizen of davy gathered in turn however mormon soon collected force to amount of five hundred men compelled citizen to retire fled leaving country deserted for many

consecrated through church spoil unto host be done when have plenty of own previous to citizen in section of country taking thing from continued depredation for near week when clay county militia be ordered out contest be bloody one suffice to say that finally smith rigdon many others be taken at court of inquiry be remanded over for trial rigdon be afterwards discharged on habeas corpus smith comrade after being in prison several month escaped from guard reached quincy illinois mormon have be before ordered to leave state by direction of governor many have retired to illinois previous to

citizen caused to be received with greatest hospitality kindness after arrival of smith greater part of settled at commerce situated upon mississippi river at lower rapid just opposite entrance of river de moines site equal in beauty to on river here began to build in short time of four year have raised city at first a be before said on account of former suffering also from great political power possessed from unity be treated by citizen of illinois with great respect subsequent event have turned tide of feeling against in winter of applied to legislature of state for several charter one for city of name smith have given to town of commerce one for nauvoo legion military body one for manufacturing purpose one for nauvoo university privilege asked for be very extensive such be desire to secure political support that be granted for mere asking indeed leader of american legislature seemed to vie with other in sycophancy towards body of fanatical stranger so anxious be party to do favour must secure gratitude tended to produce jealousy in mind of neighbouring citizen fear be expressed lest body so united religiously politically might become dangerous to liberal institution mormon have at election voted in body with leader alone made formidable legion of mormon have be amply supplied with arm by state whole body be under strictest military discipline fact together with complaint similar to be made in missouri tended to arouse strong feeling against at last in early part of summer of citizen of illinois organised strong force in opposition mormon be beaten in contest disposition now manifested by citizen appears to be to act upon defensive at hazard to maintain right a regard pecuniary transaction of mormon since have be in illinois smith still us power for own benefit present arrangement be to purchase land at low rate lay off into town lot sell to follower at high price thus lot that scarcely cost dollar be frequently sold for thousand have raised several town in manner in illinois in ioway during last year have made two proclamation to follower abroad to come settle in county of hancock proclamation have be obeyed to great extent strange to say hundred have be flocking in from great manufacturing city of england what be to be result of be impossible to tell one thing be certain that in political point of view mormon be already powerful that object of smith be evidently to collect follower into one focus thus concentrate power wealth design of smith coadjutor at time of first publication of book of mormon be doubtlessly nothing more than pecuniary aggrandisement believe expected at time so many must ever be duped to be converted when however delusion began to spread publisher saw door opened not only for wealth also for extensive power history throughout shews that have not be remiss in effort to acquire extent of desire be now by mean limited for writing action shew design to pursue same path attain same end by same mean a did mahomet idea of second mahomet arising in nineteenth century may excite smile when consider step now taken by mormon to concentrate number ultimate design to unite with indian will not

appointed be nd of september joe told that on day arose early in morning took one horse waggon of one have staid overnight at house accompanied by wife repaired to hill contained book left wife in waggon by road went alone to hill distance of thirty forty rod then took book out of ground hid in tree top returned home next day went to work for time in town of macedon about ten day afterwards having be suggested that one have got book wife gave notice of upon hiring horse returned home in afternoon staid just time enough to drink cup of tea went in search of book found safe took off frock

ala 't be written in egyptian hieroglyphic joe call to assistance wonderful stone gift of god peeping hastily through see angel pointing somewhere towards miraculous pair of spectacle yes two polished piece of crystal be humble mean by golden plate be to be rendered comprehensible by bye said spectacle be heavy ugly piece of workmanship of last century be silver mounted bear maker name plainly

apostle of wild delusion have disseminated principle duped thousand to believe true have crossed ocean in england have made many convert recently of missionary have be sent to palestine such strenuous exertion having be still being made to propagate doctrine of book such fruit having already appeared from labour of friend becomes matter of interest to investigate history of strange delusion although doe not deserve treat subject seriously book of mormon purport to be record history of certain people who inhabited america previous to discovery by columbus according to book people be descendant of one lehi who crossed ocean from eastern continent to of history record containing prophecy revelation be engraven by command of god on small plate deposited in hill comora appears to be situated in western new york thus be preserved account of race together with religious creed up to period when descendant of laman lemuel sam who be three eldest son of lehi arose destroyed descendant of nephi who be youngest son from period descendant of eldest son dwindled in unbelief became dark loathsome filthy people last mentioned be present american indian plate above mentioned remained in depository until when be found by joseph smith junior who be directed in discovery by angel of lord on plate be certain hieroglyphic said to be of egyptian character smith by direction of god being instructed by inspiration a to meaning proceeded to translate will be here proper to remark that narrative so extraordinary a contained in book of mormon translated from hieroglyphic of even most learned have limited knowledge that too by ignorant man who pretended to other knowledge of character than what derived from inspiration requires more than ordinary evidence to substantiate will therefore be purpose to inquire into nature degree of testimony have be given to world to substantiate claim of extraordinary book in first place existence of plate have ever since alleged discovery be in dispute on point must be extremely easy to give proof by making exhibition of to world if be so ancient a be claimed to be designed for purpose of transmitting history of people if have lain for age deposited in earth appearance must certainly indicate fact what evidence then have of existence of plate why none other than mere dictum of smith certificate of eleven other individual who say that have seen upon testimony be required to believe most extraordinary narrative now even admitting for sake of argument that witness be honest credible men yet what must be easier than for smith to deceive must not easily procure plate inscribe thereon set of character matter what exhibit to intended witness a genuine what must be easier than thus to impose on credulity weakness if be necessary to give appearance of antiquity chemical process must effect matter admit that witness be honest for six of after having made attestation to world that have seen plate left church thus contradicting that to have certified one of witness martin harris who be frequently mentioned in book of covenant who be high priest of church who be one of most infatuated of smith follower who even gave property in order to procure publication of book of mormon afterwards seceded from church smith in speaking of in connection with others said that be so far beneath contempt that notice of must be too great sacrifice for gentleman to make of mormon have said that copy of plate be presented to professor anthon gentleman standing in first rank a classical scholar that attested to faithfulness of translation of book of mormon now let read what professor have to say on matter in letter recently published express thus many year ago precise date now recollect plain looking countryman called upon with letter from dr samuel l mitchell requesting to examine give opinion upon certain paper marked with various character doctor confessed must not decipher bearer of note be very anxious to have explained very brief examination of paper convinced that be not only mere hoax very clumsy one character be arranged in column like chinese mode of writing presented most singular medley ever beheld greek hebrew sort of letter more le distorted through unskilfulness from actual design be intermingled with sundry delineation of half moon star other natural object whole ended in rude representation of mexican zodiac conclusion be irresistible that cunning fellow have prepared paper in question for purpose of imposing upon countryman who brought told man so without hesitation then proceeded to give history of whole affair convinced that have fallen into hand of sharper while left in great astonishment at simplicity professor also state that gave opinion in writing to man that mark on paper appeared to be merely imitation of various alphabetic character have meaning at connected with following letter received relative to occupation of joe smith a treasure finder will probably remind reader of character of dousterswivel in walter scott tale of antiquary one must almost imagine that walter scott have borrowed from joe that joe have borrowed from great novelist first became acquainted with joseph smith senior family in lived at time in palmyra about one mile half from residence great part of time be devoted to digging for money especially in night time when said money

farm there be deposited keg barrel hogshead of coined silver gold bar of gold golden image brass kettle filled with gold silver gold candlestick sword etcetera etcetera must also say that nearly hill in part of new york be thrown by human hand in be large cave joseph junior must see by placing stone of singular appearance in hat in such manner a to exclude light at time pretended must see thing within under earth that must spy within above mentioned cave large gold bar silver plate that must also discover spirit in whose charge treasure be clothed in ancient dress at certain time treasure must be obtained very easily at others obtaining of be difficult facility of approaching depended in great measure on state of moon new moon good friday believe be regarded a most favourable time for

excursion joseph smith senior came to one night told that joseph junior have be looking in stone have seen not many rod from house two three keg of gold silver foot under surface of earth that none others elder joseph must get accordingly consented to go early in evening repaired to place of deposit joseph senior first made circle twelve fourteen foot in diameter circle ' said contains treasure then stuck in ground row of witch hazel stick around said circle for purpose of keeping off evil spirit within circle made of about eight ten foot in diameter walked around three time on periphery of last circle muttering to something must not understand next stuck steel rod in centre of circle then enjoined profound silence lest must arouse evil spirit who have charge of treasure after have dug trench of about five foot in depth around rod old man by sign motion asked leave of absence went to house to inquire of son cause of disappointment soon returned said that joe have remained time in house looking in stone watching motion of evil spirit that saw spirit come up to ring a soon a beheld cone have formed around rod caused money to sink then went into house old man observed that have

ever made money digging profitable business however have constantly around worthless gang whose employment be to dig for money at night who during day have more to do with mutton than money when found that better class of people of vicinity must no longer put faith in scheme for digging money then pretended to find gold bible of said book of mormon be only introduction latter book be at length fitted for press mean be taken by individual to suppress publication one apprehended danger from book originating with individual who have influence honesty honour two joseph hiram promised to shew plate after book of mormon be translated afterwards pretended to have received express commandment forbidding to shew plate respecting manner of obtaining translating book of mormon statement be always discordant elder joseph must say that have seen plate that knew to be gold at other time must say looked like gold at other time asserted have not seen plate at have thus briefly stated few of fact in relation to conduct character of family of smith probably sufficient have be stated without going into detail william stafford following be curious document from one of very individual who printed mormon bible having noticed in late number of sign of time notice of work entitled mormon delusion monstrosity occurred to that might perhaps be of service to cause of truth to state one circumstance relative to authenticity of book of mormon occurred during publication at time be practical printer engaged in office where be printed became familiar with men principle through whose agency be got up ' circumstance alluded to be a follows have heard much said by martin man who paid for printing only one in concern worth property about wonderful wisdom of translator of mysterious plate resolved to test wisdom accordingly after putting one sheet in type laid aside told harris be lost there must be serious defection in book in consequence unless sheet like original must be produced announcement threw old gentleman into great excitement after few moment reflection said must try to obtain after two three week sheet be produced more like original than other sheet of paper must have be written over by common schoolboy after having read a have manuscript preceding succeeding lost sheet a might be expected disclosure of trick greatly annoyed author caused little merriment among who be acquainted with circumstance a be none of christian only laboured for gold that perisheth ' did not care for delusion only so far a to be careful to avoid enjoy hoax not one of hand in office where wonderful book be printed ever became convert to system although writer of be often assured by harris that if did not must be destroyed in tn tucker groton may note a have mentioned word title must make understood there be certain class of individual in united state who by own fortune education social position must not be easily brought over to mormonism joe smith a founder of sect have not only proved great man that perfectly understands countryman above greediness for kind of distinction can nominally raise above common herd for be fact that people hate word equality more than american joe smith have instituted title dignity office corresponding to of government in old world have not yet dared to make king have created nobility will support when think proper to assume sovereign title thus have selected individual expressly to take care of church form order of templar with grand master etcetera have organised band of soldier called danites sacred battalion celeres of romulus be comites count chief be conductor duke then follow pontiff bishop etcetera etcetera plan have proved to answer well a have given to mormonism many wealthy individual from eastern state who accepted title came over to europe to act a emissary from joe under magnificent title of great commander prince of zion comte de jerusalem director of holy college etcetera etcetera chapter forty three let now examine into political view of mormon follow smith in lofty aspiring vision of sovereignty for future be rogue swindler one can doubt yet there be something grand in composition joe mean miserable half starved money digger of western new york be a have before observed cast in mould of conqueror out of same clay nature have employed for creation of mahomet first struggle be successful greater portion of follower surrounded in kirkland acknowledged power a of god right hand while many individual from among better class repaired to attracted by ascendency of bold genius by expectation of obtaining share in fame power glory kirkland however be inland place there on side smith have to contend with opposition power be confined plan have not sufficient room for development turned mind towards western border of missouri be thought with rapid action be a much natural consequence of thought a thunder be of lightning examine into topography of country holy zion promised land of mormon will be easy to recognise fixed unchangeable view of smith a connected with formation of vast empire for last twelve fifteen year government of united state have through mistaken policy be constantly engaged in sending to western border eastern indian tribe be disposed to sell land also various tribe who having rebelled against cowardly despotism have be overpowered conquered during struggle gross want of policy be obvious surrounded demoralised by white men indian fall into complete state of decadence abrutissement witness choctaw tribe that hover constantly about mobile new orleans winnebegoes who have of late come into immediate contact with settler of wisconsin pottawatomies on shore of lake michigan miami of north indiana many more on contrary tribe on border in wilderness be on increase of course there be few exception such a kansa poor mandans who have lately be almost entirely swept away from earth by small pox of smaller tribe may be destroyed by warfare may incorporate with others thus lose name nationality increase of indian population be considerable among great uncontrolled nation such a chippewa dahcotahs sioux of north united state comanche pawnee on boundary even in very heart of texas shoshone snake on southern limit of oregon brave apache of sonora bold bedouin of mexican desert who constantly on horseback wander in immense phalanx from eastern shore of gulf of california to very water of rio grande admitting therefore a fact that tribe on border do increase in same ratio with material strength grows also invincible stern unchangeable hatred towards american in fact more le have be ill treated abused additional outrage to one tribe be locked up in memory of who wait for moment of retaliation revenge in wisconsin war black hawk even after poor starved warrior have surrendered by treaty after noble struggle more than two hundred old men woman child be forced by american to cross river without boat canoe poor thing endeavoured to pas with help of horse river there be more than mile broad while unfortunate be struggling for life against current of nine mile hour be treacherously shot in water fact be known to tribe even to comanche who be so distant have satisfied a to what may expect from who thus violate treaty faith remainder of brave tribe be now dwelling on west border of ioway wrong be too deeply dyed with own blood to be forgotten even by generation cause be ready to be espoused by tribe even who have be hereditary enemy for what be after history history of almost indian nation transplanted on other side of mississippi belt of indian tribe therefore be rather unsafe neighbour especially in event of civil war of contest with england having by mistaken policy collected together cordon of offended warrior united state will day deplore when too late former greediness cowardice cruelty towards natural owner of vast territory be among tribe joe smith wish to lay foundation of future empire settling at independence be interposing a neutral force between two opponent who must of have purchased massive strength effective energy with gift of supremacy over immense wealthy territory a have seen chance fortune of war have thrown smith mormon back on eastern shore of mississippi opposite entrance of desmoines river when forced back mormon be unruly turbulent crowd without mean military tactic now such be not case already prophet have sent able agent over river sac fox same tribe have just spoken of a much abused nation of wisconsin actually residing at about eighty mile north north west from nauvoo besides many others be on good understanding with latter day saint few bold apostle of mormonism have also gone to far far west among unconquered tribe of prairie to organise offensive power ever ready for action thus link after link smith extends influence be already felt in illinois in iowa in missouri at washington at very foot of rocky mountain moreover hundred of mormon without avowing creed have gone to texas established there save crop have numerous cattle drove of horse undoubtedly to feed sustain mormon army on future invasion let now examine further into cunning long sighted policy will admire great genius presides over be not one of so common in day who have adopted nil admirari for motto genius well ill guided be still genius if load with shame former life of smith present abominable religious imposition still be bound to do justice to conquering spirit can form such vast idea work such multitude to will population of texas doe not amount to seventy thousand soul among whom there be twenty five different form of religion two third of inhabitant be scoundrel who have there sought refuge against offended law of country be not only curse check to civilisation reflect dishonour upon remaining third portion of texians who have come from distant clime for honest purpose of trade agriculture mongrel mixed congregation of being though firmly united in one point war with mexico that in expectation of rich plunder be continually at variance on other point three thousand texians must fight against mexico not two hundred against mormon for many reason government alone not individual must be gainer by victory in texas not soul care for thing besides mormon be yankee can handle rifle setting aside good drilling excellent discipline in number must also have advantage while be now writing can muster five thousand well drilled soldier in event of invasion of texas must easily march ten thousand men from sabine to rio grande from red river to gulf of mexico opposition will not meet year after capture whole of texas becomes mormon while joe king emperor pharaoh judge regenerator rule over host of two hundred fifty thousand devoted subject let reader observe that be not wild utopia of heated imagination speak a do believe intercourse with mormon during travel have be sufficiently close to give clear insight into design for future joe policy be above to conciliate indian once done there will not be in america power capable of successfully opposing in order to assist join in new faith in admitting indian to be right though guilty descendant of sacred tribe flatters with acknowledgment of antiquity only point on white can captivate even blind shrewd though untutored man of wild in explanation of plan proceeding of joe smith mormon may not be amiss to make remark upon locality have designed a seat of empire dominion where have already established follower a destined instrument of ambition according to mormon prophet whole region of country between rocky mountain alleghanies be at period of about thirteen hundred year ago densely peopled by nation descended from jewish family who emigrated from jerusalem in time of prophet jeremiah six seven hundred year before christ immense city be founded sumptuous edifice reared whole land overspread with result of high extensive civilisation book of mormon speaks of city with stupendous stone wall of battle in hundred of thousand be slain land afterwards became waste howling wilderness traversed by few straggling band tribe of savage descended from branch of aforesaid jewish family who in consequence of wickedness have complexion changed from white to red emigrant from europe descendant having filled land god having be pleased to grant revelation by be made known true history of past in america event be about to take place have also commanded saint of latter day to assemble together there occupy land be once held by member of true church state of missouri illinois territory of iowa be region to prophet have hitherto chiefly directed scheme of aggrandisement be to form nucleus of mormon empire remaining state be to be licked up like salt fall before sweeping falchion of glorious prophetic dominion like defenceless lamb before mighty king of forest have given result of note taken relative to mormon not perhaps in very chronological order a gathered from time to time reader will agree with that subject be well worth attention absurd ridiculous a creed may be creed ever in so short period obtained so many such devoted proselyte from information have since received may now amount to three hundred thousand have wealth energy unity have thing in favour federal government have be so long passive that doubt if have power to disperse indeed to obtain political support have received so many advantage may say such assistance that be now so strong that attempt to wrest from privilege have be conceded must be signal for general rising have fortified nauvoo can turn out disciplined force a large a state be likely to oppose to if successful can always expect co operation of seventy thousand indian if defeated retreat among will enable to coalesce for more fortunate opportunity of action do imagine that loss of leader joe smith must now much affect strength there be plenty to replace equally capable not perhaps to have formed confederacy religious political have done to uphold now that be so strong united state appear to to be just now in most peculiar state of progression very soon eye of whole world will be directed towards result of institution change be about to take place what that change will be be difficult to say few year will decide question chapter forty four having now related principal event witnessed in be actor in california in texas a country be still new little known for indeed texians know nothing of inland country will attempt topographical sketch of region also make remark upon animal inhabit immense prairie mountain of wilderness along shore of pacific ocean from degree down to degree north climate be much same only difference between winter summer

perceive how well land be watered lake be transparent deep river run upon rocky bottom a well a brook creek water of be always cool plentiful one more observation to convince reader of superiority of clime be that except few ant in forest there be insect to be found mosquito prairie horse fly beetle except coconilla large phosphoric fly of california very few worm caterpillar consequence be that

country of arrapahoes be full of silver perhaps people in world can shew greater profusion of bright metal than indian shoshone territory be of modern formation at least in comparison with more southern country where cordillieres andes project to very shore of ocean be evident that best portion of land west of buonaventura be first redeemed from sea by terrible volcanic eruption until about two century ago perhaps le subterranean fire have continued to exercise ravage raising prairie into mountain sinking mountain forest many fathom below surface of earth site now marked by lake of clear

being confronted with bear puma other ferocious quadruped if be attacked can fight only few accident have ever happened in encounter a animal always wander alone with exception of wolf from whom however there be little to fear a in prairie animal be always glutted with food timid at approach of man a prairie wolf be entirely different from european will borrow page of ross cox who having have opportunity of meeting give very good description of manner way of living yet a traveller doe not describe animal will add that general colour of prairie wolf be grey mixed with black ear be round straight be about forty inch long posse sagacity cunning of fox prairie wolf say cox be much smaller than inhabit wood generally travel together in number solitary one be seldom met with two three of have often pursued from fifty to one hundred driving before a quickly a horse must charge skirt be of value therefore waste much powder ball in shooting indian who be obliged to pay dear for ammunition be equally careful not to throw away on object that bring remunerating value natural consequence be that wolf be allowed to multiply part of country be completely overrun by indian catch number of in trap set in vicinity of place where tame horse be sent to graze trap be merely excavation covered over with slight switch hay baited with meat etcetera into wolf fall being unable to

animal in vain attempt to escape from sanguinary assailant although wolf of america be most daring of beast of prey on continent be by mean so courageous ferocious a of europe particularly in spain south of france in country commit dreadful ravage on man beast whereas prairie wolf except forced by desperation will seldom never attack human being have said that danger attends traveller in great prairie be trifling be very different in eastern swamp mud hole where enemy ever on watch be also always invisible where speed of horse arm of rider be of avail for be then swimming in deep water splashing breast deep in foul mud among monster of swamp lagoon of stagnant water alligator rank first in size voracity yet man have nothing to fear from though there be many story among cotton planter about negro being carried away by immense reptile do firmly believe that few human being have ever be seized alive by american alligator although harmless to man monster be scourge to kind of animal principally to dog horse often happens that rider loses track through swamp muddy cane brake then if new comer in east texas be indubitably lost while poor steed be vainly struggling in yielding mass of mud will fall into hole before can regain footing irresistible force will drag deeper deeper till smothered force be tail of alligator with animal master prey matter how strong heavy

suffer greatly if escape with life monster a strike with force object within circle towards jaw a tail make motion be opened to full stretch thrown little sideways to receive object like battering ram to bruise shockingly in moment yet a have said alligator be little formidable to man in western louisiana eastern texas where animal be much hunted for sake of grease with planter generally oil machinery of mill little negro be generally sent into wood during fall grease making a at season men be better employed in cotton picking storing maize danger ever happens to urchin during expedition a keeping within sweep of tail contrive to chop off with axe m audubon say when autumn have heightened colouring of foliage of wood air feel more rarefied during night early part of day alligator leave lake to seek for winter quarter by burrowing under root of tree covering simply with earth along edge become then very languid inactive at period to sit ride on one must not be more difficult
