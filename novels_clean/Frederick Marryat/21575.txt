decoration of person to one who have so contaminated with tobacco chewing seaman who be pigtail within without for a scripture say who can touch pitch without being defiled although mother have made

port admiral although seldom left ship must not refuse such compliment so went a soon a be dark jack thought absence too good opportunity not to have fish so go into mizen chain drop line well fished know whether caught till boat be hailed in first lieutenant be coming on board then jack thought time to haul in line just at moment there be jerk jack who knew that fish be at bait must not for life of pull up line for see be fisherman heart soul so jack trusted to providence first lieutenant going down below a soon a came on deck now see ship be lying at time 'cross tide wind blowing against current starboard side being to leeward a to wind to windward a to tide have be cleared away manned for boat jack made sure that first lieutenant must pull to side be mistaken whether be that first

come to fire then sit in father big chair never knew that father have be married thought peter anderson said that be bachelor so be replied bessy be not daughter although call father indeed then whose daughter be who be old lady upstairs old lady upstairs be widow of pilot with whom father served time husband be lost at sea keep father house father picked up at sea have taken care of ever since then remember own parent recollect nothing till found in house father say be dutchman because be dutch ship dutch boat be taken out of how long be that ago nine year ago be now believe about ten year

bessy brought large bible read chapter aloud then closed put away ca always do tom observed bramble when be knocking about in channel can do be to read when can come now to breakfast when have finished assisted bessy to put everything away then bramble said to anderson tell be good scholar tom must now learn what will be of use to a well a to first thing must learn can do on shore be point of compass to know at sight tell quickly for see be of great importance to pilot to know exactly how ship head be men at helm although good seaman steering well be not so ready at answering a pilot wish very often stammer at sometimes make mistake now see when be piloting vessel if stand at binnacle watch compass answer quickly how ship head be will be of use to in very short time go up into room under bed will find compass bring down carefully will give lesson at once brought compass to bramble made write down whole thirty two point at full length upon piece of paper when have done so told must learn by heart a fast a must studied whole of day in evening finding perfect went up to bramble repeated without one mistake right said bramble now tom give paper if know to night ought to know to morrow morning will hear if do after breakfast went to bed be tapped up a before by bessy assisted to clean everything taking off hand heaviest of work indeed what have narrated of first day may be taken a sample of life on shore at deal after breakfast repeated point of compass correctly well tom have good memory be certain better for for pilot carry everything in head a will find out now then look here bramble took glass off top of compass box lifted up card then showed needle below pointed to north then showed north point above then other point making repeat a put finger on a soon a understood must put stem of pipe to one ask be when be perfect with point explained half point quarter point in two day have gained by heart now say must try iron skewer be ship head recollect will stick into table when do so must tell what point of compass stand to then will be direction of ship head do understand practice make perfect must work at time that be ashore when know compass well then will teach something else now then how be head tom north half west said after little time yes very true see tom must do aboard ship be just way most of seaman must puzzle at must have answer in moment be why must practise in evening when bramble be smoking pipe be seated by minute must change place of iron skewer with how head tom must get 'prentice paper signed before go afloat again said bramble for pick up boy a well a men for king service be stout boy for age be ever pressed inquired have narrow chance once have not captain be smart fellow many more must have be serving king at present moment tell how be said well a soon a bessy have done rattling with cup saucer will have done now father said bessy taking seat on stool close to bramble foot well then before passed for pilot just after breaking out of war took into head to try chance at privateering there be plenty to pick up at time of deal men have be very fortunate so went on board of twelve gun lugger commanded by captain shank fitted out in river with crew of sixty men press be very hot at time men be kept at crimp house until be ready when started got off clear into channel without being overhauled have be out fortnight keeping well on french coast have picked up two good prize when one morning a fog be cleared up with sharp northerly wind found right under lee of english frigate not mile from there be bubble of sea for wind have be against tide previous to changing be then about six seven mile from french coast just between boulogne cape grisnez lying to for fog to clear away a soon a saw frigate knew that must board be in terrible fright here bramble shifted skewer said how head tom replied proceeded frigate hoisted colour of course did same then fired gun a signal for to remain hove to perceived boat lowering down now lad said captain if mind shot two think will save from impressment time ' declared that must stand hundred rather than be taken on board of man of war very well ' say starboard little keep little away so a to let go through water keep fore sheet to windward so that may appear only to have fallen off by plan gradually increased distance from frigate got more on bow while boat be pulling towards rising tossing on sea still nearing fast a came nearer to let lugger come up in wind again for short time that might not appear to be dodging away then when bowman be almost ready to lay in oar away let go through water so that be left astern again must not well perceive on board of frigate although officer in boat be very savage for at one time have bow oar in boat hook out at last frigate perceiving that be apparently slipping away put helm up fired shot across bow now be time boy said captain let draw sheet breeze be strong must wait to pick up boat will give mile at least up went helm made sail right for french coast how be head tom replied bramble resumed frigate ran down to boat then rounded to to hoist up sea be heavy be delayed minute two although to do justice be very smart on board of a soon a boat be up made sail came foaming after a if be in a great rage a captain on board of now then yawed to throw shot at from bow chaser that did mind a yawing checked way be not easy to hit low vessel like lugger in toppling sea well very soon be not four mile from french coast so hauled down english colour hoisted french frigate gained on very fast continued to steer on in pursuit until be within gun shot of battery what frenchman thought did not know at event did not fire steered right on a if be chased frigate followed after until be within mile half of battery when frigate thought proper to haul wind then battery opened upon must see that be hulled more than once a kept wind along shore other battery opened upon got good mauling saw shift fore topsail yard a soon a went about again afterwards heard that have several men hurt be pity did not battery fire upon for kept french colour up hove to within mile of coast be lee shore there be too much surf sea for to send off boat ascertain whether be french privateer not so there lay till dusk then made sail again being so close into french shore picked up good prize very night when cruise be over be satisfied got prize money then a knew own coast well passed for pilot have served a one ever since how head tom south west almost south west almost wo do tom be not quite south west quarter south so must say south west southerly d 'ye understand when bessy knocked at door next morning cried out laughing how be head tom word made jump up like lightning chapter twenty five in bramble point out to that singing be part of profession of pilot in about fortnight from time bramble commenced tuition be quite perfect with compass method certainly be very good for by such reiterated catechising what have to learn be graven on memory day long same system be pursued even if dinner be on table compass be on chair close by a be putting fork to mouth much to bessy amusement out must come question how be head tom bramble soon gained point must answer like lightning whether be by fire indoors on shingle beach system be ever same time that bramble opened lip gained information be never wearying often very amusing one morning be out on beach have be conversing with other pilot examining vessel in offing with glass when pointed out to being low neap tide that goodwin sand be partially dry tom continued of danger not only of channel in wide ocean there be none to be compared with sand life have be lost on vessel have be wrecked property have be sucked into must be dozen king ransom for see tom be quicksand vessel go on shore doe not remain to be broken up in two tide disappears sinking down into sand never give cargo up again there must be mighty deal of wealth buried there be certain say once be flourishing fertile island belonging to earl godwin whose name now bear may be so sea retreat from one place while advance at look at romney marsh where so many thousand of sheep be now fed run up many mile inland yet formerly very marsh be arm of sea vessel rode in deep water sea fight be told took place howsomever when sea took godwin island to made best trap for vessel old neptune now posse may consider a most productive spot in dominion lord help what deal of gold merchandise must there be buried below yellow patch do never save anything when vessel be run on shore there when only tail on occasionally get off again when once fixed there be end of yes save life occasionally at great risk of own saved little bessy from vessel ashore on sand indeed pray tell how be why see tom be just at breaking out of war be in very month of october be out in galley with others looking for vessel have just then left off privateering got warrant a pilot for know did serve 'prenticeship before went privateering a told other night well be blowing night be running in for down intending to beach galley sleep on shore for have be out five day only put pilot on board of one vessel be just to windward of sand out there where be now pointing sea be very rough night be clear moon shone bright when saw brig running down before wind under foresail close reefed topsail why bill a steer will be right between caliper said to man sitting by there be mistake about ' replied let haul fore sheet to windward lay to to hail be coming right down upon ' well did so hailed time without answer at last man looked over gunnel just a be flying past told in dutch to go to devil think will go there if look sharp ' replied bill come lad may a well follow see if can not prevent mischief ' so bore up after hailed several time for sailed very fast there be scuffling on deck think that captain be drunk passed in le than five minute then a knew must be case struck on sand with such force that mast went over side immediately now sea roll awfully over willow water of sand tom have kept with a far a dared then hove to about two cable length to windward of when struck for ebb be still running strong under lee only made sea more cross heavy wave made clean breach over knew that must go to piece in le than hour did not like to leave so many to perish without trial to save so kept away so a to get abreast of then lowered sail got out oar pulled close to be impossible to board must have be stove to piece swamped immediately moon still shone bright saw a plain a must wish made attempt to save for be crowded together forward once sea drove boat so close that touched side then woman pressed before men reached over gunnel extending arm held child while several others attempted to get in return of wave carried back so quick from vessel that a attempted to jump in went to water never appeared again have caught hold of child laid down in stern sheet made second third attempt in vain at last vessel broke up a be at once there be one loud cry be still except roaring breaking wave buried be scene to make very lively tom hoisted sail ran on to beach in silence took child in arm have be snatched out of warm bed poor thing have nothing on calico night gown took up to cottage be then maddox bought afterwards of widow with money made privateering gave in charge to mr maddox did intend to have sent to workhouse something of sort mr maddox took fancy to so did so thought must take care of christened by name of betsy godwin have idea who may be not half one cotton gown cap told nothing vessel be dutch that be know may be child of stadtholder child of ship cook what be matter did notice mark upon person by might be reclaimed not only axed mr maddox whether be boy girl how old be then well how can tell be not in way knowing one in matter said that must be about eighteen month old so have taken that for departure a to age love now a if be own child so will tom like sister when know call father may do same tom if like for will be a good a father to if be a good boy a now seem to be like to be called father somehow sound pleasant to ear come in now think have compassed compass so must learn something else there be way tom said bramble a seated in large chair in smart 'prentice may be useful to master be of quite a much importance a compass be in heaving lead see tom exact sounding being known will often enable pilot to run over tail of bank save tide be when know that can trust man in chain seaman be very particular in giving exact sounding be not care more for song than do for anything else though song be very musical wo get ship off when be on shore now two third of seaman who be sent in chain will not give sounding within fathom moreover give quick enough for pilot in many case if therefore learn to heave lead well be correct in sounding quick in giving will become of great use to understand yes replied well go up into room hanging on nail behind door will see lead line bring down here did so then bramble explained to how fathom be marked on line how sounding be given out see said wherever there be mark with piece of leather bunting whether be white red be called mark if have five fathom of water must cry out by mark five at other depth there be mark so many knot tied a there be fathom a here at nine then must say by deep nine now run line through hand see if can repeat mark deep a pas did so very well now for song for there be sort of tune to bramble then again passed line through hand giving song to fathom half fathom quarter fathom making sing after after have to repeat by next day took out mark knot from whole line giving two foot rule to re measure made put in again have to repeat three four time by plan be fully impressed on memory a for song made sing almost half hour for three four day bessy generally repeating in clear voice from back kitchen upstairs quarter seven by deep nine on fourth day bramble said well tom think bessy may leave off singing now have yet to learn most important part be to heave lead must wait till get on board of vessel for observe tom be very well singing when have plenty of water like for sound musical pleasant to ear in willow water pilot answer must be much shorter quicker a will find out by bye chapter twenty six in go afloat obtain knowledge of english channel may be a well here to remark that system of pilotage be different now from what used to be at period of be writing cinque port pilot now carry vessel from down to river from river to down pilotage extends farther vessel seldom require pilot for channel take unless be bound to port in channel with be unacquainted pilot who ply in channel be termed hoblers at time refer to regular pilot used to go out in galley to chap of channel take charge of vessel way up by new regulation do arrangement for pilotage have be much improved of late year employed be better qualified have remained at deal about three week when outward bound indiaman anchored in down pilot came on shore made signal for be bramble turn galley be launched went on board ship be bound to plymouth from whence be to sail with convoy to certain latitude weather be now fine frosty made sail when tide served a soon a be fairly out in channel bramble went with into main chain showed how to heave lead after several attempt in sometimes must hit spare topsail yard upon stood sometimes must nearly break own head once contrived to throw lead over hammock rail in board succeeded in getting round over head when have once gained that point made fewer mistake in two day arrived at plymouth a bramble kept at till arm ached nearly day must by time heave lead pretty fairly be to say without danger to other people day after arrived at plymouth got into pilot boat went out in search of employment soon found continued chiefly taking vessel up to portsmouth down to plymouth clear of sounding for time during time practice at lead be incessant became very perfect when be not at lead bramble must make stand at binnacle watch compass so that by time arrived at deal again be pretty competent in two branch of art except having practised lead mostly in deep water have not acquired accuracy expedition in giving sounding learnt great deal more of profession bramble explaining to sail rigging name us of rope various manoeuvre practised of must catechise in afterwards to ascertain if be perfect have remembered what told be therefore under excellent tuition port entered bramble must point out landmark to state distance from point to point danger to be avoided must not so well retain perfectly required occasional reminding altogether gave satisfaction be on new year day that boarded large homeward bound indiaman have just struck sounding be thousand ton ship with rich cargo of tea on board full of passenger besides more than one hundred invalid from regiment out there who have be sent home under charge of two officer what difference there appeared to to be between indiaman going out one coming home first so neat clean in deck so crowded so weatherworn by long voyage what with troop in old jacket have once be scarlet lascar with curly black hair dark handsome feature yellow men sickly woman half caste child with hindoo ayah tiger lion turtle cow sheep goat pig on boom main deck vessel be in strange motley of confusion a soon a be put on board captain officer passenger crowded round to inquire news bramble according to pilot custom have brought off one two late plymouth paper one of recollect gave account of cutting out of hermione by captain hamilton people on board be eight month behindhand at least a regarded what have passed have not even heard of sir sydney smith defence of acre against bonaparte anything else have subsequently occurred so that a soon a bramble have taken charge put ship head right course for wind be fair there be end to question answer while bramble be questioned by captain passenger be attacked by midshipman guinea pig a be called having fair wind ran right for down where arrived on morning of second day here purser of ship went on shore with despatch ship anchored to await order by next post to go up river tom said bramble a vessel anchored can not quit ship may so just get on shore in one of boat see how little bessy be poor old mr maddox leg tom take dirty linen on shore bring off clean be glad enough to obey order for be very anxious to see dear little bessy again so dropped into boat be going on shore for fresh beef taking with two three little present for bessy out of many have received when on board for officer men be very kind to have given many thing did not value did

here for mr maddox have kept bed ever since left leg be better have pain in limb groan so all night here be left by to hear groan wind roar here bessy began to cry to console a well a must although did feel that be hard that child must be left so lonely present brought made wipe away tear be very soon a lively joyous a ever heard father say bessy always called bramble father a have said might that have picked up something winter for have have none heavy vessel know pilotage be paid by draught of water well may have made money be sure have spent to matter for have hardly be once week to mr maddox for money since have gone eats hardly anything ca eat meal when be alone down here will father come home after have be up river yes bessy said that must take spell on shore tom think might go on board see for hour yes see why not speak to mr maddox bessy ran upstairs came down with required permission provided neighbour girl must remain in house that went under escort bonnet be soon on obtained passage in one of indiaman boat be shoving off for water be quite smooth ship boat must lie on shingle without difficulty officer took bessy under boat cloak be soon on board bramble be not on deck at time when went down to look for bessy remained on quarterdeck in admiration of saw bramble be not below a supposed have gone into cuddy with captain when came out first knowledge of bessy being on board be being embraced by waist with little arm why bessy child said bramble just a returned on deck be master tom doing continued kissing so have come to see father why must not come on shore to see father said bessy a bramble took up kissed again well tom have brought clean thing must go on shore again with bessy father very true so must bessy be taken much notice of by captain on board wonder fair skin clear transparent red white be in such contrast with bilious looking passenger that appeared a if be not of same race be much admired received many little present when left ship after staying on board hour be much delighted with trip still more so with promise of bramble that must stay ashore for time a soon a came back from river remained with on shore till dusk then having collected clean linen a be expected to sail early next morning returned on board indiaman chapter twenty seven showing importance on board ship of rope end well applied next morning a expected order came down for indiaman to go round to river wind be fair light hove up made sail stemming last of ebb when flood made wind died away so that made little progress much to annoyance of on board who be naturally impatient to land after so tedious voyage towards evening fell calm fog bank rose on horizon to eastward there be still two hour of daylight when a be sweeping horizon with glass discovered three mast of vessel with sail set on a be long way off went way up main rigging to have better view of made out to be large lugger went down to poop where bramble stood smoking cheroot with of officer of ship father say there be large lugger on beam with sail lowered down caught mast with glass just now then be french privateer may depend upon replied bramble mean to try to take by surprise to night officer went down reported to captain glass be fixed upon there be little doubt a to what be lucky discovered boy for might have be surprised that be fact said captain however now will catch tartar be waiting for fog captain said bramble will come rolling down with shift of wind in about hour two expect then must allow hour to get alongside of depend upon have plenty of men intends to try to board in fog everybody be now on qui vive woman be a usual frightened men passenger looked grave lascar rather unsteady have forty english seaman hundred invalid soldier on board who must be depended upon gun be loaded shotted invalid soldier be mustered musket ammunition handed up bayonet fixed unfixed again then be ordered to remain on boom with accoutrement on musket by side officer still kept glass on lugger until at last fog came down must see more officer who commanded invalid after consultation with captain at bramble assisted told off men into two party one of being appointed to assist seaman with bayonet in repelling boarder must attempt be made other to fire upon into deck of vessel when came alongside lascar be stationed at gun in case might be required great dependence be placed upon service by time that arrangement have be made fog have reached indiaman be at same time taken aback with easterly breeze brought down to being near to land put ship head off shore wind continued light water smooth fog thickened minute at last must hardly see a far a foremast of vessel will be puzzled to find think said captain will find never fear replied bramble have calculated time of fog reaching know that must lay head off shore to be sure might give go by if bore up ran back again to down think see bearing up running away from rascally french privateer said captain keep sharp look out there forward ay ay sir replied chief officer hour more passed by calculation privateer must have be on board of must see nothing of although fog have cleared up little soldier be now ordered to load musket be on poop with bramble when happening to turn look aft very opposite direction from privateer be to be expected saw three lug sail looming in mist just on quarter not cable length from jumped down to where captain be standing said to there be sir close on lee quarter captain sprang on poop saw vessel ordered men to come aft in silence tramp of soldier foot be scarcely over when lugger be alongside of mast banging against main mizen chain a rolled with swell under lee frenchman gave cheer told how very numerous be climbed up side into chain like cat in few second be noise confusion smoke be impossible to know what result be to be for about minute when cheer from own men announced that assailant have be beaten back hardly have cheering ceased on side when cheer be heard from lugger attempt to gain deck be repeated time frenchman fought more obstinately than before be nearly five minute before be repelled be not yet dark although fog be thick must make out countenance pretty clear more wild reckless set of fellow never beheld certainly fought very gallantly be driven back again once more be cheer from british seaman soldier mixed up with execration shout of still contending although retreating frenchman just at period of conflict be standing on poop by bramble who have be watching result when said tom come with do jump into main chain with double part of topsail halyard fall when lugger mast strike against chain a roll into pas tail round underneath rigging hand end in to leapt off poop gave bight of halyard crept out of port into chain passed round lugger main mast a told handing in bight to belayed slack to main sheet kevel at time perceived man lying wounded dead in main chain paid attention to until a be about to get on board attracted attention by seizing leg making teeth meet in small part of above ankle must not help cry out be so taken by surprise with pain however kicked off turning to look at found be wounded frenchman who perceiving what be about have paid compliment a soon a be on board heard captain say to bramble well pilot have have enough of yes wo escape captain for tom have got fast by masthead dare not climb up to cut adrift that have to do now be to let soldier fire on deck until run below then men can board take possession of captain perceiving that vessel be made fast gave necessary order soldier lined hammock netting chain shower of musketry be poured into deck that frenchman be soon driven below seaman then slipped down rigging boarded took possession of prisoner having be ordered up passed into forehold wounded men be then looked after have eleven wounded none killed frenchman have eight killed seventeen wounded among others captain who have headed second attempt to board be called pucelle d'orleans of twelve gun hundred twenty five men be two three hour before be again aft to right party sent on board of prize then there be again kind of confusion from congratulation drinking woman coming up on deck etcetera however weather continued light so be of consequence that frenchman bit very hard limped for three four day afterwards well tom said bramble see have got nerve so right have better go lie down now for must be tired will call in morning very glad be to limp to bed night dreamt of nothing volley of musketry boarding reboarding being wounded in leg then must awake with smart of frenchman teeth next morning when came on deck captain thanked for service said that lugger must have escaped have not be for replied that be bramble who prevented escape a must not have thought of making fast if have not be told be true enough replied captain how many of age having be told to do must have done tom will not forget went on poop to bramble who a usual have short pipe in hand certainly be pleased when saw what beautiful craft have helped to capture sat like swan on water sailed round round with greatest ease in afternoon anchored at nore sent away prisoner to sheerness must not forget to say how very kind generous passenger be to made great many present of value a afterwards found out be glad to receive might give to virginia who have be friendly to next morning arrived off greenwich bramble told to go on shore remain with father mother until came down must do in few day pay visit to old friend anderson landed with contraband article

often when be expected to return be very intimate with man replied in negative then narrated whole history of spy glass erasure of name by mr st felix recognition of by spicer did right to leave in error relative to where received glass from said peter anderson there be mystery there time may unravel say word of to one tom be glad that have told a in case be away anything must occur will know how to act must acknowledge that now walked proudly through street of greenwich be no longer poor jack be earning livelihood in profession have reason to be still prouder when two day afterwards mr

increase in volume power now rushing rapidly now moving along in deep tranquil water until swell into bold stream coursing way over willow dashing through impeding rock descending in rapid swift a thought pouring boiling water over cataract thus doe vary velocity appearance course until swell into broad expanse gradually checking career a approach at last mingles with ocean of eternity have be led into somewhat trite metaphor to account to reader for content of chapter a in river after many mile of chequered boisterous career will find that water will for time flow in smooth tranquil course a almost to render unconscious of never ceasing stream so in life of man after eventful adventurous career will be found that for time be permitted to glide gently quietly along a if respite be given to feeling preparatory to fresh scene of excitement such be case with for time have now be under bramble tuition for more than year half be consequently between fifteen sixteen year old year from to end of be of description in stream of life unmarked by peculiar stirring event worthy of occupying attention of reader be therefore intention in chapter to play part of chorus in old play sum up event

that have cut anny whistle mr st felix continued to vend tobacco never failed seeing on visit to greenwich appeared to look just a young a did when first knew one said that there be apparent alteration be a kind a cheerful a ever may a well here remark that during period great intimacy have grown up between sister virginia very much to annoyance of mother who still retained feeling of ill will against mr st felix why know except be so good looking person favourite with everybody father who when chose must not be contradicted insisted upon virginia being on good term with mr st felix used to take there virginia who have never forgotten widow kindness to be extremely partial to be much more in company than mother have idea of for virginia must not vex mother unnecessarily by telling have be with widow unless be directly asked be about four month after father have given money to mother returned to greenwich letter from virginia have acquainted with street number of house mother have taken therefore walked from beach right to must say that when came to new abode be very much surprised at neat even handsome appearance ground floor be fitted up a shop with large pane of glass inside upon stand be arranged variety of bonnet cap set off with looking glass silk curtain in arrangement of little taste be displayed behind show good be curtain hanging on brass rod drawn so a to conceal workpeople who be within there be private door a well a shop door hardly knew be to go in at however a shop door required knocking went into found in company of eight young damsel very busy at needle sitting on side of long table covered with half made dress inquired of whether mother be at home be answered by one who be apparently eldest that be down below getting breakfast ready suppose continued be mr tom saunders pilot suppose be replied pray who be be miss amelia gozlin apprentice to mr saunders milliner at service sir in consequence of being so very quiet sedate have charge of young lady see with here others burst into laugh be in very good hand miss amelia replied under care with example have doubt will turn out very useful member of society thank sir allow to say can not permit young men especially such enchanting young men a mr tom saunders to remain here a if do amiable mother must give what be genteelly termed wigging so if will be pleased sir just to remove from presence continued with mock curtsey not make appearance here again until be certain mother be gone out will oblige very much obeyed wish of miss amelia gozlin who certainly be very handsome girl with fine black eye apparently about fifteen year old walked into passage found way down into kitchen where mother virginia be employed a have told above mother received kindly said little for appeared to be fully occupied virginia have time to dedicate to until breakfast be ready when called apprentice sat down together miss amelia companion looking so demure that if have not seen before must have thought that must not speak after breakfast be over virginia showed house first floor be to let furnished second be occupied by mother virginia attic be appropriated to apprentice everything appeared clean neat well arranged must not imagine how mother have contrived to do so much with so little money virginia told that thought mr wilson have assisted when returned might have be in six month found great improvement appearance of mother succeeding well in speculation have now maid servant apprentice be increased to twelve there be appearance of brisk full employment in found that virginia who be then fourteen year old have left school have told mother that during last half year have only repeated over again what have half year before that thought must employ time better at home assisting mother be of same opinion virginia now superintended cutting out department be very useful said that increase of business have be very great that mother must hardly execute order received there be now two servant in house additional workwomen mother also have very much altered in appearance before be usually clean neat now be well if not elegantly dressed appeared much younger better looking must do justice to say that prosperity have not spoiled improved be more kind more cheerful time went to see may add that with exception of little necessary castigation to miss amelia companion never scolded be kind to servant last year have be even more successful be now considered first milliner in town believed that deserved reputation for have great deal of taste in dress when have gone upstairs to decorate previous to hour of arrival of customer came down in handsome silk dress elegant morning cap must often look at with surprise say to who must think that be mother who used to shove broom at in little parlour at fisher alley reader may inquire how father mother got on after such alteration in circumstance can only reply that got on better than did before for mother who did not wish father company in house pointed out to that with so many young people living with must be very inconvenient if came there in evening to smoke pipe that must be better if must smoke drink beer anywhere else father perceived propriety of assented with good grace mother be very liberal to be now enabled when chose to ask companion two to join so that suited party father therefore never came to house except after hospital supper when remained few minute to see virginia then departed on sunday spent whole day there be kindly welcomed always left in evening to smoke pipe elsewhere a for when did come be always kindly received slept in spare bed on same floor with mother virginia before time be out be too well supplied by bramble ever to want anything afterwards made plenty of money seldom came home without bringing present to mother virginia having thus given general outline of affair will in next chapter enter more minutely into particular without detail of event will not be complete chapter thirty three in sine qua non of novel be for first time introduced in last chapter have said in few word bessy goodwin have be sent to school have since returned home have be home nearly year before period to brought up history now no longer be employed in menial service girl who have be hired during absence being still retained bessy now superintended household did nothing more there be greater degree of comfort expenditure than have formerly be case whether be on bessy account from bessy imbibed idea can not pretend to say certainly there be great change in style of living bramble appeared to sanction mr maddox remained a mere pensioner sitting by fire perhaps finishing pair of stocking about five six week talking a usual at to everybody with everything in point also there be change in bramble house be much oftener filled with company be presume to be ascribed to bessy personal charm certainly be very great be of peculiar much admired style of beauty description strike people at first sight not others not perceiving at first eventually admiring even more than others be taller than middle height person finely developed yet not so much so a to take away from grace complexion be pale clear eye hair very dark there be coldness about beauty when in repose like statuary marble if least excited animated colour must mantle in cheek eye must beam till appeared a if like bright planet must almost cast shadow dimple before concealed must show when indulged in silvery laugh although form be commanding still be very feminine there be great attraction in face even when in repose be cold not chilling have seen little of for three year during have sprung up to womanhood for be now seventeen appeared to be at least eighteen year old before before when be living together kissed a brother sister since have again become inmate of same house have be friend nothing more bessy certainly showed a great preference to a relative situation must admit still appeared a if extreme intimacy of childhood have be broken off that be necessary that renewed intimacy under aspect must take place to restore to former relation here be for to make first overture not for a maidenly reserve must not permit bramble seemed to be most anxious that such must be case indeed considered a matter of course perhaps bessy thought so too in own bosom continual raillery of bramble did more harm than good a appeared to warrant thinking that ought to be so why be not will now explain to reader have already made mention of mr wilson lawyer whose acquaintance procured through sir hercules lady intimacy have very much increased miss janet wilson have come home from finishing seminary near town between young lady sister virginia certain degree of intimacy have be formed of course have seen great deal of her at time when be at greenwich be very pretty very diminutive girl beautifully proportioned although so very small indeed be considered quite model in figure at least mother used to say so never heard one disagree with janet have moreover large eye pencilled eyebrow dimpled chin now a bessy be away at time when first made acquaintance if perfection be not enough for to fall in love with must have be difficult to please at age of eighteen when one be not so very difficult consequence be be most devoted slave mr wilson laughed at seemed to think that must end in nothing that if did end in something have objection thus be fixed with virginia for confidante be to prevent course of true love running smooth janet received sigh protestation oath present many be latter although perhaps not equal to former three be therefore not surprising that bessy who have be out of way have be forestalled by diamond edition of nature handiwork such be state of heart at commencement of year have mentioned that mother have taken house in principal street must now add that in year found necessary to remove into one much larger have therefore shifted more to upper part of town instead of being in row house be detached with small garden in front good piece of ground at back looked down towards river situation not being so central did harm to mother a be so well known on contrary made even more fashionable now kept shop show room have not only accommodation for more workpeople very handsome apartment to let in point be advantageous be on account of father at end of garden there be octangular summer house looking upon river be good sized room boarded floor moreover have fireplace in when shut up be very warm comfortable mother made house over to father a own to smoke drink beer in father preferred place in must sit alone with friend to public house especially a garden have gate at end of by must admit whenever pleased here father ben whaler anderson others must sit having commanding view of thames vessel passing repassing in summer time with window open enjoying fresh air fresh smoke from pipe in winter time surrounding fire telling yarn be admirable arrangement virginia always knew where to find have said little of sister virginia may be considered partial to perhaps be to be if not handsomest certainly one of most captivating person ever saw to prove thought so can only say deeply a be smitten with miss janet wilson often thought that wished be facsimile of sister virginia be now seventeen year old slender very graceful reminded more of antelope in figure than anything can compare to head be so beautifully placed on shoulder that be first thing attracted notice when saw eye be of deep hazel fringed by long black eyelash arching delicate eyebrow nearly met nose be perfectly straight rather small face ended in sharp oval added to brilliancy animation of countenance mouth be small beautifully formed little teeth like seed pearl one declared that be handsomest creature ever have seen what one say must be true be so be not always lively be only so at time appeared to be of serious reflective turn of mind read great deal at time be mirth personified to mother be always dutiful attentive be very useful to must not at first imagine what made mother so anxious to have lodger in house a must have proved great nuisance to circumstance be above infliction be not long before discovered cause of be other to make up good match for sister whose beauty considered must effect purpose many be application for lodging made by highly respectable gentleman when discovered that be married that in other point did not suit invariably refused for month apartment continued vacant if anybody at aristocratical who be single wished to inspect mother be smile eagerness may be supposed that be not likely to meet with such people a solicited at such town a greenwich such be not case before steamboat made greenwich so come at able there be many family of distinction who resided there in environs especially in autumn of year when river offered much amusement be just at period that whitebait party became so much in vogue greenwich be considered pleasant retreat for few month by many of fashionable world although virginia never mentioned surmise directly perceived by occasional remark that have latterly become aware of what be mother view indeed how must do otherwise when mother must refuse lodging one day to gentleman because be married let next time merely because be single man that be disgusted with mother conduct be convinced at same time certainly kept thought to herself merely telling how very uncomfortable be to have lodger to be obliged to go into room with message from mother there be honourable mr really forget name indeed must not have mentioned except that be introduction of personage who be several month in mother house harmless old bachelor how old be can not say a wore very youthful wig also false whisker must think about sixty be great admirer of fine art still greater admirer of own performance in painting took lesson twice day from two different master who came from london be at from morning to night came down to greenwich a said to study tint get up colouring can not say thought performance very good perhaps be not judge mother who must believe have sacrificed sister to ourang outang provided be honourable took opportunity of sending virginia in to that might study delicate tint on cheek must not do even if virginia have be party to looked at palette instead of pretty mouth camel hair pencil attracted attention more than pencilled eyebrow be wrapt up in art overlooked prettiest piece of nature in world virginia seeing to be case have longer objection to go into room gentleman have nephew very different sort of personage young heir to marquisate who used to pay attention to bachelor uncle by paying visit at first because be ordered so to do after once twice because have seen virginia be struck with appearance be good looking young man about nineteen not very bright indeed ought to say very silly although at same time not at bashful made acquaintance with mother who be delighted with condescension declared that be one of most pleasant young men have ever met with must have be very intimate with virginia have not repulsed a soon a leaf dropped off tree old bachelor declared that there be more tint worth remaining for took departure about month afterwards nephew came down accompanied by young man who be tutor hired apartment much to joy of mother who now have hope much to annoyance of sister who have fear of being persecuted now having in chapter brought up history to commencement of

have to do be to make men fight nail colour to mast be very true when there be fair chance of success be useless sacrificing men against so very superior force replied captain ai superior in gun be equal if know anything about vessel at event suppose will have trial for wo beat to quarter captain oh to be sure mr stubbs beat to quarter think must not be bad thing to fire off broadside now let see that be well armed men be summoned up to quarter very unwillingly did obey said that did not come on board to fight others that have agreed to work passage home not to stand to be shot at be actually going down below again when bramble mate spoke to persuaded to remain on deck still there be willingness shown although bramble told how many privateer have be beaten off mentioned particularly leith smack having other day fought with one hour half knocked to piece still appeared uneasy wavering in meantime privateer be within mile of have hoisted french colour will keep away give first broadside cried captain 'd better hoist colour first observed bramble quietly hoist colour mr stubbs port helm look out men point gun to object fire off went gun not only on starboard side in direction of privateer on larboard side a well circumstance probably gave people on board of privateer idea of state of confusion be in now rounded to gave broadside of three gun be well directed did damage in upper work rigging still more in frightening people who be now running down below notwithstanding exertion of mate bramble one two of seaman fate be soon decided by captain who cried out be useless contending against superior force with observation ran aft hauled down colour a soon a men perceived left gun at broadside from privateer scampered down below at same time captain went down

nation be little better than pirate know how to behave in victory just keep where be look a if have nothing to do with ship except steering of here come a spoke lugger touched weather side at same time lowering down foresail mainsail with little noise confusion in second two there be thirty of men on deck flourishing cutlass looking round with pistol ready cocked in left hand for somebody to let fly at at last came aft pilot cried bramble taking off hat did same with reiterated sacres diables of description now rushed down into cabin while others went down fore hatchway while more of men from lugger poured upon deck none of molested bramble a continued standing at wheel in about ten minute order be to certain degree restored by captain of privateer who have come on board perceived express surprise to officer who be with at armament of ship appeared very much pleased be not necessary to understand french for that then came up to bramble spoke to in french bramble only pointed to

pier ran out from town there be other vessel in harbour except two small coasting chasse marees about dozen fishing boat harbour be formed by mouth of small river ran down through very narrow alluvial flat backed by precipitous rock on right side of river on entering on level ground above mentioned extended back perhaps two hundred yard until be met by rocky cliff be situated village century back must have be town of lanion consisted of perhaps one hundred to one hundred twenty house few of of size major portion with wall built of mud whitewashed over only remains of former town be stone built market place portion of hotel de ville in mayor resided old church although perfect in wall be sadly dilapidated in roof have long be deserted small chapel have be built in lieu of in only cure of

privateer so important that must not attend to even mayor sergeant privateer men dressed in fashion armed to teeth explaining pushing away running here there obeying order then wounded men for have several men killed others hurt in conflict with cutter handed up one by one bandaged here there exciting compassion even scream of woman prisoner who have be ordered to come on deck half dressed chapfallen sail of vessel only dewed up still fluttering ensign pennant hoisted upon mast waving over head of crowd assembled at pier may have idea of confused bustling scene at last a there appeared chance of anything being arranged while people crowded round captain of privateer ordered men to draw weapon drive back crowd be soon effected notwithstanding many oath more screaming on part of fairer sex when crowd have be thus driven men be stationed so a to keep back at first gave offence to party to crowd because did like to be driven away to mayor who remained with sergeant invalid in area have be cleared by privateer people because thought that have interfered with civil authority to sergeant of invalid because thought that marine force have interfered with military authority captain of privateer having taken off hat bowed first to mayor then to sergeant saying how much be obliged to for assistance party be satisfied now consultation be held between how to proceed while privateer men who kept back crowd amused by giving detail of two desperate action have be fought two account agreeing certainly be of consequence first question to be canvassed be what be to be done with prisoner be nearest town in must be under safe keeping be twenty mile distant must be necessary to send over express so that sufficient force might be dispatched to lanion to escort prisoner there mr mayor undertook to do immediately boy be summoned to take over communication mayor went up to write letter to authority while wounded men be carried away by direction of cure who have just

of consultation be how to dispose of prisoner until force must arrive from morlaix here sergeant became principal person being military commandant forty seven prisoner be heavy charge for twelve invalid a for privateer men there be dependence upon for a captain said have have enough to do to take be business of authority to look after now while privateer men made merry chapter thirty six with powerful agent fire water contrive to escape from french prison after more than hour of confusion loud talking be at last proposed agreed to nem con that prisoner must be confined in old church twelve invalid to be divided into two party who be to be sentinel over relieving other four hour mayor immediately went forward with village blacksmith to examine state of church door ascertain how might be

prisoner be taken down by mayor attended by notary then be passed into church bramble of course be marched up with others captain of privateer talking with whole way through young man who interpreted informing that express have be sent over to morlaix to town must be escorted next day then have better accommodation a stood at huge door of church be opened for reception perceived that altar decoration have be removed that with exception of large wooden screen of carved oak near altar church be completely bare bramble spoke to interpreter said that hoped captain must request mayor to allow prisoner to have straw to lie down upon a pavement must be very cold although mayor at first demurred at demand yet captain of privateer probably out of good will to bramble insisted straw be ordered to be sent in at last mayor became impatient must delay no longer door be closed have surveyed church a be escorted up to be very large capable must think of holding more than two thousand people wall of church be very massive window have very few pane of glass remaining in be so very high a to prevent climbing out of even if there have not be six sentinel guarding outside at one corner to right of end of church where altar piece have be be narrow stone tower apparently addition made to lady chapel long after church have be originally built when be shut up be enabled to survey interior at leisure whole be completely bare to pavement until came to chancel part near to altar have be where wooden screen seat still remained in sad dilapidated state must have once be very handsome for carving where be perfect be very beautiful small thick wooden door loaded with ironwork communicated with narrow tower have flight of stone step running up to top narrow loophole to give light a ascended while majority of prisoner be sitting down here there on pavement few of entering into conversation bramble have with taken full survey of locality tell what tom if once get to morlaix chance be over said must either get out of church very night must make up mind to remain in prison heaven know how long have chance will tell more about in little while door of church now opened people brought in straw for bed threw in heap in centre of church door be again closed see daylight now said bramble tom find mate boatswain bring here to quickly did so bramble asked whether be inclined to make attempt to get clear replied that must join in anything did not care what be against odds well then said bramble idea be see there be twelve old soldier to guard for may be certain that before long privateer men will be a drunk a owl be natural not that think of coming to fight with make observation because if get out will have little to fear afterwards now see asked for straw because idea came in head that might be useful see what propose be a there be plenty of wood in part of church that must wait till about three hour after dark be until ten eleven o'clock then set fire to church must come let out know at least take for granted that will before roof come down if must force door ourselves have looked at until do there be fear of suffocating for there be pane to window so after will only be bonfire without danger to anybody well what will gain by said mate will be walked out with other prisoner how will then escape there be will not be walked out with other prisoner in confusion hurry of taking away to one place will not be likely to miss will go up narrow tower where may remain till church fall in with perfect safety then when be quiet again people have left spot will make for pier get one of fishing boat be off how do like idea agreed that plan be very feasible must attempt well then must remain quiet for present have to do be to fetch a much straw way a can by degree expect will bring something to eat before long removed large portion of straw to chancel in hour afterwards door be opened ration of bread be brought in what still more assisted plan be that captain of privateer at same time very good naturedly brought demijohn of brandy gave to bramble bramble thanked through interpreter told that must get well drunk night yes drive away care

seat on straw a if also intended to repose at last became dusk then dark prisoner settled to sleep left joined bramble having arranged straw so a to secure ignition leaving mate boatswain down below bramble now that there be chance of being seen by sentinel ascended tower commanded view of town harbour looked down upon main street be mirth revelry fiddling dancing singing be to be heard from more than one house woman in street laughing now then running screaming when pursued by men be right observed bramble in hour two will see how quiet everything will be will not let go to bed before set fire for there may be difficulty in waking see that there be light down at pier where vessel lie stayed up there till about eleven o'clock bramble watching light sound when considered that have sufficiently decreased said now will try tom may success attend descended found mate boatswain anxiously waiting for bramble struck light with flint carried to screen where have piled straw under seat against panel now then messmate said bramble a long a others sleep better if waken in confusion bring here straw can collect for must not fail for want of fuel of there be chance for wood of screen bench be so dry that be alight immediately for ten minute other prisoner guard outside did not appear to be aware of what be going on at last church be so filled with smoke that be roused up still principal smoke be in portion of church where be at other end be not much inconvenienced a found vent by window what invalid be about outside know did not perceive probably have left guard to go carouse at event flame have climbed up from screen have caught portion of roof before frenchman knew that church be on fire smoke be now exchanged for bright clear flame have already found way through slating prisoner be halloaing screaming a loud a must went to part of church where others be joined outcry voice of people outside be now to be heard for men woman have be summoned by cry of church being on fire still there be danger until roof fell in must not be case for perhaps hour although be now burning furiously spark cinder be borne away to leeward by breeze scream of prisoner now became dreadful frightened out of wit fully expected to be burnt alive still door be not opened although heard loud consultation of many voice without well said bramble hope really mean to let burn here at event if do can save poor devil for there be room enough on stair of tower for twice a many at event must hold on till last moment a said heard outside put key in door immediately bramble boatswain mate retreated from crowd gained other portion of church be most in flame a door opened hastened to tower door closing after gained staircase near top where remained quiet there be want of smoke there still must breathe pretty freely a fire from roof be borne down by wind from towards people who be at front of church how disposed of other prisoner know a dared not show ourselves in about hour whole of roof fell down upon pavement nothing bare wall of church be left standing after roof fell in light from flame be so small that ventured to top of tower to look out there be still many people standing about major part of be gone a fire sank down so did people go away at last there be one to be seen remained more than hour watching light after light disappeared be quiet a death now be time said bramble still must be cautious let follow one at about ten yard apart if meet with one pretend to be reeling a if drunk may think be be men not yet gone to bed followed down stair gained church trod over still burning ember a soon a be clear of wall turned to right in way down to harbour keeping in gloom a much a possible arrived safely at pier for there be not soul stirring fear be that must find one keeping watch on board of vessel must pas after have possession of one of fishing boat a laid inside of fortune favoured way boat selected have sail bent be not fastened with chain be therefore in stream in moment tide be also running out strong passed vessel without having occasion to use oar battery at entrance of harbour be also without usual sentry for men have be called up to guard prisoner in hour be clear of harbour steering with fine breeze for english coast when daylight broke french land be just perceptible well said bramble praised be heaven for thing expected to have lost precious liberty for year have only lost two shirt one pair of trouser three pair of worsted stocking have nothing to eat drink that cared little for a wind be fair about ten o'clock night landed at cawsand bay near plymouth where sat down to hearty supper when went to bed did not forget to thank providence for unexpected escape chapter thirty seven escape more fortunate than one recorded in preceding chapter from time have passed examination worked a pilot on own account until period of escape have narrated in preceding chapter have continued to live in cottage with bramble without contributing share to expense have at first proposed bramble must not listen to such arrangement considered said a son who knowed added that cottage must be mine after be gone fact be that bramble ardently wished that bessy must be united continually hinted at joked with bessy about believe that in consequence bessy feeling towards have taken same bent be prepared for issue regard naturally felt for from long intimacy now that indulgence of be so openly sanctioned by whom considered a father be not checked on part indeed there be doubt that have ripened into love showed in little way that maiden modesty did not interfere with old bramble must at time throw out such strong hint of eventual union a to make feel very uncomfortable of have idea of heart having be pre engaged strangeness of manner be ascribed by bramble to feeling towards bessy bessy however be not so easily deceived conduct towards appeared to say best of very inconsistent so often have have opportunity especially when be at home bramble be away of speaking on subject so often have opportunity be neglected that filled mind with doubt anxiety after having accepted address at first janet have once twice written to latterly however have not written message be through virginia letter perhaps must add little postscript have letter arrived for in other handwriting than of virginia bessy after suspicion be roused might have easily guessed truth be absence of clue to guide a to state of feeling so much puzzled be fully convinced that heart be not hers have reason to suppose that be in possession of thus did passion for janet wilson in way prove to source of anxiety knew that be duty to undeceive bramble bessy yet task be too painful must not make up mind to make unhappy felt that have right to remain under bramble roof live at expense at same time must not find opportunity of telling what feeling wish be very mention of must at once explain to that desire of old age must never be accomplished often accused of ingratitude felt a if be duty to make sacrifice to one who have be so kind protector be bound by vow to janet wilson how be possible must retract virginia letter be not satisfactory at first told how much have be annoyed by attention of young nobleman how very indelicate mother have be in conduct eventually informed that have be insulted by that upon complaining to mother latter have much to surprise indignation not only laughed at extreme forwardness pointed out to virginia line of conduct by might be entrapped into marriage that refusal to accede to such unworthy device have created serious breach between mother stated young man to be extremely silly weak that mother have gained great influence over be not that presence of tutor who seldom quitted house have proved check that there be little doubt a far a young man be concerned disproportionate match must be readily acceded to that only person have ventured to consult be dear friend mr st felix who have promised if persecution did not cease that must make mr sommerville tutor aware of what be going on virginia described latter a amiable modest young man who did in power to instruct pupil who be treated with anything deference in return relative to janet said little except that generally called there day to make inquiry after once twice did say that be pity be not able to come oftener to greenwich a janet be not very steady indeed considering how young be without mother so little controlled by father be not to be wondered at such be state of affair when made up mind must speak to bramble about paying share of expense thought must open eye to real state of feeling towards bessy did so pointed out to be now earning money fast that considered fair must support not put to further expense that perhaps must be better must take house for a must give great deal of trouble to bessy mr maddox well tom said bramble have be at about before believe be proper feeling after certainly doe seem to to be matter of little consequence a thing stand however ca consent to leaving have be with ever since be lad must feel like fish out of water if be to be without bessy so pay just what please will take since wish there be end of matter be not end to be driving bramble eye must not be opened must not help have never directly spoken to about union with bessy therefore be impossible for to say more bramble however did not fail to communicate what have said to one evening when be standing on shingle beach said to so emerson have be convicted for smuggling sentenced beyond sea be sorry for replied house be to be let now tom must not suit for father told that wished to leave why must live upon when be able to support certainly not if be not must not bear to see father miserable think must be better if did take emerson house must vex poor good man not bessy be that mean perhaps be tell must not be better made reply well replied bessy think of a please will speak now tom be not considering tom be thinking of be only induced so to do on account of father have be brought up together a child tom a child be great friend believe sincerely attached to other believe to be very true that who be brought up together a brother sister change affection for other more serious in after life be therefore not fault if can not feel a must know tom father wish must be not right be believe bessy replied father therefore be deceiving with hope of what never can take place know even better than do tom be object of daily thought only wish before sink into grave can not bear to undeceive more can if have truly judged feeling have judged right bessy very circumstance of knowing wish hint throw out joking on subject have be source of annoyance to of not only source of annoyance tom have estranged no longer feel affection must feel for other kindness a between brother sister might exist on contrary not being exactly aware of other feeling avoid other fearful that least kindness might be misconstrued really treat a otherwise must in fact have destroyed mutual confidence be not so be acknowledge too true bessy thank for having entered into explanation a said before continued bessy must not have done except for sake of father now have done so here bessy voice became tremulous let consult at once how will act so a to secure happiness that in future may return to former confidence regard must exist between a brother sister point out how be to be done bessy will cheerfully enter into wish must laugh when laugh tom even if not inclined must gain time be very easy may refuse a long a life may put off then tom circumstance may help who know what even day may bring forth very true replied there be only one thing what be suppose be to marry then replied bessy in voice half choked a turned away father must be very unhappy looked round to reply have gone into cottage conversation gave great satisfaction felt convinced that if have at one time formed idea that bessy be attached to have be mistaken be a indifferent to a be to be just a anxious a be not to vex bramble equally glad confidence be restored between ala must have be very blind not to have perceived be true state of feeling did not after reflection determined must make confidant of passion for janet wilson then walked to post office to see if there be letter from virginia there be letter for double one a soon a have paid money opened be very closely written evidently virginia have much to communicate to forgot for moment bessy bramble thought only of janet put letter to lip a walked away that might go home read hurried past bessy who be in parlour went up stair into bed room where took letter out of pocket commenced dear tom th april will begin letter to now fill up a sort of diary a be best plan think to narrate circumstance a actually take place be unpleasant to say anything against mother more so a believe that think have be doing right have interest sincerely at heart appears to consider alliance with people of rank can not be purchased too dear attempt be justifiable to secure for advantage little doe know if forgets never will be daughter of greenwich pensioner never must ally with whose relation must look upon a disgrace to family tom even if be so heedless a to allow affection to be enthralled must at sacrifice refuse to enter into family much beyond condition have thought of often confess be sometimes unhappy have be brought up educated above situation in life think ever must marry person who be not more refined educated than who be really truly equal a at same time never will enter into family who might look down upon parentage presume little virginia must remain unmarried if so be content have wish to alter present condition be happy respected with exception of trifling annoyance must expect must submit to have reason to be dissatisfied on contrary have to be grateful for many blessing trust be so poor mother be cause of present vexation tell that beauty a be partially pleased to call be sufficient for aspiring to hand of duke that will be own fault if make high connection night have be overwhelming with alternate reproach entreaty to permit attention of gay gentleman who be now lodging at house stating that be on account only that took apartment that if play card well will be caught in own trap presume be a much a to say that came here with different intention finding that can not succeed will secure intended prize victim by marriage rather than not obtain at very flattering truly be man to whom mother must induce to confide future happiness man who independent of want of probity be fool into bargain persecution on part on of mother now becomes so annoying have requested mr st felix to speak to mr tutor who if doe duty have reason to believe that will do so will take measure to remove pupil from house th mr st felix mr sommerville have have meeting generally walk out afternoon in park mr st felix have already be

guess content of tom do know very often find looking about asking if have happened be true dream said bramble to a sat inside of coach to dover for there be other inside passenger ca help thinking that great good fortune be a astounding a great calamity who must have thought when must in spite of bessy remonstrance go round in ship with that in first place must have be taken possession of by privateer in very narrow be bold cruiser that frenchman after be captured said to myself bessy must have have forewarning of what be to happen never must have be a thought so perverse since have turned out so fortunately ca help saying how fortunate be that did not allow to persuade for have not gone nothing must have be done well think may promise bessy time when meet that will not trust ourselves to salt water again in hurry what do think tom think best thing can do be to marry live on shore replied yes tom be give hand know how happy make will live together where will live for poor little cottage thought quite big enough for month ago will not do now have plenty of time to talk that over father love cottage for many reason although a say be not large enough now for mean future

that have be most anxious about will say when hears have be wounded ay must have done to have told that must have set off for chatham a sure a be sitting here here pause ensued for time be busied with own thought silence be at last broken by father said must like to ask father peter anderson to come down to can easily get leave be to be present at wedding tom exactly if bessy will consent well have doubt of tom will now require little courting know why why became woman like suppose tom be because be in love before be d 'ye understand now that thing be smooth follow why be natural suppose that must shy off little in turn must mind that tom be sort of soothing to mortification of having at one time found a be rejected well sha mind that will only serve right for being such fool a not to have perceived value before how do understand woman so well father because tom have be looking on not performing life except in one instance in long life have only be bystander in way of courtship matrimony here be at last now for chaise to deal thank god can afford to shorten time for bessy sake poor thing arrived at cottage sound of wheel have called out not only bessy mr maddox neighbour for have heard of good fortune bessy a soon a have satisfied that be bramble went into cottage again once more entered humble roof bessy flew into father arm hung weeping on shoulder have kind word to say for tom said bramble kissing a released doe deserve to leave a did laughing at distress have right to treat so indeed bessy do injustice said at time thought there be risk certainly did think there be

have be back here quite so soon beat down frenchman one after in good style when attempted to recover vessel that did can tell wounded a be wounded cried bessy starting eye running over to find out

pipe on beach left alone with bessy now for first time plainly told state of affection asked to consent to be wife did not plead in vain a reader may suppose from what have already be made acquainted with after bessy have retired be sitting with bramble who have glass of grog pipe a usual made acquainted with success right tom said be thankful god bless have not reason also to be thankful when have retired to room that night thought over various passage in life what might have be if providence have not watched over when neglected in youth in situation exposed to temptation have not old anderson be sent a guardian to keep in right path to instruct to give education without future success might have turned out disadvantage instead of source of gratitude in bramble again have met with father to supply place of one who be not in situation to do duty to forward in life in old nanny have met with kind friend one who at same time that must lead right be warning to from suffering to mr st felix be equally indebted have not be permitted to pay debt of gratitude to of even mother harshness appeared at first to short sightedness to have be so indefensible be of great advantage to a have stimulated to exertion industry pointed out to value of independence be not also most fortunate in having escaped front entanglement of janet who have married must in probability have proved useless if not faithless helpmate still more so in finding that there be a be especially reserved for affection of such noble right minded creature a bessy life commenced in rag poverty have by industry exertion kindness of others step by step progressed to competence prospect of mundane happiness have not therefore reason to be grateful to feel that there have be little cherub who have watched over life of poor jack on bended knee acknowledged fervently gratefully prayed must please heaven must in after life meet reverse might bear without repining say with humility thy will not mine o lord be done how bright be next morning how cheerful did dancing wave appear to bessy eye be radiant a day smile followed in rapid succession bramble looked so many year younger be almost too

for uncommon style for now that countenance be lighted up with joy be indeed lovely well tom observed father there be only one thing surprise what be why how with fine craft in view must ever have sailed in wake of little privateer a must not mention never mind answer that question when be going to be spliced very soon hope really exactly know can say be sooner better so say will bring up subject on plea of leave being only for ten day yes father wish must a be really good reason to allege for taking place immediately tom dear boy said old anderson from what can perceive have great reason to be thankful in having obtained young woman for future partner in life admire exceedingly trust in heaven that will be happy ought to be replied grateful also particularly to to whom under providence be so much indebted if seed be sown upon good ground will always yield good harvest tom be proof of so thank heaven not wish to tell what father have mentioned to fact be tom be in what may be called false position at greenwich be pensioner have now sufficient not to require charity think that ought not to avail of now that have made independent if leaf hospital remains at greenwich mother must not agree well together be very good friend at certain distance think with high notion that must ever live together in same house say that must like to live either with near think now that be become so very steady character doe require consideration whether ought not to permit will be very good companion for bramble will get on well together mean to say that might not be more agreeable if be to remain at greenwich be father tom must make sacrifice for parent a far a be concerned anderson most gladly consent bramble be to live with be arranged if objection be raised by others may be
