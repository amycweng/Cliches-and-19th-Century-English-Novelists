know whom have honour of addressing young lady be flattered with mark of confidence feel assure feel correctly that be not exactly in lawless hand cecilia looked with more surprise than fear at pickersgill mr hautaine dress became be handsome fine looking man have nothing of ruffian in appearance unless like byron corsair be half savage half soft must not help thinking that have met many with le pretension a far a appearance went to claim of gentleman at almack other fashionable circle have ventured on deck sir said cecilia with little tremulousness in voice to request a favour that will inform what intention may be with regard to vessel with regard to lady feel much obliged to for so doing assure will a far a have made up own mind answer candidly tremble allow to conduct to seat in few word then to remove present alarm intend that vessel will be returned to owner with article in a religiously respected a if be church property with respect to other lady on board pledge honour that have nothing to fear that will be treated with respect privacy never invaded that in few day will be restored to friend young lady pledge hope of future salvation to truth of at same time must make few condition however will not be very severe sir replied cecilia much relieved for pickersgill have stood by in most respectful manner be presume captain of smuggler pray answer one question more what became of boat with lord b be father left in boat without hair of head touched young lady took away oar then will perish cried cecilia putting handkerchief to eye young lady be on shore probably by time although took away mean of assisting to capture left mean of gaining land be not one who must have done after conduct to begged not to go said cecilia told that be not fair that have quarrel with smuggler thank even for replied pickersgill now miss have not pleasure of recollecting lordship family name ossulton sir cried cecilia looking at pickersgill with surprise then with permission miss ossulton will now make confidant excuse using so free term be because wish to relieve fear at same time can not permit to divulge intention to whole party on board feel may trust for have courage where there be courage there generally be truth must first tell whether will condescend to accept term cecilia demurred moment idea of being confidant of smuggler rather startled still knowledge of what intention be if might not reveal might be important a perhaps might dissuade must be in worse position than be now might be in much better conduct of pickersgill have be such up to present a to inspire confidence although defied law appeared to regard courtesy of life cecilia be courageous girl at length replied provided what desire to keep secret will not be injurious to one compromise in peculiar situation consent must not hurt fly miss ossulton in self defence have too much respect for from conduct during short meeting to compromise allow now to be very candid then perhaps will acknowledge that in situation others must do same perhaps not show half so much forbearance father without right interferes with calling attempt to make prisoner to have thrown into jail heavily fined perhaps sent out of country will not enter into defence of smuggling be sufficient to say that there be pain penalty attached to infraction of certain law choose to risk lord b be not empowered by government to attack be gratuitous act have thrown crew into sea must have be justified for be in short act of piracy on part now a father have thought to turn yacht into revenue cutter can not be surprised at retaliating in turning into smuggler a have mixed up looking after revenue with yachting can not be surprised if retaliate by mixing up little yachting with smuggling have dressed male companion a smuggler have sent in smuggling vessel to cherbourg where will be safely landed have dressed only person whom must join with in frolic a gentleman in place object be twofold one be to land cargo have now on board be very valuable other be to retaliate upon father companion for attempt upon by stepping into shoe enjoying for day two luxury be intention to make free with nothing lordship wine eatable that may be assured of will have pleasure if lady sit down to dinner table with a did before with father friend can hardly expect that sir said cecilia yes do will be not only price of early release of yacht will also be only mean by will obtain anything to eat observe miss ossulton sin of father be visited on child have now told what mean to do what wish leave to think of decide whether will not be best for party to consent have permission to tell other lady that may be conduct be a secure from ill treatment rudeness a if be in grosvenor square can not answer that will not be hungry if after such forbearance in point show so little gratitude a not to honour with company then be to understand that be to be starved into submission not starved miss ossulton recollect that will be on bread water detained until do consent detention will increase anxiety of father know how to persuade sir said cecilia a far a be concerned trust will ever be ready to sacrifice feeling of pride to spare father so much uneasiness with permission will now go down into cabin relieve companion from worst of fear a for obtaining what wish can only say that a young person be not likely to have much influence with older than must inevitably be overruled a have not permission to point out to reason might avail must so far allow to be relieved from promise a to communicate have said to to only married woman on board think might then obtain wish must candidly tell will attempt to effect only because be most anxious to rejoin friend be relieved of company replied pickersgill smiling ironically of course be must will have pretty revenge although may probably will detest at event will not have very formidable charge to make against before go below miss ossulton give permission to add married lady to number of confidant must permit to introduce friend mr ossulton pickersgill waved hand in direction of corbett who took off hat made low obeisance be impossible for cecilia ossulton to help smiling continued pickersgill having taken command of yacht instead of lordship be absolutely necessary that also take lordship name while on board be lord b allow to introduce under name can not be addressed otherwise depend upon miss ossulton that will have most paternal solicitude to make happy comfortable have cecilia ossulton dared to have given vent to real feeling at time must have burst into fit of laughter be too ludicrous at same time very burlesque reassured still more went into cabin with heavy weight removed from heart in meantime miss ossulton mr lascelles remained below in greatest anxiety at cecilia prolonged stay knew not what to think dared not go on deck mr lascelles have once determined at risk to go up miss ossulton phoebe have screamed implored so fervently not to leave that unwillingly consented to remain cecilia countenance when entered cabin reassured mr lascelles not aunt who ran to cry sobbing clinging to saying what have done to poor poor cecilia nothing at aunt replied cecilia captain speaks very fairly say will respect in possible way provided that obey order if not if not what cecilia said miss ossulton grasping niece arm will starve not let go god have mercy on cried miss ossulton renewing sob cecilia then went to mr lascelles communicated to apart have passed mr lascelles agreed with cecilia that be in danger of insult a talked over matter at last began to laugh there be novelty in there be something so ridiculous in gentleman being turned into smuggler cecilia be glad that must not tell aunt a wished to be so frightened a never to have company on board yacht again mr lascelles be too glad to annoy for many various insult received matter be therefore canvassed over very satisfactorily mr lascelles felt natural curiosity to see new lord b second mr ossulton have have breakfast be feeling very hungry now that alarm be over desired phoebe to ask steward for tea coffee reply be that

revenged to have laugh now none of three offence be capital in eye of fair sex jack be handsome fine looking fellow of excellent manner very agreeable conversation at same time friend be in general deportment behaviour otherwise than most respectful lady a be not afraid of be greater happiness than have reason to expect think may be amused to witness fear of who accuse sex of cowardice with permission will send for cook steward inquire about dinner must like to know what there be for dinner observed mr lascelles demurely must cecilia cecilia put handkerchief to mouth tell steward cook to come aft immediately cried pickersgill in few second made appearance steward cried pickersgill with loud voice yes lord replied maddox with hat in hand what wine have put out for dinner champagne lord
