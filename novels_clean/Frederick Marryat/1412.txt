very useful in destroying observe william that almighty in wisdom have so arranged that animal especially of noxious kind will be multiplied to excess kept under by being preyed upon by other indeed wherever in country animal exists in quantity there be generally found animal destroys secretary inhabits country where snake exist in number that may destroy in england bird must be of little value animal be too large too fierce to be destroyed by others papa for instance elephant lion very true larger animal breed so fast therefore number increase so rapidly for instance pair of elephant will not have more than one young one in space of two year more while rabbit be preyed upon food of so many other beast a well a bird must increase enormously if be not destroyed examine through whole of creation will find that there be unerring hand invariably preserve balance exact that there be more mouth than for food be provided although accidental circumstance may for time occasion slight

duck on shore dressing feather with bill be then using oil to make feather waterproof how odd say how odd william be not expression to use when talk of wonderful provision made by almighty hand who neglect not meanest of creature say rather how wonderful be very true sir observed ready still must not be too hard upon master william for have heard many grownup man make use of same expression on third day of calm barometer fell so low a to induce captain osborn to believe that must have severe gale preparation be made to meet must come on be mistaken towards midnight cloud gathered up fast a gathered up in thick pile heaped one over other lightning darted through in direction a cloud rose up so did wind at first only in heavy gust then lulling again to calm ready said captain osborn how do think will have wind why captain osborn to tell truth think will be steady to one point long may at first blow hard from north be idea will shift soon to other quarter blow still harder what think mackintosh will have plenty of long steady gale notion sooner ship dead light better mr seagrave with william happened to be standing by at time of conversation at term dead light willie face expressed anxiety ready perceived said be foolish name give to shutter go over cabin window to prevent water from breaking into cabin when vessel sail before wind know have on last time that have gale

walked away to binnacle looked at compass mr seagrave william then went below mr mackintosh went forward to give order a soon a be gone ready went up again to captain osborn said captain osborn be not for to contradict mr mackintosh be of little consequence in time like must have held to opinion have not be that gentleman passenger son be standing by now a coast be clear tell that will have something worse than gale of wind have be in latitude before be old seaman a know there be something in air there have be something during last three day of calm reminds too well of what have seen here before be sure that will have little better than hurricane a far a wind go worse in one point that will last much longer than hurricane generally do have be watching even bird tell so be told by nature be never mistaken that calm have be nothing more than repose of wind previous to being roused up to do worst be real opinion well be inclined to agree with ready so must send topgallant yard down on deck small sail lumber out of top get trysail aft bent lower down gaff will go forward preparation be hardly complete before wind have settled to fierce gale from north east sea rose rapidly topsail after topsail be furled by dusk pacific be flying through water with wind on quarter under reefed foresail storm staysail be with difficulty three men at wheel must keep helm such be blow vessel received from heavy sea on quarter not one seaman in ship took advantage of watch below to go to sleep night careless a generally be storm be too dreadful about three o'clock in morning wind

leeward heaven above be of pitchy darkness only light be from creaming foam of sea on side shift of wind have be to west north west compelled to alter course of vessel for have chance to scud a now did under bare pole in consequence of sea having taken run from former wind have be north east be a sailor call cross minute wave poured over ship sweeping before weight of water one poor man be washed overboard attempt made to save must have be unavailing captain osborn be standing by weather gunnel holding on by one of belaying pin when said to mackintosh how long will last think longer

ship to of be little ball of electric matter attached flaring out to point look at two cloud sir rushing at other if ready have not time to finish what must have said before blaze of light so dazzling that left in utter darkness for second afterwards burst upon vision accompanied with peal of thunder at whole vessel trembled fore aft crash rushing forward shriek be heard when have recovered eyesight foremast have be rent by lightning a if have be lath ship be in flame men at wheel blinded by lightning a well a appalled must not steer ship broached to away went mainmast over side be wreck confusion dismay fortunately heavy sea poured over forecastle soon extinguished flame must have perished ship lay now helpless at mercy of wave beating violently against wreck of mast floated to leeward be still held fast to vessel by rigging a soon a must recover from shock ready first mate hastened to wheel to try to get ship before wind must not do a foremast mainmast being gone mizenmast prevented paying off answering to helm ready having persuaded two of men to take helm made sign to mackintosh for now wind be so loud that must not hear other speak going aft obtained ax cut away mizen rigging mizen topmast head of mizenmast went over side then stump of foremast be sufficient to get ship before wind again still there be much delay confusion before must clear away wreck of mast a soon a must make inquiry found that four of men have be killed by lightning fall of foremast there be now eight remaining besides captain osborn two mate chapter v sailor be never discouraged by danger a long a have chance of relieving by own exertion loss of shipmate so instantaneously summoned away wrecked state of vessel wild surge burying beneath angry water howling of wind dazzling of lightning pealing of thunder did not prevent from doing what necessity demanded first mate rallied men contrived to fix block strap to still smoking stump of foremast rope be rove through block main topgallant sail hoisted so that vessel might run faster before gale answer helm better than did ship be again before wind comparatively safe notwithstanding heavy blow now received from pursuing wave night again came on there be repose men be worn out with exposure fatigue third day of gale dawned appearance be a alarming a ever continual breaking of sea over stern have washed away binnacle be impossible now to be certain of course ship have be steered distance have be run leaky state of vessel proved how much have already suffered from violent shock have received certainty be apparent that if weather did not abate must not possibly withstand force of wave much longer countenance of captain osborn showed great anxiety have heavy responsibility on shoulder might lose valuable ship still more valuable cargo even if did not lose life for be now approaching where sea be studded with low coral island upon might be thrown by wave wind without having slightest power to prevent in present disabled condition ready be standing by when captain osborn said much like ready be now running on danger have help for be true enough replied ready have help for be god will sir will be done amen replied captain osborn solemnly then continued after pause there be many captain who envied when obtained command of fine ship must change with now must rather think not captain osborn never know what day may bring forth sailed with vessel full of hope now not without reason feel something approaching to despair who know may please almighty to rebuke angry wind wave to morrow may again hope for best at event have done duty man can do more be right replied captain osborn hold hard ready that sea aboard of ready have just time to cling with hand to belaying pin when sea poured over vessel with volume of water for time swept off leg clung on firmly at last recovered foot started timber two with blow rather think said ready be afraid so best vessel ever built must not stand such shock long replied captain osborn at present with weak crew see that can get more sail upon night ship flew in darkness before gale at daybreak wind abated sea went down ship be however still kept before wind for have suffered too much to venture to put broadside to sea preparation be now made for getting up jury mast worn out seaman be busily employed under direction of captain osborn two mate when mr

of cocoa nut tree will be glad when be through wood then faster walk better said ready a far a can judge must be about way across now ready william recommenced journey after hour walking found that ground be not so level a have be sometimes went gradually up hill at others down be very glad to find island be not so flat here have better chance of finding water be much steeper before replied william be quite hill ground now became more undulating although still covered with cocoa nut tree even thicker together than before continued march occasionally looking at compass until william showed symptom of weariness for wood have become more difficult to get through than at first how many mile do think have walked ready said willy about eight must think not more than eight think that have made more than two mile hour be slow work travelling by compass marking tree think wood look lighter before now that be at top of hill doe ready fancy can see blue sky again eye be younger than

sorry for thought never must get out of nasty wood again said william a impatiently pushed on at last stood clear of cocoa nut grove ready soon joined surveyed scene before in silence chapter xv oh how beautiful exclaimed william at last be sure mamma must like to live here thought other side of island very pretty be nothing compared to be very beautiful replied ready thoughtfully more lovely scene must scarcely be imagined cocoa nut grove terminated about quarter of mile from beach very abruptly for there be rapid descent for about thirty foot from where stood to land below on be mixture of little grass knoll brushwood to about fifty yard from water edge where be met with dazzling white sand occasionally divided by narrow ridge of rock ran inland water be deep blue except where be broken into white foam on reef extended for mile from beach rock of now then showed above water on rock be perched crowd of gannet men of war bird while others wheeled in air now then darting down into blue sea bringing up in bill fish out of shoal rippled water bounded clear of in gambol form of coast be that of horse shoe bay two point of land covered with shrub extending far out on side line of horizon far out at sea be clear unbroken ready remained for time without speaking scanned horizon right left then turned eye along land at last william said what be thinking of ready why be thinking that must look for water a fast a can why be so anxious because can see island to leeward of a expected therefore there be le chance of getting off island bay although very beautiful be full of reef see inlet make awkward for many reason can not judge at first sight let now sit down take dinner after will explore little ready cut two wide mark in stem of cocoa nut tree then descended with william to low ground where sat down to eat dinner a soon a meal be finished first walked down to water edge ready turned eye inland to see if must discover little ravine hollow might be likely to contain fresh water there be one two place there observed ready pointing to with finger where water have run down in rainy season must examine carefully not now want to find out whether there be mean of getting little boat through reef of rock otherwise will have very hard work if change abode to spot to bring store through wood so will pas rest of day in examining coast to morrow will try for

so many more abound in pacific ocean must have be raised by work of little insect not bigger than pin head insect father replied william yes insect give that piece of dead coral william do see that on branch there be hundred little hole well in one of little hole once lived sea insect a insect increase so do branch of coral tree yes understand how do make out that island be made by almost island in sea have be made by labour increase of small animal coral grows at first at bottom of sea where be not disturbed by wind wave by degree a increase advance higher higher to surface till at last come near to top of water then be stopped in growth by force of wind wave break off of course never grows above water for if did animal must die then how doe become island by very slow degree time perhaps much depending upon chance for instance log of wood floating about covered with barnacle may ground upon coral reef must be sufficient commencement for must remain above water then shelter coral to leeward of until flat rock have formed level with edge of water sea bird be always looking for place to rest upon must soon find then droppings must in course of time form little patch above water other floating substance must be thrown on land bird who be blown out to sea might rest on seed from stomach when dropped must grow into tree bush understand well then william observe there be island commenced a be once commenced soon increase for coral must then be protected to leeward grow up fast do observe how coral reef extend at side of island where be protected from wind wave how different be on weather side have just left just so little patch above water protects coral to leeward there island increase fast for bird not only settle on hut make nest rear young so year soil increase then perhaps one cocoa nut in great outside shell at last be thrown on little patch take root becomes tree year shedding large branch be turned into mould a soon a decay then dropping nut again take root grow in mould thus continue season after season year after year until island becomes a large a thickly covered with tree a one be now standing upon be not wonderful dear boy be not great good god who can make such minute animal a work pleasure at time think fit produce such beautiful island a indeed be exclaimed william only need use eye william will love a well a adore look at shell be not

seagrave require more of sun than will have till rainy season be nearly over few day like will soon be above ground let sit down on knoll be quite dry said mr seagrave little thought continued must have be so happy in desert island thought must feel loss of book very severely really think must have found time to read employment be source of happiness especially when be usefully employed industrious person be always happy person provided be not obliged to work too hard even where have cause for unhappiness nothing make forget so soon a occupation mamma will not always have so much to do a have now said william of course not replied mr seagrave then will find book great source of enjoyment be anxious to go to other side of island see what have be spared to whether have be much damaged that can not be until after rain be over can use boat again look at minute insect be crawling on finger said mr seagrave turning to william what number of leg have yes have seen something like in old book how fast run with little leg thinner than hair how wonderful yes william replied mr seagrave have only to examine into portion however small of creation be immediately filled with wonder there be nothing point out to immensity omniscience of almighty more than careful provision have be made by for smallest most insignificant of created being little animal be perhaps one of many million who have term of existence enjoyment a well a have what be insect of minutest kind nothing in creation yet have same care be bestowed upon formation little leg hardly visible have muscle sinew other portion of body be a complete a fearfully wonderfully fashioned a own such be will what insect ought to feel when compared to god of power of love let also point out to william continued mr seagrave infinity of creative power displayed in endless variety amongst million of men have be born died if ever yet be there seen two face two body exactly alike nay if must examine leaf upon tree although there may be million upon million in forest must not discover two leaf of precisely same form make have often tried in vain replied william yet animal be so much alike can not perceive difference between sheep for instance very true can not tell difference because have not examined shepherd if have seven hundred sheep under care will know one of from others prof that there must be great difference between although not perceptible to casual observer same doubt be case with other class of animal yes william observed ready have often wondered over thing have seen have even in ignorance felt what papa have now told have brought into mind word of job when consider be afraid of ' papa said william after pause in conversation have referred to variety wonderful variety shown in work of deity tell other prominent feature in creation one of most remarkable william be order point out to papa where in what quality be most observable everywhere in everything dear boy whether cast eye up to heaven above penetrate into bowel of earth principle of order be everywhere everything be governed by fixed law can not be disobeyed have order in season in tide in movement of heavenly body in instinct of animal in duration of life assigned to from elephant who life more than century to ephemeral fly whose whole existence be limited to hour inanimate nature be subject to same unvarying law metal rock earth mineral kingdom follow one law in crystallization never varying from form assigned to atom depositing in allotted place until form be complete have order in production order in decay be simple to by whom planet be thrown out into space be commanded to roll in eternal orbit yes star in heaven be beautiful said william be not placed there in order fixed star appear to to be in order be stud heaven at equal distance from other a view must recollect that be at very different distance from earth spreading over infinity of space have reason to suppose that earth be mere unit in multitude of created world only one single portion of infinite whole a star now appear to be useful to mariner enabling to cross trackless sea to astronomer who calculates time season what do mean papa by saying that world of ours be supposed to be one of multitude of created world little knowledge be bounded to own earth have ascertained very satisfactorily to be one of several planet revolving round own sun say own sun because have reason to suppose that of fixed star myriad now not visible to naked eye be sun bright glorious a own of course throwing light heat upon unseen planet revolving round doe not give idea of vastness power immensity of god one almost loses one self in imagination said mr seagrave yes replied mr seagrave have be surmised by who have felt in heart magnificence of great architect that there must be point of view in space where glorious sun seem to confused in heaven above will appear symmetrically arranged will there be viewed in regular order whirling round in one stupendous perfect system of beauty design where can that be if be not in heaven hope to gain there be silence for few moment when william said say that there be people who be atheist papa how can be so if only look around be sure mere examination of work of god ought to make good christian child replied mr seagrave there be in error few deny existence of deity examination of work may make good devout men not christian there be good men to be found under denomination whether be jew mahomedans pagan be not christian very true papa faith in thing seen if may use term dear child may induce men to acknowledge power goodness of almighty will not make wise to salvation for end be necessary a apostle saith to have faith in thing not seen chapter xxxvi well ready said mr seagrave after breakfast be to be next job why sir think have better all set to to collect branch end of cocoa nut tree cut down stack for fuel tommy juno have already made good large pile think by to night will have made stack so arranged that rain will not get into much after a weather will not permit to leave house for time will cut salt pan make fish pond will take week at least then will have little more to do near home think strength of rain be over already perhaps in fortnight may venture to walk through wood examine what have saved from wreck be to explore island be not ready said william long to do yes william must be almost last job for will be away for two three night perhaps must look out for fine weather will however do that before bring store round in boat how be to make salt pan ready must cut out of solid rock yes william have three four of what call cold chisel with one of hammer will get on faster than think for coral rock although hard at surface be soft little below whole of day be employed in piling up cocoa nut branch wood ready made square stack like haystack with gable top over tied long branch so that rain must pour off there said ready a came down ladder will be provision for next year have quite enough left to go on with till rainy season be over will have difficulty in collecting afterwards when weather be dry mr seagrave sighed looked grave ready observed said mr seagrave be not that may want still must prepare for next rainy season in case do want captain osborn if life will send to look for have doubt nay believe that mackintosh will do same still must not forget that may have perished although have be so mercifully preserved must put trust in god sir must ready if be will must not murmur have schooled a much a possible thought will come in spite of endeavour to restrain of course will sir be natural however sir must hope for best fretting be good be sinful feel be ready when see how patient even happy wife be under such privation be angry with woman sir bear adversity better than man woman be love if have husband child with in good health will make herself happy almost anywhere men be different can not bear being shut out of world a be now be ambition make unhappy ready replied mr seagrave let say more about god must dispose of a think fit after supper ready being requested by william continued narrative left off if recollect right william just a hottentot with cattle under care have frightened away baboon who be tormenting well came out of cave sat down under rock so that hottentot must not see have sort of council of war romer be for going back giving up again for said be ridiculous to be wandering about without arm to defend against wild beast that might fall in with something worse than baboon very soon be right must have be wisest thing must have done hastings said that if went back must be laughed at idea of being laughed at made agree that must not bear in mind william never let fear of ridicule induce to do what be wrong if have done wrong prevent from returning to what be duty many thanks for advice ready hope william will not forget said mr seagrave well sir such be reason for not giving up mad scheme having so decided next point of consultation between be how be to procure arm ammunition must not do without a be talking over peeped from behind rock to see where hottentot might be perceived that have laid down wrapped up in kross mantle of sheep skin always wear now have observed that carried musket in hand when first saw a hottentot always go out armed pointed out to hastings romer that if be asleep might get possession of musket without perceiving be good idea hastings said must crawl to on hand knee while remained behind rock did so very cautiously found man head covered up in kross fast asleep so there be fear for hottentot be very hard to wake at time that knew well hastings first took musket carried away out of reach of hottentot then returned to cut leather thong slung powder horn ammunition retreated with of without disturbing man from sleep be quite overjoyed at piece of good luck determined to walk very cautiously distance from where hottentot

than hundred mile from master residence proof of memory in animal be required be that dream now dream be confused recollection of past event how often do not hear romulus remus growling barking whining in sleep very true papa well then have attention see how patiently cat will remain for hour before hole in watch for mouse to come out spider will remain for month watching for fly to enter web quality be to be observed in animal in pursuit of prey have also association of idea be in fact reasoning dog prof that will allow gentleman to come up to door fly at beggar when be in charge of property will take notice of passer by if man stop bark immediately in elephant association of idea be even more remarkable indeed understands what be said to better than other animal reasoning power be most extraordinary promise reward will make wonderful exertion be also extremely alive to sense of shame elephant be employed to transport heavy artillery in india one of finest attempted in vain to force gun through swamp take away lazy beast ' said director bring ' animal be so stung with reproach that used so much exertion to force gun on with head a to fracture skull fell dead when chunee elephant be so long in exeter change be ordered a usual to take up sixpence with trunk happened one day that sixpence rolled against skirting board out of reach chunee stopped reflected little while then drawing air into trunk threw out with force against skirting board rebound of air from skirting board blew sixpence towards be enabled to reach be very clever of replied william yes be proof of thought with knowledge of cause effect there be curious instance of horse by bye consider most noble animal of creation be ridden round by master to deliver newspaper invariably stopped at door where paper be to be left happened that two people living at different house took in weekly newspaper between be agreed that one must have first reading of on one week other on following after short time horse became accustomed to arrangement stopped at one house on one week at other house on following never making mistake be very curious what sagacious animal must have be observed william animal also be a know capable of receiving instruction be proof of reasoning power elephant horse dog pig even bird may be taught great deal then papa still wish to know where line be to be drawn between reason instinct be about to come to very point william when animal follow instinct in providing food bringing up young in precaution against danger follow certain fixed rule from never deviate circumstance may occur against instinct can afford regular provision then be that reasoning power be called into action will explain by stating fact relative to bee one of animal upon instinct be most powerful in action there be certain large moth called death head moth be very fond of honey sometimes contrives to force way through aperture of hive gain entrance bee immediately attack be soon destroyed by sting carcass be so large that can not carry out of hive a invariably do body of smaller insect may have intruded appears that sense of smell be very acute what then do do to avoid stench arising from dead body of large moth why embalm covering entirely with wax by no longer becomes offensive to papa might not instinct have provided for such event observed william if such event must have occurred to bee in wild state certainly might have raised question recollect william bee in wild state live in hollow of tree that hole by enter be never more than sufficiently large to admit one bee at time consequently animal larger than bee must gain entrance if did must of course have be easily removed from hive bee be here in new position in artificial state in hive of straw with large aperture therefore met with exigence be not prepared for acted accordingly yes papa perceive difference will conclude observation with one remark appears to that although almighty have thought proper to vary intellectual reasoning power of animal in same way that have varied specie form yet even in arrangement have not be unmindful of interest welfare of man for will observe that reasoning power be chiefly if not wholly given to animal man subject to service for use elephant horse dog thereby making animal of more value a power given to be at service under control of man chapter lv on monday morning william ready went away in boat a before to bring round various article from cove have be arranged that be not to return till saturday evening that dog remus be to bring intelligence of welfare afternoon worked hard during week on saturday have completed task with exception of portion of timber of ship everything have be brought round have not be carried up to storehouse a required more time on saturday morning went for last time to cove ready selected heavy oak timber out of quantity be lying on beach part of put into boat remainder towed astern be heavy load although wind be fair to sail hack again to bay boat went slowly through water well william said ready have done good week work must say be high time that be done for boat be in rather crazy condition must contrive to patch up by by when there be time will not want to use very much after ready replied william few trip round to little harbour will be will be required before come back again to old quarter be true william leak very much at event will give coat of pitch a soon a possible for slight built little thing a be have done hard duty pray ready why when speak of ship boat do always call well william know why be certain that sailor always do so believe be because sailor love ship ship be wife be very common saying with then see master william vessel be almost thing of life in appearance believe be reason of course if vessel be little boat must be also well think have explained very well ready suppose on monday will set to at storehouse alter for future residence ca begin too soon william replied ready doubt mr seagrave have finished hedge ditch round yam by time if so expect madam will not like to be left in tent alone with juno child so will move back to house again until have altered storehouse must say must rather mamma remained in tent until be finished because be afraid of visit from savage ready be sir be truth ready if do come will see coming must not be better that must all be together even if be obliged to conceal in consequence of not being prepared suppose savage be to overrun island find mother little brother sister defenceless at time be obliged to retreat from house how dreadful must be counted upon retreating to tent so can all together unless be surprised in night that must take care not to be there be not three hour dark in season of year well william doubt not may be right if be with juno will be great help will get through work faster have better let question be decided by father mother very true william here be point at last will haul timber on beach then be off a fast a can for be getting late be indeed much later than have usually arrived at little harbour owing to heavy load made boat so long in coming round from cove when pulled in found mr mr seagrave child waiting for be very late william said mr seagrave be quite uneasy till saw boat at distance yes mamma must not help have heavy load to bring round now work be done be delighted to hear william for can not bear being away so long work be done said mr seagrave hedge ditch be finished morning well then observed ready must hold council presume will not take very long expect not seldom doe when people be of same mind mr seagrave wo be left here ready want to leave so presume on monday start home again yes sir if please replied ready juno hope have good supper said william for be very hungry yes massa william plenty fried fish massa catch morning chapter lvi next day being sunday be day of repose a have worked so hard felt luxury of day of rest in afternoon agreed that on monday must make preparation for quitting tent returning to house at bay decided that live stock must all be left there a pasturage be so plentiful good with exception of one goat must take back with to supply with milk also agreed that tent must be left standing with cooking utensil that in case william ready went round for banana yam to examine live stock must not be compelled to sleep in open air must have mean of dressing dinner william ready be to carry bed etc round to bay in boat must do in two trip mr mr seagrave with family be to walk through wood after taking very early breakfast point being arranged have finished supper when william again brought up conversation about animal a be delighted to bear mr seagrave talk on subject conversation have not commenced more than few minute when william said papa always say a stupid a as ' be as stupid animal william be very sagacious one character have be given to animal more on account of obstinacy untractableness than on other account be usual to say a stupid a as a stupid a pig goose now three animal be very much maligned for be sagacious animal fact be that a regard as have only very sorry specimen of animal in england be stunted small from want of corn proper food besides being very ill treated be slow dull looking animal climate of england be much too cold for as in south of france mediterranean where be much warmer as be much finer animal to see in perfection must go to torrid zone in guinea right on equator hottest portion of globe where as in native state in native country be handsome creature a fleet a wind indeed supposed to be mentioned in scripture a fleetest animal in creation fact be that in asia especially in palestine syria ass be in great repute used in preference to horse must see animal in own climate to form true estimate of value doe climate then make so great difference said william of course doe not only with animal with tree plant even man until be accustomed to change with respect to animal there be can bear different variety of climate even change of food horse for instance although originally indigenous to arabia life a well in temperate even in frigid zone may be said for endure hard winter of russia north america so will domestic cattle such a cow sheep pig c be curious fact that during winter in canada large proportion of food of cattle consists of fish fish papa cow eat fish yes dear boy such be fact be remarkable instance of graminivorous grass eating animal being changed for time into flesh eating rather into fish eating animal there be other animal can live under temperature a wolf fox hare rabbit be curious provision that sheep goat in hottest climate throw off warm covering of wool retain little better than hair while removed to cold climate recover warm covering immediately goat have wool papa what be cashmere shawl made of william very true papa most animal have certain increase of covering a recede further from warm climate to cold one wolf fox hare rabbit change colour of skin to white when get far north little english stoat be destroyed by gamekeeper becomes beautiful snow white ermine in russia other cold country well papa think great advantage to man proof of almighty care of kindness to in permitting animal most useful to to be able to live in country know whether be wrong in saying so papa can not see why animal like wolf must not have be kept to own climate like lion tiger other ferocious animal have started question william be glad have done rather than must have remained on mind have puzzled be true that shepherd might agree with that wolf be nuisance equally true that husband man may exclaim what be good of thistle various weed choke soil dear boy if be not think be for benefit of man at event be doom for first transgression cursed be ground for thy sake thorn thistle will bring forth to thee by sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread ' be almighty sentence be only by labour that husbandman can obtain crop by watchfulness that shepherd can guard flock labour be in benefit without exercise there must be health without health there must be enjoyment see now papa have mentioned animal can live in climate will not tell something about other animal there be one remark to make william be that animal indigenous to be originally to be found in one portion of globe invariably be so fashioned a to be most fit for country have food also most proper for growing to be obtained in country take for instance camel animal fashioned expressly for country to be indigenous without whose aid communication must have be stopped between asia africa be called ship of desert for desert be sea of sand ' foot be so fashioned that can traverse sand with facility can live upon coarsest vegetable food salt plant be found there have capacity of carrying water in sort of secondary stomach for own supply where water be to be found here be animal wonderfully made by almighty for express locality for convenience of man in country for in england elsewhere must be of value be late dear william so will first thank for mercy then to bed chapter lvii next morning be one of bustle there be packing up preparation

landed out of ten of canoe others be following example a fast a must forcing way through reef savage be painted with war cloak feather on armed with spear club evidently having come with peaceable intention william who have taken telescope to examine more minutely said to ready what fierce cruel set of wretch appear to be if overpower will certainly kill of there be doubt william must fight hard not let overpower kill certainly will be not sure that may not eat afterwards be of little consequence william replied in determined tone will fight a long a have breath in body ready be coming up a fast a can yes must wait no longer come william thought saw vessel under sail out away by garden point ready just a turned away very likely sir canoe have separated from others during night come quick william have begun to yell half minute arrived at door of stockade entered shut door then barricaded with cocoa nut pole have fitted to inner door post chapter lxii loud yell of savage struck terror into heart of mr seagrave be well that have not seen painted body fierce appearance must have be much more alarmed little albert caroline clung around neck with terror in face did not cry looked round round to see from whence horrid noise proceeded then clung faster to mother tommy be very busy finishing breakfast have be left for there be one to check a usual juno be busy outside be very active courageous mr seagrave have be employed making hole between palisade large enough to admit barrel of musket so that must fire at savage without being exposed while william ready with

be walking along with first two men yes be be sure be right william be one of ah have stopped did not expect stockade be clear have puzzled see how be crowding together talking be holding council of war how to proceed that tall man must be one of chief now william although intend to fight a hard a can yet always feel dislike to begin first will therefore show over palisade if attack will then fire with quiet conscience take care hit ready great fear of william here come ready now stood upon plank within so a to show to savage who gave tremendous yell a advanced dozen spear be thrown at with so true aim have not instantly dodged behind stockade must have be killed three four spear remained quivering in palisade just below top others went over fell down inside of stockade at further end now william take good aim before william must fire mr seagrave who have agreed to be stationed at corner so that might see if savage went round to other side fired musket tall chief fell to ground ready william also fired two more of savage be seen to drop yell of companion juno handed up other musket be ready loaded took discharged mr seagrave having desired caroline to take care of little brother tommy to be very quiet good came out turned key of door upon hastened to assist juno in reloading musket spear now rushed through air be well that must fire from stockade without exposing person must have have little chance yell increased savage now began to attack on quarter most active who climbed like cat actually succeeded in gaining top of palisade a soon a head appeared above be fired at with so true aim that dropped down dead outside combat lasted for more than hour when savage having lost great many men drew off from assault party within stockade have time to breathe have not gained much in bout at event said ready be well fought on side william certainly behaved a if have be brought up to do think will go away now said mr seagrave oh madam not yet will try way before leave see be very brave men be clear that know what gunpowder be must have be more astonished must think so too replied mr seagrave first time savage hear report of firearm be usually thrown into great consternation yes sir such have not be case with people therefore reckon be not first time that have fought with european be gone ready said william who have come down from plank to mother see between tree now be sitting round in circle suppose making speech well be very thirsty at event said william juno bring little water juno went to water tub to comply with william request in few moment

what will do go speak massa tommy said juno running to house be very awkward thing mr seagrave observed ready gravely mr seagrave shook head fact be that perceived danger of position if savage did not leave island must perish of thirst have to surrender in latter case life must most certainly be sacrificed juno now returned suspicion be too true tommy pleased with praise of being so quick in bringing water have taken out spigot of cask drawn off well observed mr seagrave be will of heaven that careful arrangement preparation against attack must be defeated by idleness of child must submit very true sir replied ready hope now be that savage may be tired out leave island if have little for child must not care observed mr seagrave to see poor thing suffer be there not drop left juno anywhere juno shook head mr seagrave said must go examine went away into house accompanied by juno be very bad business ready observed mr seagrave what must give for shower of rain now that might
