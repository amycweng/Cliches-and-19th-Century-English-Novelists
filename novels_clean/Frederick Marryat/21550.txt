men to whom nation looked for defence from surrounding enemy in steadfast reliance upon whose bravery lay down night in tranquillity men who have dared everything for king country in whose breast patriotism although suppressed for time must never be extinguished irritated by ungrateful neglect on one hand by seditious adviser on other turned gun have so often manned in defence of english flag against own countryman own home with acrimony of feeling ever attending family quarrel seemed determined to sacrifice nation rather than listen to dictate of reason of conscience doubtless there be point at endurance of oppression cease to be virtue rebellion can no longer be considered a crime be dangerous intricate problem solution of have better not be attempted must however be acknowledged that seaman on occasion of first mutiny have just ground of complaint that did not proceed to act of violence until repeated humble remonstrance have be made in vain whether act in body individually such be infirmity selfishness of human nature that often surrender to importunity refuse to dictate of gratitude yielding for own comfort to demand of turbulence while quiet unpretending merit be overlooked oppressed until roused by neglect demand a right what policy alone must have granted a favour such be behaviour on part of government produced mutiny at nore what mechanism be more complex than mind of man a in machinery there be wheel spring of action not apparent without close examination of interior so pride ambition avarice love play alternately conjointly upon human mind under influence be whirled round like weathercock in hurricane only pointing for short time in one direction for time steadfastly how difficult then to analyse motif inducement actuated several ringleader

blood mantled in cheek of one who at period be incapable of crime blush of virtuous indignation be construed into presumptive evidence of guilt captain superficial presuming pompous yet cowardly creature whose conduct assisted in small degree to excite mutiny on board of own ship declared quite convinced of peter guilt because blushed at bare idea of being suspected punishment ensued with degradation allotted to offence be never forgiven on board of man of war there be perhaps crime be attended with such serious consequence on board ship a theft succession of theft undiscovered will disintegrate ship company break up mess destroy confidence harmony occasion who have be dearest friend to become greatest enemy for whom can person suspect when have lost property in so confined space who be acquainted with being in possession with place in be deposited who be own messmate in whom most confided after positive conviction punishment can be too severe for crime produce such mischief to degrade man by corporal punishment to ruin character render object of abhorrence contempt in absence of even bare presumptive evidence be act of cruelty injustice must excite one feeling from day man who must have gloried in dying for country became discontented gloomy dangerous subject above effect must have be produced in man to peter whose previous history have yet to narrate death must have be preferable heart did not break swelled with contending passion till be burst riven with wound never to be cicatrised suffering under most painful burthen can oppress man who value reputation writhing with injustice of accusation when innocent of conviction without proof of punishment unmerited be not to be wondered at peter took earliest opportunity of deserting from ship there be particular feeling pervading animal nature from man be not exempt indeed with boasted reason man still inherits too many of propensity of brute creation refer to disposition not only incline to feel satisfaction at finding have companion in misfortune too often stimulates to increase number by own exertion from stupendous elephant down to smallest of feathered tribe will act a decoy to own specie when in captivity in compulsory service may be considered specie of captivity man prof that be imbued with same propensity seaman have be pressed into navy be invariably most active in pressing others soldier sailor have secret pleasure in recapturing deserter even at very time when be watching opportunity to desert bond of friendship seem destroyed when powerful brutal feeling be called into action a have frequently occurred in service before since man who be selected by peter a most intimate friend man with whom have consulted to whom have confided plan for desertion gave information of retreat of wife child from place peter be not likely to be very distant thus with assistance of dearest friend master at arm party in quest of succeeded in capture so happened that on very day on peter be brought on board put into iron purser servant be discovered to have in possession watch have be lost thus far character of peter be reinstated a have declared at time of capture that unjust punishment have received have be motive of desertion captain be strongly urged by officer to overlook offence have everything to be offered in extenuation captain be fond of court martial imagined that added to consequence certainly required to be upheld by adventitious aid moreover feeling too often pervading little mind that of dislike taken to person because have injured preferring to accumulate injustice rather than to acknowledge error have more than due weight with weak man court martial be held peter be sentenced to death in consideration of circumstance sentence be mitigated to of being flogged round fleet mitigated strange vanity in men that must imagine own feeling to be more sensible acute than of others that must consider that mitigation in favour of prisoner have be placed in situation must have declared accumulation of punishment not captain who sat upon court martial must have considered a peter did that death be by far more lenient sentence of two yet meant well felt kindly towards acknowledged provocation fell into too common error of supposing that finer feeling induce man to prefer death to dishonour be only to be recognised among higher class because circumstance may have placed man before mast will undergo punishment however severe however degrading in short ill that flesh be heir to in preference to death a reader may not perhaps be acquainted with nature of punishment to peter be sentenced ceremony by be attended will enter into short description of man sentenced to be flogged round fleet receives equal part of whole number of lash awarded

high low rich poor granted will allow also law maker must not be lawbreaker that if be so can not expect that others will regard what disregard granted also once more by law of country receiver be a bad a thief who instigate others to commit offence be equally guilty with offending party can not be denied replied debriseau then have acceded to proposition wish will come to undeniable mathematical

laughing then there must be smuggling chapter twelve love love dog proverb be misfortune of who have be in constant habit of deceit that always imagine others be attempting same dishonest practice for time mcelvina felt convinced that little hero have swerved from truth in account gave of be not until after repeated catechisings in found that strange improbable a narrative appeared willy never altered from contradicted original statement that believed boy to be a honest ingenuous a might have be inferred from prepossessing countenance to conviction how ever did arrive at last hero who

that boy have be detained by have have opportunity of leaving vessel have never anchored in french port of havre also stated what be indeed true that have always evaded explaining to boy real nature of service upon lugger be employed from may be inferred that notwithstanding mcelvina defence of smuggling in former chapter be not quite so well convinced in own mind of propriety a must have induced

'd byron survey be continued one morning after fatiguing walk from point to point occasionally crossing from one islet to others in boat party collected under projecting rock screened from ray of vertical sun repast have be brought from ship in morning be spread before party consisted of captain m pearce master surgeon who have accompanied to explore natural production of reef confidential clerk of captain m man of name of collier who have be many year in service who be now employed in noting down angle taken with theodolite tired with labour of morning captain m did not rise immediately after meal have be despatched entered into conversation with surgeon who be looking over memoranda have made relative to natural history of reef do intend to write book mr macallan that have collected so many remark indeed sir have ambition to be author clerk who be very taciturn in general seldom spoke unless on point connected with duty joined conversation by addressing surgeon be service of danger sir must be prepared to meet attack of author reviewer of reviewer can imagine replied macallan why of author depends very much whether tread over beaten ground strike into new path in latter case will be pretty safe from a author will be indifferent reviewer in probability incapable why if enter upon beaten track presume infers style of writing in others have preceded because sir when new author make appearance be much in same situation a strange dog entering kennel preoccupied by many others be immediately attacked worried by rest until by boldly defending pertinaciously refusing to quit eventually obtains domiciliation becomes acknowledged member of fraternity why mr collier observed captain seem to be quite au fait a to literary arrangement ought to be sir replied clerk for in course of life have attempted to become author practised a reviewer indeed did fail in attempt at authorship work be never printed sir for bookseller must undertake to publish tried whole town man must give trouble to look over m be said that public taste be not way that must not do at last received letter of introduction from old acquaintance to uncle who be literary character certainly did read part of performance what then why sir shook head told with sneer a author must never succeed added with sort of encouraging smile from part of m have perused thought that must find employment for in reviewing line if chose to undertake pride be hurt answered must not agree with a considered that required ability to write book to enable to decide upon merit of others well must say that agree with replied captain proceed in story for be interested friend answered by mean dear sir damned bad author generally make very good reviewer indeed sir to be candid with never allow gentleman to review for unless have met with misfortune similar to yours be one of necessary qualification of good reviewer that must have failed a author for without exacerbated feeling arising from disappointment must not posse gall sufficient for task conscience must stand in way when be writing against if be not spurred on by keen probe of envy convinced poverty did sir if did not worked many month for have better have earned bread a common labourer review ought to pay well too observed macallan be periodical in great demand be so replied captain m reason be obvious few people take trouble to think for on contrary be very glad to find others who will think for can not find time to read others will not find review remove difficulty give busy world insight into what be going on in literary world enables lounger not to appear wholly ignorant of work merit of may happen to be discussed what be consequence seven eighth of town be led by nose by periodical work having wholly lost sight of fact that review be far from being gospel indeed know set of men so likely to err a reviewer in first place there be class of people so irascible so full of party feeling so disgraced by envy a author hatred malice uncharitableness seem to preside over science political opinion step in increase undue preponderance to crown be more influenced by money being proverbially more in want of than others how then be to be expected that review can be impartial seldom read a consider that be better to know nothing than to be misled if be fair question mr collier continued captain m in what manner be employed be almost ashamed to tell sir be mere automaton machine in hand of others new publication be sent to with private mark from employer directing quantum of praise censure be to incur if former be allotted to best passage be selected if condemned to latter worst connecting part of review be made up from commonplace book in by turning to subject found general head extract from work of others be directed to alter so a to retain idea disguise style that might appear original be aware of ground of praise abuse for appears that who directed censure did not read publication ground be various book printed by bookseller to whom master have dislike be sure to be run down on contrary published by connection friend be a much applauded moreover influence of author who be afraid of successful rival in own line often damned work mean to say that review be conducted with such want of principle by mean there be many very impartial clever critique misfortune be that unless read work be reviewed can not distinguish one from other pray what induced to abandon creditable employment quarrel sir have reviewed work with private mark of approval when be found out to be mistake be desired to review with censure expected to be paid for second review a well a for first employer thought proper to consider a one job refused so parted pretty trick in trade indeed replied captain m why mr collier appear to have belonged to gang of literary bravo whose pen like stilettoes be always ready to stab in dark unfortunate individual who might be pointed out to by interest revenge acknowledge justice of remark sir can offer in defence be excuse of libeller to cardinal richelieu il faut vivre monsieur answer with cardinal je ne vois pa la necessite replied captain m with smile a

place make necessary arrangement when heavy north east swell lowering horizon predicted continuance of fair wind plenty of so proved wind increased rapidly men found difficult to reduce canvas in sufficient time before dark wind blew with considerable force not steadily in fitful gust sun a descended in wave warned by red fiery aspect to prepare for increase of gale schooner flew before under diminished sail rolling gunwale to in deep trough lurching heavily a weather quarter be borne up aloft by culminating swell be secured for night watch be set seymour walked deck while courtenay rest went below at early hour retired to bed among other reason for selecting hero a one of assistant courtenay be influenced by perfect knowledge of french language might prove useful in communicating with french prisoner who be sent on board to assist in working vessel jerry have also boasted of talent in way a wished to go in prize although reader from specimen have have may not exactly give credit to assertion yet courtenay who have never heard believed that be pretty well acquainted with language soon after have parted with frigate when courtenay desired french prisoner to lay hold of rope assist in shortening sail refused seymour be not on deck at time have be desired to superintend arrangement below although have be informed of conduct have not yet spoken to prisoner two of be sitting aft under lee of weather bulwark a seymour be walking deck to fro be in earnest conversation when seymour stopped near to carelessly leaning over weather quarter watching long following sea when overheard one say to other taisez peut etre qu'il nous entend nous verrons replied other who immediately rose addressed seymour in french relative to weather what have previously heard induced hero to shake head continue to look over weather quarter a seymour only answered in english negative to further interrogation prisoner did not think while to remove out of hearing satisfied with not being able to comprehend sat down again resumed conversation lurching of vessel be sufficient reason for not walking deck seymour to remove suspicion took turn two then again held on by rope close by frenchman wind blew too fresh to permit to catch more than occasional sentence two of conversation what heard made more anxious to collect more il ne sont que seize avec ce petit misere observed one et nous somme here rest of sentence be lost seymour reckoned up english on board found that with billy pitt whom macallan have allowed courtenay to take with a steward exactly amounted to that number latter epithet considered justly enough to be bestowed upon friend jerry few minute afterwards intercepted will throw overboard if succeed will throw overboard if do courage mon ami il n ' y aura pa de difficulte nous somme trop fort replied other a terminating conversation rose walked forward be evident to hero that something be in agitation at same time appeared perfectly incomprehensible that six prisoner must have even formed idea of attempting recapture of vessel manned with sixteen englishman that must consider so strong a to insure success determined to report what have heard to courtenay seymour walked remainder of watch be relieved went below to hammock wind have increased during night a be fair sky clear sun shone bright breeze be rather matter of congratulation when met at breakfast in morning although peter paul complained of violent motion of vessel having taken away appetite seymour reported to courtenay fragment of conversation have overheard insane a appeared to be idea of recapture latter agreed with that demanded caution on part a must appear very opposite to english character to take open measure against six prisoner when be so numerous contented with desiring arm ammunition to be stowed in cabin gave order that prisoner a refused to work must not be allowed to come on deck after dusk then gave affair further thought seymour be aware that although be duty to report circumstance have right to press matter upon courtenay who be to be supposed best judge still be not satisfied have unaccountable foreboding that be not right turned subject in mind until dinner be announced by billy pitt put end to reverie violent jerking motion of vessel made easy task to retain position at table be securely lashed a for placing on whole of dinner at once decanter etcetera must have be certain destruction plate spoon for soup be billy pitt who be major domo must trust with paul who be not best sailor in world have secured to seat to windward

table to receive supply paul having helped nearest to rose from chair that might see to fill plate on other side of tureen be leaning over centre of gravity being considerably beyond perpendicular when heavy sea struck vessel threw nearly on beam end pitching paul right over table to leeward with tureen did not forget to take with flew into jerry arm rolled together on floor content of tureen be rapidly deposited in open bosom of jerry who disengaged from embrace of enemy a fast a must amidst laughter of companion well asked for soup observed courtenay yes friend have helped very liberally replied jerry who be not at out of humour except when be foiled with own weapon in meantime paul who be little stunned with blow have received on head have continued on floor rolling in pea soup be just attempting to get on leg have got to yourself there mr paul a seem to like perhaps must prefer spoon said jerry offering one at same time say paul what capital harlequin must make observed peter paul who have recovered leg now clung on by table looked answer horribly asquint a if did not admire joke resumed seat at table remainder of dinner be brought down without further accident occurring by time be over a bottle have to be passed round everybody be obliged to drink off immediately put wine glass inside waistcoat to save from perdition be very merry happy before repast have be concluded there said jerry stroking down when have finished cheese a if be falstaff kitten might play with now more than one dare do with rejoined peter for be cursedly inclined to shoot cat a second

hatch be battened down fore aft port be knocked out to allow escape of water poured over in such volume a must otherwise have swamped vessel courtenay crew remained on deck until dawn of day when violence of gale seemed to have abated courtenay desired seymour jerry to turn in relieve at eight o'clock hero jerry went down into cabin where found two passenger who although have not come on deck during night have not retired to bed peter be sitting up to windward on locker looking very pale very sea sick paul be on cabin floor with one hand holding on by leg of table bottle of brandy in other prayer book have abandoned during fright be washing about in lee scupper jerry be delighted put on rueful face well observed paul who be nearly frightened out of wit how be now worse worse replied jerry there be nine inch water in well oh god cried paul who be not very au fait at nautical technicality raising one eye up to heaven while other appeared to rest upon bottle of brandy why turn in said jerry can go to bottom just a comfortably in bed a anywhere else agree with replied peter who have often be at sea knew very well that be right by two midshipman coming off deck mother prophesied that never must die in bed be determined will have better turn in mr paul said kindly will ring for steward billy pitt made appearance by gad gentleman damned schooner under water under water cried paul with dismay bottle be applied to mouth a if be determined to leave a little room a possible for element expected instantaneously to be struggling in with assistance of billy paul be placed in one of standing bed place at side of cabin jerry put brandy bottle at side of pillow kindly informing that must have opportunity of taking few more swig before went down for water be only up to bend at present peter be already in cot next to seymour jerry turned in without taking off clothes in courtenay bed on other side of cabin before have fallen asleep heard paul cry out peter peter well what do want do think there be hope peter who wished to frighten companion replied gravely be afraid not paul have just be reflecting upon subject here be two men considerably on wrong side of forty have enjoyed youth be happiest period of life be now fast descending hill to old age decrepitude disease what avail few more year allowing that be spared time perceive comfort of observation paul groaned made answer even creaking of timber must not disguise repeated cleck cleck cleck a brandy from bottle gurgled down throat chapter thirty three two stripling lad more like to run than to commit such slaughter cymbeline gale of wind in tropical climate be violent while last be seldom of long duration such be case in present instance for subsided in few hour after daylight schooner have be propelled before be now sheltered under lee of island of st domingo with canvas spread be gliding through tranquil sea again be collected round dinner table to more quiet repast than have hitherto enjoyed since have come on board paul have not quite recovered spirit although when went on deck just before dinner be announced be delighted at sudden change have taken place mirth of companion at expense be not received in very good part after dinner finding in better humour turned to peter addressed say peter made answer to remark last night when expected to go down have since have time deliberately to weigh argument must like to explain to where comfort be that so strenuously pointed out for hang if can discover seymour again have charge of first watch notwithstanding that order for prisoner to remain below after dark have be communicated to observed that on one pretence other occasionally came on deck repeatedly put head above hatchway conduct reminded of conversation have overheard again be subject of thought captain m have one day observed to that if there be duty going on must not employ in more useful manner when be walking deck than by placing ship in difficult situation reflecting upon most eligible mean of relief depend upon observed captain m time will come when will find of use to will create for presence of mind in sudden dilemma may be salvation of ship be in seymour remembering injunction reflected upon what must be most advisable step to take in case of french prisoner attempting to recapture during watch on deck that there be six be very true at same time during night watch there be five english seaman officer of watch on deck must frenchman have boldness to attempt to regain possession of vessel there be doubt that if watch must be surprised hatch must be secured over below what must be step in case that ought to take such be cogitation of seymour when midnight be reported jerry be summoned to relieve deck did not do relying upon hero good nature until past one bell up came with ready apology really beg pardon dear fellow have not wink of sleep last night never mind jerry be not at sleepy have be thinking about french prisoner can not get conversation out of head why did not like when heard of replied jerry hope wo attempt in watch must not give much trouble to launch over quarter must skim away flying light ' like lady bonnet what must do jerry if perceived rushing aft to retake vessel inquired seymour who be aware of ready invention skim up rigging like lamplighter to be sure not that must be of much use if gained day except say few prayer before went astern well that be idea thought that if one have musket ammunition up there diversion might created in favour of below for prisoner have firearm very true replied jerry might puzzle not little now jerry suppose be to take precaution for like manoeuvre during watch will do harm if doe good suppose fetch two musket cartouch box from cabin will take one secure in fore cross tree do same at main for courtenay be too proud to keep armed watch jerry agreed to proposal brought up musket ammunition seymour gave stout fox to lash musket taking ascended rigging at same time be busy securing musket up down at head of lower mast when heard sudden rush upon deck beneath be dark though not so dark must distinguish what be going on perceived that thought have anticipated reality french be up roared man at wheel to rouse below a well a watch who be lying about deck to astonishment of youngster aloft a well a of men on deck not six about twenty frenchman armed with cutlass made appearance hatch be over secured in minute unarmed english on deck be then attacked by superior force be with agonised feeling that seymour jerry heard scuffle took place be short plunge after plunge into water alongside announced death of separate victim man at wheel struggled long be of athletic frame overpowered by number be launched over taffrail french supposing that remainder of crew be below placed sentry over hatch that might not be forced then collected together abaft altering course of vessel for st domingo will be necessary to explain sudden appearance of so many frenchman when captain of privateer be occupied during night previous to attack with several plan of defence also arranged one for recapture of vessel in case of being overpowered with in view have constructed platform in hold on tier of cask be stowed under there be sufficient space for fifteen twenty men to lie concealed when privateer men have be driven below hatch secured over fifteen armed with cutlass concealed in place with hope of recapturing vessel from prize master after must have parted company with frigate prisoner who have be sent on board to assist in navigating schooner to jamaica have communicated with unperceived after dark a english be fatigued from having be on deck during previous night middle watch be proposed for attempt have thus far be attended with success seymour jerry remained quiet at masthead for although did not attempt to communicate with other for fear of discovery rightly judged that must be best to remain till daylight by time plan must have be formed by party below situation must enable materially to assist nearly four hour elapsed previous to dawning of day during interval jerry have ample time to say of prayer spoke of be to be supposed that did not fail to offer up in perilous situation a soon a day began to break jerry who have not yet loaded musket lest might be heard thought time to prepare for action primed put in cartridge in ramming down of slight ringing of ramrod against muzzle attracted notice of one of frenchman who looking up after short time exclaimed diable c'est monsieur misere qui est la jerry levelled with steady aim bullet passed through broad chest of frenchman who rolled upon deck now may chant miserere cried youngster second shot from fore cross tree laid frenchman alongside of companion comment diable nous serons abimes par ce enfans la il faut monter musket be again loaded again boy brought down bird before frenchman must decide upon operation be case of necessity that youngster must be attacked be service of little danger of certain destruction to one who must fall sacrifice that other might be able to secure youngster before have time to reload musket two of most daring flew to main rigging one ascending to windward other to lee ward seymour who perceived intention reserved fire until saw one in weather rigging fall by jerry musket then levelled at one to leeward who dropped into lee chain from thence into sea thus have six frenchman already fallen by coolness determination of two boy one fourteen other not sixteen year old short consultation ended in frenchman resorting to only measure likely to be attended with success leaving three to guard hatchway remaining twelve divided into four party began to mount fore main rigging to windward to leeward at same time fate of jerry seymour now appeared to be decided might kill one man more then must have be hurled into sea during consultation seymour who anticipated movement have knife in pocket divided lanyard of lee topmast rigging running up weather side with musket ammunition a soon a have gained topmast cross tree hauled up lee rigging after thus gaining position must admit one person mounting up to at time called to jerry pointing out what have done that might do same unfortunately jerry have not knife must not contented with climbing up to topmast cross tree to be followed by two of frenchman jerry levelled musket passed bullet through skull of one of pursuer whose heavy fall on deck shook schooner fore aft then aware that nothing more must be done pitched musket overboard that might not gain possession of climbing with nimbleness suited to occasion up to masthead descended by top gallant stay to fore topmast cross tree joined seymour in presence of exasperated frenchman who now unable to reach of be at nonplus say monsieur catchee habbee cried jerry laughing putting hand to side from loss of breath must now acquaint reader with what be going on below surprise of courtenay when found hatch down deck in possession of french be removed when men who have be secured with stated that a lay in hammock have be awakened by large body of men running up hatchway now perceived that there must have be men concealed in hold of vessel struggle on deck splashing in water have be plainly heard below be aware of fate of shipmate did not expect to see daylight again until be handed up a prisoner in french port feeling of courtenay be not enviable upbraided for having by want of prudence lost vessel sacrificed life of two midshipman five seaman who have watch on deck party below consisted of courtenay peter paul billy pitt five seaman consultation be held a to proceeding to regain vessel avenge death of shipmate to perish in attempt be determination of lieutenant be aware that french have firearm amply supplied a be must have cared little for number if once on deck how to get on deck be problem to set fire to vessel rush up in flame to scuttle to blow up go down together be proposed agitated peter plan be considered a most feasible suggested that one half of cabin table be divided in two must be placed upon other so a to raise up to coaming of skylight hatch on upper table to place pound two of powder from ascending principle of explosion must blow off skylight grating without injuring vessel below then with musket loaded bayonet fixed to jump on table from thence if possible gain deck be agreed to preparation be well forward when report of jerry musket be heard succeeded be perplexed have frenchman firearm if so what must be firing at falling of body on deck indistinct curse of frenchman puzzled even more what can be observed courtenay recollect now said paul a lay awake saw young devil skin pas bed with musket wondered what be for then probably have gained rigging with be safe cried courtenay intuitively be quick where be powder take that candle further off train be laid a musket continued to be discharged removed from cabin be fired skylight be blown up killing frenchman who guarded hatchway at very moment that frenchman be in rigging puzzled with manoeuvre of seymour escape of jerry courtenay party rushed into cabin mounted table be on deck before smoke have cleared away frenchman who have not have time to descend rigging be at mercy mercy be not entitled to have shown none to unarmed english whom have wantonly thrown into sea when have overpowered be now thirsting for blood of two boy mercy be shown to a dropped one by one from rigging wounded dead be tossed into wave a expiatory sacrifice to mane of murdered englishman in few minute carnage be over seymour jerry descended from little fortalice aloft be warmly greeted by friend a reached deck really mr paul said jerry shaking proffered hand be quite unexpected pleasure well never thought that must possibly like answered other well observed jerry have quite stopped growth not tongue hope replied peter must be pity now explain to how happened jerry entered into detail with accustomed humour while courtenay walked aft with seymour to have more sober narrative of transaction have described afforded ample matter for conversation until prize be brought to anchor in port royal harbour where courtenay crew be ordered passage to barbadoes in frigate have order to proceed there in few day mr peter capon mr paul contract went on shore declaring that until mail coach ran between there england must never leave island again subject to charming vicissitude of seafaring existence chapter thirty four for execution of form observance ceremony subordination like even though while compels obedience may get privately laughed at commend to governor don fabricio humour of madrid in few day courtenay with prize crew of aspasia sailed for barbadoes in frigate have be ordered to receive for passage frigate be commanded by one of most singular character in service be clever man thorough sailor well acquainted with detail technicality of profession spirited enterprising officer of most arbitrary disposition so well be acquainted with regulation of service that must hedge in so a to insure compliance with most preposterous order draw officer who resisted into premunire must risk commission in profession where one man be embarked with many isolated from power whence derives own where fiat must be received without murmur by hundred who can reason a well a be absolutely requisite that must be invested with authority amounting to despotism true be that be held responsible to superior for undue exercise of authority amongst so many to whom be confided there must be who from disposition bad example of under whom have served will not adhere to limit have be prescribed however be reason for reducing authority a govern wholly by opinion be necessary for discipline upholds service be strong reason for not delegating to who be not fit to be intrusted captain bradshaw have many redeeming quality oppressor a be admired spirit of resistance in officer when be shown in just cause upon reflection be invariably friend for felt that own natural temperament be increased by abject obedience raynal think be have said that pride of men in office arises a much from servility of inferior expectants a from other cause in service be inferior expectants can then be surprising that captain occasionally becomes tyrannical captain bradshaw be not naturally tyrannical have become so because promoted at early age have never be afterwards opposed one contradicted one applauded joke magnified mirth into wit must try by court martial officer who have committed slight error on same day must open purse extend patronage to whom knew not have be informed that be deserving have friend to seaman be a lavish with money a be with cat must give man new jacket one day cut to piece on back with rope end on next yet be not exactly inconsistency be eccentricity of character not natural created by service graft be of worse quality than parent stock fruit be compound of two sailor who be of most forgiving temper in world will pardon hundred fault for one redeeming quality declared that war bad captain after violent tyrannical disposition made constantly at variance with officer continual change took place in ship be observed that who have left from spirited resistance be kindly received benefited by patronage while who submitted be neglected like pretty clever woman who be aware that flattery be to be despised yet from habit can not exist without so captain bradshaw exacted servility have be accustomed to yet rewarded not by whom be administered midshipman promoted on station have to pas through ordeal of sailing with captain bradshaw who generally have vacancy certainly have good effect upon young men who be inclined to presume upon newly acquired rank for be well schooled before quitted ship when courtenay party went on board of frigate first lieutenant master surgeon indignant at language have be used to by captain refused to dine in cabin when be invited by steward who reported to captain bradshaw that officer must not accept invitation wo by god will see to send clerk here

anything rejoined master there be old proverb may lead horse to pond ca make drink ' do replied robert first lieutenant must act in concert have be long enough in service to know that must obey first remonstrate afterwards that be unusual order grant do know by what regulation of service can be enforced at same time consider that run great risk in refusing to obey only observe in preamble how artfully insert appearance of conspiracy tending to bring into contempt again for better discipline of majesty service must invariably suffer when there be appearance of want of cordiality between to whom men must look for example ' upon soul be devilish clever do believe 'd find out reason for drawing out double teeth if be inclined prove be for benefit of majesty service well now what be to be done why what be opinion robert oh mine be to go if will act with wo allow to dine with second time well then agree replied surgeon so must then presume by heaven downright tyranny oppression never

among upon point of service taking notice of captain master in explanation drew chart with wine upon polished table while first lieutenant defended opinion with piece of biscuit laid at different position during two more glass be demolished captain rang ordered coffee in angry tone when officer have taken bowed stiffly wished good evening there be one dish be object of abhorrence to captain bradshaw first lieutenant aware of a rose to depart said captain bradshaw if be not too great liberty must like to have tripe to morrow be three very partial to so be rejoined jerry captain bradshaw

coffee too sir said jerry trying to escape have not have chasse cafe can not permit to leave cabin without steward desire boatswain mate to bring cat quarter master to come here with seizing jerry be now in stew inflexible countenance of captain bradshaw showed that be in earnest however held tongue until operator appeared hoping that captain must think better of seize young gentleman up to breach of gun quarter master will oblige sir by letting know offence sir belong to ship continued jerry if have done wrong captain m be well known to be strict officer will pay attention to complaint will

with scorn why if cut to piece turn out of service afterwards will call paltry coward own conscience when be able to reflect will tell same captain bradshaw started back with astonishment at such unheard of language from midshipman be pleased with undaunted spirit of boy perhaps felt truth of observation at event saved jerry after short pause captain said cast loose observe sir never let see face again while be in ship other part of if can help replied jerry buttoning up clothes making precipitate escape by cabin door chapter thirty five air more be vital now did mortal poison grow lung

carlisle bay until three week after arrival of frigate brought up courtenay prize crew have not be idle having three valuable prize have captured in company courtenay immediately repaired on board of ship to report to captain circumstance have occurred connected with loss of five men be too honourable to attempt to disguise palliate fact on contrary laid blame upon enhanced merit of two midshipman captain m who admired ingenuous confession contented with observing that trusted must be caution to during future career in service to seymour jerry said nothing a be afraid that latter must presume upon commendation treasured up conduct in memory determined to lose opportunity might offer to reward courtenay descended to gun room where be warmly greeted by messmate who crowded round to listen to detail of attempt to recapture well observed price appears have have narrow chance of losing messmate narrow chance lose two sar replied billy pitt forgit sar on board schooner oh billy be there how

courtenay snuffing vile habit wish must leave off so do messmate replied surgeon can not imagine what pleasure there can be in practice in so nasty independent of destruction of olfactory power be exactly for reason take snuff be convinced that be gainer by loss of power of smell consider ungrateful if not wicked to say so replied surgeon gravely sens be given to a source of enjoyment true doctor answered courtenay mimicking language of macallan if be savage in wood there must not be sense more valuable affording so much gratification a one in question must rise with sun inhale fragrance of shrub flower offered up in grateful incense to creator must stretch under branch of forest tree a evening closed enjoy faint perfume with wooed descending moisture after exhaustion from

native attempting to avert present anticipated calamity by devoting child to propitiate deity on certain day assembled in boat with victim attended by priest music decorated with flower gaiety of

collected at spot where immolation took place blood curdles now when think of cry of native shouting encouraging of priest deafening noise of tom tom mixed with piercing harsh music of country hurling tossing of poor little infant into water splashing contention of ravenous creature a tore limb from limb within few foot of unnatural parent whole sea tinged with blood strewed with flower very

of bile in young lady in mamma who did not bring to cheltenham merely to drink water gentleman moreover did not admire being so totally eclipsed by mr rainscourt who rendered insignificant what previous to appearance have be considered to be quite thing lady must talk of nothing mr rainscourt equipage handsome man too on whole female be most annoyed a there threatened to be stagnation in market until said heiress be disposed of gentleman who have be attentive more than week who have be asked twice to dinner who have be considered to have nibbled sufficient time to ensure eventually

author a well a aspasia have most decidedly doubled cape frigate be standing course before light breeze at rate of four five knot hour captain m be standing at break of gangway talking with first lieutenant when man stationed at mast head called out rock on lee bow telemaque shoal be supposed to exist somewhere to southward of cape whose situation have never be ascertained have just before be subject of conversation startled at intelligence captain m ordered studding sail to be taken in hailing man at mast head inquired how far rock be distant from ship can see off fore yard answered pearce master who have immediately ascended rigging upon report first lieutenant now went aloft soon brought down to lower ratline in few minute be distinctly seen from deck of frigate ship course be altered three four point risk might be incurred captain m directing people aloft to keep sharp look out for change in colour of water continued to near supposed danger in slanting direction rock appeared to be about six seven foot above water edge with base of four five foot in diameter to great surprise of party there be apparent change in colour to indicate that shoaled water be not until hove to within two cable length cutter be ordered to be cleared away to examine that perceived that object of scrutiny be in motion be now evident in direction crossing stern of ship think that be

enormous spongy excrescence have appearance of rock be so buoyant that although animal made several attempt a approached ship must not sink under water captain m satisfied that really be a have described again made sail pursued course be very strange very important observed that disease of description can scarcely be confined to one individual must pervade whole specie circumstance may account for many rock reported to have be seen in various part of southern hemisphere have never be afterwards fallen in with more complete deception never witnessed have hauled off sooner not have examined must have have hesitation in asserting most confidently that have seen rock answered first lieutenant captain m went below be soon after at table with first lieutenant macallan who have be invited to dine in cabin after dinner subject be again introduced have doubt sir observed first lieutenant whether will ever venture to tell story in england never must be believed le vrai n'est pa toujours le vraisemblable answered captain m be afraid that too often great illiberality be shown towards traveller who after having encountered great difficulty danger have mortification not to be credited upon return although credulity be to be guarded against know greater proof of ignorance than refusing to believe anything because doe not exactly coincide with one own idea more confined may be from want of education knowledge more incredulous people be apt to become two of most enterprising traveller of modern day bruce le vaillant be ridiculed discredited upon return subsequent traveller who went same track a former with view to confute be obliged to corroborate assertion who have followed latter have acknowledged correctness of statement observation remind of story of old woman grandson replied first lieutenant recollect presume indeed said captain m pray favour with first lieutenant then narrated with considerable degree of following story lad who have be year at sea returned home to aged grandmother who be naturally curious to hear adventure now jack ' said old woman tell have seen tell most wonderful thing first well granny when be in red sea anchored close to shore when hove anchor up there be chariot wheel hanging to ' oh jack pharaoh host be drowned in red sea know prof bible be true well jack what else did see ' why granny when be in west indie saw whole mountain of sugar river between be rum true true said old woman smacking lip get sugar rum from there know pray jack did ever see mermaid why mother have seen merman well let hear jack why mother when anchored to northward of st kitt one sunday morning voice called from alongside when looked over there be merman just come to top of water stroked down hair touched a do hat to captain told that must feel much obliged to to trip anchor a have be let go just before door of house below must not open in consequence wife must be too late to go to church ' god bless ' say old woman why be christian do declare now jack tell something more jack whose invention be probably exhausted then told that have seen hundred of fish flying in air come come jack ' said old woman now be bamming attempt to put such story off on old granny chariot wheel can believe because be likely sugar rum know to be true also merman for have seen picture of a for fish flying in air jack be lie excellent said captain m then only part be true rejected believing monstrous lie that have coined if unknown individual observed macallan not captain cook have reported existence of such animal a ornithorhynchus duck billed platypus without bringing home specimen a proof who must have credited statement one replied captain m still such be scepticism of present age that traveller must be content with having justice done to after be dead that be cold comfort sir replied first lieutenant rising from table movement be immediately followed by remainder of guest who bowed quitted cabin note be singular that almost incredible story in above chapter be perhaps only real fact in whole book will be found in log of ship signed by officer yet many of reader will be inclined to reject believe considerable portion of remainder of composition to have be drawn from living character if so will be like old woman chapter fifty cym guiderius have upon neck mole sanguine star bel be who hath upon still that stamp shakespeare when mr rainscourt left cheltenham wrote hasty note to mcelvinas requesting that must take charge of emily whose presence must be necessary at hall when have arranged own affair must bring with over to ireland where be intention to reside for time few day after rainscourt have quitted cheltenham emily who since mother death have remained with mcelvinas be accompanied by to home for first time returned to with regret may be inquired by reader whether rainscourt be not harassed by conscience never heard that showed outward sign conscience have be described a most importunate monitor paying respect to person making coward of now a far a have be able to judge from external evidence there be not greater courtier than conscience be true that when in adversity upbraids hold up catalogue of crime so close to nose that can not help reading line be true that when suffering with disease terrified with idea of going know not where assails enfeebled mind body scare away little resolution have left in heydey of youth in vigour of health with mean of administering to folly adding daily hourly to crime never mention hell to ear polite in fact never attack man who have more than ten thousand year like london tradesman never present bill a long a give fresh order will increase once prove to be cleaned out by longer swelling amount pounce upon demand post obit bond upon next world like others will probably be found very disagreeable inconvenient to liquidate conscience therefore be not honest sturdy adviser sneaking scoundrel who allows to run into debt never caring to tell a caution rather concealing bill from a long a there be chance of increasing length satisfied that eventually must be paid in shape other mcelvinas who must not leave emily by took up abode at hall until necessary arrangement have be completed then removed with to cottage that might attend to own affair emily be deeply affected at loss of mother have always be kind indulgent friend who have treated her more a equal than a one subject to authority control mcelvinas be anxious to remove emily from hall where object presented formed link of association with loss trifle in must occasion fresh burst of grief from affectionate sorrowful girl may be pardoned when state perhaps bitterest tear be shed be when threw on sofa where have remained after abrupt departure of william seymour vicar hastened to offer condolence finding that emily be a resigned a must be expected after long visit walked out with mcelvina that might have more detailed account of unfortunate event mcelvina related circumstantially without communicating suspicion story of groom have occasioned for be aware that vicar be too charitable to allow anything positive evidence to be of weight in accusation so degrading to human nature be strange observed vicar very gravely seems a if fatality attended possessor of splendid estate death of admiral de courcy be under most painful circumstance without friend relation to close eye be followed by of immediate heir who be drowned a soon almost a property devolved to who be appointed to be guardian never beheld charge now have violent death of possessor within space of twelve thirteen year have probably heard something of singular history of former heir to estate heard state that be drowned at sea nothing further rather supposed to be for never have proof positive be sent away in prize never be heard of although there be confirmation of fact have doubt be lost know when be so much distressed a at death of child there be peculiarity of incident in history fact of have not a yet communicated to one a there be certain point even distant branch of family may wish to keep concealed yet upon promise of secrecy mr mcelvina will impart to promise being given vicar commenced with history of admiral de courcy treatment of wife child unfortunate marriage more unfortunate demise of edward peter rather of edward de courcy acknowledgment of grandson by admiral de courcy on death bed account of adam death boy being sent away in prize drowned at sea have particular in writing continued good man necessary document identity be easy to be proved by mark of broad arrow imprinted on shoulder by old adam heaven be possible exclaimed mcelvina grasping arm of vicar what do mean mean mean that boy be alive have be in company within last two year that boy yes boy boy be william seymour merciful god how inscrutable be thy way exclaimed vicar with astonishment reverence explain to dear sir how can establish assertion if reader will refer back to circumstance of vicar calling upon captain m will observe upon being made acquainted with loss of child be so much shocked that withdrew without imparting particular to one who be perfect stranger on other hand captain m when seymour again made appearance after interval of three year not having be put in possession of fact even knowing vicar address name have mean of communicating intelligence of boy recovery must now sir said mcelvina to vicar return confidence have placed in under same promise of secrecy by making acquainted with particular of former life at acknowledge have reason to blush nothing interest of william seymour must have induced to disclose mcelvina then acknowledged having formerly be engaged in smuggling picking up boy from wreck care of for three year capture of vessel by captain m circumstance have induced captain m to take boy under protection mark be a legible a ever there must be doubt of identity being satisfactorily established vicar listened to narration with interest deserved acknowledged conviction of clearness of evidence by observing will be heavy blow to dear emily not very heavy one imagine replied mcelvina who immediately relieved mind of worthy man by communicating attachment between honourable behaviour of seymour how very strange be replied vicar really must be good subject for novel only trust that like invention of kind may end a happily trust so too let now consider what must be done must advise being sent for immediately so must expect from last account received from that ship will have left station to return home before letter can arrive there plan be to keep quiet until return fact be known can be established by alone let immediately take such precaution a legal adviser think requisite that proof may not be wanting in case of sudden demise must not act until arrives in country for mr rainscourt be difficult dangerous person to deal with be right replied vicar when do leave house for ireland in few day will be ready to appear moment that hear of ship arrival in meantime will make necessary affidavit in case of accident mcelvina vicar separated mcelvina like dutiful husband communicated joyful intelligence to wife wife to soothe emily under affliction although kept secret now talked of seymour in few day arrangement be made cottage be put into agent hand to be disposed of quitting with abode in have passed year of unalloyed happiness set off for galway where found rainscourt on arrival consigning daughter to care removed to own house be on property mcelvina have purchased about four mile distant from castle mcelvina name be passport to heart of tenant who declared that head of house have come unto own again that have true eye of mcelvinas there be mistaking for other family have eye that honour have gladdened heart by seeing property into ould family again a ould one a in ould ireland mcelvina like wise man held tongue then talked of misfortune of bad potato crop of arrears of rent one demand be heaped upon until mcelvina be ultimately obliged to refer to agent whom requested to be a lenient a possible emily be now reinstated in castle where have passed first year of existence found that in be new except old nurse norah contiguity of mcelvinas be source of comfort to for must not admire dissipated companion of father life be solitary have

unworthy motif remark wish to make most certainly not a be persuaded that will never make observation inconsistent with duty infringing upon rule of service then sir with due submission to do think be

danger presented frowned upon a if in defiance chapter fifty three universal cry resounds aloud sailor run in heap helpless crowd art fails courage fall succour near a many wave a many death appear ovid dryden translation however may be inclined to extend admiration to feeling of self devotion governed conduct of captain m can not be matter of surprise that officer of frigate did not coincide with total indifference to self in discharge of duty murmur did not looked at other at captain at perilous situation of vessel in silence with restless change of position that indicated anxiety macallan be below attending to wounded men must probably have be deputed by others to have remonstrated with captain few minute more have elapsed when master again addressed be afraid sir if continue to stand on will lose frigate said respectfully touching hat be so replied captain m enemy will lose line of battle ship country will be gainer when account be balanced must be permitted to doubt that value of enemy ship be certainly greater there be other consideration what be value of respective officer ship company must inevitably share fate of two vessel captain of ship be not worth salt must be politic to let live continue to command ship will always be ours when want in event of general action must make gap in enemy line might prove of greatest importance now sir without drawing parallel further without taking into consideration value of respective officer men must take liberty of observing that on account alone england will be gainer by loss of vessel crew thank for compliment a be
