chapter will now repeat have idea of putting boy to school mr easy mr easy crossed leg clasped hand together over knee a always did when be about to commence argument great objection have to sending boy to school dr middleton be that conceive that discipline enforced be not only contrary to right of man also in opposition to sound sense common judgment not content with punishment be in erroneous infringement of social justice even degrade mind of boy still more by applying punishment to most degraded part adding contumely to tyranny of course be intended that boy who be sent to school must gain by precept example be to learn benevolence by angry look flourish of vindictive birch forbearance by cruelty of usher patience when master over be out of patience modesty when nether part be exposed to general examination be not daily reading lesson at variance with equality posse of be unjustly deprived why must there be distinction between flogger floggee be not fashioned alike after god image endowed with same reason having equal right to what world offer be intended by providence to be equally distributed be not that sacred inheritance of have tyrannously impiously be ravished from many for benefit of few ravishment from long custom of iniquity inculcation of false precept have too long be basely submitted to be not duty of father to preserve only son from imbibing dangerous debasing error will render only one of vile herd who be content to suffer provided that live yet be not very error inculcated at school impressed upon mind inversely by birch there receive first lesson in slavery with first lesson in b c be not mind thereby prostrated so a never to rise again ever to bow to despotism to cringe to rank to think act by precept of others to tacitly disavow that sacred equality be birthright sir without can teach without resorting to fundamental error a flogging boy will never go to school mr easy threw back in chair imagining like philosopher that have said something very clever dr middleton knew man therefore patiently waited until have exhausted oratory will grant said doctor at last that say may have great truth in mr easy do not think that by not permitting boy to be educated allow to remain more open to very error of speak be only education will conquer prejudice enable man to break through trammel of custom now allowing that birch be used yet be at period when young mind be so elastic a to soon become indifferent after have attained usual rudiment of education will then find prepared to receive lesson can yourself instil will teach everything replied mr easy folding arm consequentially determinedly doubt capability mr easy unfortunately will always have difficulty never can get over excuse know what be capable of boy must indeed be happy with preceptor if must speak plain must be aware a well a be that maternal fondness of mr easy will always be bar to intention be already so spoiled by that will not obey without obedience can not inculcate grant dear sir that there be difficulty on point maternal weakness must then be overcome by paternal severity may ask how mr easy for appears to impossible impossible by heaven will make will here mr easy stopped before word flog be fairly out of mouth will know reason why dr middleton dr middleton checked inclination to laugh replied that must hit upon scheme by must obtain necessary power over have doubt what will be consequence boy will consider mother a protector a tyrant will have aversion to with aversion will never pay respect attention to valuable precept when arrives at age to understand now appears to that difficulty have raised may be got over know very worthy clergyman who doe not use birch will write put direct question to then if boy be removed from danger arising from mr easy overindulgence in short time will be ready for more important tuition think replied mr easy after pause that what say merit consideration acknowledge that in consequence of mr easy nonsensical indulgence boy be unruly will not obey at present if friend doe not apply rod will think seriously of sending son john to to learn element doctor have gained point by flattering philosopher in day returned with letter from pedagogue in answer to one supposed to be sent to in use of birch be indignantly disclaimed mr easy announced to wife when met that day at

be conducted to bed although be six o'clock be not only in pain idea be confused wonder after life having be humoured indulged never punished until day before after caress of mother sarah never knew value of after stuffing day long being tempted to eat till turned away in satiety to find without mother without sarah without supper covered with wheal what be worse than without own way wonder johnny be confused at same time that be subdued a mr bonnycastle have truly told have more than have idea of must mr easy have said have known sarah too mr easy with right of man at very time that johnny be having devil driven out of be consoling with idea at event there be birch used at mr bonnycastle quite losing sight of fact that a there be more way of killing dog besides hanging so be there more way of teaching than posterior happy in ignorance went fast asleep little dreaming that johnny be already so far advanced in knowledge a to have tolerable comprehension of mystery of cane a for johnny have cried to sleep at least six hour before chapter vi in jack make essay of father sublime philosophy arrives very near to truth at last next morning master jack easy be not only very sore very hungry a mr bonnycastle informed that must not only have plenty of cane also breakfast if did not learn letter johnny have wisdom enough to say whole alphabet for received great deal of praise if did not duly appreciate at event infinitely preferred to beating mr bonnycastle perceived that have conquered boy by one hour well timed severity therefore handed over to usher in school a be equally empowered to administer needful impulse johnny very soon became very tractable boy may be imagined that absence of johnny be severely felt at home such be not case in first place dr middleton have pointed out to mr easy that there be flogging at school that punishment received by johnny from father must very likely be repeated in next although mr easy thought that never must have survived parting with own son soon found out that be much happier without spoilt child be always source of anxiety worry after johnny departure mr easy found quiet repose much more suited to disposition gradually weaned from satisfied with seeing occasionally hearing report of dr middleton at last be quite reconciled to being at school not coming back except during holiday john easy made great progress have good natural ability mr easy rubbed hand when saw doctor saying yes let have for year two longer then will finish vacation have attempted to instil into johnny mind equal right of man johnny appeared to pay little attention to father discourse evidently showed that be not altogether thrown away a helped to everything wanted without asking leave thus be hero educated until arrived at age of sixteen when be stout good looking boy with plenty to say for indeed when suited purpose must out talk father nothing pleased mr easy so much a jack loquacity be right argue point jack argue point boy must say a jack disputed with mother then must turn to doctor rubbing hand observe depend upon jack will be great very great man then must call jack give guinea for cleverness at last jack thought very clever thing to argue never must attempt to argue with mr bonnycastle because be aware that mr bonnycastle argument be too strong for argued with boy until ended in fight decided point sometimes argued with usher in short at time now speak of be at breaking up of midsummer holiday jack be a full of argument a be fond of must argue point to point of needle must divide that point into a many a there be day of year argue upon in short there be end to jack arguing point although there seldom be point to argument jack have be fishing in river without success for whole morning observed large pond have appearance of being well stocked cleared park paling threw in line have pulled up several fine fish when be accosted by proprietor accompanied by couple of keeper may request pleasure of name young gentleman said proprietor to jack now jack be always urbane polite certainly sir name be easy very much at service appear to to be taking very easy replied gentleman pray sir may enquire whether be aware that be trespassing word trespass dear sir replied jack will admit of much argument will divide into three head implies according to conventional meaning coming without permission upon land property of now sir question may be resolved in following be not world made for have one portion of inhabitant exclusive right to claim part of a property if please have laid down proposition will now argue point gentleman who accosted jack have heard of mr easy argument be humorist more inclined to laugh than to be angry at same time that considered necessary to show jack that under existing circumstance be not tenable mr easy allowing trespass on property to be venial surely mean to say that be justified in taking fish bought fish stocked pond have fed ever since can not deny that be private property to take be theft will again admit of much ratiocination dear sir replied jack beg pardon have fish jack pulled up large carp much to indignation of keeper to amusement of master unhooked placed in basket renewed bait with greatest sang then throwing in line resumed discourse a be observing dear sir continued jack will admit of much ratiocination creature of earth be given to man for use man mean mankind be never intended to be made monopoly of water be also gift of heaven meant for use of now come to question how far fish be property if fish only bred on purpose to please make present of stock might then require different line of argument a in breeding only acted in obedience to instinct with be endowed on purpose that may supply man submit to that can not prove fish to be yours more than mine a for feeding with idea that be own be not unusual case in world even when man be giving bread butter to child further have bite beg pardon dear sir ah be off again then mr easy mean to say that world content be made for exactly sir be father opinion who be very great philosopher how then doe father account for possessing property others being without because who be strongest have deprived who be weaker must not that be always case even if be in state of general inheritance have supposed for instance allowing two men to chase same animal to come up to at same time must not strongest bear off grant that sir well then where be equality doe not disprove that men be not intended to be equal only prof that be not so neither doe disprove that everything be not made for benefit of only prof that strong will take advantage of weak be very natural oh grant that to be very natural well mr easy be glad to perceive that be of one mind trust will continue so will observe keeper being three be strong party in instance admitting argument that fish be a much yours a mine still take advantage of strength to repossess of be a say very natural james take fish if please interrupted jack will argue point not at will act according to own argument have fish now mean to have more that fishing rod be a much mine a yours being stronger party will take possession of james william take that fishing rod be ours presume will first allow to observe replied jack that although have expressed opinion that earth animal on be made for never yet have asserted that what man creates by have created for for consideration be not own property beg pardon tree that rod be made from be made for if one for have thought proper to make into rod be more fault than be have be feeding fish with supposition that be own everything being common being natural that strong must take advantage of weak must take rod a property until be dispossessed by one more powerful moreover being stronger party having possession of land say doe not belong to more than to also will direct keeper to see off property james take rod see mr easy over park paling mr easy wish good morning sir beg pardon have not yet heard argument replied jack who did not approve of conclusion drawn have time to hear more mr easy wish good morning proprietor departed leaving jack in company with keeper will trouble for rod master said william james be very busy stringing fish through gill upon piece of osier at event will hear reason said jack have argument never heard good argument in favour of poaching interrupted keeper be insolent fellow replied jack be by paying such vagabond a that people be able to be guilty of injustice be by paying that land poached if there be excuse for poor devil who be out of work there be none for who call gentleman according to account a be equal be no more gentleman than be silence blackguard will not condescend to argue with such a if did must prove that be set of base slave who have just a much right to property a master have a have dare say master a have scoundrel pond be a much property so be fish in a be of master who have usurped right say james what do say will put young gentleman in possession of property said william winking to other james took hint seized jack by arm leg soused into pond jack arose after deep submersion floundered on shore blowing spluttering in meantime keeper have walked away carrying with rod line fish tin can of bait laughing loudly at practical joke have played hero well thought jack there must be mistake in father philosophy else be very wicked world will submit case to father jack received reply have told before jack that important truth will not at present be admitted doe not le follow that be true be age of iron in might have become right time will come when truth will be admitted father name will be more celebrated than of philosopher of ancient day recollect jack although in preaching against wrong advocating right of man will be treated a martyr be still duty to persevere if be dragged through horse pond in kingdom never give up argument that never will sir replied jack next time argue will be if possible with power on side at event not quite so near pond think said mr easy who have be silent listener that jack have better fish in river then if catch fish at event will not be soused in water spoil clothes mr easy be philosopher few day afterwards jack discovered one fine morning on other side of hedge summer apple tree bearing tempting fruit immediately broke through hedge climbing tree a first mother did before culled fairest did eat say sir what be doing there cried rough voice jack looked down perceived stout thickset personage in grey coat red waistcoat standing underneath see what be about replied jack be eating apple will throw down few thank kindly fewer be pulled better perhaps a be so free to give to others a well a to help may think that be own property not bit more property than be yours good man guess be something like truth be not quite at truth yet lad apple be mine will trouble to come down a fast a please when be down can then settle account continued man shaking cudgel depend upon will have receipt in full jack did not much like appearance of thing good man said be quite prejudice on part to imagine that apple be not given a well a other fruit for benefit of be common property believe be matter of opinion lad may be allowed to have own will find in bible say jack never did yet have read through through bating pocryfar then said jack go home fetch bible will prove to suspect will not wait till come back again have lost plenty of apple have long wanted to find robber out now have caught one will take care that becape without apple sauce at event so come down young thief come down directly will be worse for thank said jack be very well here will if please argue point from where be have time to argue point lad have plenty to do think will let off if choose to come down why then may stay there will answer for a soon a work be done will find safe enough what can be done thought jack with man who will not listen to argument what world be however will not find here when come back have notion in jack be mistaken farmer walked to hedge called to boy who took order ran to farmhouse in minute two large bull dog be seen bounding along orchard to master mark caesar said farmer to dog mark dog crouched down on grass with head up eye glaring at jack showing range of teeth drove hero philosophy out of head ca wait here caesar can will tell a friend that if get hold of will not leave limb of together when work done will come back so saying farmer walked off leaving jack dog to argue point if so inclined what sad jade must philosophy be to put votary in such predicament after while dog laid head down closed eye a if asleep jack observed that at least movement on part one eye be seen partially to unclose so jack like prudent man resolved to remain where be picked few more apple for be dinner time a chewed ruminated jack have be few minute ruminating before be interrupted by ruminating animal le personage than bull who have be turned out with full possession of orchard who now advanced bellowing occasionally tossing head at sight of caesar whom considered a much trespasser a master have hero caesar started on leg faced bull who advanced pawing with tail up in air when within few yard bull made rush at dog who evaded attacked in return thus did warfare continue until opponent be already at distance from apple tree jack prepared for immediate flight unfortunately combat be carried on by side of hedge at jack have gained admission never mind thought jack there be two side to field although other hedge joined on to garden near to farmhouse there be option at event said jack will try jack be slipping down trunk when heard tremendous roar bull dog have be tossed by bull be then high in air jack saw fall on other side of hedge bull be thus celebrating victory with flourish of trumpet upon jack perceiving that be relieved from sentry slipped down rest of tree took to heel unfortunately for jack bull saw flushed with victory immediately set up roar bounded after jack jack perceived danger fear gave wing not only flew over orchard flew over hedge be about five foot high just a bull drove head into look before leap be old proverb have jack done so must have done better a there be cogent reason to be offered in extenuation of philosopher will say no more merely state that jack when got to other side of hedge found that have pitched into small apiary have upset two hive of bee who resented intrusion jack have hardly time to get upon leg before found very busy stinging in quarter jack must do be to run for bee flew faster than must run jack be mad with pain when stumbled half blinded over brickwork of well jack must not stop pitching into well seized iron chain a struck across face down went jack round went windlass after rapid descent of forty foot hero found under water longer troubled with bee who whether have lost scent of prey from rapid descent being notoriously clever insect acknowledged truth of adage leave well alone have certainly left jack with other companion than truth jack rose from immersion seized rope to chain of bucket be made fast have of be unwound from windlass therefore enabled jack to keep head above water after few second jack felt something against leg be bucket about two foot under water jack put foot into found pretty comfortable for water after sting of bee heat have be put into by race with bull be quite cool refreshing at event thought jack if have not be for bull must have be watched by dog then thrashed by farmer then again if have not be for bull must not have tumbled among bee if have not be for bee must not have tumbled into well if have not be for chain must have be drowned such have be chain of event because wanted to eat apple however have got rid of farmer dog bull bee well that end well how devil be to get out of well creation appears to have conspired against right of man a father said be iron age here be swinging to iron chain have given whole of jack soliloquy a will prove jack be fool although be bit of philosopher man who must reason so well upon cause ant effect at bottom of well up to neck in water showed good deal of presence of mind if jack mind have be little twisted by father philosophy have still sufficient strength elasticity to recover in due time have jack be common personage must never have selected for hero chapter vii in jack make very sage reflection come to very unwise decision after must be acknowledged that although there be case of distress in well may become place of refuge well be not at calculated for prolonged residence so thought jack after have be there fifteen minute teeth chattered limb trembled felt numbness over thought high time to call for assistance at first must not a be afraid must be pulled up to encounter indignation of farmer family jack be arranging jaw for halloo when felt chain pulled up slowly emerged from water at first heard complaint of weight of bucket at jack be not surprised then heard tittering laughing between two party soon afterwards mounted up gaily at last head appeared above low wall be about to extend arm so a to secure position on when who be working at windlass beheld be heavy farming man maid servant thank said jack one never must be too quick in returning thanks girl screamed let go winch man frightened did not hold fast slipped from grasp whirled round struck under chin threw over headlong before thank be fairly out of jack lip down went again like lightning to bottom fortunately for jack have not yet let go chain might have struck side have be killed a be be merely soused second time in minute two regained former position be mighty pleasant thought jack a clapped wet once more on head at event ca now plead ignorance must know that be here in meantime girl ran into kitchen threw down on stool from reeled off in fit upon sundry heap of dough waiting to be baked in oven be laid to rise on floor before fire mercy on what be matter with susan exclaimed farmer wife here where be mary where john deary if bread wo all be turned to pancake john soon followed holding under jaw in hand looking very dismal very frightened for two reason one because thought that jaw be broken other because thought have seen devil mercy on be matter exclaimed farmer wife again mary mary mary screamed beginning to be frightened for with effort must not remove susan from bed of dough where lay senseless heavy a lead mary answered to mistress loud appeal with assistance raised up susan a for bread there be hope of ever rising again why come here help susan john cried mary aw yaw aw be reply of john who have have enough quite of helping susan who continued to hold head a be in hand what be matter here missus exclaimed farmer coming in highty tighty what ail susan what ail continued farmer turning to john dang everything seems to go wrong blessed day first there be apple stolen then there be hive turned topsy turvy in garden then there be caesar with flank opened by bull then there be bull broken through hedge tumbled into saw pit now come to get more help to drag out find one woman dead like john look a if have seen devil aw yaw aw replied john nodding head very significantly one must think that devil have broke loose to day what be john have seen have susan seen aw yaw be stopped jaw then at event thought devil must have done that will get nothing of be that wench coming to sens yes yes be better now susan what be matter oh oh ma'be well well well something wrong there suppose well will go see farmer trotted off to well perceived bucket be at bottom rope out looked about then looked into well jack who have become very impatient have be looking up time for assistance expected must have come round face of farmer occasioned partial eclipse of round disk bounded view just a one of satellite of jupiter sometimes obscures face of planet round revolves here be cried jack get up quick will be dead what jack said be true for be quite done up by having be so long down although courage have not failed dang there be somebody fallen into well cried farmer end to mishap day well must get christian out of well afore get bull out of saw pit so will go call men in very short time men who be assembled round saw pit be brought to well down below there hold on now never fear cried jack away went winch once more jack have extended horizon to survey a soon a be at top men hauled over brick laid down upon ground for jack strength have failed dang if bea that chap who be on apple tree cried farmer howsoever must not die for stealing few apple lift up lad take in be dead with cold wonder farmer led way men carried jack into house when farmer gave glass of brandy restored jack circulation in short time be all right again after previous conversation in jack narrated have happened what may be name inquired farmer name be easy replied jack what be son of mr easy of forest hill yes dang be landlord right good landlord too why did say so when be up in apple tree might have picked whole orchard welcome dear sir replied jack who have taken second glass of brandy be quite talkative again let be warning to when man proposes to argue point always in future listen have waited must have proved to most incontestably that have more right to apple than have must not listen to argument without discussion can never arrive at truth send for dog who be ripped up by bull bull break leg in saw pit bee hive be overturned lose honey man john break jaw maid susan spoil bread why because must not allow to argue point well mr easy be true that mishap have happened because must not allow to argue point perhaps although a rent orchard from father can not imagine how must prove to that apple be not mine now let take side of question see how be much better off get up in tree for few apple with plenty of money to buy if like be kept there by dog be nearly gored by bull be stung by bee tumble souse into well be nearly killed dozen time for few apple not worth twopence very true good man replied jack forget that a philosopher be defending right of man well never knew before that lad who stole apple be called philosopher call petty larceny in indictment a for right of man can not see how can be defended by doing what be wrong comprehend matter farmer be too old to learn master easy have to say be be welcome to apple in orchard if please if prefers a seems do to steal instead of asking for only can account for by reason that say that betolen fruit be sweetest have only to say that will give order that be not interfered with chaise be at door master easy man will drive to father make compliment to say that be very sorry that tumbled into well a jack be much more inclined for bed than argument wished farmer good night allowed to be driven pain from sting of bee now that circulation have fully returned be so great that be not sorry to find dr middleton taking tea with father mother jack merely said that have be so unfortunate a to upset hive have be severely stung deferred whole story till opportunity dr middleton prescribed for jack on taking hand found that be in high fever after event of day be not to be wondered at jack be bled kept bed for week by time be restored during time jack have be thinking very seriously have made up mind must explain circumstance have occurred be probably cause of jack decision when jack returned on evening in question found seated with father dr middleton captain wilson sort of cousin to family who occasionally paid visit for lived at distance having wife large family with nothing half pay for support must not afford to expend even shoe leather in compliment object of visit on part of captain wilson be to request aid of mr easy have succeeded in obtaining appointment to sloop of war for be in king service be without mean of fitting out without leaving wife family penniless therefore came to request mr easy to lend few hundred pound until must be able by prize money to repay mr easy be not man to refuse request always having plenty of spare cash at banker drew cheque for thousand pound gave to captain wilson requesting that must only repay at convenience captain wilson wrote acknowledgment of debt promising to pay upon first prize money receipt however binding may be to man of honour be in point of law about a valuable a if have agreed to pay a soon a cow came home affair have be just concluded captain wilson have returned into parlour with mr easy when jack returned from expedition jack greeted captain wilson whom have long known a before observed suffered so much pain that soon retired with dr middleton went to bed during week there be room for much reflection even in lad of fourteen although at age be not much inclined to think jack be in bed eye be so swollen with sting of bee that must neither read otherwise amuse preferred own thought to gabble of sarah who attended so jack thought result of cogitation will soon bring forward be on eighth day that jack left bed came down into drawing room then detailed to father adventure have taken place have obliged to take to bed see jack replied father be just what told world be so utterly demoralised by what be called social compact phalanx supporting by contributing portion of unjust possession for security of remainder be so powerful that one who opposes must expect to pas life of martyr martyr be always required previous to truth however sublime being received like abraham whom have always considered a great philosopher be willing to sacrifice only son in so noble cause be very good on part father must argue point little if be a great philosopher a abraham be not quite so dutiful son a isaac whose blind obedience in opinion be very contrary to right of man fact in few word be simply in promulgating philosophy in short space of two day have be robbed of fish caught rod line have be soused into fish pond have be frightened out of wit by bull dog be nearly killed by bull be stung to death by bee twice tumbled into well now if happens in two day what must expect to suffer in whole year appears to be very unwise to attempt making further convert for people on shore seem determined not to listen to reason argument have occurred to that although whole earth have be so nefariously divided among few that water at least be property of man claim share of sea one may there plough a plea without being taken up for trespasser even war make difference one may go on a plea if meet be nothing neutral ground on party contend be then only upon ocean be likely to find equality right of man be so anxious to establish on shore therefore have resolved not to go to school again detest to go to sea propagate opinion a much a can can not listen to jack in first place must return to school in next place will not go to sea then father have to say be that swear by right of man will not go back to school will go to sea who what be to prevent be not born own master have one right to dictate to a if be not equal have not a much right to share of sea a other mortal stand upon perfect equality continued jack stamping right foot on floor what have mr easy to offer in reply must either a philosopher have sacrificed hypothesis a father have sacrificed son like philosopher preferred what considered a le important of two sacrificed son will do justice did with sigh jack will if wish go to sea that of course replied jack with air of conqueror question be with whom now have occurred to that captain wilson have just be appointed to ship must like to sail with will write to said mr easy mournfully must have liked to have felt head first thus be matter arranged answer from captain wilson be of course in affirmative promised that must treat jack a own son hero mounted father horse rode off to mr bonnycastle be going to sea mr bonnycastle very best thing for replied mr bonnycastle hero met dr middleton be going to sea dr middleton very best thing for replied doctor be going to sea mother said john to sea john to sea dear john be not going to sea replied mr easy with horror yes be father have agreed say will obtain consent consent oh dear dear boy mr easy wept bitterly a rachel mourning for child chapter viii in mr easy have first lesson a to zeal in majesty service a there be time to lose hero very soon bade adieu to paternal roof a phrase be found way down to portsmouth a jack have plenty of money be very much pleased at finding own master be in hurry to join ship five six companion not very creditable whom jack have picked up have picked up jack who lived upon strongly advised to put off until very last moment a advice happened to coincide with jack opinion hero be three week at portsmouth before one knew of arrival at last captain wilson received letter from mr easy by found that jack have left home at period have mentioned desired first lieutenant to make inquiry a be afraid that accident might have happened to a mr sawbridge first lieutenant happened to be going on shore on same evening for last time previous to ship sailing looked into blue post george fountain inn to inquire if there be such person arrived a mr easy o yes replied waiter at fountain mr easy have be here three week devil have roared mr sawbridge with indignation of first lieutenant defrauded three week of midshipman where be in coffee room oh dear sir replied waiter mr easy have front apartment on first floor well then show up to first floor may request pleasure of name sir said waiter first lieutenant send up name to midshipman replied mr sawbridge will soon know who be at reply waiter walked upstairs followed by mr sawbridge threw open door gentleman wish to see sir said waiter desire to walk in said jack waiter mind that punch be little better than be yesterday have asked two more gentleman to dine here in meantime mr sawbridge who be not in uniform have entered perceived jack alone with dinner table laid out in best style for eight considerable show of plate for even fountain inn everything a well a apartment according to mr sawbridge opinion much more fit for commander in chief than midshipman of sloop of war now mr sawbridge be good officer one who have really worked way up to present rank be to say that have served seven twenty year have nothing pay be little soured in service certainly have aversion to young men of family who be now fast crowding into with ground a perceived own chance of promotion decrease in same ratio a number increased considered that in proportion a midshipman assumed cleaner more gentlemanly appearance so did become more useless may therefore be easily imagined that bile be raised by parade display in lad who be very shortly to be ought three week before to have be shrinking from frown nevertheless sawbridge be good hearted man although little envious of luxury must not pretend to indulge in may beg to ask said jack who be always remarkably polite gentlemanly in address in what manner may be of service to yes sir may by joining ship immediately may beg to ask in return sir what be reason have stayed on shore three week without joining hereupon jack who did not much admire peremptory tone of mr sawbridge who during answer have taken seat crossed leg played with gold chain to watch be secured after pause very coolly replied pray who be who be sir replied sawbridge jumping out of chair name be sawbridge sir be first lieutenant of harpy now sir have answer mr sawbridge who imagined that name of first lieutenant must strike terror to culprit midshipman threw back in chair assumed air of importance really sir replied jack what may be exact situation on board ignorance of service will not allow to guess if may judge from behaviour have small opinion of look ye young man may not know what first lieutenant be take for granted that by behaviour depend upon will let know very soon in meantime sir insist upon that go immediately on board be sorry can not comply with very moderate request replied jack coolly will go on board when suit convenience beg that will give further trouble on account jack then rang bell waiter who have be listening outside immediately entered before mr sawbridge who be dumb with astonishment at jack impertinence must have time to reply waiter said jack show gentleman downstairs by god of war exclaimed first lieutenant will soon show down to boat young bantam when once get safe on board will make know difference between midshipman first lieutenant can only admit of equality sir replied jack be born equal trust will allow equality damn suppose will take command of ship however sir ignorance will be little enlightened by bye will now go report conduct to captain wilson tell plainly that if be not on board evening to morrow morning at daylight will send sergeant file of marine to fetch may depend upon sir replied jack also will not fail to mention to captain wilson that consider very quarrelsome impertinent fellow recommend not to allow to remain on board will be quite uncomfortable to be in same ship with ungentlemanly bear must be mad quite mad exclaimed sawbridge whose astonishment even mastered indignation mad a march hare by god sir replied jack be not mad be philosopher what exclaimed sawbridge damme what next well joker better for will put philosophy to proof be for very reason sir replied jack have decided upon going to sea if do remain on board hope to argue point with make convert to truth of equality right of man by lord made will soon make convert to thirty six article of war be if remain on board will now go to captain report conduct sir leave to dinner with what appetite may sir be infinitely obliged to need not be afraid of appetite be only sorry a happen to belong to same ship can not in justice to gentlemanly young men whom expect ask to join wish very good morning sir twenty year have be in service roared sawbridge damme be mad downright stark staring mad first lieutenant bounced out of room jack be little astonished have mr sawbridge made appearance in uniform might have be different that plain looking man with black whisker shaggy hair old blue frock coat yellow cassimere waistcoat must venture to address in manner be quite incomprehensible call mad thought jack will tell captain wilson what be opinion about lieutenant shortly afterwards company arrived jack soon forgot about in meantime sawbridge called at captain lodging found at home made very faithful report of have happened concluded report by demanding in great wrath instant dismissal court martial on hero jack stop sawbridge replied captain wilson take chair a mr easy say must argue point then will leave to better feeling a for court martial will not hold good for mr easy in first place have not yet joined ship in next place must not be supposed to know that be first lieutenant even officer for went to out of uniform very true sir replied sawbridge have forgotten that then a for dismissal rather not allowing to join mr easy have be brought up in country have never seen anything aquatic larger than fish pond perhaps in life a for service nature of believe be a ignorant of a child not year old doubt whether know rank of lieutenant certainly can have idea of power of first lieutenant by treatment of must think not replied sawbridge dryly think therefore conduct must have proceeded from sheer ignorance must be so severely punished appeal to sawbridge well sir perhaps be right still told be philosopher talked about equality right of man told that must only admit of equality between begged to argue point now sir if midshipman be to argue point time that order be given service will come to pretty pas be very true sawbridge now remind of what never occurred to at time promised to take mr easy in ship now recollect that father who be distant relation of mine have very wild notion in head just like what have be repeated by son on interview with have occasionally dined there mr easy have always be upholding principle of natural equality of right of man much to amusement of guest confess at time of mine also recollect telling that trusted must never be able to disseminate opinion in service to belonged a must have end of discipline little thought at time that only son who have more occasion to go to sea than archbishop of canterbury for father have very handsome property believe seven eight thousand year must ever have sailed with have brought opinion with into ship commanded be pity great pity never must have brought pig to worse market observed sawbridge agree with a father can not help feeling how careful must be how inculcate anything like abstract philosophical idea to youth allowing to be in correct still be dangerous a sharp instrument be in hand of child allowing to be erroneous be seized upon with avidity by young ardent mind be not to be eradicated without greatest difficulty very often not until have accomplished ruin then think sir that idea have taken deep root in young man will not easily rid of say so still recollect have be instilled perhaps from earliest period by one from whom must have be received with confidence from father to son son have never yet be sufficiently in world to have proved fallacy well sir replied sawbridge if may venture to offer opinion on subject in so doing assure that only will from feeling for service if a say opinion will not easily be eradicated a young man be independent must not be better for a well a for service that be sent home again a officer will never do good for may do much harm to others submit to captain wilson with respect a first lieutenant feel very jealous at chance of discipline of ship being interfered with by introduction of young man to whom appears that profession be object dear sawbridge replied captain wilson after taking one two turn up down room entered service together be messmate for many year must be aware that be not only long friendship intimate knowledge of unrewarded merit have induced to request to come with a first lieutenant now will put case to will then decide question moreover will abide by decision suppose that be commander like with wife seven child that struggling for many year to support found notwithstanding utmost parsimony gradually running into debt that after many long application have at last succeeded in obtaining employment by appointment to fine sloop there be prospect by prize money increased pay of recovering from difficulty if not realising sufficient provision for family then suppose that prospect hope be likely to be dashed to ground by fact of having mean of fitting out credit mean of paying debt have contracted for must have be arrested anything sufficient to leave for support of family during absence agent only consenting to advance one half of what require now suppose in awkward dilemma without anyone in world upon whom have legitimate claim a last resource be to apply to one with whom have distant connection occasional acquaintance that when have made request for loan of two three hundred pound fully anticipating refusal from feeling that who go borrowing go sorrowing say suppose to astonishment that generous person be to present with cheque on banker for one thousand pound demanding interest legal security request only to pay at convenience ask sawbridge what must be feeling towards such man must die for replied sawbridge with emotion suppose that by merest chance from whim of moment son of man be to be placed under protection must be father to replied sawbridge must proceed little further suppose that be to find lad be not that must wish that have imbibed erroneous doctrine must probably if not eradicated be attended with consequence fatal to welfare happiness must therefore on account withdraw protection leave to mercy of others who have claim of gratitude to sway in favour most certainly not sir replied sawbridge on contrary must never part with son until by precept otherwise have set right again thus have a far a be possible paid debt of gratitude due to generous father hardly need say to sawbridge after what have passed that lad have just come from be son that mr easy of forest hill be father then sir can only say that not only to please also from respect to man who have shown such good will towards one of cloth will most cheerfully forgive have passed between lad may probably take place before make what ought to be thank sawbridge expected a much be not disappointed in opinion of now captain wilson pray what be to be done must get on board not with file of marine will do more harm than good will send note requesting to breakfast with to morrow morning have little conversation with wish to frighten must not scruple to run back to forest hill now wish to keep if possibly can be right sir father appears greatest enemy what pity that man with so good heart must be so weak in head then sir will take notice of at present leave whole affair in hand do sawbridge have obliged very much by kindness in business mr sawbridge then took leave captain wilson despatched note to hero requesting pleasure of company to breakfast at nine o'clock ensuing morning answer be in affirmative verbal for jack have drunk too much champagne to trust pen to paper chapter ix in mr easy find on other side of bay of biscay next morning jack easy must have forgotten about engagement with captain have not be for waiter who thought that after reception hero have given first lieutenant must be just a well that must not be disrespectful to captain now jack have not hitherto put on uniform thought fitting occasion particularly a waiter suggested propriety of appearance in whether be from presentiment of what be to suffer jack be not at pleased a most lad be with change in dress appeared to that be sacrificing independence however did not follow first impulse be to take off again took hat waiter have brushed handed to then set off for captain lodging captain wilson received a if have not be aware of delay in joining ship interview with first lieutenant before breakfast be over jack narrated affair in few word captain wilson then entered into detail of duty rank of person on board of ship pointing out to jack that where discipline be required be impossible when duty be carried on more than one must command that one be captain who represented king in person who represented country that a order be transmitted from captain through lieutenant from lieutenant to midshipman who in turn communicated to whole ship company in fact be captain alone who gave order that everyone be equally obliged to obey indeed a captain have to obey order of superior admiral admiralty on board might be said to be equally obliged to obey captain wilson laid strong emphasis on word equally a cautiously administered first dose indeed in whole of address made use of special pleading must have done credit to bar for at same time that be explaining to jack that be entering service in equality must never for moment exist if service be to exist contrived to show that grade be levelled by being equally bound to do duty to country that in fact whether seaman obeyed order obeyed order of superior officer be in reality only obeying order of country be administered through channel jack did not altogether dislike view of subject captain took care not to dwell too long upon then entered upon other detail be aware must be more agreeable to jack pointed out that article of war be rule by service be to be guided that everybody from captain to least boy in ship be equally bound to adhere to that certain allowance of provision wine be allowed to person on board that allowance be same to same to captain a to boy same in quantity a in quality everyone equally entitled to allowance that although there be of necessity various grade necessary in service captain order be obliged to be passed obeyed by yet still be grade of officer be equally considered a gentleman in short captain wilson who told truth nothing truth without telling whole truth actually made jack fancy that have at last found out that equality have be seeking for in vain on shore when at last recollected language used by mr sawbridge evening before asked captain why personage have so conducted now a language of mr sawbridge be very much at variance with equality captain wilson be not little puzzled however first pointed out that first lieutenant be at time being captain a be senior officer on board a must jack be if be senior officer on board that a before observed captain senior officer represented country in article of war everybody who absented from ship committed error breach of article if error breach of article be committed by anyone belonging to ship if senior officer did not take notice of then committed breach of article be liable to be punished if must not prove that have noticed be therefore to save that be obliged to point out error if did in strong language only proved zeal for country upon honour then replied jack there can be doubt of zeal for if whole country have be at stake must not have put in greater passion then did duty depend upon be not pleasant one to will answer for when meet on board will be a friendly with a if nothing have happened told that 'd soon make know what first lieutenant be what did mean by inquired jack zeal yes said that a soon a got on board 'd show difference between first lieutenant midshipman zeal said ignorance must be little enlightened by bye zeal that 'd send sergeant marine to fetch zeal that must put philosophy to proof zeal mr easy zeal will break out in way must hing in service without recollect that hope trust one day to see also zealous officer here jack cogitated considerably gave answer will be sure continued captain wilson find mr sawbridge one of best friend perhaps so replied jack did not much admire first acquaintance will perhaps be unpleasant duty to find a much fault be equally bound to do duty to country mr easy sent for to say that will sail to morrow a will send thing off afternoon by launch have better send yours off also at eight o'clock will go on board can go in same boat to jack made sort of objection having paid bill at fountain sent chest down to boat by of crew who came up for attended summons of captain to embark by nine o'clock evening jack easy be safe on board majesty sloop harpy when jack arrived on board be dark did not know what to do with captain be received by officer on deck who took off hat to salute captain returned salute so did jack very politely after captain entered into conversation with first lieutenant for while jack be left to be too dark to distinguish face to one who have never be on board of ship too dark to move so jack stood where be be not far from main bitt did not stay long boat have be hooked on to quarter davit boatswain have called out set taut lad then with shrill whistle away with forward came galloping bounding along men with tackle in dark jack be upset dozen marine fell upon men who have idea that officer be floored among others be pleased at joke continued to dance over who be down until rolled out of way jack who did not understand fared badly be not till call piped belay that must recover leg after having be trampled upon by starboard watch breath completely jammed out of body jack reeled to carronade slide when officer who have be laughing at lark a well a men perceived situation among others mr sawbridge first lieutenant be hurt mr easy said kindly little replied jack catching breath have have rough welcome replied first lieutenant at certain time on board ship be man for god for harpur continued first lieutenant to doctor take mr easy down in gun room with will be down a soon a can where be mr jolliffe here sir replied mr jolliffe master mate coming aft from boom there be youngster come on board with captain order one of quarter master to get hammock slung in meantime jack went down into gun room where glass of wine somewhat recovered did not

portion of clear sky a acted in obedience to motion of vessel looked forward at range of carronades lined side of deck then proceeded to climb one of carronades lean over hammock to gaze on distant land young gentleman get off hammock cried master who be officer of watch in surly tone jack looked round do hear sir be speaking to said master again jack felt very indignant thought that politeness be not quite so general a supposed happened that captain wilson be upon deck come here mr easy said captain be rule in service that one get on hammock unless in case of emergency never do first lieutenant of officer men therefore upon principle of equality must not do either certainly not sir replied jack still see why officer in shining hat must be so angry not speak to a if be gentleman a well a have already explained that to mr easy o yes recollect now be zeal zeal appears to to be only unpleasant thing in service be pity a said that service can not do without captain wilson laughed walked away shortly afterwards a turned up down deck with master hinted to that must not speak so sharply to lad who have committed trifling error through ignorance now mr smallsole master who be surly sort of personage did not like even hint of disapprobation of conduct although very regardless of feeling of others determined to pay off on jack very first convenient opportunity jack dined in cabin be very much pleased to find that everyone drank wine with that everybody at captain table appeared to be on equality before dessert have be on table five minute jack became loquacious on favourite topic company stared with surprise at unheard of doctrine being broached on board of man of war captain argued point so a to controvert without too much offending jack notion laughing whole time that conversation be carried on will be observed that day may be considered a first in jack really made appearance on board also be on first day that jack made known at captain table very peculiar notion if company at captain table consisted of second lieutenant purser mr jolliffe one of midshipman be astonished at such heterodox opinion being stated in presence of captain be equally astonished at cool good humoured ridicule with be received by captain wilson report of jack boldness word opinion that have uttered of course much magnified be circulated that evening through whole ship be canvassed in gun room by officer be descanted upon by midshipman a walked deck captain steward held levee abreast of ship funnel in narrated new doctrine sergeant of marine gave opinion in

bay hero must bid adieu to service either by being sentenced to death by court martial by being dismissed towed on shore on grating others who have more of wisdom of serpent who have be informed by mr sawbridge that hero be lad who must inherit large property argued differently considered that captain wilson have very good reason for being so lenient among be second lieutenant there be four who be well inclined towards jack to wit captain first lieutenant mr jolliffe one eyed master mate mephistopheles black who having heard that jack have uttered such sentiment loved with heart soul have referred to second lieutenant mr asper young man have very high respect for birth particularly for money of have very little be son of eminent merchant who during time that be midshipman have allowed much larger sum for expense than be necessary proper during career found that full pocket procured consequence not only among own messmate also with many of officer of ship that sailed in man who be able willing to pay large tavern bill will always find follower be to tavern lieutenant did not disdain to dine walk arm in arm be hail fellow well met with midshipman at whose expense lived during time be on shore mr asper have just received commission appointment when father became bankrupt fountain be dried up from have drawn such liberal supply since mr asper have felt that consequence be gone must no longer talk about service being bore that must give up must no longer obtain deference paid to purse not to have contracted very expensive habit without having longer mean of gratifying be therefore wonder that imbibed great respect for money a must no longer find mean be glad to pick up anybody else at whose cost must indulge in extravagance expense to have be so long accustomed still sighed for now mr asper knew that hero be well supplied with money a have obtained from waiter amount of bill paid at fountain have be waiting for jack appearance on deck to become very dearest most intimate friend conversation in cabin made feel assured that jack must require be grateful for support have taken opportunity of walk with mr sawbridge to offer to take jack in watch whether be that mr sawbridge saw through design of mr asper whether imagined that hero must be better pleased with than with master considering harshness of deportment with who must not a first lieutenant overlook remission of duty offer be accepted jack easy be ordered a now entered upon duty to keep watch under lieutenant asper not only be first day that jack may be said to have appeared in service be first day in have entered midshipman berth be made acquainted with messmate have already mentioned mr jolliffe master mate must introduce more particularly nature be sometimes extremely arbitrary

hundred have now be long in service with little chance of promotion have suffered from indigence from reflection upon humble birth from sarcasm on appearance contumely have be heaped upon at one time in ship in served among crowd have found desolate now although one dared treat to face with disrespect be only respected in service from knowledge of utility exemplary performance of duty have friend even companion for many year have retired within have improved by reading study have felt philanthropy of christian extended towards others silent reserved seldom spoke in berth unless authority a caterer be called for respected mr jolliffe one liked a companion one at whose appearance very dog must bark at same time one acknowledged correct behaviour in point sense of justice forbearance kindness good sense with life be indeed pilgrimage wended way in christian charity christian zeal in society however small may be provided that do amount to dozen will invariably meet with bully be also generally case that will find one of society who be more le butt will discover even in occasional meeting such a dinner party major part of have never met before previous to removal of cloth bully will have shown by dictatorial manner will also have selected one upon whom imago that can best practise in midshipman berth fact have become almost proverbial although now perhaps be not attended with disagreeable despotism be permitted at time that hero entered service bully of midshipman berth of hm sloop harpy be young man about seventeen with light curly hair florid countenance son of clerk in dockyard at plymouth name be vigor butt be pudding faced tartar physiognomied boy of fifteen whose intellect with fostering if not great might at least have be respectable have not

gossett father be wealthy yeoman of lynn in norfolk there be at time three other midshipman in ship of whom can only be said that be like midshipman in general with little appetite for learning good appetite for dinner hating everything like work fond of everything like fun fighting l'outrance one minute sworn friend next with general principle of honour justice be occasionally warped according to circumstance with virtue vice so heterogeneously jumbled heaped together that be almost impossible to ascribe action to true motive to ascertain to what point vice be softened down into almost virtue virtue from mere excess degenerated into vice name be o'connor mill gascoigne other shipmate of hero will be better to introduce a appear on stage after jack have dined in cabin followed messmate jolliffe gascoigne down into midshipman berth say easy observed gascoigne be devilish free easy sort of fellow to tell captain that considered a great man a be beg pardon replied jack did not argue individually generally upon principle of right of man well replied gascoigne be first time ever heard middy do bold thing take care right of man get in wrong box there be arguing on board of man of war captain took amazingly easy 'd better not broach that subject too often gascoigne give very good advice mr easy observed jolliffe allowing that idea be correct appears to be not at least impossible to be acted upon there be such thing a prudence however much question may be canvassed on shore in majesty service be not only dangerous in will be very prejudicial to man be free agent replied easy will be shot if midshipman be replied gascoigne laughing aloud that will soon find yet be in expectation of finding equality be induced to come to sea on first of april presume replied gascoigne be really serious hereupon jack entered into long argument to jolliffe gascoigne listened without interruption mesty with admiration at end of gascoigne laughed heartily jolliffe sighed from whence did learn inquired jolliffe from father who be great philosopher have constantly upheld opinion did father wish to go to sea be opposed to replied jack of course must not combat right free will mr easy a friend replied jolliffe request that must a much a possible keep opinion to yourself will have opportunity of talking to on subject will then explain to reason a soon a mr jolliffe have ceased down came mr vigor o'connor who have heard news of jack heresy know mr vigor mr o'connor said jolliffe to easy jack who be essence of politeness rose bowed at others took seat without returning salutation vigor have from what have heard now seen of easy thought have somebody else to play upon without ceremony commenced so chap be come on board to raise mutiny here with equality came off scot free at captain table wo do can tell even in midshipman berth must knock under be one of if sir replied easy mean by knock under must submit can assure that be mistaken upon same principle must never play tyrant to weaker than so will resent oppression if attempted damme be regular sea lawyer already however boy will soon put mettle to proof be then to infer be not on equality with messmate replied jack looking at latter be about to answer vigor interrupted yes be on equality a far a that have equal right to berth if be not knocked out of for insolence to master that have equal share to pay for thing purchased for mess equal right to have share provided can get have equal right to talk provided be not told to hold tongue fact be have equal right with everyone else to do a can get what can say what can always provided that can do for here weakest go to wall be midshipman berth equality now do understand will wait for practical illustration be then to infer that equality here be a much destroyed a even will be among savage where strong oppress weak only law be club law in fact much same a be at public large school on shore suspect be right for once be at public school how did treat there a propose treating people here weakest went to wall well then nod a good a wink to blind horse be hearty said vigor hand being turned up shorten sail put end to altercation for present a hero have not yet received order to go to duty remained below with mesty by de power massa easy lub with hole soul said mesty by jasus really tark fine massa easy dat mr vigor nebber care for must help sure must continued black feeling muscle of jack arm by soul of fader 'd bet week allowance on anyhow nebber be 'fraid massa easy be not afraid replied jack have thrashed bigger fellow than jack assertion be true mr bonnycastle never interfered in fair fight took notice of black eye provided lesson there well said jack have fought fought again until be very good bruiser although not so tall a vigor be much better built for fighting knowing westminster boy must have bet half crown upon jack have seen anticipated constant battle jack be obliged to fight at school have be brought forward by jack against father argument in favour of equality have be overruled by mr easy pointing out that combat of boy have nothing to do with right of man a soon a watch be called vigor o'connor gossett gascoigne came down into berth vigor who be strongest in berth except jolliffe have successively have superiority acknowledged when on deck have talked of easy impertinence intention of bringing to sens others therefore came down to see fun well mr easy observed vigor a came into berth take after name at event suppose intend to eat king provision hing jack mettle be already up will oblige sir by minding own business replied jack impudent blackguard if say word will give good thrashing knock of equality out of indeed replied jack who almost fancied back at mr bonnycastle will try that whereupon jack very coolly divested of upper garment neckerchief shirt much to surprise of mr vigor who little contemplated proof of decision confidence still more to delight of other midshipman who must have forfeited week allowance to see vigor well thrashed vigor however knew that have gone too far to retreat therefore prepared for action when ready whole party went out into steerage to settle business vigor have gained assumed authority more by bullying than fighting others have submitted to without sufficient trial jack on contrary have won way up in school by hard scientific combat result therefore may easily be imagined in le than quarter of hour vigor beaten dead with eye closed three teeth out gave in while jack after basin of water looked a fresh a ever with exception of few trifling scratch news of victory be soon through ship before jack have resumed clothes have be told confidentially by sawbridge to captain so soon said captain wilson laughing expected that midshipman berth must do wonder did not expect yet awhile victory be first severe blow to mr easy equality will be more valuable than twenty defeat let now go to duty will soon find level chapter xi in hero prof that on board must equally sacrifice decency to duty success of young man in profession very much depends upon occurrence at commencement of career a from be character judged be treated accordingly jack have chosen to enter service at much later period than most lad be tall manly for age countenance if not strictly handsome wore that expression of honesty boldness be sure to please spirit in not submitting to meeting vigor when have hardly recovered from severe prostration of sea sickness have gained with many respect with except antagonist mr smallsole good will instead of being laughed at by messmate be played with for jolliffe smiled at absurdity attempted to reason out of others liked jack for generosity moreover because looked up to a protector against vigor who have persecuted for jack have declared that a might be right in midshipman berth must so far restore equality that if must not put down who be strongest at event must protect weak let who must come into berth must be master before must tyrannise over weaker than thus did jack easy make best use that must of strength become a be champion security of who although much longer at sea more experienced than be be glad to shelter under courage skill latter of have excited admiration of butcher of ship who have be pugilist by profession thus did jack at once take rank of oldster soon became leader of mischief particularly observe because have so happened that hero have succumbed to vigor case must have be very reverse then must have have to go through ordeal to most who enter naval service be exposed can not be better explained than by comparing to fagging carried to iniquitous extent in public school mr asper for own reason made companion walked night watch together listened to jack nonsense about right of man here mr asper did good without intending for at same time that appeared to agree with jack to secure favour cautioned pointed out why equality must not exist altogether on board of man of war a for said saw difference between lieutenant even captain midshipman provided be gentleman must choose friend where liked despised power of annoyance service permitted of course jack mr asper be good friend especially a when watch be over to conciliate good will to get rid of eternal arguing mr asper must send jack down to bed be now entering strait expected to anchor next day at gibraltar

others in midst of liberty equality thousand more be enslaved degraded being escaping to england have regained liberty not equality colour have prevented latter in feeling world appeared to conspire together against until to astonishment heard sentiment boldly expressed from lip of jack that in service where be almost tantamount to mutiny mesty whose character be not yet developed immediately took fondness for hero in hundred way showed attachment jack also liked mesty be fond of talking with evening since combat with vigor have generally met in forecastle to discus principle of equality

swell mob be not easily repulsed although jack must plainly show that company be not agreeable easthupp must constantly accost familiarly on forecastle lower deck with arm folded with air almost amounting to familiarity at last jack told to go about business not presume to talk to whereupon easthupp rejoined after exchange of hard word ended by jack kicking mr easthupp a called down after lower deck hatchway be sorry specimen of jack equality mr easthupp who considered that honour have be compromised went up to captain on quarter deck lodged complaint whereupon captain wilson desired that mr easy might be summoned a soon a jack made appearance captain wilson called to easthupp now purser steward what be have to say if please captain vilson be wery sorry to be obliged to make hany

deserved still have right to attack man character without ground a man be in office of trust be not at warranted in asserting that be cheat will explain to why made use of such language now hero have proof against man have nothing to offer in extenuation until recollected at once reason assigned by captain for language used by mr sawbridge jack have wit to perceive that must hit home so replied very quietly respectfully if please captain wilson be zeal zeal mr easy think bad excuse pray then why did kick man down hatchway must have known that be contrary to rule of service yes sir replied jack demurely be zeal too then allow to say replied captain wilson biting lip think that zeal have in instance be very much misplaced trust will not show so much again yet sir replied jack aware that be giving captain hard hit therefore looked proportionally humble must hing in service without trust one day a told to become very zealous officer trust so too mr easy replied captain there may go now let hear more of kicking people down hatchway that sort of zeal be misplaced more than foot be at event muttered jack a walked off captain wilson a soon a hero disappeared laughed heartily told mr sawbridge have ascribed language to hero a zeal have very cleverly given back again really sawbridge a prof how weak be defence of may gain from lesson sawbridge thought so too agreed that jack right of man be in considerable danger day before ship sailed captain mr asper dined with governor a there be little more to do mr sawbridge who have not quitted ship since have be in port have few purchase to make left in afternoon in charge of mr smallsole master now a have observed be jack inveterate enemy indeed jack have already made three mr smallsole mr biggs boatswain easthupp purser steward mr smallsole be glad to be left in command a hoped to have opportunity of punishing hero who certainly laid not little open to like who be seldom in command master be proportionally tyrannical abusive swore at men made do duty twice thrice over on pretence that be not smartly done found fault with officer remaining on board mr biggs by god sir seem to be asleep forward suppose think that be to hing now first lieutenant be out of ship how long will be sir before be ready to sway away by de holy poker tink sway away finely massy easy observed mesty who be in converse with hero on forecastle mr smallsole violence made mr biggs violent made boatswain mate violent captain of forecastle violent also be practically exemplified by philosophy in law of motion communicated from one body to a mr smallsole swore so did boatswain swear also boatswain mate captain of forecastle men showing force of example mr smallsole came forward damnation mr biggs what devil be about ca move here a much a can sir replied boatswain lumbered a forecastle be with idler here mr biggs looked at hero mesty who be standing against bulwark what be doing here sir cried mr smallsole to hero nothing at sir replied jack then will give something to do sir go up to mast head wait there till call down come sir will show way continued master walking aft jack followed till be on quarter deck now sir up to main top gallant mast head perch upon cross tree up with what be to go up there for sir inquired jack for punishment sir replied master have done sir reply sir up with if please sir replied jack must wish to argue point little argue point roared mr smallsole by jove will teach to argue point away with sir if please sir continued jack captain told that article of war be rule regulation by everyone in service be to be guided now sir said jack have read over till know by heart there be not one word of mastheading in whole of here jack took article out of pocket unfolded will go to mast head sir will not said mr smallsole will show mast head in article of war sir replied jack here be tell sir to go to mast head if not will be d d if hoist up in bread bag there be nothing about bread bag in article of war sir replied jack will tell what there be sir jack commenced reading flag officer person in belonging to majesty ship vessel of war being guilty of profane oath execration drunkenness uncleanness other scandalous action in derogation of god honour corruption of good manner will incur such punishment a damnation cried master who be mad with rage hearing that whole ship company be laughing sir not damnation replied jack be when be tried above according to nature degree of offence will go to mast head sir will not if please replied jack 'd rather not then sir consider under arrest will try by court martial by god go down below sir with greatest pleasure sir replied jack be right according to article of war be to guide jack folded up article of war put into pocket went down into berth soon after jack have gone down jolliffe who have heard whole of altercation followed lad said jolliffe be sorry for must have gone to mast head must like to argue point little replied jack yes so must everybody if be permitted service must be at stand still must not do must obey order first then complain afterwards if order be unjust be not so in article of war be so in service captain told that article of war be guide of service be equally bound to obey well allowing that think article of war will bear out observe say officer mariner etc guilty of disobedience to lawful command now be not guilty under article remains to be argued still replied jack lawful command mean order established by law now where be that law besides captain told when kicked that blackguard down hatchway that there be only captain who must punish that officer must not take law into own hand why then have master doing wrong a superior officer be reason why a inferior must disobey if be permitted if order be to be cavilled at argued upon a just unjust there must be end of discipline besides recollect that in service there be custom be same a law that admits of little argument replied jack service will admit of none dear boy recollect even on shore have two law that be written 'lex non scripta be custom of course have in service for article of war can not provide for everything provide court martial for everything though replied jack yes with death dismissal from service of must be very agreeable have got into scrape although captain be evidently friend can not overlook fortunately be with master be of le consequence than with other officer still will have to submit for captain can not overlook will tell what jolliffe replied jack eye now begin to be opened to great many thing captain tell when be astonished at bad language that be zeal then found out that what be zeal in superior to inferior be insolence when reversed tell that article of war be made to equally guide master break what be positively mentioned in second article twenty time over go scot free while be to be punished because comply with what article mention how be to know ought to go to mast head for punishment particularly when captain tell that alone be to punish in ship if obey order in opposition to captain order be not that a bad a disobeying captain think have made out very strong case argument be not to be confuted be afraid that master will make out very strong case that argument will never be heard will be contrary to rule of justice according to rule of service do believe that be great fool observed jack after pause what do imagine made come to sea jolliffe because did not know when be well off replied mate drily be true enough reason be because thought must find equality here must not find on shore jolliffe stared dear boy heard say that obtained opinion from father mean disrespect to must be mad foolish if at age have not discovered that there be such thing in existence begin to think so replied jack doe not prove that there ought not to be beg pardon very non existence prof that ought not to be 'whatever be be right ' might a well expect to find perfect happiness perfection in individual father must be visionary best thing can do be to go home again dear easy best thing that can do be to stay in service for will soon put end to such nonsensical idea will make clever sensible fellow service be rough good school where everybody find level not level of equality level natural talent acquirement will rise sink to in proportion a be be noble service have imperfection a everything in world must have have little reason to speak in favour a far a be concerned for have be hard bread to there must be exception in rule think of quitting service until have given fair trial be aware that be only son father be man of property therefore in common parlance of world be independent believe man however rich be independent unless have profession will find better than notwithstanding what that will be most certainly sent to mast head to morrow will argue that point replied jack at event will go turn in to night chapter xiii in hero begin to act think for may have be jack thought at event did not spoil rest possessed in material of true philosopher there be great deal of weeding still required joliffe argument sensible a be have very little effect upon for strange to say be much more easy to shake man opinion when be wrong than when be right proving that be of very perverse nature well thought jack if be to go to mast head be be doe not prove that argument be not good only that will not be listened to then jack shut eye in few minute be fast asleep master have reported to first lieutenant first lieutenant to captain when came on board next morning conduct of mr easy who be sent for in cabin to hear if have anything to offer in extenuation of offence jack made oration lasted more than hour in argument have brought forward to jolliffe in preceding chapter be entered fully into mr jolliffe be then examined also mr smallsole be interrogated after captain first lieutenant be left alone sawbridge said captain wilson how true be that deviation from what be right invariably lead into scrape have done wrong wishing to get boy out of father hand fearful that must not join ship imagining to be by mean shrewd fellow that be in reality represented service in much more favourable light than must have done that say told did tell be who really led boy into error mr smallsole have behaved tyrannically unjustly punished lad for crime so that between master be now on horn of dilemma if punish boy feel that be punishing more for own fault fault of others than own if punish allow flagrant open violation of discipline to pas uncensured will be injurious to service must be punished sir replied sawbridge send for said captain jack made appearance with very polite bow mr easy a suppose that article of war contained rule regulation of service take for granted that have erred through ignorance recollect that although have erred through ignorance violation of discipline if passed unnoticed will have very injurious effect with men whose obedience be enforced by example shown to by officer feel so convinced of zeal showed other day in case of easthupp that be sure will see propriety of proving to men by punishing that discipline must be enforced will therefore send for on quarter deck order to go to mast head in presence of ship company a be in presence of ship company that refused with greatest pleasure captain wilson replied jack in future mr easy although will ever set face against recollect that if officer punishes imagine that be unfairly treated will submit to punishment then apply to for redress certainly sir replied jack now that be aware of wish will oblige mr easy by going on quarter deck wait there till come up jack made best bow exit old jolliffe told that must have to go said jack to be right so far hang if have best of argument be care about captain wilson sent for master reprimanded for oppression a be evident that there be ground for punishment forbade ever to mast head midshipman to report conduct to first lieutenant then proceeded to quarter deck calling for mr easy gave what appeared to be very severe reprimand jack looked upon very quietly because be zeal on captain part to give zeal on own to take hero be then ordered up to mast head jack took off hat took three four step in obedience to order then returned made best bow inquired of captain wilson whether wished to go to fore to mainmast head to main mr easy replied captain biting lip jack ascended three spoke of jacob ladder when again stopped took off hat beg pardon captain wilson have not informed whether be wish must go to topmast top gallant cross tree to top gallant cross tree mr easy replied captain jack ascended taking very easy stopped at main top for breath at main topmast head to look about at last gained spot agreed upon where seated taking out article of war commenced again to ascertain whether must not have strengthened argument have not however read through seventh article before hand be turned up up anchor mr sawbridge called hand down from aloft jack took hint folded up document came down a leisurely a went up jack be much better philosopher than father harpy be soon under way made sail steering for cape de catte where captain wilson hoped to pick up spanish vessel two on way to toulon to receive order of admiral succession of light breeze calm rendered passage very tedious boat be constantly out chasing vessel along shore jack usually asked to be employed on service indeed although so short time afloat be from age strength one of most effective midshipman to be trusted provided whim did not come into head hitherto jack have always be under order have always acquitted very well when harpy be at tarragona so happened that there be several case of dysentery in ship mr asper mr jolliffe be two of who be suffering reduced number of officer at same time have received information from men of fishing boat who to obtain own release have given intelligence that small convoy be coming down from rosa a soon a wind be fair under protection of two gun boat captain wilson kept well off shore until wind changed then allowing for time that vessel must take to run down distance between tarragona rosa steered in night to intercept again fell calm boat be therefore hoisted out with direction to proceed along shore a be supposed that vessel must not now be far distant mr sawbridge have command of expedition in pinnace first cutter be in charge of gunner mr linus a other officer be sick mr sawbridge who liked jack more more day at particular request gave command of second cutter a soon a heard of mesty declared to hero that must go with without permission be not possible jack obtained leave for mesty to go in lieu of marine there be many men sick of dysentery mr sawbridge be not sorry to take idler out of ship instead of working man especially a mesty be known to be good hand be ten o'clock at night when boat quitted ship a be possible that might not return till late next day one day biscuit rum be put on board that crew might not suffer from exhaustion boat pulled in shore then coasted for three hour without seeing anything night be fine overhead there be moon still continued calm men began to feel fatigued when just a be within mile of low point perceived convoy over land coming down with sail squared before light breeze mr sawbridge immediately ordered boat to lie upon oar awaiting coming arranging for attack white lateen sail of gun boat in advance be now plainly distinguishable from rest be huddled together in wake down came like beautiful swan in water sail just filled with wind running about three knot hour mr sawbridge kept three mast in one that might not be perceived winded boat with head same way so that might dash on board of with few stroke of oar so favourable be course of gun boat that stood right between launch on one bow two cutter on other be not perceived until be actually alongside resistance be trifling musket pistol have be fired alarm be given mr sawbridge took possession with crew of launch brought vessel to wind a perceived that at alarm convoy have done same directing cutter to board largest vessel secure a many a must while must do same with launch a brought to other gun boat have not yet be seen have be forgotten now made appearance came down in gallant manner to support of comrade mr sawbridge threw men into launch a carried heavy carronade sent to assist cutter have made right for gun boat smart firing of round grape be opened upon boat continued to advance upon officer commanding that gun boat finding that have support from consort concluding that have be captured hauled wind again stood out in offing hero pulled after although must not see other boat breeze have freshened pursuit be useless therefore directed course to convoy after hard pull contrived to get on board of one masted xebeque of about fifty ton mesty who have eye a sharp a needle have observed that when alarm be given several of convoy have not rounded point therefore proposed a vessel be very light that must make short tack with to weather point a if be escaping by mean be able particularly if fell calm again to capture others jack thought advice good convoy who have rounded point have stood out to seaward with gun boat have now fresh breeze to chase be therefore useless only chance be to do a mesty have proposed therefore stood out into breeze after hour tacked in shore fetched well to windward of low point finding vessel stood out again thus have made three four tack have gained perhaps six seven mile when perceived signal of recall made to leeward enforced with gun mr sawbridge want to come back mesty mr sawbridge mind own business replied mesty nebber take dis trubble to ply to windward for noting mesty must obey order yes sar when have thumb upon now must do what tink most proper by de power catch 'fore go back will lose ship find again by bye massa easy will think that be lost so much

suppose that have be sunk by fire of gun boat well what then have gun boat to show for night work will appear that there be harder fighting than there have be mr sawbridge may benefit by jack be very knowing fellow to have leant so much about service already well when discover that be not lost how glad will be to find especially if bring prize will do will not go back again be not often that one

towards mesty examined spanish vessel dat man of war massa easy what de debbel do for colour must hoist something mesty ran down below recollected that there be very gay petticoat have be left by old lady who be in vessel when captured be of green silk with yellow blue flower very faded having probably be in don family for century mesty have found under mattress of one of bed have put into bag intending probably to cut up into waistcoat soon appeared with under arm made fast to peak halyard hoisted up dere massa dat do very well dat what call nation colour ' everybody strike flag to dat men pull down said mesty anyhow now den ab hoist colour fire away mind only fire one gun at time point um well den ab time to load again be hoisted colour sir said sawbridge on board of harpy show out clear be impossible to distinguish there be gun be not at sir said midshipman be at spanish vessel saw shot fall ahead of must be privateer said captain wilson at event be very fortunate for corvette must otherwise have towed into carthagena gun round grape well pointed too carry heavy metal that craft must be maltese privateer be a much a to say that be pirate replied sawbridge can make nothing of colour appear to to be green must be turk gun devilish well aimed have hit boat yes be in confusion will have now if can only get trifle of wind be breeze coming up in offing trim sail mr sawbridge yard be squared harpy soon have steerage way in meantime jack few men have kept up steady well directed although slow fire with larboard gun upon spanish corvette two of boat have be disabled harpy brought breeze up with be soon within range steered to cut off corvette firing only on bow chaser ab now cried mesty fire away men take good aim breeze come now one man go to helm by de power what dat exclamation of mesty be occasioned by shot hulling ship on starboard side jack ran over perceived that three spanish gun boat have just made appearance round point have attacked fact be that on other side of cape be port town of carthagena gun boat have be sent out to assistance of corvette ship have now caught breeze fortunately for jack must probably have be taken into carthagena corvette finding cut off by harpy jack vessel a soon a breeze came up to put head other way tried to escape by running westward along coast close in shore shot then pierced hull of ship wounded two of jack men a corvette have turned harpy followed of course jack did same in ten minute be clear of gun boat who did not venture to make sail stand after wind now freshened fast blew out green petticoat harpy be exchanging broadside with corvette too busy to look after jack ensign spaniard defended well have assistance of battery a passed there be anchorage until have run many mile further about noon wind died away at one o'clock again fell nearly calm harpy have neared distance be now within three cable length of antagonist engaging battery of four gun jack came up again for have last of breeze be about mile from corvette when fell calm by advice of mesty did not fire anymore a otherwise harpy must not obtain so much credit be evident that fire of spaniard slackened fast at three o'clock spanish colour be hauled down harpy sending boat on board taking possession directed whole fire upon battery be soon silenced calm continued harpy be busy enough with prize shifting prisoner refitting vessel have very much suffered in sail rigging there be occasional wonder on board harpy what that strange vessel might be who have turned corvette enabled to capture when people be very busy there be not much time for surmise jack crew with consisted of eight one of be spaniard two be wounded therefore left four have also something to do be to assist wounded men secure gun moreover mesty did not think prudent to leave vessel mile from harpy with only two on board besides a jack said have have dinner be not quite sure that must find anything to eat when went into midshipman berth must therefore have dinner cooked eat before went on board in meantime must try close with jack took thing always very easy said must report at sunset there be other reason made jack in very great hurry to go on board wanted to have time to consider little what must say to excuse also how must plead for men natural correctness of feeling decided in first place to tell whole truth in next kind feeling determined to tell only part of jack need not have given trouble for a far a regarded have fourteen thousand good excuse in bag lay in state room a for men after action with enemy if behave well even mutiny be forgiven at last jack who be tired with excitement hard work of day thought thought until fell fast asleep instead of waking at sunset did not wake till two hour afterwards mesty did not call because be in hurry to go on board boil de kettle for de young gentleman when jack woke up be astonished to find that have slept so long went on deck be dark still calm must easily perceive that harpy corvette be still hove to repairing damage ordered men to lower down small boat leaving mesty in charge with two oar pulled to harpy what with wounded men with prisoner boat going coming between vessel everyone on board harpy be well employed in dark jack little boat came alongside without notice must not have be case be there be excuse for jack ascended side pushed way through prisoner who be being mustered to be victualled be wrapped up in one of gregos many of prisoner wore same jack be amused at not being recognised slipped down main ladder have to stoop under hammock of wounded men be about to go aft to captain cabin to report when heard young gossett cry out sound of rope hang if brute vigor ai thrashing young gossett thought jack dare say poor fellow have have plenty of since have be away will save time at least jack wrapped up in grego went to window of berth looked in found be a expected cried out in angry voice mr vigor will thank to leave gossett alone at sound of voice vigor turned round with colt in hand saw jack face at window impressed with idea that re appearance be supernatural uttered wail fell down in fit little gossett also trembling in limb stared with mouth open jack be satisfied immediately disappeared then went aft to cabin pushed by servant who be giving order from captain to officer on deck entering cabin where captain be seated with two spanish officer took off hat said come on board captain wilson captain wilson did not fall down in fit jumped up upset glass before merciful god mr easy where did come from from ship astern sir replied jack that ship astern what be where have be so long be long story sir replied jack captain wilson extended hand shook jack heartily at event be delighted to see boy now sit down tell story in few word will have in detail by bye if please sir said jack captured that ship with cutter night after went away be not first rate navigator be blown to zaffarine island where remained two month for want of hand a soon a procured made sail again have lost three men by shark have two wounded in to day fight ship mount twelve gun be half laden with lead cotton print have fourteen thousand dollar in cabin three shot hole right through sooner send people on board of better be not very intelligible that there be fourteen thousand dollar that required hand sent on board be very satisfactorily explained captain wilson rang bell sent for mr asper who started back at sight of hero desired to order mr jolliffe to go on board with one of cutter send wounded men on board take charge of vessel then told jack to accompany mr jolliffe to give information telling that must hear story to morrow when be not so very busy chapter xvii in hero find out that trigonometry be not only necessary to navigation may be required in settling affair of honour a captain wilson truly said be too busy even to hear jack story night for be anxious to have vessel ready to make sail a soon a breeze must spring up for spaniard have vessel of war at carthagena be not ten mile off have known result of action be therefore necessary to change position a soon a possible mr sawbridge be on board prize be corvette mounting two gun more than harpy called cacafuogo have escaped from cadiz run through strait in night be three mile from carthagena when be captured certainly never must have be for jack fortunately blundering against cape with armed vessel so captain wilson mr sawbridge of whom be promoted first to rank of post captain second to of commander may be said to be indebted to jack for good fortune harpy have lost nineteen men killed wounded spanish corvette forty seven altogether be very creditable affair at two o'clock in morning vessel be ready everything have be done must be done in so short time stood under easy sail during night for gibraltar nostra signora del carmen under charge of jolliffe keeping company jolliffe have advantage over shipmate of first hearing jack adventure with be much astonished a well a amused even captain wilson be not more happy to see jack than be worthy master mate about nine o'clock harpy hove to sent boat on board for hero men who have be so long with in prize then hoisted out pinnace to fetch on board dollar be of more importance jack a bade adieu to jolliffe took out of pocket presented with article of war a have be so useful to thought jolliffe must not do without then went down side men be already in boat casting imploring look upon jack to raise feeling of compassion mesty took seat by hero in very sulky humour probably because did not like idea of having again to boil de kettle for de young gentleman even jack felt little melancholy at resigning command looked back at green petticoat blew out gracefully from mast for jolliffe have determined that must not haul down colour under jack have fought so gallant action jack narration a may be imagined occupied large part of forenoon although jack did not attempt to deny that have seen recall signal of mr sawbridge yet a account went on captain became so interested that at end of quite forgot to point out to jack impropriety of not obeying order gave jack great credit for conduct be also much pleased with of mesty jack took opportunity of stating mesty aversion to present employment recommendation be graciously received jack also succeeded in obtaining pardon of men in consideration of subsequent good behaviour notwithstanding promise on part of captain wilson be ordered to be put in iron for present however jack told mesty mesty told men that must be released with reprimand when arrived at gibraltar so that men cared for be fair wind captain wilson informed jack that after joining admiral have be sent to malta with prize that supposing cutter to have be sunk have written to father acquainting with son death at hero be much grieved for knew what sorrow must occasion particularly to poor mother thought jack if be unhappy for three month will be overjoyed for three more when hears that be alive so will be square at end of six a soon a arrive at gibraltar will write a wind be fair will be to morrow next day after long conversation jack be graciously dismissed captain wilson being satisfied from what have heard that jack must turn out very good officer have already forgotten about equality right of man there captain wilson be mistaken tare sown in infancy be not so soon rooted out jack went on deck a soon a captain have dismissed found captain officer of spanish corvette standing aft looking very seriously at nostra signora del carmen when saw hero whom captain wilson have told be young officer who have barred entrance into carthagena turned eye upon not quite so graciously a might have done jack with usual politeness took off hat to spanish captain glad to have opportunity of sporting spanish expressed usual wish that might live thousand year spanish captain who have reason to wish jack have gone to devil at least twenty four hour before be equally complimentary then begged to be informed what colour be that jack have hoisted during action jack replied that be colour to spanish gentleman considered disgrace to surrender although always ready to engage frequently attempting to board upon spanish captain be very much puzzled captain wilson who understood little spanish then interrupted by observing by bye mr easy what colour did hoist up must not make out see mr jolliffe still keep up at peak yes sir replied jack rather puzzled what to call at last replied that be banner of equality right of man captain wilson frowned jack perceiving that be displeased then told whole story whereupon captain wilson laughed jack then also explained in spanish to officer of corvette who replied that be not first time must not be last that men have got into scrape through petticoat spanish captain complimented jack on spanish be really very good for in two month with nothing else in world to do have made great progress asked where have learnt jack replied at zaffarine island zaffarine isle replied spanish captain be not inhabited plenty of ground shark replied jack spanish captain thought hero very strange fellow to fight under green silk petticoat to take lesson in spanish from ground shark however being quite a polite a jack did not contradict took huge pinch of snuff wishing from bottom of heart that ground shark have taken jack before have hoisted that confounded green petticoat however jack be in high favour with captain ship company with exception of four enemy master vigor boatswain purser steward a for mr vigor have come to sens again have put colt in chest until jack must take cruise little gossett at insulting remark made by vigor pointed to window of berth grinned very recollection made vigor turn pale awed into silence in two day arrived at gibraltar mr sawbridge rejoined ship so did mr jolliffe remained there fortnight during jack be permitted to be continually on shore mr asper accompanied jack drew heavy bill to prove to father that be still alive mr sawbridge made hero relate to adventure be so pleased with conduct of mesty that appointed to situation be particularly suited to that of ship corporal mr sawbridge knew that be office of trust provided that must find man fit for be very indifferent about colour mesty walked strutted about at least three inch taller than be before be always clean did duty conscientiously seldom used cane think mr easy said first lieutenant that a be so particularly fond of taking cruise for jack have told whole truth might be a well that improve navigation do think sir replied jack with great modesty be not yet quite perfect well then mr jolliffe will teach be most competent in ship sooner ask better if learn a fast a have spanish will not give much trouble jack thought advice good next day be very busy with friend jolliffe made important discovery that two parallel line continued to infinity must never meet must not be supposed captain wilson mr sawbridge received promotion instanter promotion be always attended with delay a there be certain routine in service must not be departed from captain wilson have order to return to malta after cruise therefore carried own despatch away from england from despatch have to be forwarded to toulon to admiral then admiral have to send to england to admiralty whose reply have to come out again with delay arising from vessel not sailing immediately occupied interval of between five six month during time there be alteration in officer crew of majesty sloop harpy there have however be one alteration gunner mr linus who have charge of first cutter in night action in hero be separated from ship carelessly loading musket have found minus right hand upon musket going off a rammed down have gone off too be invalided sent home during jack absence have be appointed whose name be tallboy mr tallboy be stout dumpy man with red face still redder hand have red hair red whisker have read great deal for mr tallboy considered that gunner be most important personage in ship have once be captain clerk having distinguished very much in cutting out service have applied for received warrant a gunner have studied art of gunnery part of understood remainder be above comprehension continued however to read a before thinking that by constant reading must understand at last have gone through work from title page to finis at least forty time have just commenced over again never came on deck without gunner vade mecum in pocket with hand always upon to refer to in moment mr tallboy have a observed before great idea of importance of gunner among other qualification considered absolutely necessary that must be navigator have at least ten instance to bring forward of bloody action in captain commissioned officer have be killed wounded command of ship have devolved upon gunner now sir must say if gunner be navigator be not fit to take charge of majesty ship boatswain carpenter be merely practical men gunner sir be ought to be scientific gunnery sir be science have own disparts line of sight windage parabola projectile force point blank reduction of powder upon graduated scale now sir there be excuse for gunner not being navigator for knowing duty a gunner have same mathematical tool to work with upon principle mr tallboy have added john hamilton moore to library have advanced about a far into navigation a have in gunnery be to threshold where stuck fast with mathematical tool did not know how to use to do justice studied for two three hour day be not fault if did not advance head be confused with technical term mixed up together disparts sine cosine parabola tangent windage second line of sight logarithm projectile traverse sailing quadrature gunter scale be crowded together in brain have not capacity to receive rule of three too much learning said festus to apostle hath made thee mad mr tallboy have not wit enough to go mad learning lay like lead upon brain more read le understood at same time that became more satisfied with supposed acquirement must not speak in mathematical parable understand mr easy said gunner to one day after have sailed for malta that have entered into science of navigation at age be high time yes replied jack can raise perpendicular at event box compass yes have not yet arrived at dispart of compass not come to yet replied jack be aware that ship sailing describes parabola round globe not come to yet replied jack that propelled body striking against fly off at tangent very likely replied jack be beine ' that like have not yet entered into 'acute ' trigonometry not come to yet replied jack will require very sharp attention must think so replied jack will then find out how parallel of longitude latitude meet two parallel line if continued to infinity will never meet replied jack beg pardon said gunner beg yours said jack whereupon mr tallboy brought up small map of world showed jack that parallel of latitude met at point at top bottom parallel line never meet replied jack producing hamilton moore whereupon jack gunner argued point until be agreed to refer case to mr jolliffe who asserted with smile line be parallel not parallel a be right be satisfied be fortunate that jack must argue in instance have believed confused assertion of gunner must have be a puzzled a gunner never met without argument reference a jack be put right in end only learnt faster by time that did know something about navigation discovered that antagonist knew nothing before arrived at malta jack must fudge day work at malta jack got into scrape although mr smallsole must not injure be still jack enemy more so a jack have become very popular vigor also submitted planning revenge party in instance be boatswain purser steward jack still continued forecastle conversation with mesty boatswain purser steward probably from respective ill will towards hero have become great ally mr easthupp now put on best jacket to walk dog watch with mr biggs took opportunity to talk at hero be peculiar hopinion said mr easthupp one evening pulling at frill of shirt that gentleman must behave a gentleman that if gentleman professes opinion of inequality such liberal sentiment that be bound a gentleman to hact up to very true mr easthupp be bound to act up to not because person who be gentleman a well a happens not to be on quarter deck to insult because only have perfessed opinion like own hereupon mr biggs struck rattan against funnel looked at hero yes continued purser steward must like to see fellow who must have done so on shore however time will come when can hagain pull on plain coat then insult will be vashed out in blood mr biggs will be cursed if day teach lesson to blackguard who stole trouser va hall money right mr biggs inquired purser steward did count replied boatswain magnificently gentleman be habove that replied easthupp there be many light fingered gentry about quantity of vatches harticles of value vich be lost ven valked bond street in former time be incredible can say at event replied boatswain must be always ready to give satisfaction to person beneath in rank after have insulted stand upon rank although talk about equality damme consort with nigger be too plain for hero not to understand so jack walked up to boatswain taking hat off with utmost politeness said to if mistake not mr biggs conversation refers to very likely doe replied boatswain listener hear good of appears that gentleman ca converse without being vatched continued mr easthupp pulling up shirt collar be not first time that have thought proper to make very offensive remark mr biggs a appear to consider ill treated in affair of trouser for tell at once that be who brought on board can only say continued hero with very polite bow that will be most happy to give satisfaction be superior officer mr easy replied boatswain yes by rule of service just now asserted that must waive rank indeed dispute on occasion be on quarter deck be not be gentleman whom have insulted mr easy replied boatswain pointing to purser steward yes mr heasy quite a good gentleman a although av ad misfortune ham of a old family a hany in country replied mr easthupp now backed by boatswain many year did valk bond street ave a good blood in weins a mr heasy halthough have be misfortunate have have admiral in family have grossly insulted gentleman said mr biggs in continuation notwithstanding talk of equality be afraid to give satisfaction shelter under quarter deck mr biggs replied hero who be now very wroth will go on shore directly arrive at malta let fellow put on plain clothes will meet then will show whether be afraid to give satisfaction one at time said boatswain sir not one at time at same time will fight none if be superior officer must descend replied jack with ironical sneer to meet will not descend to meet that fellow whom believe to have be little better than pickpocket accidental hit of jack made purser steward turn pale a sheet then equally red raved foamed amazingly although must not meet jack indignant look who then turned round again now mr biggs be to be understood do shelter under forecastle be dodger replied boatswain will settle affair at malta at reply jack returned to mesty massa easy look at um face dat fellow eastop like go shore wid see fair play anyhow suppose can mr biggs having declared that must fight of course have to look out for second fixed upon mr tallboy gunner requested to be friend mr tallboy who have be latterly very much annoyed by jack victory over in science of navigation therefore felt ill will towards consented be very much puzzled how to arrange three be to fight at same time for have idea of there being two duel so went to cabin commenced reading jack on other hand dared not say word to jolliffe on subject indeed there be one in ship to whom must confide gascoigne therefore went to although gascoigne thought be excessively 'infra dig ' of jack to meet even boatswain a challenge have be given there be retracting therefore consented like midshipman anticipating fun quite thoughtless of consequence second day after have be anchored in valette harbour boatswain gunner jack gascoigne obtained permission to go on shore mr easthupp purser steward dressed in best blue coat with brass button velvet collar very one in have be taken up when have be vowing protesting that be gentleman at very time that hand be abstracting pocket book went up on quarter deck requested same indulgence mr sawbridge refused a required to return stave hoop at cooperage mesty also much to mortification be not to be spared be awkward be got over by proposing that meeting must take place behind cooperage at certain hour on mr easthupp might slip out borrow portion of time appropriated to duty to heal breach in wounded honour so party went on shore put up at one of small inn to make necessary arrangement mr tallboy then addressed mr gascoigne taking apart while boatswain amused with glass of grog hero sat outside teasing monkey mr gascoigne said gunner have be very much puzzled how duel must be fought have at last found out see that there be three party to fight have there be two four there must have be difficulty a right line square might guide in instance must arrange upon triangle in gascoigne stared must not imagine what be coming be aware mr gascoigne of property of equilateral triangle yes replied midshipman that have three equal side what devil have that to do with duel everything mr gascoigne replied gunner have resolved great difficulty indeed duel between three can only be fought upon principle observe said gunner taking piece of chalk out of pocket making triangle on table in figure have three point equidistant from other have three combatant so that placing one at point be fair play for three mr easy for instance stand here boatswain here purser steward at third corner now if distance be fairly measured will be all right then replied gascoigne delighted at idea how be to fire certainly be not of much consequence replied gunner still a sailor appears to that must fire with sun be mr easy fire at mr biggs mr biggs fire at mr easthupp mr easthupp fire at mr easy so that perceive that party have shot at one at same time receives fire of gascoigne be in ecstasy at novelty of proceeding more so a perceived that easy obtained advantage by arrangement upon word mr tallboy give great credit have profound mathematical head be delighted with arrangement of course in affair principal be bound to comply with arrangement of second will insist upon mr easy consenting to excellent scientific proposal gascoigne went out pulling jack away from monkey told what gunner have proposed at jack laughed heartily gunner also explained to boatswain who did not very well comprehend replied dare say be right shot for shot d n favour party then repaired to spot with two pair of ship pistol mr tallboy have smuggled on shore a soon a be on ground gunner called mr easthupp out of cooperage in meantime gascoigne have be measuring equilateral triangle of twelve pace marked out mr tallboy on return with purser steward went over ground finding that be equal angle subtended by equal side declared that be all right easy took station boatswain be put into mr easthupp who be quite in mystery be led by gunner to third position mr tallboy said purser steward understand mr easy will first fight mr biggs will not replied gunner be duel of three will fire at mr easy mr easy will fire at mr biggs mr biggs will fire at be arranged mr easthupp said mr easthupp understand why be mr biggs to fire at have quarrel with mr biggs because mr easy fire at mr biggs mr biggs must have shot a well if have ever be in company of gentleman mr easthupp observed gascoigne must know something about duelling yes yes have kept best company mr gascoigne can give gentleman satisfaction then sir if be case must know that honour be in hand of second that gentleman appeal yes yes know that mr gascoigne still have quarrel with mr biggs therefore mr biggs of course will not aim at why think that be going to be fired at for nothing replied boatswain will have shot anyhow at friend mr biggs same will fire at somebody shot for shot hit luckiest vel gentleman purtest against proceeding replied mr easthupp came here to have satisfaction from mr easy not to be fired at by mr biggs have satisfaction when fire at mr easy replied gunner what more must have purtest against mr biggs firing at so must have shot without receiving one cried gascoigne fact be that fellow confounded coward ought to be kicked into cooperage again at affront mr easthupp rallied accepted pistol offered by gunner ear word mr biggs pretty language to use to gentleman will ear from sir a soon a ship be paid off purtest no longer mr tallboy death before dishonour be gentleman damme at event swell be not very courageous gentleman for trembled most exceedingly a pointed pistol gunner gave word a if be exercising great gun on board ship cock lock take good aim at object fire stop vent only one of combatant who appeared to comply with latter supplementary order be mr easthupp who clapped hand to trouser behind gave loud yell then dropped down bullet having passed clean through seat of honour from having presented broadside a target to boatswain a faced towards hero jack shot have also taken effect having passed through boatswain cheek without further mischief than extracting two of best upper double teeth forcing through hole of further cheek boatswain own quid of tobacco a for mr easthupp ball a be very unsettled shut eye before fired have gone lord know where purser steward lay on ground screamed boatswain spit double teeth two three mouthful of blood out then threw down pistol in rage pretty business by god sputtered be put pipe out how devil be to pipe to dinner when be ordered wind escaping through cheek in meantime others have gone to assistance of purser steward who continued vociferation examined considered wound in part not to be dangerous hold confounded bawling cried gunner will have guard down here be not hurt have hi roared steward oh let die let die move nonsense cried gunner must get up walk down to boat if will leave hold tongue confound wo then will give something to halloo for whereupon mr tallboy commenced cuffing poor wretch right left who received so many swinging box of ear that be soon reduced to merely pitiful plaint of oh dear such inhumanity purtest oh dear must get up ca indeed think can move mr tallboy said gascoigne must think best plan must be to call up two of men from cooperage let take at once to hospital gunner went down to cooperage to call men mr biggs who have bound up face a if have toothache for bleeding have be very slight came up to purser steward what hell be making such howling about look at with two shot hole through figure head while have only got one in stem wish must change with by heaven for must use whistle then now if attempt to pipe there will be such wasteful expenditure of majesty store of wind that never will get out note wicked shot of yours mr easy really be very sorry replied jack with polite bow beg to offer best apology during conversation purser steward felt very faint thought be going to die oh dear oh dear what fool be never be gentleman only swell will die never will pick pocket again never never god forgive why confound fellow cried gascoigne so be pickpocket be never will again replied fellow in faint voice hi will hamend lead good life drop of water oh lagged at last then poor wretch fainted away mr tallboy coming up with men be taken on shoulder walked off to hospital attended by gunner also boatswain who thought might a well have little medical advice before went on board well easy said gascoigne collecting pistol tying up in handkerchief will be shot be in pretty scrape there be hushing up will be hanged if care be best piece of fun ever met with at remembrance of gascoigne laughed till tear ran down cheek jack mirth be not quite so excessive a be afraid that purser steward be severely hurt expressed fear at event did not hit replied gascoigne have to answer for be boatswain mug think have stopped jaw for future be afraid that leave will be stopped for future replied jack that may take oath of replied gascoigne then look ned said easy have lot of dollar may a well be hanged for sheep a lamb a saying be vote that go on board sawbridge will send fetch replied ned must find first wo take long for soldier will soon have description rout out will be pinned in couple of day confound say that ship be to be hove down that will be here six week at least cooped up on board in broiling sun nothing to do to watch pilot fish playing round rudder munch bad apricot wo go on board look'ye jack said gascoigne have plenty of money have twenty doubloon besides dollar replied jack well then will pretend to be so much alarmed at result of duel that dare not show lest must be hung will write note send to jolliffe to say that have hid until affair be blown over beg to intercede with captain first lieutenant will tell particular refer to gunner for truth of then know that although must be punished will only laugh will pretend easthupp be killed be frightened out of life will be then let get on board one of speronares come with fruit from sicily sail in night for palermo then will have cruise for fortnight when money be gone will come back be capital idea ned sooner do better will write to captain begging to get off from being hung telling where have fled to that letter will be given after have sailed be two very nice lad hero gascoigne chapter xviii in hero set off on cruise in be not blown off shore gascoigne hero be of in uniform hastened to nix mangare stair where soon picked up padrone of speronare went with into wine shop with assistance of little english from maltese boy whose shirt hung out of trouser made bargain by be agreed that for consideration of two doubloon must sail that evening land at gergentif other town in sicily providing with something to eat gregos to sleep upon two midshipman then went back to tavern from have set off to fight duel ordering good dinner to be served in back room amused with killing fly a talked over event of day waited for dinner a mr tallboy did not think proper to go on board till evening mr biggs also wished to be dark before went up ship side event of duel did not transpire till next morning even then be not known from boatswain gunner by hospital mate coming on board to inform surgeon that there be one of men wounded under charge that be doing very well mr biggs have ascended side with face bound up confound that jack easy said have only be on leave twice since sailed from portsmouth once be obliged to come up side without trouser show bare stem to whole ship company now be coming up dare not show figure head reported to officer of watch hastening to cabin went to bed lay whole night awake from pain thinking what excuse must possibly make for not coming on deck next morning to duty be however saved trouble for mr jolliffe brought letter of gascoigne up to mr sawbridge captain have received that of hero captain wilson came on board found that mr sawbridge must communicate particular of have not be acquainted by jack after have read over gascoigne letter in cabin interrogated mr tallboy who be sent down under arrest gave free vent to mirth upon soul there be end to mr easy adventure said captain must laugh at duel for after be nothing must have be let off with severe reprimand foolish boy have set off in speronare to sicily how devil be to get back again will come back sir replied sawbridge when money gone yes if get into more scrape that young scamp gascoigne be a bad a easy now be together there be saying what may happen dine at governor to day how will laugh when tell of new way of fighting duel yes sir be just thing will tickle old tom must find out if have got off island sawbridge may not be case be case jack gascoigne have eaten ye good dinner sent for monkey to amuse till be dark there have waited till padrone came to what will do with pistol easy take with load before go may want who know there may be mutiny on board of speronare wish have mesty with loaded pistol took pair put in waist concealed under clothes divided ammunition between soon afterwards padrone came to tell be ready whereupon messrs gascoigne easy paid there bill rose to depart padrone informed that must like to see colour of money before went on board jack very indignant at insinuation that have not sufficient cash pulled out handful of doubloon tossing two to padrone asked if be satisfied padrone untied sash put in money with many thanks protestation of service begged young gentleman to accompany did so in few minute be clear of nix mangare stair passing close to majesty ship harpy be soon out of harbour of valette of variety of vessel float upon wave there be not perhaps one bound over water so gracefully so lightly a speronare one so picturesque beautiful to eye of who watch progress night be clear star shone out brilliantly a light craft skimmed over water fragment of desert waning moon threw soft beam upon snow white sail vessel have deck be full of basket have contained grape various fruit brought from ancient granary of rome still a fertile a luxuriant a ever crew consisted of padrone two men boy three latter with gregos night great coat with hood sitting forward before sail with eye fixed on land a flew past point after point thinking perhaps of wife perhaps of sweetheart perhaps not thinking at padrone remained aft at helm offering politeness to two young gentleman who only wished to be left alone at last requested padrone to give gregos to lie down upon a wished to go to sleep called boy to take helm procured required then went forward two midshipman laid down looking at star above for minute without exchanging word at last jack commenced have be thinking gascoigne that be very delightful heart bound with vessel almost appears to a if vessel herself be rejoicing in liberty here be capering over wave instead of being tied by nose with cable anchor be touch of sentimental jack replied gascoigne be more free than be when at anchor for now be forced to act in obedience to steersman go just where plea may just a well say that horse if taken out of stable be free with curb rider on back be touch of rational ned destroys illusion never mind be free at event what machine be on board of man of war walk talk eat drink sleep get up just like clock work be wound up to go twenty four hour then wound up again just like old smallsole doe chronometer very true jack doe not appear to that hitherto have kept very good time require little more regulating said gascoigne how can expect piece of machinery to go well so damnably knocked about a midshipman be replied hero very true jack sometimes keep time for keep watch mr asper wind up go at because allows to go down still do go ned yes to hammock be go with old smallsole if want bit of caulk jack what do say will keep watch to night why to tell truth have be thinking same thing much like look of padrone squint that be proof of anything jack except eye be not straight if like look of can tell that very much liked look of doubloon saw start eye twinkled thought at time be pity have not paid in dollar be very foolish in at event have not seen saw quite enough ned very true must have let see pistol not have let see doubloon well if wish to take what have seen will receive what have not seen why there be only four

proposition well then suppose keep body on board run into seaport go to authority state fact what then will prove beyond doubt that have killed three men if not four will not prove that be obliged so to do jack then be heretic will be put in prison till be satisfied of innocence never can prove there will remain until have written to malta man of war come to redeem if be not stabbed something else

be duly administered party be tried convicted then be sentenced to punishment grant that in instance attempt have be clearly proved be witness be judge jury society in general for best of possible reason because there be nobody else men life being therefore forfeited to society belong to doe not follow because be not killed in attempt therefore be not now to be brought out for punishment a there be common hangman here of course must do duty a well a other have now clearly proved that be justified in what be about to do argument doe not stop there self preservation be first law of nature if get rid of man what be consequence that will have to account for being wounded then instead of judge will immediately be placed in position of culprit have to defend without witness therefore risk life from misplaced lenity towards wretch unworthy to live last argument be strong easy can not consent to doing what may occasion uneasiness hereafter when think of pooh nonsense be philosopher of what school jack oh presume be disciple of mesty mean to say that be wrong still hear proposition let lower down sail then can leave to assist will clear vessel of everything except man who be still alive at event may wait little if at last there be help for will then agree with to launch overboard even if be not quite dead agreed even by own making out will be no great sin be half dead already only do work of tossing over so will be only quarter murder on part must have shown quarter on here jack left off arguing punning went forward lowered down sail have mind to take doubloon back said

philosopher must not have gone to sea so that be father fault have killed four men off coast of sicily without knowing cause effect after there be nothing like argument so having settled point let go to dinner having finished meal jack went forward observed land ahead steered same course for three four hour must haul wind more said gascoigne will not do to put into small town have now to choose whether will land on coast sink speronare land at large town must argue that point replied jack in meantime do take helm for arm be quite tired replied gascoigne can steer well enough by bye may a

easy must lower down take in reef sooner better for will be dark in hour go forward lower down then will help jack did so sail went into water must not drag in avast heaving said gascoigne till throw up take wind out of be done reefed sail must not hoist up if gascoigne left helm to help jack sail filled if went to helm took wind out of sail jack be not strong enough to hoist wind increased rapidly sea got up sun went down with sail half hoisted must not keep to wind be obliged to run right for land speronare flew rising on crest of wave with keel clear of water moon be already up gave light enough to perceive that be not five mile from coast be lined with foam at event ca accuse of running away with boat observed jack for be running away with yes replied gascoigne dragging at tiller with strength have taken bit between teeth must care if have bit between mine replied jack for feel devilish hungry again what do say ned with heart replied gascoigne do know easy may be last

very true lee shore be joke may be knocked to piece a well a boat even swimming may not help if must find cove sandy beach might perhaps manage to get on shore well replied jack have not be long at sea of course can not know much about thing have be blown off shore never have be blown on may be a say see great danger let run right up on beach at once be what will try to do replied gascoigne who have be four year at sea knew very well what be about jack handed huge piece of bread sausage thank ye can not eat can replied jack with mouth full jack ate while gascoigne steered rapidity with speronare rushed to beach be almost frightful darted like arrow from wave to wave appeared a if mocking attempt a curled summit almost over narrow stern be within mile of beach when jack who have finished supper be looking at foam boiling on coast exclaimed that be very fine very beautiful upon soul care for nothing thought gascoigne appears to have idea of danger now dear fellow said gascoigne in few minute will be on rock must continue at helm for higher be forced up better chance for may not meet again so if good bye god bless gascoigne said jack be hurt be not shoulder be stiff can hardly move left arm now can steer for rock a well a do go to bow there will have better chance by bye continued picking up pistol sticking into waist wo leave have served too good turn already gascoigne give helm easy say yes replied jack in loud authoritative tone what be more will be obeyed gascoigne have nerve if have knowledge at event can steer for beach tell give helm well then if wo must take easy wrested tiller from gascoigne hand gave shove forward now do look out ahead tell how to steer may have be gascoigne feeling at behaviour of hero immediately occurred to that must not do better than to run speronare to safest point that therefore be probably more advantageously employed than if be at helm went forward looked at rock covered at one moment with tumultuous water then pouring down cascade from side a wave recoiled perceived chasm right ahead thought if boat be steered for must be thrown up so a to enable to get clear of for at other part escape appeared impossible starboard little will do steady port be port steer small for life easy steady now mind yard hit head hold on speronare be at moment thrown into large cleft in rock side of be nearly perpendicular nothing else must have saved a have struck rock outside boat must have be dashed to piece fragment have disappeared in undertow a be cleft be not four foot more than width of boat a wave hurled up into yard of speronare be thrown fore aft with great violence have not jack be warned must have be struck overboard without chance of being saved crouched down passed over a water receded boat struck be nearly dry between rock wave followed dashing boat further up at same time filling with water bow of boat be now several foot higher than stem where jack held on weight of water in with force of returning wave separated right across abaft mast jack perceived that after part of boat be going out again with wave caught hold of yard have swung fore aft a clung to part of boat on have stood disappeared from under be swept away by returning current jack required utmost of strength to maintain position until wave floated dashed higher up knew life depended on holding on to yard did although under water advanced several foot when wave receded found footing on rock still clinging walked till have gained fore part of boat be wedged firmly into narrow part of cleft next wave be not very large have gained so much that did not throw off leg reached rock a climbed up side of chasm to gain ledge above perceived gascoigne standing above holding out hand to assistance well say jack shaking to get rid of water here be ashore at last have idea of anything like rush back of water be so strong that have almost tom arm out of socket how very lucky sent forward with disabled shoulder by bye now that be over must see be right beg to apologise for rudeness there need apology for saving life easy replied gascoigne trembling with cold one must ever have thought of making one at moment wonder whether ammunition dry said jack put in hat jack took off hat found cartridge have not suffered now then gascoigne what will do hardly know replied gascoigne suppose then sit down argue point thank there will be too much cold water thrown upon argument be half dead let walk on with heart said jack be devilish steep can argue up hill down hill wet dry be used to for a told before ned father be philosopher so be by lord be replied gascoigne a walked on chapter xix in hero follows destiny form tableau hero comrade climbed precipice after minute severe toil arrived at summit when sat down to recover sky be clear although gale blew strong have extensive view of coast lashed by angry wave be opinion ned said jack a surveyed expanse of troubled water that be just a well out of agree with jack be also opinion that must be just a well out of for wind blow through one suppose go little further inland where may find shelter till morning be rather dark to find anything rejoined hero however westerly gale on top of mountain with wet clothes in middle of night with nothing to eat drink be not most comfortable position in world may change for better proceeded over flat of hundred yard then descended change in atmosphere be immediate a continued march inland came to high road appeared to run along shore turned into for a jack said very truly road must lead to something after quarter of hour walk again heard rolling of surf perceived white wall of house here be at last said jack wonder if one will turn out to take in will stow away for night in one of vessel hauled up on beach recollect time easy said gascoigne not to show money be show only dollar say have more promise to pay when arrive at palermo if will neither trust give to must make out a can how cursed dog bark think will do very well time gascoigne look a if be worth robbing at event have pistol to defend with if be attacked depend upon will show more gold now let make arrangement take one pistol take gold have in right hand pocket dollar pistarenes in left will take half of too have silver enough to go on with till be in safe place jack then divided money in dark also gave pistol now then will knock for admittance let first walk through village see if there be anything like inn yelping cur will soon be at heel come nearer nearer time there be cart be full of straw suppose go to bed till to morrow morning will be warm at event yes replied gascoigne sleep much better than in of cottage have be in sicily before have idea how flea bite two midshipman climbed up into cart nestled into straw rather indian corn leaf be soon fast asleep a have not slept for two night be not to be wondered at slept soundly so soundly indeed that about two hour after have got into comfortable bed peasant who have brought to village cask of wine to be shipped taken down coast in felucca yoked bullock not being aware of freight drove off without in way disturbing repose although road in sicily be not yet macadamised jolting of road rather increased than disturbed sleep of adventurer although there be rude shock only have effect of making fancy in dream that be again in boat that be still dashing against rock in about two hour cart arrived at destination peasant unyoked bullock led away same cause will often produce contrary effect stopping of motion of cart disturbed rest of two midshipman turned round in straw yawned spread out arm then awoke gascoigne who felt considerable pain in shoulder be first to recall scattered sens easy cried a sat up shook off corn leaf port be said jack half dreaming come easy be not on board now rouse bit jack then sat up looked at gascoigne forage in cart be so high round that must not see above rubbed eye yawned looked at other have faith in dream said jack to gascoigne because have very queer one last night well so have replied gascoigne dreamt that cart rolled by into sea went away with right in wind eye back to malta considering that never be built for such service behaved uncommonly well now what be dream mine be that woke up found ourselves in very town from speronare have sailed that have found fore part of speronare among rock have recognised picked up one of pistol that have laid hold of have insisted that have be thrown on shore in boat asked what have become of crew be just seizing when awoke dream be more likely to come true than mine easy still think need not fear that at same time have better not remain here longer occurs to that if tore clothes more must be advisable will in first place look more wretched in next place can replace with dress of country so travel without exciting suspicion know that can speak italian pretty well have objection to tear clothes if wish replied jack at same time give pistol will draw charge load again must be wet having reloaded pistol rent garment two midshipman stood up in cart looked about halloo why how be gascoigne last night be close to beach among house now where devil be dreamt nearer mark than did for cart have certainly taken cruise must have slept like midshipman then replied gascoigne surely can not have gone far here be surrounded by hill on side for at least couple of mile surely good genius have transported into interior that might escape from relative of crew whom dreamt about said jack looking at gascoigne a afterwards be known to speronare have sailed from very seaport in have arrived that night where have got into cart wreck of speronare have be found have be recognised be considered by inhabitant that padrone crew have perished in gale have found two midshipman questioned be not improbable that suspicion might have be excited result have be such a hero have conjured up in dream a said before there be peculiar providence for midshipman on minute survey found that be in open space apparently have be used for thrashing winnowing maize that cart be standing under clump of tree in shade there ought to be house hereabouts said gascoigne must think that behind tree will find one come jack be a hungry a be will answer for must look out for breakfast somewhere if wo give something to eat sell replied jack who be ravenous clutching pistol will take consider robbery fruit of earth be made for never be intended that one man must have superfluity starve law of equality may appear very good argument to starving man grant still wo prevent fellow creature from hanging replied gascoigne none of confounded nonsense jack man starves with money in pocket a long a have leave have none to talk about equality right of man must like to argue point with gascoigne tell do prefer sitting down here to argue to look out for breakfast jack oh argument may be put off hunger can not be very good philosophy jack so let go on went through copse of wood be very thick soon discovered wall of large house on other side right said jack still let reconnoitre be not farmhouse must belong to person of consequence better will see that be gentleman notwithstanding tattered dress suppose be to stick to story of sea mew at gozo yes replied gascoigne can think of nothing better english be well received in island have troop at palermo have wish be sitting down at mess table what be that woman screaming yes by heaven come along ned away dashed jack towards house followed by gascoigne a advanced scream redoubled entered porch burst into room from whence proceeded found elderly gentleman defending against two young men who be held back by elderly young lady hero comrade have drawn pistol just a burst open door old gentleman who

same to other be very dramatic tableau two woman flew to elderly gentleman raised up two assailant being held just a dog hold pig by ear trembling with fright with point of rapier dropped looked at midshipman muzzle of pistol with equal dismay at same time astonishment of elderly gentleman woman at unexpected deliverance be equally great there be silence for few second ned at last said jack tell chap to drop sword fire gascoigne gave order in italian be complied with midshipman then possessed of rapier gave young men liberty elderly gentleman at last broke silence must appear signor that there be special interference of providence to prevent from committing foul unjust murder who be who have so opportunely come to rescue know not thanking a do now think that will yourselves when be calm also thank for having prevented from committing act must have loaded with remorse embittered future existence gentleman be free to depart don silvio have indeed disappointed gratitude must have

like for be quintessence of brunette beauty figure be equally perfect although not having yet completed fifteenth year required still little more development donna clara be extremely gracious a perhaps be aware that voice must drown that of husband proposed to hero to walk in garden in few minute took seat in pavilion at end of old lady did not talk much spanish when at loss for word put in italian one jack understood perfectly well told sister have married spanish nobleman many year since that before war broke out between spanish english have gone over with child to see when wished to

not attending to what passed when hero mother sat down in pavilion joined then when jack addressed with usual politeness be almost ashamed to be sitting by donna agnes in ragged dress rock of coast have respect for person be under great obligation signor regard such trifle be kindness signora replied jack little thought morning of good fortune can tell fortune of others not own can tell fortune replied old lady yes madame be famous for will tell daughter hers donna agnes looked at hero smiled perceive that young lady doe not believe must prove art by telling of what have already happened to signora will then give credit certainly if do replied agnes oblige by showing palm of hand agnes extended little hand jack felt so very polite that be nearly kissing however restrained examining line

agnes looked at hero after minute appeared to recognise oh mother 't be recollect now 't be who child replied donna clara who have be struck dumb with jack astonishing power of fortune telling officer who captured be so kind jack burst out into laughter not to be controlled for minute then acknowledged that have discovered at event donna agnes said at last acknowledge ragged a be have seen in much greater dishabille agnes sprang up took to heel that might hide confusion at same time go to father tell who have a guest although don rebiera have not yet finished narrative announcement of agnes who ran in breathless to communicate immediately brought party together jack received thanks little thought said don must have be so doubly indebted to sir command service a please of son be at palermo trust will allow pleasure of friendship when be tired of remaining with jack made politest bow then with shrug of shoulder looked down upon habiliment to please gascoigne have torn into riband a much a to say be not provided for lengthened stay brother clothes will fit think said agnes to father have left plenty in wardrobe if signor will condescend to wear till can replace own midshipman be very condescending followed don rebiera condescended to put on clean shirt belonging to don philip don martin also to put on trouser to select best waistcoat coat in short condescended to have regular fit out so happened that fit out be not far from regular fit having condescended then descended intimacy between party became so great that appeared a if not only wore young men clothes also stood in shoe having thus made presentable jack presented hand to lady led into garden don rebiera might finish long story to gascoigne without further interruption resuming seat in pavilion entertained lady with history of cruise in ship after capture agnes soon recovered from reserve jack have forbearance not to allude again to scene in cabin be only thing dreaded after dinner when family according to custom have retired for siesta gascoigne jack who have slept enough in cart to last for week went out together in garden well ned said jack do wish on board harpy again replied gascoigne have fallen on foot at last still not without first being knocked about like pea in rattle what lovely little creature that agnes be how strange that must fall in with again how odd that must come here good fellow did not come here destiny brought in cart may take to tyburn in same way yes if sport philosophy a did when awoke morning nevertheless will be hanged if be not right suppose argue point right wrong will be hanged jack so instead of arguing point suppose tell what don made long story about with heart let go to pavilion hero friend took seat gascoigne then communicated history of don rebiera to will dedicate ensuing chapter chapter xx long story reader must listen to a well a hero have already made acquainted with name have only to add that be one of most noble in sicily that there be few family who posse such large estate father be man who have pleasure in pursuit of most of young men of age be of weakly constitution be with difficulty reared to manhood when study be completed retired to country seat belonging to family be about twenty mile from palermo shutting up devoted wholly to literary pursuit a be only son parent be naturally very anxious that must marry more so a health did not promise very extended existence have consulted own inclination must have declined felt that be duty to comply with wish did not trouble with choice leaving wholly to selected young lady of high family certainly of most exquisite beauty only wish must say more in favour for be mother be impossible to narrate history without exposing conduct marriage took place father having woke up a be at celebration again returned to closet to occupy in abstruse study result of have be published have fully established reputation a man of superior talent deep research however much public may appreciate work of man of genius whether be written to instruct to amuse certain be that literary man requires in wife mind congenial to own pride in husband talent induces to sacrifice much of own domestic enjoyment to satisfaction of having name extolled abroad mention point a extenuation of mother conduct be neglected most certainly not neglected for frivolous amusement because form have captivated fancy in desire to instruct others may add ambition for renown applied to literary pursuit became abstracted answered without hearing left wife to amuse in way might please literary husband be without exception although always at home least domestic husband in world must try best of temper not by unkindness for father be kind indulgent to excess by state of perfect abstraction indifference showed to everything except favourite pursuit absorbed mother have to speak wish be granted refusal be unknown may say what must want more reply that anything to woman be preferable to indifference immediate consent to wish took away in opinion merit in grant value of everything be only relative in proportion to difficulty of obtaining immediate assent to opinion be tantamount to insult implied that did not choose to argue with be true that woman like to have own way like at same time to have difficulty to surmount to conquer otherwise gratification be lost although tempest be to be deplored still certain degree of oscillation motion be requisite to keep fresh clear lake of matrimony water of otherwise soon stagnate become foul without contrary current of opinion between married couple stagnation must take place woman permitted always invariably to have own way without control be much in same situation a child who insists upon whole instead of holiday before evening close be tired of everything about in short little contradiction like salt at dinner season appetises repast too much eke condiment in question spoil whole becomes unpalatable in proportion to excess mother be vain woman in sense of word vain of birth of beauty accustomed to receive homage to considered entitled have be spoiled in infancy a grew up have leant nothing because be permitted to do a pleased be therefore frivolous must not appreciate what must not comprehend there never be more ill assorted union have always thought that such must be case replied gascoigne in catholic country where young person be taken out of convent mated according to what family wealth may consider a most eligible connection on subject there be many opinion friend replied don rebiera be true that when marriage of convenience be arranged by parent disposition of party be made secondary point then again must be remembered that when choice be left to party be at age at there be little worldly consideration led away in first place by passion form connection with inferior in station be attended with eventual unhappiness in other allowing that do choose in own rank of life make quite a bad often worse choice than if partner be selected for can not understand that replied gascoigne reason be because there be mean if mean wish to study other disposition young man be attracted by person admires young woman be flattered by admiration be agreeable if have fault be not likely to display not concealing from hypocrisy because be not called out young man fall in love so doe young woman when once in love can no longer see fault marry imagining that have found perfection in blindness of love raise other to standard of perfection human nature can never attain becomes equally annoyed on finding by degree that be in error re action take place then under rate a much a before have over rated other now if two young people marry without violence of passion expect to find other perfect perhaps have better chance of happiness agree with thought gascoigne a appear to be a fond of argument a friend jack will make reply lest there be end to story don rebiera proceeded mother finding that father preferred closet book to gaiety dissipation soon left to amused after own fashion not until be born be ten month after marriage father be confiding pleased that mother must be amused indulged in everything time flew on have arrived at fifteenth year came home from study being intended must enter army be aware be generally only profession embraced in country by heir of noble family of course knew little of what have passed at home still have occasionally heard mother spoken lightly of when be not supposed to be present always heard father name mentioned with compassion a if ill used man knew nothing more still be quite sufficient for young man whose blood boiled at idea of anything like stigma being cast upon family arrived at father found at book paid respect to mother found with confessor disliked man at first sight be handsome certainly forehead be high white eye large fiery figure commanding there be dangerous proud look about disgusted nothing like humility devotion might have admired a officer commanding regiment of cavalry a churchman appeared to be most misplaced named with kindness appeared to treat with disdain spoke authoritatively to mother who appeared to yield implicitly discovered that be lord of whole household mother too be said have given up gaiety become devout soon perceived more than common intelligence between before have be two month at home have certain proof of father dishonour what be still more unfortunate for be aware that such be case first impulse be to acquaint father on consideration thought better to say nothing provided must persuade mother to dismiss father ignatio took opportunity when be alone to express indignation at conduct to demand immediate dismissal a condition of not divulging crime appeared frightened gave

merely to amuse have always have in view to instruct must not be supposed that have other end in view than to make reader laugh if be to write elaborate work telling truth plain truth confining only to point out error to demand reform must not be read have therefore selected light trifling specie of writing a be by many denominated a channel through may convey wholesome advice in palatable shape if must point out error draw character although character appears to weave naturally into tale of fiction becomes a much beacon a be vehicle of amusement consider to be true art of novel writing that crime folly error can be a severely lashed a virtue morality can be upheld by series of amusing cause effect entice reader to take medicine although rendered agreeable to palate still produce same internal benefit a if have be presented to in crude state in must either be refused nauseated in naval novel have often pointed out error have existed still do exist in service be honour to country for what institution be there on earth be perfect into if once be perfect abuse will not creep unfortunately others have written to decry service many have raised up voice against writing because felt that in exposing error be exposing to have be indifferent felt that be doing good have continued to prove that be correct in asserting that have done good will out of several state one single case in king own captain when requested to punish man instanter for fault committed reply that never have never will punish man until twenty four hour after offence that may not be induced by anger of moment to award severer punishment than in cooler moment might think commensurate that wished that admiralty must give out order to effect time after publication of work order be given by admiralty forbidding punishment until certain time have elapsed after offence have pleasure of knowing from first lord of admiralty of time that be in consequence of suggestion in novel if writing have effected nothing else might still lay down pen with pride satisfaction have done more much more while have amused reader have improved service have held up in character mirror in who have be in error may see own deformity many hint have be given have afterwards returned to thought of who have have influence have be considered a own idea have be acted upon conduct of captain tartar may be considered a libel on service be not fault of captain tartar be not in sending on board even putting in iron a deserter although under circumstance might have shown more delicacy fault be in stigmatising young man a swindler punishment awarded to error be intended to point out moral that abuse of power must be severely visited greatest error now in service be disregard shown to feeling of junior officer in language of superior that improvement have taken place grant that still exists to degree injurious to service know too well article of war a hero be informed by captain be equally binding on officer

tell that be liar must there be redress if so must be commensurate to insult if midshipman be to request court martial must be granted certainly not yet be point of more importance than may be conceived service have be wonderfully improved since peace who be now permitted to enter must be gentleman know that even now there be many who cry out against a dangerous injurious to service a if education spoilt officer scion of illustrious house must not be more careful to uphold escutcheon without blemish for century than one who have little more than brute courage who argue thus be very people who be injurious to service for can have other reason except that wish that junior may be tyrannised over with impunity be remembered that be not observation of junior officer smarting under insult be result of deep calm reflection have arrived to grade that although have power to inflict be too high to receive insult have not forgotten how young blood have boiled when wanton reckless cruel torture have be heaped upon feeling merely because a junior officer be not in position to retaliate even to reply evil be that great error be disseminated in observing on in one of work called peter simple have put following true observation in mouth of o'brien peter observes in simple right minded way must think o'brien that very circumstance of having have feeling so often wounded by such language when be junior officer must make doubly careful not to use towards others when have advanced in service peter be just first feeling wear away after time till at last own sense of indignation becomes blunted becomes indifferent to forget also that wound feeling of others carry habit with to great injury disgrace of service let not be supposed that in making remark want to cause litigation insubordination on contrary assert that error be cause eventually will be much more cause of insubordination for a junior officer who enter service be improved so will resist complaint here be more against officer than captain whose power have be perhaps already too much curtailed by late regulation power must remain for although there may be few who be so perverted a to make whom command uncomfortable in justice to service be proud to assert that majority acknowledge by conduct that greatest charm attached to power be to be able to make so many people happy chapter xxii hero be sick

when venture upon matrimony why jack be becoming quite sensible wisdom be for friend folly for good night jack did not go to sleep must not allow gascoigne to do foolish thing thought marry dark girl on midshipman pay if succeeds get throat cut if doe not a jack said wisdom be for friend be so generous that reserved none for own occasion miss julia hick a before observed set fashion at tetuan style of dress be not unbecoming moorish woman wore large veil may be called what will for head dress descend to heel at time cover whole body leaving eye to peep with hiding everything else now miss hick found much more convenient than bonnet a might walk out in heat of sun without burning fair skin stare at everybody everything without being stared at in return therefore never went out without one of overall composed of several yard of fine muslin dress in house be usually of coloured sarcenet for small vessel came into port one day during father lifetime unloaded great quantity of bale of good with english mark a vessel have gone out in ballast there be surmise on part by what mean came into captain possession therefore cited captain up to governor affair be amicably arranged by vice consul receiving about one quarter of cargo in bale of silk muslin miss hick have therefore dress of blue green yellow sarcenet with white muslin overall made a conspicuous a only frankish lady in town have right to be there be not dog barked in tetuan did not know sister of vice consul although few have seen face now occurred to jack a gascoigne be determined to carry on amour that in case of surprise must be a well if dressed a miss hick proposed to gascoigne next morning who approved of idea in course of day when miss hick be busy with captain hogg contrived to abstract one of dress muslin overall must do in safety a there be plenty of for miss hick be not troubled with mantua maker bill when gascoigne went up on roof ensuing night put on apparel of miss hick looked very like a far a figure went although little taller waited for moorish girl to sing did not so crept up ladder looked over wall when observed that be reclining a before in deep thought head covered with muslin caught eye gave faint scream fear not lady said gascoigne be not first time have beheld that sweet face sigh for companion must not give to be sitting by side be not of creed 't be true doe therefore follow that must not love other moorish girl be about to reply when gascoigne received answer from quarter whence little expected be from moor who hearing daughter scream have come swiftly up to roof doe frankish lily wish to mingle perfume with dark violet said for have often seen sister of vice consul imagined be who have come on roof ascended wall to speak with daughter gascoigne have presence of mind to avail of fortunate mistake be alone worthy moor replied pulling muslin over face pine for companion have be charmed by nightingale on roof of dwelling thought not to meet face of man when took courage to climb ladder if frankish lily will have courage to descend can sit by side of dark violet gascoigne thought advisable to make reply fear not said old moor what be old man woman moor brought ladder placed against wall after pause gascoigne said be fate then descended be led by moor to mattress upon daughter reclined moor then took seat near entered into conversation gascoigne knew quite enough of vice consul sister to play part thought proper to tell moor that brother wished to give a wife to captain of ship whom abhorred must take to cold foggy climate that have be born here wished to live die here must prefer passing life in woman apartment to leaving country at abdel faza for such be name felt very amorous put hand to forehead salaamed told gascoigne that zenana be in be hers a well a house after hour conversation in azar daughter did not join old moor asked gascoigne to descend into woman apartment observing daughter silence said to azar be angry that frankish houri must come to apartment of have hitherto be sole mistress fear not will soon be for osman ali have asked thee for wife have listened to request now osman ali be a old a father azar hated offered hand tremblingly led gascoigne into zenana moor attended to threshold bowed left that gascoigne have time to press suit that did not lose golden opportunity may easily be imagined father communication relative to osman ali very much assisted midshipman cause left zenana like most midshipman in love be little above quicksilver boiling heat jack who have remained in state of suspense time be not sorry to hear voice in amicable tone in few minute afterwards perceived that gascoigne be ascending ladder occurred to hero that be perhaps advisable that must not be seen a moor in gallantry might come up ladder with supposed lady be right for abdel faza not only followed up ladder on side assisted to descend on other with great ceremony took leave gascoigne hastened to jack who have be peeping gave detail of what have passed describing azar a most beautiful fascinating fond creature that ever be created after hour relation stopped short because discovered that jack be fast asleep visit of

attention to real miss hick mate proceeded to get bullock on board a more than three week have already passed away be time to think of departing for toulon captain hogg be too much in love a for gascoigne intended like midshipman in love to give up service jack reasoned with captain who appeared to listen to reason because miss hick have agreed to follow fortune crown transport in transport mary ann therefore proposed that must get away a fast a must a soon a have weighed anchor must come on shore take off miss hick make sail for toulon jack might have suffered difficulty be with gascoigne who must not hear of going away without lovely azar at last jack planned scheme thought must succeed must be good joke to tell governor therefore appeared to consent to gascoigne carrying

having lady with objected to immediately saying that must have cabin to intended now in first place have notion of giving up cabin to miss hick mr hogg will be very uncomfortable to be shut out

time declaring that must not lose sight of sister until after hogg be on board now say jack know can not do thing by main force so best plan will be for to go on board get under way leaving to bring

captain that gascoigne be very silly fellow want to run away with girl have made acquaintance with here what do think have proposed that after ship be under way that will carry off in boat have

of jack captain a for gascoigne must not eat mouthful drank to excess looking over rim of tumbler a if must devour hero who only laughed more mr hick have applied to men to lend clothes jack have foreseen that be omnipotent there be not jacket pair of trouser to be have for love money mr hick then considered advisable to lower tone applied to captain hogg who begged to be excused without consented to marriage with sister to mr hick gave indignant negative then applied to gascoigne who told in very surly tone to go to h l at last applied to hero who laughed said that must see d d first so mr hick sat down in petticoat vowed revenge gascoigne who have drunk much eaten nothing turned in went to sleep while captain hogg hero drank porter on capstern thus passed first day wind be famously fair bullock lowed cock crew sheep baa 'd mary ann made upwards of two hundred mile jack took possession of other berth in cabin majesty representative be obliged to lie down in petticoat upon topsail lay between deck with bullock on side of who now then made dart at with horn a if knew that be to that be indebted for embarkation being destined to drive scurvy out of toulon fleet can not enter into detail of passage a wind be fair be accomplished in ten day without loss of bullock during time mr hick condescended to eat without speaking imagining that hour of retribution must come when joined admiral gascoigne gradually recovered did not speak to hero who continued to laugh drink porter on eleventh morning be in midst of toulon fleet mr hick smiled exultingly a passed hero in petticoat wondered that jack showed sign of trepidation fleet hove to jack ran under admiral stern lowered down boat went on board showed credential reported bullock general signal be made there be fair division of spoil then admiral asked hero whether master of transport have other stock on board jack replied that have not that having be told by governor of malta that might be acceptable have bought few sheep dozen of fowl be much at service if must accept of admiral be much obliged to governor also to jack for thinking of must not of course accept of stock without paying for requested to

that master wife on board sir replied jack be vice consul what in petticoat vice consul yes vice consul of tetuan came on board in dress when brig be under way considered duty not to delay being aware how very important be that fleet must be provided with fresh beef what be mr easy said admiral there have be trick here will oblige by coming into cabin easy followed admiral flag captain into cabin then boldly told whole story how tricked be impossible for of to help laughing when began to laugh be almost a impossible to stop mr easy said admiral at last altogether blame appears to captain of transport must have delayed sailing because be in love that mr gascoigne must have stayed behind because be infatuated independent of ill will against english must have be excited by abduction of girl think might have contrived to manage without putting vice consul in petticoat acted to best of judgment sir replied jack very humbly altogether have done well captain malcolm send boat for vice consul mr hick be too impatient to tell wrong to care for being in sister clothes came on board although tittering be great imagined that must soon be in favour when be known that be diplomatic told story waited for decision of admiral be to crush hero who stood with midshipman on lee side of deck admiral replied mr hick in first place appears to to be family affair concerning marriage of sister with have nothing to do went on board of own free will in woman clothes mr easy order be positive obeyed be duty to sail a soon a transport be ready may forward complaint if please a friend tell that will probably occasion dismissal for kind of prank be not understood at foreign office may return to transport after have touched at mahon will proceed again to tetuan boat be alongside sir mr hick

of boat mary ann hoisted ensign made sail a porter be not yet sold jack ordered up bottle jack be much pleased with result of explanation with admiral felt that for once have not only got into scrape that have prevented others gascoigne walked deck gloomily fact be that be very unhappy have have time to reflect now that first violence have subsided felt that hero have done real service have prevented from committing act of egregious folly yet have summoned friend to meet in field such have be gratitude must have given world to recall what have passed to make friend felt ashamed a most people do to acknowledge error have however almost made up mind to be walking up down thinking in what manner might contrive when jack who be sitting a usual in chair by capstern with porter by said to now will lay life ned want to make friend be ashamed to speak first may be mistaken may fly off at tangent even if be at event will not be who be wrong will try jack waited till gascoigne passed again then said looking kindly knowingly in face say ned will have glass of porter gascoigne smiled jack held out hand reconciliation be effected in moment subject of quarrel be not canvassed by party will be at minorca in day two observed jack after while now will be glad to get there do know ned that feel very much satisfied with have got into scrape time will notwithstanding have good story to tell governor when go to malta partly at expense replied gascoigne why will figure little in others will figure much more wonder what have become of poor girl observed gascoigne who must not refrain

frankly mr easy if prefer captain sawbridge to will not be affronted sir replied easy prefer captain sawbridge to have be equally kind to prefer fact be sir that much like to part with gascoigne who said captain smiling with mesty sir may think very foolish must not be alive at moment if have not be for consider gratitude to be foolish mr easy replied captain wilson mr gascoigne intend to take with if chooses to come a have great respect for father fault to find with be generally speaking a for mesty why be good man a have behaved very well perhaps may think of next day mesty be included among boat crew taken with by captain wilson according to regulation of service appointed to same situation under master at arm of aurora gascoigne hero be also discharged into frigate a hero never have shown remarkable predilection for duty reader will not be surprised at requesting from captain wilson few day on shore previous to going on board of aurora captain wilson allowed same licence to gascoigne a have be cooped up for time on board of transport hero took up quarter at only respectable hotel in town whenever must meet officer of aurora very politely begged pleasure of company to dinner jack reputation have gone before midshipman drank wine swore be trump not that jack be to be deceived upon principle of equality argued that be duty of who must afford dinner to give to who

tossed about on snowy wave hundred of mile away from wreck be rolling heavily groaning complaining in timber a urged impetuous race with furious running sea how wrong be on shore who assert that sailor be not religious how be possible supposing to be possessed of feeling to be otherwise on shore where have nothing change of season in own peculiar beauty nothing blessing of earth fruit flower nothing bounty comfort luxury have be invented where can rise in morning in peace lay down head at night in security god may be neglected forgotten for long time at sea when gale be warning disaster act a check escape a homily upon forbearance of providence that man must be indeed brutalised who doe not feel that god be there on shore seldom view in beauty kindness at sea be a often reminded how

boil de kettle for young gentleman now dat ship corporal hab cane tink so no longer jack made reply thought more reader must have perceived jack notion of equality be rapidly disappearing defended more from habit perhaps wilfulness must not allow to acknowledge wrong to may be added love of argument already have accustomed to obedience of superior notwithstanding argument must admit of resistance from below not that be hardly ever attempted for jack be anything tyrant be much beloved by in ship day brought lesson captain wilson be now satisfied that jack have be almost cured of

have more effect upon jack than must have be imagined very often found be putting to question of mesty why do stay at sea have not entered service with particular view except to find equality must not acknowledge to that a mesty observed have come to wrong place have never even thought of staying to serve time have looked forward to promotion one day commanding ship have only cared for present without indulging in future anticipation of reward except in union with agnes mesty observation occasioned jack to reflect upon future for first time in life be always perplexed when put question of mesty tried to answer to a to what be intention in remaining in service nevertheless jack did duty very much to satisfaction of mr pottyfar after tedious passage from baffling light wind aurora arrived at malta hero have have conversation with friend gascoigne in canvassed future plan of however ended in one settled point be that be to marry agnes a for rest gascoigne be of opinion that jack ought to follow up service become captain there be plenty of time to think about that a observed now have to consider be how to get on shore for refitting of ship be excuse for detaining on board knew mr pottyfar must avail of jack dined in gun room on day of arrival resolved that must ask very evening captain wilson be already on shore at governor now there have be little difference of opinion between mr pottyfar mr hawkins chaplain on point of seamanship most of officer sided with chaplain who a have before observed be first rate seaman have ended in high word for mr hawkins have forgotten so far a to tell first lieutenant that have great deal to learn not having even got over midshipman trick of keeping hand in pocket mr pottyfar have replied that be very well for a chaplain to insult others knowing that cassock protected be bitter reply to mr hawkins who at very time that insinuation made blood boil be also reminded that profession forbade retort rushed into cabin poor fellow having other method left vented indignation in tear then consoled by degree with prayer in meantime mr pottyfar have gone on deck wroth with hawkins with messmate a well a displeased with be indeed in humour to be pleased with nobody in most unfortunate humour to be asked leave by midshipman nevertheless jack politely took off hat requested leave to go on shore see friend governor upon mr pottyfar turned round to with foot spread wide open thrusting hand to very bottom of pocket a if in determination said mr easy know state of ship have everything to do new mast new rigging everything almost to

first idea be to go on shore without leave from be persuaded by gascoigne who told that must displease captain wilson that old tom governor must not receive jack agreed to then after flourish about right of man tyranny oppression so forth walked forward to forecastle where found friend mesty who have heard have passed who insidiously said to in low tone why stay at sea massa easy why indeed thought jack boiling with indignation to be cooped up here at will of be fool mesty be right will ask for discharge to morrow jack went down below told gascoigne what have determined to do will do such thing jack replied gascoigne depend upon will have plenty of leave in day two pottyfar be in pet with chaplain who be too much for captain wilson will be on board by nine o'clock nevertheless jack walked first watch in magnificents a biddy do when can not go on shore turned in at twelve o'clock with resolution of sticking to purpose quitting majesty service in fact of presenting majesty

than in fighting don silvio before met governor at table sloop of war arrived from fleet with despatch from commander in chief to captain wilson required to make possible haste in fitting then to proceed cruise off corsica to fall in with russian frigate be on coast if not there to obtain intelligence to follow wherever might be be now bustle activity on board of aurora captain wilson with hero gascoigne quieted governor house repaired on board where remained day night on third day aurora be complete ready for sea about noon sailed out of valette harbour in week aurora have gained coast of corsica there be need of sending look out men to mast head for one of officer midshipman be there from daylight to dark ran up coast to northward without seeing object of pursuit obtaining intelligence calm light air detained for few day when northerly breeze enabled to run down eastern side of island be on eighteenth day after have quieted malta that large vessel be seen ahead about eighteen mile off men be then at breakfast frigate captain wilson be sure of said mr hawkins chaplain whose anxiety induced to go to mast head how be steering same way a be aurora be under possible sail when hand be piped to dinner be thought that have neared chase about two mile will be long chase stern chase always be observed martin to gascoigne yes be afraid so be more afraid of escaping be not unlikely replied mate be one of job comforter martin replied gascoigne then be not so often disappointed replied mate there be two point to be ascertained first be whether will come up with vessel lose next be if do come up with whether be vessel be looking for seem very indifferent about indeed be not be oldest passed midshipman in ship taking of frigate will if live give promotion if be killed sha want have be so often disappointed that now make sure of nothing until have well for sake martin will still hope that vessel be one seek that will not be killed that will gain promotion thank easy wish be one dared hope a do poor martin have long felt how bitter be to meet disappointment upon disappointment how true be that hope deferred maketh heart sick anticipation of early day buoyant calculation of youth have be one by one crushed now having served time nearly three time over reaction have become too painful a truly said dared not hope still temper be not soured chastened have hauled wind sir hailed second lieutenant from topmast cross tree what think of martin observed jack that be english frigate that be vessel commanded by very brave fellow well manned be sunset before aurora have arrived within two mile of vessel private signal have be thrown out have not be answered either because be too dark to make out colour of flag that be unknown to enemy stranger have hoisted english colour be satisfactory proof of being friend just before dark have put head towards aurora who have now come stem down to ship company of aurora be at quarter a few minute must now decide whether have to deal with friend foe there be situation perhaps more difficult demanding so much caution a occasional meeting with doubtful ship on one hand being necessary to be fully prepared not allow enemy advantage may be derived from inaction on other necessity of prudence that may not assault friend countryman captain wilson have hoisted private night signal here again be difficult from sail intervening for other ship to make out before two frigate be within three cable length of other captain wilson determined that there must be mistake from want of precaution on part hauled up course brailed up driver that night signal might be clearly seen light be seen abaft on quarter deck of other vessel a if be about to answer continued to keep aurora to leeward at about cable length a foremost gun of vessel be abreast of other hailed in english ship ahoy what ship that majesty ship aurora replied captain wilson who stood on hammock what ship by time other frigate have passed half length clear of beam of aurora at same time that pretended reply of majesty ship be heard broadside from gun have be trained aft on purpose be poured into aurora at so short distance doing considerable execution crew of aurora hearing hailing in english vessel passing apparently without firing have imagined that have be one of own cruiser captain of gun have dropped lanyard in disappointment silence have be maintained a two vessel met be just breaking up in various way of lamentation at bad luck when broadside be poured in thundering in ear ripping tearing of beam plank astonished sens many be carried down below be difficult to say whether indignation at enemy ruse satisfaction at discovering that be not called to quarter in vain most predominated at event be answered by three voluntary cheer drowned cry of who be being assisted to cockpit man larboard gun about ship cried captain wilson leaping off hammock look out lad rake in stay will pay off for foul play before have done with look out lad take good aim a pay round aurora be put about broadside poured into stern of russian frigate for such be be almost dark enemy who appeared a anxious a aurora to come to action hauled up course to await coming up in five minute two vessel be alongside exchanging murderous broadside at little more than pistol shot running slowly in for land then not more than five mile distant skin clad mountaineer of corsica be aroused by furious cannonading watching incessant flash of gun listening to reverberating roar after hour fierce combat during fire of vessel be kept up with undiminished vigour captain wilson went down on main deck separately pointed gun after be loaded amidships being direct for main channel of enemy ship while abaft beam be gradually trained more more forward before beam more more aft so a to throw shot nearly into one focus giving direction that be to be fired at once at word of command enemy not aware of cause of delay imagined that fire of aurora have slackened loudly cheered at word given broadside be poured in dark a be effect from be evident two of midship port of antagonist be blown into one mainmast be seen to totter then to fall over side aurora then set course have be hauled up shooting ahead took up raking position while russian be still hampered with wreck poured in grape cannister from upper deck carronades to impede labour on deck while continued destructive fire upon hull of enemy from main deck battery moon now burst out from low bank of cloud enabled to accomplish work with more precision in quarter of hour russian be totally dismasted captain wilson ordered half of remaining ship company to repair damage have be most severe whilst larboard men at quarter continued fire from main deck enemy continued to return fire from four gun two on of deck must still make bear upon aurora after time even ceased from men having deserted from being dismounted observing that fire from antagonist have ceased aurora also discontinued jolly boat astern being still uninjured second lieutenant be deputed to pull alongside of frigate to ascertain if have struck beam of bright moon silvered rippling water a boat shoved off captain wilson officer who be still unhurt leant over shattered side of aurora waiting for reply suddenly silence of night be broken upon by loud splash from bow of russian frigate then about three cable length distant must that be cried captain wilson anchor down mr jones lead over side see what water have mr jones have long be carried down below severed in two with round shot man leaped into chain lowering down lead sounded in seven fathom then suspect will give more trouble yet observed captain wilson so indeed proved for russian captain in reply to second lieutenant have told in english that must answer question with broadside before boat be dropped astern have warped round with spring on cable have recommenced fire upon aurora captain wilson made sail upon ship sailed round round anchored vessel so a to give two broadside to one from slowness with worked at spring upon cable be evident that must be now very weak handed still pertinacity decided courage of russian captain convinced captain wilson that in probability must sink at anchor before must haul down colour not only must lose more of aurora men also russian vessel without took more decided step captain wilson therefore resolved to try by board having poured in raking fire stood off for few moment during called officer men on deck stated intention then went about conning aurora ran on board russian pouring in reserved broadside a vessel came into collision heading men a leaped on enemy deck although a captain wilson have imagined russian frigate have not many men to oppose to aurora deck be obstinately defended voice arm of russian captain be to be heard seen everywhere men encouraged by be cut down by number where stood hero who have good fortune to be still unhurt be for little while close to captain wilson when boarded be about to oppose unequal force against of russian captain when be pulled back by collar by mr hawkins chaplain who rushed in advance with sabre in hand opponent be well matched may be said that with little interruption hand to hand conflict ensued for moon lighted up scene of carnage be well able to distinguish other face at last chaplain sword broke rushed in drove hilt into antagonist face closed with fell down hatchway together after deck be gained rather cleared by crew of aurora for few must be said to have resisted in minute two frigate be in possession chaplain russian captain be hoisted up still clinging to other senseless from fall of dead although bleeding from several wound a soon a main deck have be cleared captain wilson ordered hatch to be put on left party on board while hastened to attend to condition of own ship ship company be daylight before anything like order have be restored to deck of aurora water be still smooth instead of letting go own anchor have hung on with hawser to prize sail have be furled deck cleared gun secured bucket be dashing away blood from plank carriage of gun when sun rose shone upon numerous wounded have by time be put into hammock although there be still one two case of amputation to be performed carpenter have repaired shot hole under too near to water line then have proceeded to sound well of prize although upper work have be dreadfully shattered there be reason to suppose that have received serious injury below therefore hatch still remained on although few hand be put to pump to try if made water be not until aurora presented more cheerful appearance captain wilson went over to other ship whose deck now that light of heaven enabled to witness horror even to minuteness presented shocking spectacle of blood carnage body after body be thrown over wounded be supplied with water such assistance a must be rendered until surgeon must attend hatch be then taken off remainder of crew ordered on deck about two hundred obeyed summons lower deck be a crowded with killed wounded a be upper for present prisoner be handed over down into fore hold of aurora have be

commenced arguing upon truth soundness of philosophy by bye dear son if recollect right told last night that be no longer of opinion now if please will argue point will argue point with heart sir replied jack will begin let fill glass cried mr easy triumphantly let fill glass then will bring jack back to proper way of thinking now then son trust will not deny that be born equal do deny sir replied jack deny in toto deny from evidence of own sens from authority of scripture to suppose men be born equal be to suppose that be equally endowed with same strength with same capacity of mind know be not case deny from scripture from must quote many passage will restrict to one parable of talent one gave five talent to one ' holding responsible for trust reposed in be intended to fill various situation in society be provided by heaven accordingly may be replied mr easy doe not prove that earth be not intended to be equally distributed among alike beg pardon proof that be not intention of providence be that equality allowing to be put in practice must never be maintained not maintained no because strong oppress weak tyrant rise up conquer men combine to do wrong not so dear father say must not be maintained without organisation of individual have be equalised several other point established for instance allowing that man have ab origin certain portion of ground who be strongest cleverest must soon cause to yield more than others must thus equality be destroyed again if one couple have ten child have none then again must equality be broken in upon a land support two in one instance must have to feed twelve in other perceive therefore that without rapine injustice equality must not be preserved jack allowing that there might be diversity from such cause must be very different thing from present monstrous state of society in have king lord people rolling in wealth while others be in state of pauperism obliged to steal for daily bread dear father consider that be to inequality society owes firmest cementation that be enabled to live in peace happiness protected by just law doing duty in state of life to be called rising above sinking in scale of society according a have be entrusted with five talent one equality can doe exist nowhere be told that doe not exist in heaven how can exist upon earth be only asserted jack be not proof that ought not to exist let argue point father coolly let examine little must be effect if be equality be equal in beauty there must be beauty for beauty be only by comparison be equal in strength conflict must be interminable be equal in rank power possession greatest charm of existence must be destroyed generosity gratitude finer virtue must be unknown first principle of religion charity must not be practised pity must never be called forth benevolence great organ must be useless self denial blank letter be equal in ability there must be instruction talent genius nothing to admire nothing to copy to respect nothing to rouse emulation stimulate to praiseworthy ambition why dear father what idle unprofitable weary world must be if be based on equality allowing jack replied mr easy will say argue well in bad cause why must inequality be carried so far king lord for instance most lasting imperishable form of building be that of pyramid defies age to may most perfect form of society be compared be based upon many rising by degree becomes le a wealth talent rank increase in individual until end at apex monarch above yet several stone from apex to base be necessary for preservation of structure fulfils duty in allotted place must prove that at summit posse greatest share of happiness in world then indeed have position to argue on be well known that such be not case provided be of contented mind peasant be more happy than king surrounded a latter be by care anxiety very well argued indeed dear sir observed dr middleton dear boy there be other state of society than monarchy have republic despotism have how long do last compared to first there be cycle in change never varies monarchy may be overthrown by revolution republicanism succeed be shortly followed by despotism till after time monarchy succeeds again by unanimous consent a most legitimate equitable form of government in none of do find single advance to equality in republic who govern be more powerful than ruler in restricted monarchy president be greater than king next to despot whose will be law even in small society find that will naturally take lead assume domination commence system at school when be first thrown into society there be taught system of petty tyranny there be few point in obtain equality in world equality can only be obtained under well regulated form of society consists in equal administration of justice of law to have agreed to submit for benefit of whole equal right to live not be permitted to starve have be obtained in country when be called to account will have equal justice now dear father have opinion yes dear be very well in abstract how doe work work well luxury pampered state idleness if please wickedness of rich contribute to support comfort employment of poor may behold extravagance be vice very extravagance circulates money vice of one contributes to happiness of many only vice be not redeemed by producing commensurate good be avarice if be equal there must be art manufacture industry no employment a be inequality of distribution of wealth may be compared to heart pouring forth blood like steam engine through human frame same blood returning from extremity by vein to be again propelled keep up healthy vigorous circulation bravo jack said dr middleton have anything to reply sir continued addressing mr easy to reply sir replied mr easy with scorn why have not given argument yet why black servant even laugh at look at there showing teeth can forget horror of slavery can forget base unfeeling lash sir have suffered can estimate divine
