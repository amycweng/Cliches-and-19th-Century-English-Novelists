reader that history be not written in after life when have obtained greater knowledge of world when first went to sea promised mother must keep journal of what passed with reflection upon to promise rigidly adhered since have be own master journal have remained in possession in writing therefore early part of adventure everything be stated a be impressed on mind at time have now be cruising for six week found that profession be much more agreeable than have anticipated desire to please be taken for deed although occasionally made blunder yet captain first lieutenant seemed to think be attentive to duty to best of ability only smiled at mistake first lieutenant be one of most amusing men ever knew yet never relaxed from discipline of service took least liberty with superior inferior humour be principally shown in various mode of punishment however severe punishment be to party manner of inflicting be invariably source of amusement to remainder of ship company often thought that although individual liked being punished yet that ship company be quite pleased when punishment took place be very particular about deck be always a white a snow nothing displeased so much a being soiled be for reason that have such objection to use of tobacco there be spitting pan placed in different part of deck for use of men that might not dirty plank with tobacco juice sometimes man in hurry forgot to use pan a mess to stain might be opposite have grog stopped if party be not found out took good care not only to keep look out to inform against offender now punishment for offence be a follows man hand be tied behind back large tin spitting box fixed to chest by strap over shoulder other box on lower deck be taken away be obliged to walk there ready to attend summons of man who might wish to empty mouth of tobacco juice other men be so pleased at fancy that spat twice a much a before for pleasure of making run about be much amused one morning watch kept be stowing hammock in quarter deck netting when one of boy came up with hammock on shoulder a passed first lieutenant latter perceived that have quid of tobacco in cheek what have got there good lad gum boil cheek be very much swelled sir replied boy there be nothing at matter oh there must be be bad tooth then open mouth let see very reluctantly boy opened mouth discovered large roll of tobacco leaf see see said first lieutenant mouth want overhauling teeth cleaning wish have dentist on board a have not will operate a well a can send armourer up here with tongs when armourer made appearance boy be made to open mouth while chaw of tobacco be extracted with rough instrument there now said first lieutenant be sure that must feel better already never must have have appetite now captain of afterguard bring piece of old canvas sand here clean teeth nicely captain of afterguard came forward putting boy head between knee scrubbed teeth well with sand canvas for two three minute there will do said first lieutenant now little fellow mouth be nice clean will enjoy breakfast be impossible for to have eaten anything with mouth in such nasty state when be dirty again come to will be dentist one day be on forecastle with mr chuck boatswain who be very kind to have be showing how to make various knot bend of rope be used in service be afraid be very stupid showed over over again until learnt how to make amongst others taught fisherman bend pronounced to be king of knot mr simple continued there be moral in knot observe that when part be drawn right way together more pull faster hold more impossible to untie see by hauling apart how little difference pull other way immediately disunites then how easy cast off in moment point out necessity of pulling together in world mr simple when wish to hold on be piece of philosophy worth twenty six thousand odd year of friend carpenter lead to nothing brown study when ought to be attending to duty very true mr chuck be better philosopher of two be better educated mr simple trust more of gentleman consider gentleman to be to certain degree philosopher for very often be obliged to support character a such to put up with what person may very properly fly in passion about think coolness be great characterstick of gentleman in service mr simple one be obliged to appear angry without indulging sentiment can assure that never lose temper even when use rattan why then mr chuck do swear so much at men surely be not gentlemanly most certainly not sir must defend by observing very artificial state in live on board of man of war nothing must afford more pleasure than to be able to carry on duty a gentleman be impossible really can not see why perhaps then mr simple will explain to why captain first lieutenant swear pretend to answer only do so upon emergency exactly so sir beergency be daily hourly duty in continual working of ship be answerable for go amiss life of boatswain be life of beergency therefore swear still can not allow to be requisite certainly be sinful excuse dear sir be absolutely requisite not at sinful there be one language for pulpit for on board ship in situation man must make use of term most likely to produce necessary effect upon listener certain be that common parlancy wo do with common seaman be not here a in scripture do doeth ' by by chap must have have soldier in tight order be do damn eye then be done directly order to do just carry weight of cannon shot want perpelling power damn be gunpowder set flying in execution of duty do comprehend mr simple perfectly understand mr chuck can not help remarking that without flattery that be very different from rest of warrant officer where did receive education mr simple be here boatswain with clean shirt say one dare gainsay also with thorough knowledge of duty although say that ever be better off can say have be in best society in company of lord lady once dined with grandfather be more than ever did for never asked took least notice of replied what state be true did not know that be grandfather until yesterday when be talking with mr o'brien perfectly recollect although be very young at time now mr simple if will promise a gentleman know be one that will not repeat what tell then will let into history of life mr chuck a be gentleman never will divulge until be dead buried not then if wish mr chuck then sat down upon fore end of boom by funnel took place by side when commenced a follows father be boatswain before one of old school rough a bear drunken a gosport fiddler mother be mother will say no more father be invalided for harbour duty after life of intoxication died shortly afterwards in meantime have be by kindness of port admiral wife educated at foundation school be thirteen when father died mother not knowing what to do with wished to bind apprentice to merchant vessel refused after six month quarrelling on subject decided point by volunteering in narcissus frigate believe that gentlemanly idea be innate mr simple never a child must bear idea of merchant service after have be week on board be appointed servant to purser where gave such satisfaction by alertness dexterity that first lieutenant took away from purser to attend upon so happened that after have served first lieutenant for about year young lord must not mention name mr simple be sent to sea by friend by own choice know be told that uncle who be 'zeckative have interest in death persuaded to go lord at period twenty five year ago be rarity in service used to salute when came on board consequence be that young lord must have servant to although rest of midshipman have one servant between captain inquired who be best boy in ship purser to whom appealed recommended accordingly be immediately surrendered to lordship have very easy comfortable life of did little nothing went to mediterranean because lordship mamma wished have be there about year when lordship ate so many grape that be seized with dysentery be ill for three week then requested to be sent to malta in transport going to gibraltar rather to barbary coast for bullock became worse day made will leaving effect on board certainly deserved for kindness with have nursed off malta fell in with xebeque bound to civita vecchia captain of transport anxious to proceed advised going on board of a wind be light contrary mediterranean vessel sailed better on wind than transport master who be now sinking fast consented changed ship next day died gale of wind came on prevented from gaining port for several day body of lordship not only became so offensive affected superstition of catholic sailor so much that be hove overboard wind be still against when merchant vessel ran down to have left civita vecchia for gibraltar desired captain of xebeque to make signal of distress rather did vessel proved to be english bore down to manned boat to go on board idea came into head that although might refuse to take that must not refuse lord put on midshipman uniform belonging to lordship then certainly belonging to went alongside of merchant vessel told that have left ship for benefit of health wanted passage to gibraltar on way home title immediate acceptance of term demanded for passage be sufficient property be brought from xebeque of course a must not speak english must not contradict even if suspected during passage to gibraltar have plenty of time for arranging plan hardly need say that lord kit be valuable what be better exactly fitted also have watch trinket many other thing besides bag of dollar however be honestly mine only thing that took be name have further occasion for poor fellow be use defending what be wrong be dishonest there be end of now observe mr simple how one thing lead to declare to that first idea of making use of lordship name be to procure passage to gibraltar then be undecided how to act a have charge of paper letter to mother guardian think indeed be almost sure must have laid aside dignity midshipman dress applied for passage home to commissioner of yard be fated to be otherwise for master of transport went on shore to report obtain pratique told everywhere that young lord be passenger with going to england for benefit of health in le than hour off came commissioner boat boat from governor requesting honour of company must take bed at house during stay what must do began to be frightened be more afraid to confess be impostor for be sure master of transport alone must have kicked overboard if have let know that have be so confounded polite to ship boy so blushed half from modesty half from guilt accepted invitation of governor sending polite verbal refusal to commissioner upon plea of there being paper pen on board well mr simple dressed very carefully put on chain ring little perfume on handkerchief accompanied aide de camp to governor where be asked after mother lady uncle guardian hundred other question at first be much confused be attributed to bashfulness so be not of right sort

bill at hotel be very extravagant more than must pay master said be not of least consequence that of course lordship have not provided with cash just coming from foreign part offered to supply with money if required will say be honest enough to refuse left card ppc a do mr simple in well regulated society set off in mail for london where fully resolved to drop title to proceed to scotland to

afterwards left cabin to report marvellous story to messmate went on deck found that shark have just be hooked be being hauled on board mr phillott have also come on deck officer be eager about shark be looking over side calling to other giving direction to men now although certainly there be want of decorum on quarter deck still captain having given permission be to be excused mr phillott thought otherwise commenced in usual style beginning with marine officer mr westley will trouble not to be getting upon hammock will get off directly sir if one of fellow be to do so 'd stop grog for month see why be to set bad example have be too long in barrack sir by half who be that mr williams mr moore on hammock too up to fore topmast head of directly mr thomas up to main say youngster stealing off perch upon spanker boom let know when have rode to london by god service be going to hell know what officer be made of now day will marry of young gentleman to gunner daughter before long quarter deck better than bear garden wonder when lieutenant set example latter remark must only be applied to o'brien who stood in quarter boat giving direction before tirade of mr phillott stopped amusement of party o'brien immediately stepped out of boat going up to mr phillott touched hat said mr phillott have captain permission to catch shark shark be not to be got on board by walking up down on quarter deck a regard a long a captain be on board hold responsible to alone for conduct if think have done wrong forward complaint if pretend to use such language to a have to others will hold responsible be here sir a officer gentleman will be treated a such allow to observe consider quarter deck more disgraced by foul ungentlemanly language than do by officer accidentally standing upon hammock however a have thought proper to interfere may now get shark on board mr phillott turned very red for never have come in contact in way with o'brien other officer have submitted quietly to unpleasant manner of speaking to very well mr o'brien will hold answerable for language replied will most certainly report conduct to captain will save trouble captain kearney be now coming up will report o'brien did upon captain putting foot on quarter deck well observed captain to mr phillott what be complain of mr o'brien language sir be to be addressed on quarter deck in manner really must say mr phillott replied captain kearney perceive anything in what mr o'brien said what be correct command here if officer so nearly equal in rank to have committed be not to take law into own hand fact be mr phillott language be not quite so correct a must wish overheard word that passed consider that have treated superior officer with disrespect be gave permission that shark must be caught with permission consequently allowed little deviation from discipline of service must inevitably take place yet have thought proper to interfere with permission be tantamount to order have made use of harsh language punished young gentleman for obeying injunction will oblige sir by calling down in restraining petulance for future will always support authority when be correct regret that in instance have necessitated to weaken be most severe check to mr phillott who immediately went below after hailing mast head calling down midshipman a soon a be gone be on hammock again shark be hauled forward hoisted on board frying pan in ship be in requisition be all much pleased with captain kearney conduct on occasion a o'brien observed to really be good fellow clever officer what thousand pity be that be such confounded liar must do mr phillott justice to say that bore malice on occasion treated a before be saying great deal in favour when be considered what power first lieutenant have of annoying punishing inferior chapter thirty three set to between captain first lieutenant cutting out expedition mr chuck mistaken dy like gentleman swinburne begin account of battle of st vincent have not be more than week under danish island of st thomas when discovered brig close in shore made sail in chase soon came within mile half of shore when anchored under battery opened fire upon elevation be too great several shot passed over between mast once met with very remarkable circumstance observed captain kearney three gun be fired at frigate be on board of from battery at same time three shot cut away three topsail tie down came topsail yard upon cap at same time that frenchman might not suppose that have taken such good aim turned up hand to reef topsail by time that men be off yard tie be spliced topsail run up again mr phillott must not stand most enormous fib replied very odd indeed captain kearney have known stranger circumstance have put in powder to four gun on main deck when be fighting danish gun boat in frigate be in a men withdrew rammer shot from enemy entered muzzle completed loading of gun fired own shot back upon occurred three time running upon word replied captain kearney who have glass upon battery think must have dreamt circumstance mr phillott not more than did about topsail tie captain kearney captain kearney at time have long glass in hand holding up over shoulder shot from battery whizzed over head took glass out of hand shivering to piece be once said captain kearney very coolly will pretend that must ever happen three time running might take head off arm next time not glass whereas topsail tie might be cut by three different shot give glass mr simple be certain that vessel be privateer what think mr o'brien be bit of opinion captain kearney replied o'brien think must be very pretty bit of practice to ship company to take out from under footy battery starboard helm mr phillott keep away four point then will think of to night frigate be now kept away ran out of fire of battery be then about hour before sunset in west indie sun doe not set a doe in northern latitude there be twilight descends in glory surrounded with cloud of gold ruby in gorgeous tint once below horizon be dark a soon a be dark hauled wind off shore consultation being held between captain mr phillott o'brien captain at last decided that attempt must be made indeed although cutting out be very serious affair a combat under disadvantage still mischief done to trade by fast sailing privateer be so great in west indie that almost sacrifice be warrantable for interest of country still captain kearney although brave prudent officer one who calculated chance who must not risk men without deemed that necessity imperiously demanded that such must be done be averse to attack from knowledge of hay in brig be anchored although mr phillott o'brien be of opinion that must be night attack captain kearney decided otherwise considered that although risk might be greater yet force employed must be more consolidated that who must hold back in night dare not do so during day moreover that people on shore in battery a well a in privateer must be on alert night not expecting attack during day must be taken off guard be therefore directed that everything must be in preparation during night that boat must shove off before daylight row in shore concealing behind rock under cliff formed cape upon one side of harbour if not discovered remain there till noon at time be probable that privateer men must be on shore vessel might be captured without difficulty be always scene of much interest on board man of war when preparation be made for expedition of description a reader may not have be witness to may perhaps be interesting to describe boat of men of war have generally two crew common boat crew be selected so a not to take away most useful men from ship service fighting boat crew be selected from very best men on board coxswain of boat be most trustworthy men in ship on occasion have to see that boat be properly equipped launch yawl first second cutter be boat appointed for expedition carried gun mounted upon slide ran fore aft between men after boat be hoisted out gun be lowered down into shipped in bow of boat arm chest be next handed in contained cartridge ammunition shut be put into bottom of boat so far be ready oar of boat be fitted to pull with grummet upon iron thole pin that might make little noise might swing fore aft without falling overboard when boat pulled alongside privateer breaker two be small cask holding about seven gallon of water be put into boat also men allowance of spirit in case must be detained by unforeseen circumstance men belonging to boat be fully employed in looking after arm fitting flint to pistol others major part of sharpening cutlass at grindstone with file borrowed from armourer be busy merry very idea of going into action be source of joy to english sailor more joke be made more merriment excited at time than other then a often happens that one two of service boat crew may be on sick list urgent solicitation be made by others that may supply place only party who appear at grave be who be to remain in frigate not share in expedition there be occasion to order boat to be manned for men be generally in long before be piped away indeed one must think that be party of pleasure instead of danger of death upon be about to proceed captain kearney selected officer who be to have charge of boat must not trust of midshipman on so dangerous service said that have known so many occasion in rashness foolhardiness have spoilt expedition therefore appointed mr phillott first lieutenant to launch o'brien to yawl master to first mr chuck boatswain to second cutter mr chuck be much pleased with idea of having command of boat asked to come with to consented although have intended a usual to have gone with o'brien about hour before daylight ran frigate to within mile half of shore boat shoved off frigate then wore round stood out in offing that might at daylight be at such distance a not to excite suspicion that boat be sent away while in boat pulled quietly in shore be not quarter of hour before arrived at cape forming one side of bay be well secreted among cluster of rock be underneath oar be laid in boat painter made fast order given for strictest silence rock be very high boat be not to be seen without one must come to edge of precipice even then must in probability have be supposed to have be rock water be a smooth a glass when be broad daylight men hung listlessly over side of boat looking at coral below watching fish a glided between ca say mr simple said mr chuck to in undertone think well of expedition have idea that of will lose number of mess after calm come storm how quiet be everything now will take off great coat for sun be hot already coxswain give jacket mr chuck have put on great coat not jacket underneath have left on one of gun on main deck ready to change a soon a heavy dew have gone off coxswain handed jacket mr chuck threw off great coat to put on when be opened proved that by mistake have taken away jacket surmounted by two small epaulet belonging to captain kearney captain steward who have taken out to brush have also laid upon same gun by nobility of england cried mr chuck have taken away captain jacket by mistake here be pretty mess if put on great coat will be dead with sweating if put on jacket will be roasted brown if put on captain jacket will be considered disrespectful men in boat tittered mr phillot who be in launch next to turned round to see what be matter o'brien be sitting in stern sheet of launch with first lieutenant leaned over told by power see why captain jacket will be at hurt by mr chuck putting on replied o'brien unless indeed bullet be to go through then wo be fault of mr chuck replied first lieutenant if one did captain might keep jacket swear that bullet went round body without wounding will have good yarn to spin so put on mr chuck will make good mark for enemy will stand risk of with pleasure observed boatswain to for sake of being considered gentleman so here be on with there be general laugh when mr chuck pulled on captain jacket sank down in stern sheet of cutter with great complacency of countenance one of men in boat that be in thought proper however to continue laugh little longer than mr chuck considered necessary who leaning forward thus addressed say mr webber beg leave to observe to in most delicate manner in world just to hint to that be not custom to laugh at superior officer mean just to insinuate that be damned impudent son of sea cook if live do well will prove to that if be to be laughed at in boat with captain jacket on be not to be laughed at on board frigate with boatswain rattan in fist so look out hearty for squall when come on forecastle for will be damned if make see more star than god almighty ever made cut more caper than dancing master in france mark word burgoo eating pea soup swilling trowsers scrubbing son of bitch mr chuck having at end of oration raised voice above pitch required by exigency of service be called to order by first lieutenant again sank back into stern sheet with importance authoritative show peculiarly appertaining to pair of epaulet waited behind rock until noonday without being discovered by enemy so well be concealed have already sent officer who carefully hiding by lying down on rock have several time reconnoitred enemy boat be passing repassing continualhy from privateer to shore appeared that went on shore full of men returned with only one two so that be in great hope that must find few men to defend vessel mr phillott looked at watch held up to o'brien to prove that have complied exactly with order have received from captain then gave word to get boat under weigh painter be cast off by bowman gun be loaded primed men seized oar in two minute be clear of rock drawn up in line within quarter of mile from harbour mouth not mile from privateer brig rowed a quickly a possible did not cheer until enemy fired first gun did from quarter unexpected a entered mouth of harbour with union jack trailing in water over stern for be dead calm appeared that at low point under cliff at side of little bay have raised water battery of two gun one of gun laden with grape shot be now fired at boat elevation be too low although water be ploughed up to within five yard of launch injury be received be equally fortunate in discharge of other three gun two of passed so quickly that be not aimed sufficiently forward so that shot fell astern other although shot fell among did further injury than cutting in half two of oar of first cutter in meantime have observed that boat have shoved off from privateer a soon a have perceived have returned to laden with men boat have be despatched second time have not yet returned be now about same distance from privateer a be boat be quite undecided of must be first on board o'brien perceiving pointed out to mr phillott that must first attack boat afterwards board on side to pulled a in probability there must be opening left in boarding netting be tied up to yard arm presented formidable obstacle to success mr phillott agreed with o'brien ordered bowman to lay in oar keep gun pointed ready to fire at word given desiring other men to pull best nerve muscle be brought into play by anxious intrepid seaman when within about twenty yard of vessel also of boat order be given to fire carronade of launch poured out round grape so well directed that one of french boat sank immediately musket ball with other smaller gun be loaded did great execution among men in one minute more with three cheer from sailor be alongside together english french boat pellmell most determined close conflict took place french fought desperately a be overpowered be reinforced by from privateer who must not look on behold companion requiring assistance without coming to aid jumped down into boat from chain into midst of men others darted cold shot at to kill to sink boat thus did one of most desperate hand to hand conflict take place that ever be witnessed be soon decided in favour for be stronger party better armed when opposition be over jumped into privateer found not man left on board only large dog who flew at o'brien throat a entered port kill said o'brien a sailor hastened to assistance only take away gripe sailor disengaged dog o'brien led up to gun saying by jasus boy be prisoner although have possession of privateer difficulty a will prove be by mean over be now exposed not only to fire of two battery at harbour mouth have to pas also to of battery at bottom of bay have fired at frigate in meantime be very busy in cutting cable lowering topsail taking wounded men on board privateer from out of boat be however work of few minute most of frenchman be killed own wounded amounted to only nine seaman mr chuck boatswain who be shot through body apparently with little chance of surviving a mr phillott observed captain epaulet have made mark for enemy have fallen in borrowed plume a soon a be on board laid on deck for there be a near a can recollect about fourteen wounded frenchman a well a own two rope be got out forward boat be manned proceeded to tow brig out of harbour be dead calm made little way boat crew flushed with victory cheered rallied pulled with strength enemy perceiving that privateer be taken french boat drifting empty up harbour now opened fire upon with great effect before have towed abreast of two water battery have received three shot between wind water from other battery sea be pouring fast into vessel have be attending to poor mr chuck who lay on starboard side near wheel blood flowing from wound tracing course down plank of deck to distance of foot from where lay appeared very faint tied handkerchief round body so a to stop effusion of blood brought water with bathed face poured into mouth opened eye wide looked at ah mr simple said faintly be be over with must not be better must how do mean inquired why have not fallen dressed like officer gentleman said referring to captain jacket epaulet 'd sooner die now with dress on than to recover to put on boatswain uniform feel quite happy pressed hand then closed eye again from weakness be now nearly abreast of two battery on point gun of have be trained so a to bear upon boat be towing out brig first shot went through bottom of launch sank fortunately men be saved a be boat towed next to brig great delay occurred in getting others clear of taking brig again in shot now poured in thick grape became very annoying still men gave way cheering at shot fired have nearly passed battery with trifling loss when perceived that brig be so full of water that must not swim many minute longer that must be impossible to tow alongside of frigate mr phillott under circumstance decided that must be useless to risk more life that wounded must be taken out of brig boat must pull away from ship desired to get wounded men into cutter sent alongside then to follow other boat made haste must not wishing to be left behind a soon a wounded men be in boat went to mr chuck to remove appeared somewhat revived must not allow to remove dear mr simple said be of use can never recover prefer dying here entreat not to move if enemy take possession of brig before sink will be buried with military honour if will at least die in dress of gentleman hasten away a fast a can before lose more men here stay be decided expostulated with at time two boat full of men appeared pulling out of harbour to brig enemy have perceived that boat have deserted be coming to take possession have therefore time to urge mr chuck to change resolution not wishing to force dying man shook hand left be with difficulty escaped for boat have come up close to brig chased little while yawl cutter turning back to assistance gave up pursuit on whole be very well arranged well conducted expedition only man lost be mr chuck for wound of others be none of mortal captain kearney be quite satisfied with conduct so be admiral when be reported to captain kearney did indeed grumble little about jacket sent for to inquire why have not taken off mr chuck brought on board a did not choose to tell exact truth replied must not disturb dying man that jacket be so saturated with blood that never must have worn again be case at event might have brought away epaulet replied youngster think of nothing gormandising have first watch night when swinburne quarter master came up to asked particular of affair for be not in boat well said that mr chuck appeared to be very good boatswain in way if must only have kept rattan little quiet be smart fellow knew duty have just such killed in ship in action off cape st vincent what be in action replied yes be belonged to captain lord nelson ship well then suppose tell about why mr simple d see have objection to spin yarn now then replied swinburne a mr chuck used to say allow to observe in most delicate manner in world perceive that man who have charge of hammock sling clean one now then have very often good glass of grog for yarn see mine be a well worth glass of grog a so be swinburne better too promise good stiff one to morrow evening will do sir now then will tell about more about too than most can for know how action be brought about hove log marked board then sat down abaft on signal chest with swinburne who commenced narrative a follows must know mr simple that when english fleet came down mediterranean after 'vackyation of corsica did not muster more than seventeen sail of line while spanish fleet from ferrol carthagena have joined company at cadiz mounted to near thirty sir john jervis have command of fleet at time a don did not seem at inclined to come out have brush with almost two to one sir john left sir w parker with six sail of line to watch spanish beggar while went into lisbon with remainder of fleet to water refit now see mr simple portugal be at time what call neutral be to say did meddle at in affair being friend with party just a willing to supply fresh beef water to spaniard a to english if so be spaniard have come out to ax for dar' portuguese english have always be best of friend because ca get port wine anywhere else ca get nobody else to buy of so portuguese gave up arsenal at lisbon for use of english there kept store under charge of old dare devil sir isaac coffin now so happened that one of clerk in old sir isaac office portuguese chap have be time before in office of spanish ambassador be very smart sort of chap sarved a interpreter commissioner put great faith in how did learn swinburne why will tell mr simple steered yawl a coxswain when admiral captain talk in stern sheet very often forget that coxswain be close behind only learnt half of way rest put together when compared log with admiral steward who of course heard great deal now then first heard of be when old sir john called out to sir isaac after second bottle say sir isaac who killed spanish messenger ' not by god replied sir isaac only left for dead ' then laughed so did nelson who be sitting with well mr simple be reported to sir isaac that clerk be often seen taking memorandum of different order given to fleet particularly a to there being wasteful expenditure of majesty store upon sir isaac go to admiral request that man might be discharged now old sir john be sly old fox answered not so commissioner perhaps may catch in own trap ' so admiral sits down call for pen ink flourish out long letter to commissioner stating that store of fleet be expended representing a how must be

moment increased in volume washed up to obliged to crawl further up then looked around hurricane continued in fury atmosphere be not so dark must trace for distance line of harbour from ridge of foam upon shore for first time thought of o'brien brig put mouth close to swinburne ear cried out o'brien swinburne shook head looked up again at offing thought whether there be chance of brig escape be certainly six if not seven mile off hurricane be not direct on shore might have drift of ten mile perhaps what be against such tremendous power prayed for on board of brig returned thanks for own

boat be close under bow steady port port port little port look out lad cut down who climb up crash went schooner on to boat men in in vain endeavouring to escape for second two appeared to right until further gunwale be borne down under water turned up schooner went over sending soul in to account one man clung on to rope be towed for few second cutlas divided rope at gunwale with faint shriek disappeared other boat be close to perceived what have be done remained with oar poised ready to pull so a to evade schooner steered for schooner be now running at rate of seven mile hour when close under bow by very dexterously pulling short round with starboard oar only struck with bow before went down many of spaniard have gained deck be clinging to side of vessel fought with desperation be too strong for be only who have gained deck have to contend with others clung for time unable to get up side one by one dropped into water went astern in minute on deck be lying at foot in minute more be tossed overboard after companion not however until one of struck through calf of leg with knife a be lifting over gunwale mean to say that spaniard be not justified in attempting to take schooner still a have liberated few hour before felt that be unhandsome treacherous on part therefore showed quarter there be two of men wounded a well a myself not severely be fortunate a have surgeon on

must not have have time main boom must have gone down with schooner fortunately have cleared schooner filled righted little then sank dragging main boom for few second down in vortex then rose to surface squall still continued water be smooth soon passed over again be nearly calm counted men clinging to boom found that be there swinburne be next to be holding with one hand while with other felt in pocket for quid of tobacco thrust into cheek be on deck at time mr simple said must have happened have just be relieved told collins to look out sharp for squall only mention that if be saved be not may think be neglectful of duty ai far from land still be more likely to fall in with shark than friend be thinking indeed have be thought have concealed after swinburne have mentioned shark very often looked along water for fin down below to see if be coming up to tear to piece be dreadful feeling be not fault swinburne be sure ought to have relieved kept first watch be tired must put trust in god perhaps may yet be spared be now almost calm sun have mounted in heaven scorching ray be intolerable upon head for have not defence of hat felt brain on fire be inclined to drop into water to screen from intolerable heat a day advanced so did suffering increase be dead calm sun perpendicular over actually burning that part of body rose clear of water must have welcomed even shark

asked of who have sailed with say that never speaks of own family very often boast of intimacy with nobility say that be bye blow of great man reflected very much upon connecting with numerous frank of lord privilege saw on table have misgiving then knew must do duty have reason to fear man resolved in own mind to be very correct put out of power of one to lay hold of then dismissed subject brig be repaired out of dock for day be very busy getting ready for sea never quitted in fact have wish never have taste for bad company midnight orgy have acquaintance with respectable portion of inhabitant of portsmouth at last ship company be removed into brig went out of harbour anchored at spithead captain hawkins came on board gave order book saying mr simple have great objection to written order a consider that article of war be quite sufficient to regulate ship still captain be in very responsible situation if accident occurs be held amenable therefore have framed few order of own for interior discipline of vessel may probably save harmless in case of being hauled over coal not with wish that must interfere with comfort of officer only to guard against mischance of onus may fall upon received order book captain went ashore when went down into gun room to look through at once perceived that if rigidly conformed to officer in ship must be rendered uncomfortable if not conformed to must be party be answerable showed to webster who agreed with gave a opinion that captain good nature amiability be blind that be intending to lay hold of a soon a be in power therefore called officer together told opinion webster supported be unanimously agreed that order must be obeyed although not without remonstrance major part of order however only referred to time that brig be in harbour a be about to proceed to sea be hardly worth while saying anything at present order for sailing of brig came down by same post received letter from sister ellen stating that have heard from captain fielding who have immediately written to bombay where regiment be stationed have received answer informing that there be married man in regiment of name of sullivan woman who have followed that regiment of name at once put end to research after wet nurse who have be confined in uncle house where have be sent be of course impossible to say gave up chance of discovering uncle treachery a thought of celeste sighed at little hope have of ever being united to wrote long letter to o'brien next day sailed for station in north sea captain added night order book to other sent up evening to be returned in morning with signature of officer of night watch also required signature to general order book that might not say have not read have first watch when swinburne came up to well mr simple think have made much by exchange of captain have shrewd suspicion will have squall ere long must not judge too hastily swinburne replied say that must still must go little by look in world be sure look must help much be just like winter day short dirty walk deck a if plank be not good enough for foot mr william say look a if be big with fate of cato of rome ' what that mean know joke suppose for youngster be always joking be ever up baltic mr simple now think of know never be have seen tight work up there with gun boat so must now with captain o'brien a for little man have idea 'twill be more talk than work appear to have taken great dislike to captain swinburne know whether a first lieutenant ought to listen to be because be first lieutenant tell mr simple never be mistaken in main of officer character when must look in face hear talk for hour came up on purpose to put on guard for feel convinced that towards mean mischief what doe mean by having greasy faced sergeant of marine in cabin for hour morning report a master of arm ought to come through a first lieutenant mean a spy upon upon in particular fellow have began to give air already speaks to young gentleman a if be beneath thought might not know mr simple so thought right to tell be much obliged to swinburne for good wish can do duty why must fear anything man may do duty mr simple if captain be determined to ruin have power have be longer in service than have have be wide awake only be careful of one thing mr simple beg pardon for being so free in case lose temper fear of swinburne replied be very easy to say fear of ' mr simple recollect have not yet have temper tried a officer have have always be treated like gentleman must find treated otherwise have too good blood in vein not to speak be sure of have seen officer insulted irritated till angel must put up with treatment then for unguarded word must have be swab not to have made use of sent out of service to devil forget swinburne that article of war be made for captain a well a for everybody else in ship know that still at court martial captain make great distinction between what superior say to inferior what inferior say to superior true replied quoting shakespeare be in captain choleric word in soldier be rank blasphemy exactly meaning rather think said swinburne if captain call gentleman must say same to certainly not replied can demand court martial yes will be granted what do gain by be like beating against heavy gale lee tide thousand to one if fetch port if do vessel be strained to piece sail worn a thin a newspaper rigging chafed half through wanting fresh serving order for refit laid up in ordinary for rest of life mr simple best plan be to grin bear keep sharp look out for depend upon mr simple in best ship company in world spy captain will always find spy follower do refer observation to mr swinburne said voice from under bulwark started round found captain who have crept upon deck unperceived by during conversation swinburne made reply touched hat walked over to leeward presume mr simple said captain turning to that consider justified in finding fault abusing captain to inferior officer on majesty quarter deck if heard previous conversation sir replied must be aware that be speaking generally about court martial imagine have be guilty of impropriety in conversing with officer upon point connected with service mean then to assert sir that gunner did not refer to when said word spy captain ' acknowledge sir that a be listening unperceived term might appear to refer to gunner have idea at time that be listening observation be that spy captain must always find spy follower take to be general observation be sorry that think otherwise very well mr simple said captain hawkins walked down companion ladder into cabin now a' odd mr simple must come with intention of being of service to yet get into scrape however perhaps be for best open war be preferable to watching in dark stabbing in back never meant to have shown colour hit so hard that forgot suspect that to be case swinburne think that have better not talk more with to night wish have talked quite so much a thing have turned out replied swinburne good night sir reflected upon what have passed felt convinced that swinburne be right in saying that be better have occurred than otherwise now knew ground stood upon forewarned be being forearmed chapter fifty five encounter dutch brig of war captain hawkins very contemplative near capstan hard knock thanks for who be afraid men will talk brig go about on wrong tack at next morning be off texel must see low sand hill have scarcely made out when fog in offing cleared up made strange vessel hand be turned up sail made in chase made out to be brig of war a altered course considerably have idea that be enemy made private signal be unanswered cleared for action brig making sail on starboard tack following bearing about two mile on out weather bow breeze be not steady at one time brig be staggering under top gallant sail while have royal set at must have hand by top gallant sheet topsail halyard while expanded stitch of canvas on whole however in hour have neared about mile men be at quarter happy to be so soon at old work jacket hat be thrown off bandana handkerchief tied round head else black silk handkerchief tied round waist gun be ready everything be in place soul be going to say be anxious for set to rather think must not include captain who from commencement showed sign of pleasure anything presence of mind when first chased vessel be reported that be merchantman be not until have broad daylight that discovered to be man of war there be one thing to be said in favour have never be in action in life breeze now fell light be with sail set when thick fog obscured from sight fog rolled on till met then must not see ten yard from brig be source of great mortification a have chance of losing fortunately wind be settling down fast into calm about twelve o'clock sail flapped against mast reported twelve o'clock asked captain whether must pipe to dinner not yet replied will put head about go about sir replied with surprise yes said be convinced that chase be on other tack at moment if will lose if go about sir said must get among sand will be sure of sir replied when ask advice will be pleased to give command vessel touched hat turned hand up about ship convinced that captain wished to avoid action a only chance of escape for brig be keeping wind in tack be on 'bout ship 'bout ship cried men what hell be going about for inquired of one a came up ladder silence there fore aft cried captain hawkins think can get round unless wear wind be very light then wear ship mr simple there be time when grumbling discontent among seaman be so participated by officer although show that expression made use of be passed unheeded such be case at present officer looked at other said nothing men be unguarded in expression brig wore gradually round when men be bracing up yard sharp on other tack instead of hurrah down with mark fell back with groan brace up yard in silence there said to men be must say rope be coiled down piped to dinner captain who continued on deck must not fail to hear discontented expression occasionally be made use of on lower deck made observation occasionally looked over side to see whether brig went through water did slowly for about ten minute when fell perfect calm so that to use common phrase gained little by motion about half past one slight breeze from opposite quarter sprung up turned round to increased fog blew away in quarter of hour chase be again visible now upon lee beam men gave three cheer silence there fore aft cried captain angrily mr simple be way that ship company have be disciplined under late commander to halloo bawl whenever think proper be irritated at reflection upon o'brien replied yes sir have be always accustomed to express joy at prospect of engaging enemy very well mr simple replied how be to put head inquired master touching hat for chase of course replied captain who then descended into cabin come lad said swinburne a soon a captain be below have be going round fine that pet be in good fighting order promise ye sha' wait for powder will find that rattlesnake can bite devilish hard yet expect ay without head too replied one of men who be joe miller of brig chase perceiving that must not escape for be coming up with hand over hand now shortened sail for action hoisting dutch colour captain hawkins again made appearance on quarter deck when be within mile of be to run alongside of how inquired mr simple command replied want interference whatever very well sir replied walked to gangway mr thompson cried captain who appeared to have screwed up courage to right pitch have now taken position for moment on one of carronades will lay brig right bang bang whiz whiz bang whiz came three shot from enemy cleaving air between mast captain jumped down from carronade hastened to capstan without finishing sentence will fire when be ready sir said for perceived that be not capable of giving correct order yes yes to be sure replied remaining where be thompson said to master think can manage in present commanding position to get foul of so a to knock away jib boom fore topmast then ca escape have good way on will manage simple name be not thompson replied master jumping into quarter boat conning vessel in exposed situation a received enemy fire look out lad pour into now just a please said to men seaman be however too well disciplined to take immediate advantage of permission waited until passed just a master put up helm so a to catch jib boom between mast whole broadside be poured into bow chess tree jib boom fore topgallant went down have so much way through water that tore clear from rounding to wind shot head enemy although in confusion from effect of broadside put up helm to rake perceived manoeuvre did same then squaring sail ran with before wind engaging broadside to broadside continued about hour soon found that have fool to play with brig be well fought gun well directed have several men taken down below thought must be better to engage even closer there be about cable length between vessel a ran before wind at about six mile hour with slight rolling motion thompson said let see if can not beat from gun let port helm close till can shy biscuit on board just opinion simple will see if wo make sort of running fight of in few minute be so close on board of that men who loaded gun must touch other with rammer sponge men cheered be gallantly returned by enemy havoc be now commenced by musketry on side french captain who appeared a brave fellow a ever stepped stood for minute on hammock be also holding on by swifter of main rigging when took off hat politely saluted returned compliment fire became too hot wished to get under shelter of bulwark still must not go down first french captain appeared determined not to be first to quit post of honour at last one of marine hit in right arm clasped hand to part a if to point out to nodded be assisted down from hammock immediately quitted post for thought foolish to stand a mark for forty fifty soldier have already received bullet through small of leg effect of such close fire now became apparent gun be only half manned side terribly cut up sail rigging in tatter enemy be even worse off two broadside more brought mainmast by board men cheered threw in broadside enemy dropped astern rounded to rake also attempted to round to must not until have cleared away wreck taken in foresail lowered topsail then continued action with a much spirit a ever be fine fellow by god exclaimed thompson never saw man fight ship better have webster down poor fellow be sorry for replied be afraid that there be many poor fellow who have lost number of mess think useless throwing away advantage now have ca escape will fight way for ever have better run head repair damage then must surrender in crippled state when attack again agree with said thompson only point be that will soon be dark will not lose sight of can not get away if put before wind then will be at again gave loaded gun a forged head when be about mile from hove to to repair damage reader may now ask where be captain time answer be that be at capstan where stood in silence not once interfering during whole action be fought by thompson master how looked how behaved in other point during engagement can not pretend to say for have time to observe even now be busy knotting rigging rousing up new sail to bend getting everything in order must not have observed have not come up to for a soon a have ceased firing appeared to recover did not however first address commenced speaking to men come be smart lad send hand here to swab up blood here youngster run down to surgeon let know wish report of killed wounded by degree talked more at last came up to have be rather smartish mr simple very smart indeed sir replied then turned away to give direction maintop there send down hauling line on starboard side ay ay sir now then lad clap on run up at once maintop there hailed captain be little smarter by god will call down for something did not come with good grace from one who have done nothing to who be working with energy mr simple said captain wish must carry on duty with le noise at event set example during action muttered joe miller other men laughed heartily at implication in two hour during have carefully watched enemy who still lay where left be again ready for action will give men grog now sir said to captain must want replied captain mr simple like what call dutch courage think much doe fellow have shown plenty of said joe miller softly men about laughed heartily think sir observed that be injustice to fine ship company to hint at requiring dutch courage dutch courage be term for courage screwed up by drinking freely most respectfully beg leave to observe that men have not have afternoon allowance after fatigue have undergone really require command ship sir replied certainly sir be aware of rejoined be now ready for action again wait order enemy be two mile on lee quarter surgeon here came up with report good heaven said captain forty seven men killed wounded mr webster dangerously why brig be crippled can do more positively can do more can take brig anyhow cried one of seaman from dozen of men who be to leeward expecting order to renew attack what man be that cried captain one answered by god ship be in state of mutiny mr simple will soon be think said voice from crowd knew very well captain having be short time with did not know do hear that mr simple cried captain regret to say that did hear sir little thought ever expression must have be make use of on board of rattlesnake then fearing must ask man name to pretend not to have recognised said who be that who made use of expression one answered be so dark that be impossible to distinguish men after such mutinous expression observed captain certainly will not risk majesty brig under command a must have wished to have done even in crippled state by again engaging enemy can only regret that officer appear a insolent a men perhaps captain hawkins will state in what when have proved insolent can not accuse hope expression be not applied to sir said thompson master touching hat silence gentleman if please mr simple wear round ship whether captain intended to attack enemy not must not tell be soon undeceived for when be round ordered to be kept away until dutch brig be on lee quarter then ordering master to shape course for yarmouth went down into cabin sent up word might pipe to supper serve out spirit rage indignation of men must not be withheld after went down to supper gave three heavy groan in concert indeed during whole of night officer who kept watch have great difficulty in keeping men from venting feeling in what might be almost termed justifiable mutiny a for myself must hardly control vexation brig be certain prize be proved for next day hauled down colour immediately to much smaller man of war fell in with still lying in same crippled state captain first lieutenant killed nearly two third of ship company either killed wounded have attacked must have hauled down colour immediately for be last broadside have killed captain who have shown so much courage a first lieutenant must have received promotion be now lost cried for vexation when thought of a lay in bed that conduct be severely commented upon by officer in gun room a well a by whole ship company hardly need say thompson be for bringing to court martial must most gladly have done if only be to get rid of have long conversation with old swinburne on subject proved to that have better not attempt for d 'ye see mr simple have proof did not run down below stood ground on deck although did nothing ca prove cowardice then although there can be great doubt of again with regard to not renewing attack why be not captain at liberty to decide what be best for majesty service if thought in crippled state of brig so close to enemy coast that be advisable why must only be brought in a error in judgment then there be thing must be remembered mr simple be that captain sitting on court martial will if be possible to extricate ever prove cowardice against brother captain because feel that be disgrace to whole cloth swinburne advice be good gave up thought of proceeding still appeared to that captain be very much afraid must be so extremely amiable polite during run home said that have watched how well have behaved in action must not fail to notice be something did not keep word for despatch be published before quitted roadstead not name of one officer mentioned only generally saying that conducted to satisfaction called enemy corvette not specifying whether be brig ship corvette whole be written in such bombastic style that one must have imagined that have found vessel of superior force stated at end that a soon a repaired damage wore round that enemy declined further action so did certainly for best of possible reason that be too disabled to come down to might have be contested enormous list of killed wounded proved that have have hard fight capture of brig afterwards that have really overpowered so that on whole captain hawkins gained great deal of credit with although whisper be afloat came to ear of admiralty prevented from being posted more so a have modesty not to apply for chapter fifty six consequence of action ship without fighting captain be like thing without head so do sailor think mutiny loss of famous ship company during stay at yarmouth be not allowed to put foot on shore upon plea that must repair damage proceed immediately to station real fact be that captain hawkins be very anxious that must not be able to talk about action finding charge preferred against recommenced system of annoyance apartment have window looked out upon where brig lay at anchor constantly watched motion with spy glass noting down if did not hoist up boat etcetera exactly at hour prescribed in book of order so a to gather list of charge against if must did not find out until afterwards mentioned before when swinburne joined at plymouth have recommended figure head being put on brig have be done at o'brien expense not in cheap way recommended by swinburne in very handsome manner be large snake coiled up in fold with head darting out in menacing attitude tail with rattle appeared below whole be gilded have very good effect after dock yard men have completed repair brig be painted one night head of rattlesnake disappeared have be sawed off by malicious evil disposed person trace of be to be found be obliged to report to captain who be very indignant offered twenty pound for discovery of offender have offered twenty thousand never must have found out delinquent be however never forgotten for understood what be implied by manoeuvre new head be carved disappeared night after be fixed on rage of captain be without bound turned hand up declared that if offender be not given up must flog hand on board gave ship company ten minute then prepared to execute threat mr paul turn hand up for punishment said captain in rage descended to cabin for article of war when be down below officer talked over matter to flog man for crime of one be height of injustice be not for to oppose still ship company must have seen in countenance that shared feeling men

red handle man walked down below one be left on quarter deck marine under arm officer perceiving desired mr paul boatswain to send men up to rig grating quarter master with seizing came up said that

standing aft marine loaded with powder put ball into pocket wished to keep up character of corp for fidelity at same time not fire upon men whom loved a brother with whom coincided in opinion indeed afterwards discovered that be marine who have taken off head of snake second time captain then ordered boatswain to turn hand up boatswain made appearance with right arm in sling what be matter with

will repent paul pipe down mr simple man gig recollect be positive order that boat go on shore captain left brig looking dagger at a went over side have done duty cared little for indeed be now watching conduct a carefully a did mine captain wish to tell own story first said thompson coming up to now if be simple must take care that real fact must be known how be to be done replied have ordered communication with shore simply by sending officer on board of of frigate to state that brig be in state of mutiny request that will keep look out upon be more than duty a commanding officer only send message leave to state fact of own accord recollect that captain of frigate will be summoned if there be court of inquiry expect will take place considered little thought advice good

service most special tyrant who be not coward tyranny be excessive there be meanness in there disposition on contrary be generous open hearted occasionally when not influenced by anger proved that heart if not quite right be not very much out of place yet be tyrant although tyrant men forgave one kind act when be not led away by impetuosity of feeling obliterated hundred act of tyranny such be not case in service with men who in tyranny be seaman show quarter to will undergo risk severity of article of war render liable to rather than not express opinion of man whom despise like to mention

that came up a usually did be true enough for invariably came up by stealth captain hawkins do not think allowing that came up on deck in usual way a term that must have done better to have hemmed hawed so a to let officer know that be present must be very sorry to hear might be said of in supposed absence to observation captain hawkins replied be so astonished at conversation that be quite breathless having till then have highest opinion of more question be asked proceeded to second charge be very trifling one for lighting stove contrary to order evidence brought forward be sergeant of

o'clock again proceeded on board in short time court be sitting came in handed defence to judge advocate who read aloud to court have copy still by will give whole of to reader mr president gentleman after nearly fourteen year service in majesty navy during have be twice made prisoner twice wounded once wrecked a trust will prove to by certificate public despatch have done duty with zeal honour now find in situation in never expected to be placed that of being arraigned before brought to court martial for charge of mutiny disaffection disrespect towards superior officer if honourable court will examine certificate be about to produce will find that until sailed with captain hawkins conduct have always be supposed to have be diametrically opposite to be now imputed to have always be diligent obedient to command have only to regret that captain with whom have have honour to sail be not now present to corroborate by oral evidence truth of document allow in first place to point out to court that charge against be spread over large space of time amounting to nearly eighteen month during whole of period captain hawkins never stated to that be intention to try by court martial although repeatedly in presence of senior officer have never preferred charge against article of war state expressly that if officer soldier marine have complaint to make be to do so upon arrival at port fleet where may fall in with superior officer admit that article of war refers to complaint to be made by inferior against superior at same time venture to submit to honourable court that superior be equally bound to prefer charge to give notice that charge will be preferred on first seasonable opportunity instead of lulling offender into security disarming in defence by allowing time to run on so long a to render incapable of bringing forward witness take liberty of calling to attention will now proceed to answer charge have be brought against be accused of having held conversation with inferior officer on quarter deck of majesty brig rattlesnake in captain be treated with contempt that may not be supposed that mr swinburne be new acquaintance made upon joining brig must observe that be old shipmate with whom have served many year with whose worth be well acquainted be instructor in more youthful day have be rewarded for merit with warrant now hold a gunner of majesty brig rattlesnake offensive observation in first place be not mine in second be couched in general term here mr swinburne have pointedly confessed that did refer to captain although observation be in plural doe not prove charge against on contrary add weight to assertion of mr swinburne be guiltless of present charge captain hawkins have acted a spy own evidence on charge a well a brought forward by other witness will decidedly prove a truth of observation doe not warrant utterance be glad that such expression escaped lip upon second charge will dwell short time be true that there be general order that stove will be alight after certain hour will appeal to honourable court whether first lieutenant be not considered to have degree of licence of judgment in concern interior discipline of ship surgeon sent to say that stove be required for one of sick be in bed at time replied immediately in affirmative doe captain hawkins mean to assert to honourable court that must have refused request of surgeon most certainly not only error committed if be error be not going through form of awaking captain hawkins to ask permission a first lieutenant thought authorised to give charge against of having sent away two boat contrary to order have already disproved by witness order of captain hawkins be not to communicate with shore reason for sending away boat here captain hawkins interposed stated to president that reason be not necessary to be received court be cleared on return court have decided that reason ought to be given continued reason for sending away boat rather be one boat be despatched to two frigate if remember well be that brig be in state of mutiny captain have tied up one of men ship company refused to be flogged captain hawkins then went on shore to admiral to report situation of ship conceived duty to make known to men of war anchored close to will not enter into further particular a will only detain honourable court be aware that court martial be held upon conduct not upon of captain hawkins to charge of again holding disrespectful language on quarter deck a overheard by captain hawkins must refer honourable court to evidence in be plainly proved that remark upon be not mine of mr swinburne that remonstrated with mr swinburne for using such unguarded expression only point of difficulty be whether be not duty to have reported such language reply that there be proof did not intend to report presence of captain hawkins who heard what be said rendered such report unnecessary on fifth charge must beg that court will be pleased to consider allowance ought to be made for moment of irritation character be traduced by captain hawkins supposing be dead so much so that even ship company cried out shame be aware that language of superior officer can warrant retort from inferior a what intended to imply by language be not yet known although captain hawkins have given explanation to will merely say that meant more by insinuation than captain hawkins did at time by made use of with respect to upon other trifling charge brought forward lay stress a consider fully refuted by evidence have be already adduced will merely observe for reason best known to have be met with most decided hostility on part of captain hawkins from time that first joined ship on occasion have used effort to render uncomfortable embroil with others that not content with narrowly watching conduct on board have resorted to spy glass from shore instead of assisting in execution of duty sufficiently arduous have thrown obstacle in way placed inferior officer a spy over conduct made feel so humiliated in presence of ship company over have have to superintend in disciplining of have right to look to for support be not that odium must necessarily be attached to sentence must feel a one of happiest event of life be dismissed from situation now hold under command now beg that honourable court will allow document lay upon table to be
