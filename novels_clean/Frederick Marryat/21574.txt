astonishment must anybody else have witnessed a soon a wife have spoken rushbrook immediately sprang upon foot fine looking man six foot in height very erect in bearing proved to be perfectly sober jane dear said there never be such night must be quick lose time be gun ready everything ready joey be lying down on bed ready dressed awakes in minute call then for there be time to lose that drunken fool furness proposed throwing over bridge be lucky for that did not try must have be obliged to settle that might tell tale where mum in wash house will bring joey directly wife left room while rushbrook took down gun ammunition prepared for expedition in minute two shepherd dog have be released from wash house made appearance quietly lay down close to master foot be soon followed by mr rushbrook accompanied by joey thin meagre looking boy of about twelve year old very small for age apparently a active a cat with energy corresponding one must have thought have be roused from sleep there be yawning weariness of motion on contrary large eye be a bright a eagle a quietly although quickly provided with sack threw over shoulder coil of line held in hand waiting until father be ready to start wife put out light softly opened cottage door looked well round then returned to husband who giving low whistle a summons to joey dog walked out of door not word be spoken door be softly shut to trio crept stealthily away chapter two in hero of tale be formally introduced before proceed with narrative perhaps will be better to explain what may appear very strange to reader joseph rushbrook who have just left cottage with son dog be born in village in be then residing during younger day forty year previous to present introduction to reader law be not so severe measure taken against poacher so strong a be at period of write in youth have be very fond of carrying gun a father have be before never be discovered after having poached for many year gained perfect knowledge of country for mile round be persuaded in fit of semi intoxication at neighbouring fair to enlist in marching regiment have not be more than three month at depot when be ordered out to india where remained eleven year before be recalled have scarcely be six month in england when exigency of war demanded service of regiment in mediterranean where remained for twelve year having received severe wound in head be then pensioned off discharged resolved to return to native village settle down quietly hoping by moderate labour pension to gain comfortable living on return be hardly known many have emigrated to foreign clime many have be transported for offence against law particularly for offence of poaching a most of former ally have be so employed found almost stranger where expected to meet with friend property also about village have changed hand people recollected squire so so baronet now land be held by wealthy manufacturer retired merchant be new to joe rushbrook felt anywhere at home jane ashley very beautiful young woman who be in service at hall mansion appertaining to adjacent property daughter of one of earliest friend who have be transported for poaching be almost only one who must talk to after absence of twenty four year not that knew people at time for be then infant have grown up with after joe have left must narrate anecdote of what have be eventual destiny jane having be daughter of man who have be transported for poaching be to joe sort of recommendation ended in taking for wife have not be long settled in cottage before joe former propensity returned in fact must not be idle have carried musket too long have lived life of excitement in service of country that found impossible to exist without shooting at something former love of poaching came strong upon wife so far from checking encouraged in feeling consequence be that two year after marriage joe rushbrook be most determined poacher in county although often suspected have never be detected one great cause of be appearing to be such drunkard plan hit upon by wife who have observed that drunken men be not suspected of being poacher scheme have therefore be hit upon very successfully for proving before magistrate that man be carried home dead drunk speechless at midnight be quite a good alibi a must be brought forward joe rushbrook have therefore credit of being worthless drunken fellow who lived upon pension what wife must earn one have idea that be not only earning livelihood laying by money from successful night labour not that joe did not like drop occasionally on contrary must sometimes drink freely generally speaking wound in head be complained of must if wind be fresh set in right quarter contrive to be carried home on night in have most work to do such be case a have represented in first chapter little joey who a reader may anticipate will be future hero be born first year after marriage be only child be quiet thoughtful reflective boy for year have imbibed father love of walking out on dark night to extraordinary degree be strange to see how much prudence there be mingled with love of adventure in lad true be father have trained early first to examine snare conceal game little shrimp like joey must do without being suspected to be otherwise employed than in picking blackberry before be seven year old joey must set springe a well a father be well versed in mystery art of unlawful taking of game indeed be very valuable to father must do what father must not have ventured upon without exciting suspicion be perhaps from constant vigil that little boy be so small in size at event diminutive size be cause of there being suspicion attached to joey went very regularly to day school of mr furness although often up best part of night be one of best most diligent of scholar one must have supposed that little fair haired quiet looking boy who be so busy with book writing must have be out night on perilous excursion for such be at time be speaking of need hardly be observed that joey have learned one important lesson be to be silent not even mum dog who must not speak be more secret more faithful be astonishing how much nature disposition of child may be altered by early tuition let child be always with nurse even under guidance of mother regularly brought up a child usually be will continue to be child even childish after childhood be gone take same child put by degree in situation of peril requiring thought observation beyond year accustom to nightly vigil to watching to hold tongue be astonishing how mind of child however much body may suffer will develop so a to meet demand upon thus be with lad be sent early to sea thus be with little joey be man in point although child in others must play with companion laugh a loudly a others still must never breathe hint of what be father employment went to church sunday a did father mother for considered that poaching be crime although punished a such by law of course considered crime a only did what father mother wished let not be thought therefore that moral of little hero be affected by father profession for such be not case having entered into necessary explanation will now proceed band of north american indian must have observed better trail than kept by little party rushbrook walked first followed by hero dog mum not word be spoken continued route over grass land ploughed field keeping in shade of hedgerow if rushbrook stopped for while to reconnoitre so did joey so did mum at relative distance until march be resumed for three mile half did thus continue until arrived at thick cover wind whistled through branch of bare tree chiefly oak ash cold damp fog be now stationary shrouded a proceeded cautiously by beaten track in cover until have passed through arrived on other side where cottage of gamekeeper be situated feeble light be burning shone through diamond paned window rushbrook walked out clear of cover held up hand to ascertain precisely direction of wind having satisfied retreated into cover in direction so a to be exactly to leeward of keeper house that noise of report of gun might not be heard having cleared hedge lowered gun so a to bring barrel within two three inch of ground walked slowly cautiously through brushwood followed a before by joey mum after about quarter of mile walk rattling of metal be heard stopped short be barrel of fowling piece have brushed one of wire attached to spring gun set for benefit of poacher rushbrook lifted up left hand a sign to joey not to move following wire by continually rattling barrel against eventually arrived at gun opened pan threw out priming leaving with pan open so that must not go off in case fell in with of wire rushbrook then proceeded to business for well knew that gun must be set where pheasant be most accustomed to roost put small charge of powder in fowling piece that being so near might not shatter bird because noise of report must be much le walking under oak tree soon discovered round black mass body of roosting pheasant presented between sky raising piece fired heavy bound on earth near foot followed discharge joey then slipped forward put pheasant into bag shot shot brought increase to joey load seventeen be already in when mum gave low growl be signal for people being near rushbrook snapped finger dog came forward to side stood motionless with ear tail erect in minute time be heard rustling of branch a party forced way through underwood rushbrook stood still waiting signal from mum for dog have be taught if party advancing have dog with always to raise fore foot up to rushbrook knee not otherwise mum made such sign then rushbrook lay down in brushwood motion being closely followed by son dog voice in whisper be now heard form of two men with gun be to be seen not four yard from where be lying somewhere about here will swear said one yes think so may be further on wind have brought down sound very true let follow may fall back upon spring gun party then advanced into cover be soon out of sight after time rushbrook held ear to wind satisfied that be safe moved homewards arrived without further adventure having relieved joey of heavy sack a soon a be in open field at three o'clock in morning tapped at back door of cottage jane opened spoil of night having be put away in secret place be soon in bed fast asleep chapter three train child in way must go will not depart from be old saying that if there be receiver there must be thief must have be of very little use for rushbrook to take game if have not have mean of disposing of in point byre pedlar be valuable accessory byre be radical knave who did not admire hard work at first took up profession of bricklayer labourer one be of nature only affording occasional work moderate wage did that might apply to parish for relief hing for major portion of year even few month work must not suit subsequently gained sustenance by carrying on head large basket of crockery disposing of ware among cottager at last took out pedlar license perhaps one of most dangerous permit ever allowed by government have be cause of much of ill will discontent fomented among lower class latterly cheapness of printing easiness of circulation have rendered profession of le consequence twenty year ago village ale house be not provided with newspaper be expense never thought of men went to drink beer talk over news of vicinity if there be disturbance in other portion of united kingdom fact be only gained by rumour vaguely long after have taken place when pedlar byre made appearance at last did weekly oftener a might happen there be great change be party who supplied information in consequence be always welcome looked upon a oracle best seat near fire be reserved for having deposited pack upon table in corner must then produce propeller other publication full of treason blasphemy read aloud for benefit of labourer assembled few month be more than sufficient to produce most serious effect men who have worked cheerfully through day retired to bed satisfied with lot thankful that work be to be obtained now remained at public house canvassing conduct of government leaving resort satisfied in own mind that be ill used harshly treated in bitter bondage if met superior very party to whom be indebted for employment there be respect shown to a formerly if so be sullen forced acknowledgement church be gradually deserted appearance of pastor be no longer signal for hat to be lifted from head on contrary boy of sixteen seventeen year of age must lean against church wall of churchyard with hand in pocket sort of leer upon face a though defied pastor on appearance there must remain outside during service meeting unquailed without blushing eye cast upon a came out again such be state of thing in village of grassford in one year after pedlar have added to continual round byre be great favourite for procured for woman what commissioned to obtain girl with ribbon gewgaw trusted to considerable extent reappearance be always anxiously looked for lived scot free at public house for brought so much custom be occasion of drinking of so much ale that landlord considered coming a godsend box of ware be well supplied in sunnier month for fine weather be time for wearing of gay ribbon in winter travelled more to receive order to carry away game supplied to by poacher with whom be in league have box be examined during shooting season must have be found loaded with pheasant not with trinket ribbon need hardly be observed after byre be party who took off hand of rushbrook game procured have notice to call for before daylight generally second morning after have be obtained for rushbrook be too cautious to trust byre with secret that of never going out of night without having previously pretended intoxication having suffered to be led carried home reader will acknowledge little joey be placed in very dangerous position be true that be not aware that be doing wrong in assisting father nevertheless being reflective boy did sometimes occur to that be odd that what be right must be done so secretly attempted to make out how be that bird flew about everywhere appeared to belong to one might not be shot in open day knew that law forbade inquired of why such law must be joey have heard one side of question be therefore puzzled be fortunate for that pastor of parish although did not reside in did at least once week call in at mr f school examine boy mr furness who be always sober during school hour be very proud of visit used to point out little joey a most promising scholar induced pastor to take more immediate notice of hero commendation received advice be bestowed upon be probably great cause why joey did attend assiduously to lesson otherwise vagrant life must have disinclined to do also kept character for honesty good principle really deserved indeed father mother setting aside poaching secrecy resorted to in consequence be by mean bad example in ordinary course of life did to neighbour a must be done by be fair honest in dealing invariably inculcated probity regard to truth on son may appear anomalous to many of reader there be many strange anomaly in world may therefore be stated in very few word although little hero have chance of eventually following road to ruin yet up to present time have not entered such be life led by little joey for three year subsequent to introduction of to reader day became more useful to father latterly have not attended school in forenoon for a have before observed joey must from diminutive size unsuspicious appearance do much that father must not have ventured to attempt be a well versed in art of snaring a father sauntering like child about field hedge row must examine noose take out game hide till must bring home sometimes must go out at night attended only by mum dog must invariably give mute notice by simply standing with ear tail erect when keeper have discovered snare be lying in wait for poacher to lay hold of when came to ascertain success even in such case joey very often must not retreat crawling on stomach must arrive at snare take out animal without keeper perceiving for eye be invariably directed to horizon watching appearance of stout figure of man while joey crawled along bearing away prize unseen at other time joey must reap rich harvest in broad day by mean of favourite game cock having put on animal steel spur must plunge into thickest of cover selecting small spot of cleared ground for combat must throw down gallant bird conceal in brushwood game cock must immediately crow challenge be immediately answered by pugnacious male pheasant who flew down to meet combat be short for pheasant be soon pierced by sharp steel of adversary a one antagonist fell dead again must game cock crow challenge be accepted by in hour two small arena be field of blood joey must creep forward put victorious cock into bag together with many dead adversary watch opportunity for safe retreat such be employment of hero although suspicion have often be attached to father none have idea that there have be violation of law on part of son when event took place changed hero destiny chapter four in author have endeavoured with power to suit present taste of public have said that byre be receiver of game obtained by rushbrook so happened that in account byre have not adhered to duty towards neighbour in fact attempted to over reach without success from time byre became rushbrook determined secret enemy month have passed since disagreement there be mutual mistrust a men be equally revengeful in temper when happened to meet late on saturday night at ale house be usual resort furness schoolmaster be there many others have already drunk too much be boisterous noisy few of wife of drinking be waiting patiently sorrowfully outside arm folded in apron a defence against cold watching for husband to come out that might coax home before major part of week earnings have be spent in liquor byre have paper in hand have taken from schoolmaster who be too far gone to read be declaiming loudly against government monarchy law when stranger entered tap room where be assembled rushbrook be at time sitting down intending quietly to take pint walk home a have too much respect for sabbath to follow profession of poacher on morning of day did not intend therefore to resort to usual custom of pretending to be intoxicated when stranger came in to great surprise observed glance of recognition between byre after appeared a if be perfect stranger rushbrook watched carefully so a not to let perceive be so doing when beckon from stranger to byre be again made byre continued to read paper to harangue at same time took opportunity of making signal in reply there be something in stranger appearance told rushbrook that be employed a keeper something in way for often single out enemy by instinct that there be mischief in wind rushbrook felt sure heart misgave more so a occasionally eye of be turned towards after little reflection rushbrook determined to feign intoxication a have so often done before called for pint for time talked very loud at last laid head on table after time lifted up again drank more then fell back on bench by degree company thinned until there be one left schoolmaster pedlar stranger schoolmaster a usual offered to assist pedlar in helping rushbrook to cottage byre replied that be busy that need not wait for rushbrook friend have with must assist in taking home drunken man schoolmaster reeled home leaving two together sat down on bench not far from rushbrook who appeared to to be in last stage of inebriety conversation be easily overheard pedlar stated that have watched several night never must find when rushbrook left cottage have traced boy more than once that r have promised to have game ready for on tuesday must go out on monday night for in short rushbrook discovered that byre be about to betray to man whom in course of conversation found out to be game keeper newly hired by lord of manor after while broke up byre having promised to join keeper in expedition to assist in securing former ally having made arrangement then took hold of rushbrook by arm shaking to rouse a much a must led home to cottage left in charge of wife a soon a door be closed rushbrook long repressed anger must no longer be restrained started on foot striking fist on table so a to terrify wife swore that pedlar must pay dear for peaching upon wife demanding explanation rushbrook in few hurried sentence explained whole jane however might agree with in indignation like woman shuddered at thought of shedding blood persuaded husband to go to bed consented slept not have one feeling be vengeance towards traitor when revenge enters into breast of man who have lived peaceably at home fiercely a may be impelled by passion stop short at idea of shedding blood when man who have like rushbrook served so long in army witnessed such scene of carnage so often passed bayonet through adversary body be roused up by fatal passion death of fellow creature becomes matter of indifference provided can gratify feeling thus be with rushbrook who before rose on morning of sabbath in have gone to church must have so often requested trespass might be forgiven a forgave who trespassed against have made up mind that nothing short of pedlar death must satisfy at breakfast appeared to listen to wife entreaty promised to do pedlar harm told that instead of going out on monday night a have promised must go out on very night by mean evade snare laid for jane persuaded not to go out at rushbrook must not consent to told that be determined to show that be not to be driven off beat must make byre believe on tuesday night that have be out on monday night rushbrook object be to have meeting with byre if possible alone to tax with treachery then to take summary vengeance aware that byre slept at ale house went down there little before dark told that intended going out on night that must be better if instead of coming on tuesday be to meet at corner of one of cover described at hour agreed upon when must make over to game might have procured byre who saw in excellent method of trapping rushbrook consented to intending to inform keeper so that must meet rushbrook time of meeting be arranged for two o'clock in morning rushbrook be certain that byre must leave ale house hour two before time proposed must be more than sufficient for giving information to keeper therefore remained quietly at home till twelve o'clock when loaded gun went out without joey dog wife perceiving be convinced that have not gone out with intention to poach be pursuing scheme of revenge watched after left cottage observed that have gone down in direction of ale house be afraid that there must be mischief between byre wakened joey desiring to follow

little more decent chapter eight dissertation upon pedigree reader will not perhaps be displeased if introduce captain o'donahue more particularly to notice will therefore devote chapter to giving account of birth parentage subsequent career if father of captain o'donahue be to be believed race of o'donahues be king in ireland long before o'connor be ever heard of how far may be correct can not pretend to offer opinion further than man can be supposed to know so much of family history a descendant document be never laid before have only positive assertion of squireen o'donahue who asserted not only that be king in ireland before o'connor whose pretension to ancestry treated with contempt further that be renowned for strength be famous for using longest bow in battle be ever known heard of here have circumstantial evidence although not proof if strong might have be king in ireland for there might have be right for many century certainly acquirement be handed down to posterity a one be more famous for drawing long bow than squireen o'donahue upon point however must leave reader to form own opinion perhaps one more acquainted with archive of country may be able to set right if be wrong to corroborate testimony if be right in preface to anne of geierstein sir walter scott observes that error however trivial ought in opinion never to be pointed out to author without meeting with candid respectful acknowledgement following example of so great man can only say that if gentleman can prove disprove assertion of squireen o'donahue to wit that o'donahues be king of ireland long before o'connor be heard of will be most happy to acknowledge favour insert remark in next edition must be further obliged to same party indeed other must favour with idea of what be implied by king of ireland in day be to say whether held court taxed subject collected revenue kept up standing army sent ambassador to foreign country did king do nowadays whether shillelagh be sceptre domain furze crowned hill bog intricacy of be known only to whether be arrayed in jewelled robe with crown of gold weighing on temple whether went bare legged bare armed with bare lock flowing in luxurious wildness to breeze request answer to in full simplicity observe even in ireland now fellow six foot high stout in proportion be called prince of fellow although have not wherewithal to buy paper of tobacco to supply dhudeen arguing from fact be inclined to think that few more inch in stature commensurate muscular increase of power must in former time have raised heir apparent to dignity of irish throne abstruse speculation have led from history must now resume may once have be importance of house of o'donahue one thing be certain that there be many ups down in world family in have wheel of fortune revolves faster slower a fate decree descendant of king before o'connor time be now descended into specie of viceroy squireen o'donahue being steward of certain wild estate in county of galway belonging to family who for many year have shown decided aversion to natural beauty of country have thought proper to migrate to where if people be not so much attached to be at event more civilised estate be extensive not lucrative abounded in rock brushwood woodcock during season although squireen o'donahue did best if not for employer at least for be with difficulty that contrived to support with anything like respectability in part of country mean dacent clothes to wear very numerous family lineally descended from most ancient of king of ireland before squireen have obtained employment have sunk rank travelled much a courier thereby gaining much knowledge of world if therefore have wealth to leave child at event must impart to that knowledge be said to be better than worldly possession having three son eight daughter of growing up healthy strong with commensurate appetite soon found that be necessary to get rid of a fast a must eldest who strange to say for o'donahue be quiet lad have a favour lent to brother who kept small tobacconist grocer shop in dublin brother be so fond of eventually o'carroll o'donahue be bound to a apprentice certainly be degradation for descendant of such ancient king to be weighing out pennyworth of sugar supplying halfpenny paper of tobacco to old apple fish woman still there must leave heir apparent while turn to second son mr patrick o'donahue whose history be now relating having already made reader acquainted with by introduction in saint james park chapter nine in advice of father deserves peculiar attention may be supposed that a steward of estate squireen o'donahue have influence over numerous tenant on property influence took care to make most of assistance in political contest be rewarded by offer of ensigncy for one of son in regiment then raising in ireland offer be too good to be refused so one fine day squireen o'donahue came home from dublin well bespattered with mud found son patrick also well bespattered with mud having just returned home from very successful expedition against woodcock patrick jewel said squireen taking seat wiping face for be rather warm with ride be made man well made too father if girl be anything of judge replied patrick put out replied squireen have more to be vain of than figure what may be that be discoursing about father nothing more le better worse be ensign in majesty new regiment number have escaped memory 'd rather be colonel father replied patrick musing colonel to come spalpeen said squireen fortune to make expect replied patrick have just hit have whole world before to pick choose well replied patrick after pause have objection objection why jump out of skin with delight at event might jump high enough to break in caling there be ceiling to break replied patrick looking up at rafter be true enough still might go out of seven sens in rational sort of way really ca see for why father dear tell be to leave poor old mother who doats upon sister who be fond of friend here patting dog who follow hill love woodcock shoot to go to be shot at buried like dead dog without being skinned on field of battle tell to go forth into world a officer make fortune to come back general be greatest man of family be too unhappy about not being skinned before be older wiser dead alive will be skinned will answer for well father will go expect there will be good deal of ground to march over before be general have good pair of leg so be told day of life will make best use of when start be starting like be real truth reader may be surprised at indifference shown by patrick at intelligence communicated by father fact be mr patrick o'donahue be very deep in love cooled national ardour must be confessed that there be excuse for more lovely creature than judith mccrae never existed to part with her be only difficulty family feeling be cloak to real cause of unwillingness nevertheless must start to morrow boy said father what must be must replied patrick so there be end of matter will just go out for bit of walk just to stretch leg require deal of stretching pat considering have be twenty mile at least morning over mountain replied squireen patrick be out of hearing have leapt over stone wall separated father potato ground from cornelius mccrae have hastened to judith whom found very busy getting dinner ready judith dear said patrick heart quite broke with bad news have to tell sure be going to leave to morrow morning now patrick be joking surely devil joke in be ensign in regiment then will die patrick more like will judith what with grief bullet to help perhaps now what d 'ye mean to do patrick mean to go sure because ca help myself to come back again if ever have luck of heart leaping out of mouth entirely be dead replied judith in tear be use cry mavourneen will be back to dance at own wedding if so be can there will be wedding for patrick wake for will lie on cold ground be ploughed in like muck be cold comfort from judith will hope for better ending must go back now will meet evening beyond shealing wo be for last time patrick replied judith with apron up to eye if have voice in matter say please pig will come back colonel then will be match for judith mccrae replied sobbing girl shoot easy judith be touching honour if be general will be same oh patrick patrick patrick folded judith in arm took one kiss then hastened out of house saying remember shealing judith dear there will talk matter over easy comfortable patrick returned to house where found mother sister in tear have received order to prepare wardrobe by bye did not give much trouble from extent only have to mend individual article father be sitting down by hearth when saw patrick said to now just come here boy take stool while listen to learn little worldly wisdom for may not have much time to talk to when be at dublin patrick took seat be attention will just observe pat that be very fine thing to be officer in king army nobody dare to treat ill although may ill treat others be small advantage in world there be truth in replied patrick see when get into enemy country may help if look sharp there be very pretty picking in quiet way understand that indeed observe pat that a one of officer king expects to appear live like gentleman only forgets to give mean of so doing must therefore take can get from majesty other people must make up difference be matter o ' course said patrick will soon see way clear find out what may be permitted to do what may not for king expects to keep up character of gentleman a well a appearance o ' course mayhap may be obliged to run in debt little gentleman may do mayhap may not be able to pay be gentleman case very often if so never go so far a twenty pound first because law reach secondly because twenty pound be quite enough to make man suffer for good of country there be sense in father patrick recollect that people judge by appearance in world especially when have nothing else to go by if talk small credit will be small if talk large will be just in proportion perceive father be not much property posse in said county of galway be certain must talk of property a if be squire not steward when talk of quantity of woodcock have bagged must say on property understand father must curse star at being younger brother will be excuse for having money will make believe be in family at event perceive replied patrick there be one thing more pat be irish regiment so must get out of a soon a possible by exchange for why for why will be among born too near home who may doubt say because story may interfere with own get into english regiment by mean there will be beyond reach of contradiction ai pleasant true enough father treasure up have told be worldly wisdom have fortune to make so now recollect never hold back at forlorn hope volunteer for everything volunteer to be blown from cannon mouth so that will give promotion for same volunteer to go over world into other world right through again into one come after if there be then one thing will be certain that will be colonel general else else what father that wo require to be made seeing that will be past making luck lucky be by bye have little of squire rent in hand to fit out with how must have managed saint only know a be must sink on next year account be more easy to do than to fit out with money must beg tenant off make potato crop fail entirely report twenty by name at least dead of starvation serve right for spending money out of old ireland be only out of real patriotism cheat just to spend money in country now patrick have done now may go square account with judith for know now where cat jump will leave old time alone for doing work such be advice of squireen to son a worldly wisdom be not so bad certainly when lad be cast adrift in world two best thing can bestow on be little worldly wisdom little money for without former latter will soon part company next day set off for dublin patrick head being in confused jumble of primitive good feeling judith mccrae father advice vision of future greatness be fitted out introduced to officer then father left blessing own way to make in world in fortnight regiment be complete be shipped to liverpool from liverpool to maidstone where being newly raised men be to remain for time to be disciplined before year have expired

hundred boy silent attentive at church for with deduction received pound year found own washing stayed two year during time contrived to save about pound with one fine morning set off on travel fully satisfied that come what must must not change for worse then be about in position be in now said joey laughing thereabouts only little older must imagine set off with good hope soon found that nobody wanted educated people be complete drug at last obtained situation a waiter at posting house on road where ran along day long to tinkling of bell with hot brandy water ever under nose answered bell head waiter took money however made acquaintance there at last obtained situation a clerk to corn chandler where kept book failed then be handed over to miller covered with flour for whole time be in

channel for six month a found that there be chance of being purser a hated confinement discipline of man of war cut run a soon a obtained pay then be shopman at draper be abominable for if customer must not buy good got blame besides have to clean master boot mistress shoe dine in kitchen on scrap with slipshod squinting girl who made love to then be warehouseman soon tacked on to office of light porter have to carry weight enough to break back at last obtained situation a foreman in tinman cutler shop by being constantly sent into workshop learnt something of trade have made up mind not to remain much longer paid attention receiving now then lesson from workman till found that must do very well for see be very simple sort of business after still travelling tinker be not so respectable a being in of situation be in before replied joey there must beg pardon good lad have often serious thought upon subject argued a follows what be best profession in world of ours that of gentleman for gentleman doe not work have liberty to go where plea be not controlled be own master many man considers gentleman who have not indispensables must complete profession clerk in treasury public office considers gentleman so be by birth not by profession for be not own master be a much tied down to desk a clerk in banker counting house in shop gentleman by profession must be own master independent how few there be in world who can say so soldier sailor be obliged to obey order therefore put down a perfect gentleman according to idea of what gentleman must be doubt whether prime minister can be considered gentleman until after be turned out of office do understand boy o yes understand what mean by gentleman recollect reading story of negro who came to country who said that pig be only gentleman in country for be only living being who did not work negro be not far wrong resumed tinker well after thinking long while came to decision that a must not be perfect gentleman must be nearest thing to be possible considered that most enviable situation be that of travelling tinker learned enough of trade saved money to purchase knife grinder wheel here have be in capacity for nearly ten year do hold to opinion that formed do for look work must therefore only question be to take up work be lightest paid best know trade where can gain so much with so little capital so little labour then be not controlled by living being have liberty independence go where please stop where please work when please idle when please never know what be to want night lodging show other profession can say same might be better clothed might be considered more respectable be philosopher despise earn a much a want do very little work for can grind knife scissors mend kettle enough in one day to provide for whole week for instance can grind knife in two minute for receive twopence now allowing that work twelve hour in day at rate of one penny per minute must earn pound per day deducting sunday be pound year put that against pound year a drudge to school confined to desk in shop other profession see how lucrative mine be in proportion then be under control not ordered here there like general admiral not attacked in house of common lord like prime minister on contrary half day work out of seven be require therefore assert that profession be nearer to of gentleman than other that know of may be a style look much like one replied joey laughing be prejudice clothes keep a warm a if be of best material quite new enjoy victual quite a much a well dressed gentleman doe perhaps more can indulge in own thought have leisure to read favourite author can afford to purchase new book besides a must work little be pleasant to feel that be always in request respected by who employ respected on what account because be always wanted therefore always welcome be little thing of life annoy not great kettle wo hold water knife wo cut be always object of execration a people heap anathema upon kettle knife so do long for return when come be glad to see glad to pay glad to find knife be sharp kettle thrown on one side be useful again at trifling charge add to people comfort become necessary to poor person in cottage therefore like respect indeed if be only considered how many oath execration be used when person be hacking sawing away with knife will not cut how by wheel do away with cause of crime think that travelling tinker may be considered a to moral influence upon society more important than parson in pulpit observe have not rendered profession degrading by marriage a many do how do mean hold that may be mean of gentleman must be considered to lose most precious advantage appertaining to profession when marries for loses liberty can no longer be said to be under control be very well for other profession to marry a world must be peopled gentleman never must be true may contrive to leave clog at home then pay dear for useless galling appendage in situation a travelling tinker must not have done so must have dragged clog after through mud mire have have very different reception than what have at present why so why man may stroll about country by find lodging entertainment for not so if have wife in rag two three dirty child at heel single man in stage of society if pay own way more easily find admission than married one be because woman regulate although will receive a tinker invariably object to wife who be considered stigmatised a tinker trull no must not do wife must detract from respectability add very much to care have home then anywhere why yes have like single men on pave a french say just sort of chamber to keep property in will accumulate in spite of where be in dudstone to place be now going have room for

to be sure do be own master go where like stop where like pay tax rate still retain gentleman except dress can resume when please besides mine be philanthropic profession go about doing good have mean

true british tar under command immediately bore down to attack movement of enemy fully proved that be astounded at boldness of manoeuvre instead of keeping line soon separated sheered off in different direction so a to receive support of battery see joey have said three masted vessel implies ship although a in case be only small coasting lugger in hour be sufficiently close to main body to open fire broadside after broadside be poured in answered by battery on coast with unerring aim notwithstanding unequal contest have pleasure of informing that in le than hour succeeded in capturing three of vessel named a per margin finding nothing more must be done for honour of majesty arm a soon must take possession considered duty to haul off from incessant galling fire of battery in well fought successful contest trust that british flag have not be tarnished what enemy loss may have be be impossible to say acknowledge however that have be severe ' did enemy lose men demanded joey not one

exist be not fault replied melissa with eye cast down be not still miss mathews when be considered that man have abjured may say have almost despised woman be small triumph to homage from that have made feel power of sex be just punishment for having despised perhaps so yet if be punished for misdeed a shakespeare say who must escape whipping pray master tinker where did learn to quote shakespeare where learnt much more be not always travelling tinker so presumed before pray how came to be one miss mathews if truth must be told arose from unfortunate attachment have read in olden

not what to say master tinker consider measure fraught with danger to gentleman to myself have quoted shakespeare allow now to do same friendship be constant in other thing save in affair office of love therefore heart use own tongue observe master tinker that there be danger of pleading for not for client there be also danger of being insensibly moved to listen to address of tinker now only reflect upon awful consequence continued melissa smiling pledge honour miss mathews will only plead for person whose name have read in book that will never be humiliated by importunity of mender of

of course since have received letter from stating that grandmother be dead that mother be going to quit gravesend for portsmouth to reside with brother who be now widower will go to portsmouth replied hero be thinking that a brother be navy agent mr phillips be interested about must not do better if anything turn up then will have good advice money be not so likely to be thrown away think therefore have better go to portsmouth try fortune be very glad have mentioned mary for till now one place be a indifferent to a now be otherwise to portsmouth will certainly go hero remained two three day longer at village during time mary be with evening once obtained leave to go to banker about money then turned over to joey account sum due to arrangement be made with bank so joey must draw capital out whenever pleased after hero took leave of mary promising to correspond more freely than before once more putting strap of knife grinder wheel over shoulder set off on journey to portsmouth joey have not gained two mile from village when asked question what will do with grindstone did not like to leave on road did not know to whom must give away rolled on for about six mile farther then quite tired resolved to follow plan formerly adopted by spikeman repose little upon turf on road side sun be very warm after time joey retreated to other side of hedge be shaded having taken bundle from side of wheel where hung first made dinner of provender have brought with then laying head on bundle be soon in sound sleep from be awakened by hearing voice on other side of hedge turned round perceived two men on side of road close to knife grinder wheel be in shirt trouser only sitting down on turf must be very good plan observed one of must then travel without suspicion yes if must get off with without being discovered where can owner of be well dare say be away upon business have left wheel here till come back now suppose be to take how must manage why can not go along road with must get over gate hedge till get across country into road then by travelling night might be quite clear yes then must do well for even if description a deserter be sent out from portsmouth must be considered a travelling tinker there must be suspicion well be ready for if can only get off road conceal till night may then easily manage first let see if fellow belongs to may not be somewhere about here a man said rose up turned face towards hedge hero immediately perceived that be old acquaintance furness schoolmaster marine what to do hardly knew at last perceived furness advancing towards gate of field be close to where be lying a escape be impossible hero covered face with arm pretended to be fast asleep soon heard hush given a signal to other man after while footstep close to joey pretended to snore loudly whispering then took place at last heard furness say do watch by while wheel away grindstone if wake what will do brain with big stone if doe not wake up when be past second field follow that hero have inclination to wake after notice may be easily imagined heard gate opened wheel trundled away much to delight a furness be party who have in charge joey continued to snore hard until at last heard departing footstep of furness comrade who have watched thought prudent to continue motionless for time longer to give time to be well away from then gradually turned round looked in direction in have gone must see nothing of be not until have risen up climbed up on gate that perceived two three field off running away at rapid pace thanking heaven that have escaped danger that be in delighted with loss of property hero recommenced journey with bundle over shoulder before night be safe outside one of stage took to town from there be must carry to portsmouth at sea port arrived next evening without further adventure a hero sat on outside of coach reflected upon last adventure more felt have reason to congratulate that furness have deserted from marine barrack at portsmouth be evident if have not that must have recognised joey time other be almost certain now felt sure that be safe at portsmouth a must be last place at furness must make appearance also felt that knife grinder wheel in supplying furness with ostensible mean of livelihood thereby preventing being taken up a deserter have proved best friend to must not have be disposed of better piece of good fortune be having secured bundle money for have left with wheel must have of course shared fate besides thought joey if must chance to fall in with furness again attempt to approach can threaten to have taken a deserter may deter from so doing be with grateful heart that hero laid head upon pillow in humble inn at have taken up quarter chapter thirty seven in hero return to former employment on grander scale of operation hero have received from mary name address of mr phillips brother on inquiry found that be known by everybody joey dressed in best suit presented at door about

have made engagement for hero to present at nine o'clock on following morning after communication hero took leave amused during remainder of day in walking over town at time presented most bustling appearance a expedition be fitting out street be crowded with officer of army navy marine in uniform soldier sailor more le tipsy flaunting ribbon gaudy colour variety of noise be to be heard must be well imagined from quacking of duck with head out of basket in be confined to be taken on board to martial music rolling of drum occasional salute of artillery to let world know that great man have put foot on board of ship have again deigned to tread upon terra firma be bustle excitement hurrying jostling cursing swearing joey found by manner in be shoved about right left to be in way of everybody at time appointed hero made appearance at door having given name be asked into counting house of establishment where sat mr small factotum mr sleek may be a well here to describe person peculiarity of two gentleman mr small certainly did not accord with name for be man full six foot high stout in proportion be in face extremely plain with turned up nose at same time there be lurking good humour in countenance twinkle in eye immediately prepossessed in few minute forgot that be not well favoured mr small be very fond of argument joke have forcible way of maintaining argument when happened to be near that a emma have told hero few people after time ventured to contradict mode of argument be nothing more than digging hard knuckle of large hand into rib of opponent must rather say gradually gimleting a be hole in side a heated in illustration be last person in world in disposition to inflict pain even upon insect yet from habit one perhaps gave more appeared to do so with more malice a countenance be radiant with good humour at very time when knuckle be taking away breath what made worse be that have knack of seizing coat lappet with other hand so escape be difficult when have exhausted reasoning must follow up with pressure of knuckle under fifth rib saying now feel force of argument everybody did one must oppose unless table be between be much same with joke must utter then with loud laugh insidious insertion of knuckle say do take eh mr sleek have also peculiarity be not agreeable person to argue with for have learnt to argue from many year constant companionship with head of firm mr sleek be spare man deeply pock marked in face with very large mouth when speaking sputtered to such degree that quarter of hour conversation with be a good a shower bath at long range mr sleek must heat superior out of field if mr small approached once to close quarter mr sleek gave in immediately captain of navy used to assert that fibbing enforcement of truth on part of small be quite contrary to rule of modern warfare never must stand unless required advance of money then by submitting to certain quantity of dig in rib in proportion to unreasonableness of demand usually obtained object a said knuckled down in end a for mr sleek although best man in world be abhorrence be nothing watering pot be not plant required aid to add to vigour mr sleek even in largest company invariably found alone must never imagine why still be important personage when stock be to be got on board in hurry officer in majesty service care about little spray mr small be a have observed navy agent be to say be general provider of officer captain of majesty service obtained agency on capture might send in cashed bill advanced money supplied with wine variety of stock might be required in consequence be reported to be accumulating fortune a be usually case kept open house for captain who be client occasionally invited junior officer to hospitality of table so that mr phillips emma be of great use to have quite sufficient to do in superintending such establishment having thus made reader better acquainted with new character will proceed well young man have heard about from sister so wish to leave off vagabondising do yes sir replied joey how old be can keep book be seventeen have kept book replied hero in innocence for considered mr chopper day book to come under denomination have money how much joey replied that have so much of own that sister have so much more seven hundred pound eh youngster began business with pound le here be money breed money do understand here joey received knuckle in rib almost took breath away bore without flinching a presumed be mark of good will what can do with lad sleek said mr small what can do with money let stay in counting house here for week replied mr sleek will see what can do a for money will be a safe here a in country bank until know how to employ can allow five per cent for be said in shower of spray induced joey to wipe face with pocket handkerchief yes think will do for present rejoined mr small observe sleek that young lad have very powerful interest will be expected to do something for will have worst of understand continued giving joey knuckle again lady standing against joey thought there be standing such dig in rib said nothing leave to sleek must be off to call upon captain james see to lad food lodging there be order from gun room of hecate so saying mr small departed mr sleek asked hero where be stopping recommended lodging close to house with direction how to proceed what arrangement to make told to haste a much a must then come back to counting house in couple of hour hero be back again look on list do understand said mr sleek to joey be sea stock for hecate sail in day two if send porter with to people deal with must be able to get thing be marked with cross wine others have here joey looked over be quite at home be only bumboating on large scale o yes know price of thing replied have be used to supplying of ship at gravesend why then said mr sleek be very person want for have time to attend to out door work now porter be sent for hero soon executed task not only with precision with rapidity be highly satisfactory to mr sleek a soon a article be collected joey asked whether must take on board understand work mr sleek not even egg will be broke promise second part of commission be executed with same precision by hero who returned with receipt of article having be delivered safe in good condition mr sleek be delighted with hero told mr small so when met in evening mr sleek opinion be given in presence of mr phillips emma who exchanged glance of satisfaction at joey fortunate debut chapter thirty eight in wheel of fortune turn spoke two in favour of hero if be to analyse feeling of hero towards emma phillips must hardly be warranted in saying that be in love with although at seventeen year young men be very apt to be so to fancy difference in position be so great that although hero must in dream often fancy on most intimate term with kind little patroness in waking thought be more object of adoration respect being to whom be most ardently devotedly attached one whose friendship kindness have so wrought upon best feeling that must have thought sacrifice to die for idea of ever being closer allied to than now be have not yet entered into imagination ever thought be that if ever united to female for life party selected must be like emma phillips if not must remain single endeavour be to prove worthy of patronage to be rewarded by smile of encouragement when met be lodestar guided on to path of duty stimulated by wish to find favour in sight joey never relaxed in exertion naturally active methodical be indefatigable gave greatest satisfaction to mr sleek who found more than labour taken off hand further that if joey once said thing must be done be not only well done done to very time be stipulated for completion joey cared not for meal anything of kind often went without dinner sleek said small one day poor boy will be starved be not fault sir wo go to dinner if there be anything to do a there be always something to do be a clear a day that can get dinner wish be living in house altogether came to meal with after work be done must be very advantageous much time saved time be money sleek time saved be money saved therefore be worthy of food will be so do see to thus in about two month after arrival joey found installed in nice little bedroom living at table of patron not only constantly in company with naval officer what be of more value to in company of mr phillips emma must pas over more than year during time hero have become person of importance be great favourite with naval captain a punctuality rapidity corresponded with idea of doing business be constantly said to mr sleek to mr small let o'donahue settle matter will go right mr small have already established at salary of pound per annum besides living in house hero be comfortable happy be well known to officer from being constantly on board of ship be great favourite joey soon discovered that emma have fancy for natural curiosity a boarded almost man of war came into port soon filled room with variety of shell of bird procured be present must make must accept not week passed without hero adding something to museum of live dead object indeed emma be now grown up be paid such attention to by officer who frequented uncle house not only on account of beauty on account of expectation that uncle who be without child must give handsome fortune that emotion of jealousy of be hardly conscious must occasionally give severe pain to hero perhaps a fortune rose so did hope certain be that sometimes be very grave emma be too clear sighted not to perceive cause hastened by little attention to remove feeling not that have definite idea upon subject more than joey must not bear to see look unhappy such be state of thing when one day mr small said to joey a be busy copying order into book o'donahue have be laying out of money for indeed sir be very much obliged to yes there be large stock of claret sold at auction to day be good went cheap have purchased to amount of pound on account may bottle bin here sell a can if like bargain will take off hand be very grateful to sir replied joey who knew kindness of act in two month more than doubled capital a be permitted to continue business on own account be very soon in position amounting to independence french wine business being ever afterwards considered a exclusively belonging to hero one morning a joey happened to be in counting house by be rather unusual occurrence midshipman came in joey remembered very well a have be often there before good morning mr o'donahue said midshipman be mr small within be not can do anything for yes if can tell how be to persuade mr small to advance little money upon pay can do something for never heard of such application before replied joey smiling that venture did not requires impudence of midshipman to make such one fact be mr o'donahue be mate with pound year upon have continued to assist poor old mother up to present now requires pound in consequence of illness have not farthing will repay if live be certain have little hope of obtaining nothing affection for old lady must induce to risk mortification of refusal be true enough that who go borrowing go sorrowing ' fear be will so far assist a to let know what only chance be state case to mr small a have to to day then stand close to while answer if put knuckle into rib to enforce argument shrink then wait result without interrupting well 'd do more than for old lady replied poor midshipman a mr small made appearance midshipman told story in very few word mr small heard without interruption when have finished mr small commenced see man ask to do what navy agent ever did before to lend upon promise to pay promise to pay from midshipman in first place have only promise without security be one point do observe punch with knuckle then promise to pay depends whether be in country not again if have money may not have inclination to pay be point then came sharp impression into rib of middy then again be not even personal security a may be drowned shot blown up taken out of world before pay be due to by death must be unable to pay if so inclined there be third point there be third dig middy stood boldly up against insure life can not for have money therefore require to lend money upon security whatever for even allowing that must pay if must yet death might prevent there be point knuckle again penetrated into midshipman side who felt torture increasing a hope be departing continued mr small who be evidently much pleased with own ratiocination there be point not yet touched upon be that a good christian must sometimes lend money upon security even give away for so be commanded therefore mr o'donahue will tell mr sleek to let have money there be last best point of eh wound up mr small with thumping blow upon rib of middy almost took away breath give a specimen of mr small style of practical theoretical logic combined admiral sir be coming down street said sleek entering think be coming here mr small who did not venture to chop logic with admiral be excessively polite to such great people went out to receive admiral hat in hand now mr small said admiral counting house for business if please have very unexpected order to leave portsmouth must save next tide if possible ship will be ready for know what navy can do when required a know have not one atom of stock on board flood tide have made almost hour must sail at first of ebb a twelve hour delay may be most serious now tell here be list of what be required boat will be ready men in plenty to get on board can get ready by time by time sir william replied small looking over tremendous catalogue be now eleven o'clock can be down by four o'clock be latest can give impossible sir william be of greatest importance that sail at five o'clock fact be must will be hard must starve for whole cruise indeed sir william said mr small if be possible two cow so many sheep hay everything to be got from country never must manage to morrow morning perhaps well mr small have appointed prize agent yet have obliged hero now stepped forward ran over list can inform sir said to flag captain whether zenobia orestes sail with squadron be reply beg pardon mr small said joey do think can accomplish with little arrangement indeed cried sir william yes sir william if must immediately make signal for two boat to come on shore with steady crew to assist promise will be done well said cried captain be right now admiral if say will be done will be done may depend upon mr o'donahue yes sir william everything will be a wish well mr small if young man keep word will be prize agent good morning to how must promise cried small addressing hero when admiral suite have left counting house because can perform sir replied joey have cow sheep for zenobia orestes a well a fodder ready in town can get others for to morrow know where to lay hand on everything else well that be lucky there be time to be lost hero with usual promptitude activity kept promise a mr small said be lucky for prize agency in few month afterwards proved worth to nearly pound be not to be supposed that joey neglected correspondence with mary spikeman although with latter be not so frequent mary wrote to month have not many subject to enter upon chiefly replying to joey communication congratulating upon success indeed now that hero have be nearly four year with mr small might be said to be very rising independent person capital have increased very considerably have be thrown into business be now junior partner instead of clerk have long enjoyed full confidence of superior of mr sleek who now entrusted with almost everything in short joey be in fair way to

of emma phillips hero now that four year have passed during time have be continually in company gradually a rose in importance removing distance be between have only to reply that consequence natural to case did ensue year intimacy increased year added to hope of hero who now no longer looked upon alliance with emma a impossible yet still never felt sufficient confidence in fortune to intimate thought to indeed from long habit of veneration respect be in position of subject before queen who feel partiality towards dared not give vent to thought remained for to have unfeminine task of intimating to that might venture although to outward appearance there be nothing respect feeling of gratitude on part condescension amiability on hers there be rapid adhesion going on within interview be more restrained word more selected for party felt how strong be feeling must repress be pensive silent distant must talk unconnectedly running from one subject to attempting to be lively unconcerned when be most inclined to be otherwise not daring to scrutinise too minutely own feeling when found alone what must fain conceal from very attempt to conceal made known to other people who be standing by mr phillips mr small perceived how matter stood have objection must have immediately no longer permitted to be in contact have objection for hero have long won heart of mother uncle awaited quietly time must arrive when young party must no longer conceal feeling for other be when affair be between hero emma phillips a have just stated that circumstance took place for time embittered hero happiness be walking down high street when perceived file of marine marching towards with two men between handcuffed evidently deserter who have be taken up feeling of alarm pervaded hero have presentiment induced to go into perfumer shop to remain there so a to have view of face of deserter a passed along without being able to see foreboding be correct one of be old enemy persecutor furness schoolmaster have dagger be plunged into joey bosom sensation must not have be more painful than what felt when once more found so near to dreaded denouncer for short time remained so transfixed that woman who be attending in shop asked whether must bring glass of water inquiry made recollect complaining of sudden pain in side sat down took water when be brought went home in despair quite forgetting business brought out retired to own room that might collect thought what be to do man have be brought back to barrack must be tried punished afterwards be set at liberty how be possible that must always avoid escape being recognised how little chance have of escape from furness searching eye must bribe yes must now be rich enough if did one bribe must only be followed up by demand for threat of denouncement if refused flight appeared only chance to leave present position to leave emma be impossible hero did not leave room for remainder of day retired early to bed that might cogitate for sleep must not after night of misery effect of be too visibly marked in countenance on ensuing morning joey determined to make inquiry relative to what fate of furness might be having made up mind accosted sergeant of marine with whom have slight acquaintance whom fell in with in street observed to that perceived have deserter brought in yesterday inquired from what ship have deserted from barrack sergeant replied that have deserted from niobe frigate have committed theft previous to desertion that must remain in confinement at barrack till niobe arrived that then must be tried by court martial without doubt for double offence must go through fleet joey wished sergeant good morning passed on in way home altered appearance have attracted notice of not only partner of mr phillips have caused much distress to latter hero remained whole day in counting house apparently unconcerned in reality thinking rethinking over over again former thought at last made up mind that must wait issue of court martial before took decided step indeed what to do knew not leave reader to guess state of mind in joey remained for fortnight previous to return of niobe frigate from channel cruise two day after arrival signal be made for court martial sentence be well known before night be that culprit be to go through fleet on ensuing day be however consolation to hero did not feel animosity against furness so much a did dread of did not want punishment absence security against future annoyance be about nine o'clock on next morning when punishment be to take place joey came down from own room have be thinking night have decided that have other resource to quit portsmouth emma fair prospect for ever have resolved so to do to make sacrifice be bitter conclusion to arrive at have be come to haggard countenance when made appearance at breakfast table shocked mr phillips emma made remark breakfast be passed over in silence soon afterwards hero found alone with emma who immediately went to with tear in eye said what be matter with look so ill alarm make quite miserable be afraid miss phillips miss phillips replied emma beg pardon emma be afraid that must leave leave yes leave portsmouth for ever perhaps why what have occurred can not dare not tell will so far oblige to say nothing at present recollect be obliged to leave gravesend on sudden recollect did why know not only mary said that be not fault trust be not so be misfortune emma be almost distracted have not slept for week pray believe when say have done wrong indeed be interrupted said emma hurriedly there be somebody coming upstairs have hardly time to remove few foot from hero when captain b of niobe entered room good morning miss phillips hope be well just looked in for moment before go to admiral office have have catastrophe on board niobe must report immediately indeed replied emma nothing very serious hope why only rid of blackguard not worth hanging one of marine who be to have gone round fleet morning when went to forepart of ship under sentry charge leaped overboard drowned what be name captain b inquired joey seizing by arm name why how can that interest o'donahue well if wish to know be furness be very sorry for replied hero knew once when be in better circumstance be joey longer daring to trust with others quitted room went to own apartment a soon a be there knelt down returned thanks not for death of furness for removal of load have so oppressed mind in hour relief be so great that felt sufficiently composed to go downstairs went into drawing room to find emma be not there longed to have explanation with be not until next day that have opportunity hardly know what to say to said hero how to explain conduct of yesterday certainly appeared very strange especially to captain b who told that thought be mad care little what think care much what think emma must now tell what perhaps man death may permit to do that have be most strangely connected with life be most true be who knew who must if must have put in situation in must either have suffered to be thought guilty of crime be incapable of let suffice to say have done to exculpate what trust never must have done ever will do can say no more than without betraying secret be bound to keep keeping of may still prove own destruction when first saw on wayside emma be man who forced from happy home to wander about world be reappearance of man recognition of that induced to quit gravesend so suddenly again met avoided when be deserting trusted that a have deserted must be certain of living safely in town without meeting with be reappearance here a deserter taken up put in state of agony have seen in for last three week be knowledge that after punishment must be again free likely to meet with when walking about here resolved to quit portsmouth a said to yesterday morning can therefore be surprised at emotion when heard that be removed that there be now necessity for quitting kind patron certainly after explanation can not be surprised at emotion what doe surprise mr o'donahue be that must have secret of such importance that can not be revealed have made tremble at recognition of man when at same time declare innocence did innocence mystery ever walk hand in hand addressing a mr o'donahue miss phillips have pointed out to impropriety have be guilty of in making use of christian name thought that confidence placed in when a mere boy told exactly what now repeat that secret be not own must not have be now so cruelly withdrawn have never varied in tale can honestly say have never felt degraded when have admitted have mystery connected with nay if must please heaven have option given to suffer in own person reveal secret in question trust will submit to fate with constancy be supported in misfortune by conviction of innocence feel be not wrong in communication made to yesterday morning must leave place came here because be living here to whom felt so devoted for kindness sympathy when be poor friendless now that be otherwise be pleased to withdraw not only good will confidence in a spell be broken have drawn to spot repeat that a soon a can with justice to patron will withdraw from presence hero voice faltered before have finished speaking then turning away slowly without looking up quitted room chapter forty in hero try change of air reader will observe that there have be little altercation at end of last chapter emma phillips be guilty of letting drop received truism rather metaphor offended hero did innocence mystery ever walk hand in hand if emma have put that question to from knowledge of world must have replied yes very often dear miss phillips emma be wrong not only in metaphor in time of making why did do so ah be puzzling question to answer can only say at imminent risk when narrative will be perused by other sex that have made discovery that woman be not perfect that very best of sex be full of contradiction that emma be woman woman very often be more endowed than generality of men be ready to admit cause have be taken up by lady morgan mr jamieson many others who can write much better than can when say cause mean right of equality must claim with sex not subjection to reading lady morgan other day next to conversing with be one of greatest treat know of began to speculate upon be cause have subjected woman to man in other word how be that man have got upper hand kept that woman mind be not inferior to men be forced to admit that aptitude for cultivation be often greater be not to be denied a to assertion that man make law that frame be of more robust material be argument a revolt on part of other sex must soon do away with such advantage men brought up a nursery maid must soon succumb to woman who be accustomed to athletic sport from youth upwards after great deal of cogitation came to conclusion that there be great difference between action in mind of men woman machinery of latter being more complex than of own sex man mind be despot work by one single action have one ruling principle one propelling power to be subservient power passion disguised dormant a may be in feeble mind be only one propels on primum mobile a may be termed be ambition in other word self love everything be sacrificed to now a in proportion a machine be simple so be strong in action so in proportion that machine be complex becomes weak if analyse woman mind will find that inferiority arises from simple fact that there be so many wheel within wheel working in so many compensating balance if may use term use to honour that although usually more right minded than man strength of action be lost have become feeble by time that decision have be made what will man allow to stand in way of ambition love friendship no will sacrifice best quality be more difficult make worst be in disposition subservient to move only one great principle one propelling power action being single be strong in proportion will woman mind decide in way will sacrifice to ambition love friendship natural tie in mind claim of be generally speaking fairly balanced quotient after calculation have be worked out although correct be small argument after only go to prove woman abstractedly taken have more principle more conscience better regulated mind than men be true if if must always go correct a timekeeper more complex machine more difficult be to keep in order more likely be to be out of repair movement to be disarranged by trifling shock must have effect upon one of such simple powerful construction a in own sex not only do often go wrong sometimes serious shock be liable to in world will put in state be past repair have doubt that by time reader will say never mind woman mind mind own business left emma in drawing room rather astonished at hero long speech still more by for first time during acquaintance venturing to breathe contrary opinion to own sweet self emma phillips although pouted little colour have mounted to temple nevertheless looked very lovely a pensively reclined on sofa rebuked by who have always be so attentive so submissive creature a be be mortified a pretty woman be at loss of power symptom of rebellion on part of liege vassal then taxed have done wrong have said innocence mystery did not walk hand in hand be not that true felt that be true own opinion be corroborated by others for have read in book in burke rochefoucault great author miss phillips bit tip of nail thought again yes saw how be hero have risen in world be independent be well received in society be no longer little joey of gravesend be now person of consequence be very ungrateful fellow world be full of ingratitude still did think better of hero certainly did well at event must prove to that what did not exactly know thus ended cogitation second after came series what have hero said what have accused of no longer bestowed on confidence placed in for many year be true be not relative position be not case different must now retain secret from there must be secret between there again there be full stop before sentence be complete after little more reflection own generous mind pointed out to that have be in wrong that hero have cause to be offended with made up mind to make reparation first time that must be alone having come to resolution dismissed previous question began to think about secret what possibly must be how wished knew what be of be very natural in meantime hero have made up mind to leave portsmouth for time at event quarrel with emma if such might be considered have made very miserable anxiety have lately suffered have seriously affected health believe that there never be anybody in world who have grown to man woman estate have mixed with world who must afterwards say that be at time perfectly happy who having said so did not find that reverse be case moment two after word be out of mouth there be always something a good lady said to so there always be always will be removal of furness be naturally great relief to mind of hero then felt a if difficulty be surmounted that have no longer fear of consequence might ensue from father crime must now thought be able to walk boldly through world without recognition have built castle enough to form metropolis when rupture with emma broke magic mirror through have scanned futurity when most buoyant with hope found truth of good lady saying there be always something after remaining in room for hour joey went down to counting house where found mr small mr sleek at work for labour have increased since joey have so much neglected business well good friend how do find said mr small very far from well sir feel can not attend to business replied joey be quite ashamed of myself be thinking that if have objection to allow couple of month leave of absence change of air must be very serviceable to have something to do at dudstone have put off ever since came to portsmouth think

intention of starting next morning by early coach then left counting house to make preparation for journey joey joined party be numerous at dinner be not until be in drawing room after dinner that mr small have opportunity of communicating to mr phillips be hero intention mr phillips considered very advisable measure a joey have evidently suffered very much lately probably over exertion might have be cause relaxation must effect cure emma who be sitting by mother turned pale have not imagined that hero must have followed up expressed intention of morning asked mr small if knew when o'donahue must leave portsmouth reply be that have taken place on early coach of next morning emma fell back on sofa did not say anything more when company have left mr phillips rose lighted chamber candlestick to go to bed emma followed motion of mother mr phillips shook hand with hero wishing great deal of pleasure that must return quite restored in health emma who found that chance of interview with hero be gone mustered up courage enough to extend hand say hope absence will be productive of health happiness to mr o'donahue then followed mother joey who be in humour for conversation then bade farewell to mr small mr sleek before emma have risen from not very refreshing night rest be two stage on way from portsmouth chapter forty one in hero have head turned wrong way although may be very proper when offence have be offered to show that feel injury often happens that act too much upon impulse carry measure to extremity hero felt a coach wheeled along second increasing distance from emma phillips twenty time be inclined to take postchaise return inconsistency must have be so glaring that shame prevented so went on until reached metropolis on arriving there having nothing better to do

great respect for jewish nation consider true christian must have will not enter upon point now be probably showing such feeling being well versed in history be occasion of intercourse of two day ripening into regard for one parted with sincere wish that might meet again in country at time speak of be about three year ago daughter miriam be comparatively speaking child certainly not at period indeed for time after meeting again in england did ever come into idea must ever feel anything for good will circumstance father confidence in threw much together have mother after time found growing

before nation that whole family became vile be denied usual burial rite perhaps be aware that if jew embrace christianity same disgrace be heaped upon relation with knowledge determined to conquer feeling for miriam of course no longer went to father house must have be cruel to put friend for such certainly be in such position more so a being rabbi must have to denounce own child absence be however cause of great annoyance to father sought be so pressed by to return have choice unless confessed reason did not like to do therefore visited house a before although not so frequently continually found in company with miriam father being constantly summoned away to duty of office too often alone therefore resolved must once more set off on travel a only mean by must act honourably get rid of feeling be obtaining such mastery over went to house to state intention at same time bid farewell when ascending stair slipped sprained ankle so severely must not put foot to ground decided fate be not only domiciled for week in house a lay on sofa be continually attended by miriam father must not hear of removal declared that accident be judgment against for rash intention that miriam showed regard for in way that modest maiden must do be certain did however make one last struggle did not deny feeling towards pointed out to consequence must ensue be duty a friend duty a daughter to

subject of christianity demanded reason authority for belief in short induced to enter warmly into subject to prove to best of ability that true messiah have already come conversation took pleasure in renewing during stay in house a considered that subject be one diverted attention from one wished to avoid be not sorry to enter upon although have not least idea of converting to faith such be state of affair when quitted house again seriously thought of removing from so much temptation when brother joseph arrived from madrid where have be staying with uncle for year return be occasion of jubilee

conceived very strong friendship for certainly be equally pleased with for be full of talent although be revengeful proud of lineage holding to tenet of faith with obstinacy of pharisee indeed be strange that must ever become so partial to christian respecting a doe rabbinical doctrine held forth to jewish people must be admitted have be inculcated in consequence of unwearied unjustifiable persecution of tribe for century by who call christian whose practice have be at open variance with precept of founder of faith however so be joseph conceived great regard for be continually at house compelled too often to visit at father at last made up mind must leave country for time be actively preparing intending to go without saying word to when found one morning alone with miriam walked up to a be sitting on couch motioned to to sit by stood before with stately air fixing upon dark gazelle like eye do ' said in slow solemn tone of voice do remember conversation have upon respective creed do recollect how pointed out to authority reason for faith sincere belief that messiah have already come ' do miriam replied not with view to interfere with non belief be only to uphold by argument own say nay to believe ' said miriam nevertheless have that in vest if be known to father brother must cause to dash to earth to curse in name of great jehovah pulled out of vest small copy of new testament be book of creed have searched compared with own have found authority have read word of jew who have narrated history deed of jesus of nazareth be christian may appear strange assure sir can not imagine pain felt when miriam thus acknowledged convert to faith to say to be sorry for must have argued little for christian belief when reflected upon pain disgrace must bring upon family must be cause be dreadfully shocked must only reply miriam wish that have never met ' know what feeling be too well ' replied have met what be done can not be undone too when think of relation be torn with anxiety distress what be now duty if be declare not only by great jehovah by crucified messiah be sincere believer in creed must shrink must conceal on account of father brother doe not say leave follow must not add feeble voice in acknowledgement of truth if be to consider christian must not avowal be public yes must be will be can blame ' oh dare not blame ' replied only regret that religious difference must so mar little happiness permitted to in world that jew christian will admit what saviour have distinctly declared that there be difference between jew greek gentile see much misery in can not help regretting deeply that will be considered a cause of be upbraided with ingratitude ' did duty ' replied miriam have be converted by having so done now have duty to do be aware of pain will occasion father relation whole of tribe if suffer will not suffer more thrust out from father door loaded with curse execration not one jew permitted to offer asylum not even to give morsel of bread drop of water wanderer outcast such must be fate ' not so miriam if tribe desert ' stop one moment ' interrupted miriam do recollect conversation have with before entered into subject of relative creed do remember what then said be true be merely a excuse ' be a true miriam a stand here have loved long devotedly have tried to conquer passion on account of misery marriage with christian must have occasioned relation if persist in avowing new faith misery will be equally incurred therefore be doubly bound not only by love because have by converting put in dreadful position to offer not only asylum if will accept heart hand ' miriam folded arm across breast knelt down with eye fixed upon floor can only answer in word of ruth ' replied in low voice with trembling

knowledge god know that have suffered enough what be saying be talking nonsense oh madam know whole can not be blinded either by joey beg pardon madam although joey must not reply told that father did deed answer madam be silent a son have be believe when say that suspicion must not be wrenched from even by torture do trust mary perhaps knowledge that have obtained be advantageous when doe trial

condemned god have mercy on mary have better return to exeter write to day stay by comfort may god of comfort listen to prayer of unhappy distracted mother leave now god bless dear girl have indeed proved comfort leave now chapter forty seven in hero prof game to very last mary returned to exeter trial of hero be expected to come on on following day preferred being with joey to witnessing agony distress of mr austin to whom must offer comfort indeed own state of suspense be so wearing that almost felt relief when day of trial came on mr trevor have once more attempted to reason with joey hero continued firm in resolution mr trevor when made appearance in court wore upon countenance mark of sorrow discontent did not nevertheless fail in duty joey be brought to bar appearance be so different from be to be expected in one charged with crime of murder that strong interest be immediately excited spectator anticipated low bred ruffian beheld fair handsome young man with open brow intelligent countenance whose eye quailed not when met own whose demeanour be bold without being offensive true that there be trace of sorrow on countenance that cheek be pale one who have knowledge of human nature feeling of charity in disposition must say that there be least appearance of guilt jury be empannelled count of indictment read over trial commenced a indictment be preferred judge caught date of supposed offence what be date said judge year mean upon reply of clerk lordship observed eight year ago then looking at prisoner added why must have be child a be too often case replied prosecuting counsel child in year not in guilt a will soon bring evidence to substantiate a evidence brought forward be same a have already mentioned a given on inquest over body will pas over that of furness a be not to be found be read to court a trial proceeded a fact came forth more condemning people began to look with le compassion on prisoner shook head compressed lip a soon a evidence for crown be closed mr trevor rose in hero defence commenced by ridiculing idea of trying mere child upon so grave charge for child prisoner must have be at time offence be committed look at now gentleman of jury eight year ago murder of pedlar byre took place why may judge for yourselves whether be now more than seventeen year of age must scarcely have held gun at time referred to prisoner age doe not appear in indictment observed judge may ask age lord demanded one of jury prisoner may answer question if plea replied judge not otherwise perhaps may not yet be seventeen year of age do wish to state age to jury prisoner have objection lord replied joey not regarding shake of head of counsel be twenty two last month mr trevor bit lip at unfortunate regard for truth in hero after time proceeded observing that very candour of prisoner in not taking advantage of youthful appearance to deceive jury ought to be strong argument in favour mr trevor then continued to address jury upon vagueness of evidence a proceeded observed now gentleman of jury if case have be offered to to give opinion upon must without previous knowledge of prisoner have just come to following conclusion must have said intelligence good sense will have doubt bear out in supposition that allowing that pedlar byre did receive death by prisoner hand say gentleman allowing such to have be case for deny that be borne out by evidence that must have be at sudden meeting with pedlar when lad conscience told that what be doing be wrong that gun of prisoner be discharged unintentionally consequence be fatal must then surmise further that prisoner frightened at deed have unintentionally committed have absconded upon first impulse that gentleman believe to be real state of case be more natural than that child under such circumstance must have be frightened have attempted to evade inquiry must have eventually ensued state such to be opinion mr trevor do wish to infer that prisoner pleads such a defence asked judge lord replied mr trevor in hesitating way prisoner have pleaded not guilty to crime imputed to that be aware of wish to know whether mean to say that prisoner defence be not having anything to do with death of pedlar upon plea of gun going off by accident lord be duty to client to make admission must think that must be safe enough circumstance considered if took latter course observed judge humanely mr trevor be now in dilemma knew not how to move be fearful if stated positively that hero gun went off by accident that joey must deny yet if be permitted to assert to be case saw from bearing of judge that result of trial must be satisfactory hardly need be observed that judge prosecuting counsel jury everybody in court be much astonished at hesitation on part of prisoner counsel do mean to assert that gun went off by accident mr trevor asked judge never fired gun lord replied joey in calm steady voice prisoner have answered for replied mr trevor recovering be perfectly aware that by making statement of accidental murder must safely have left prisoner in hand of intelligent jury fact be lord that prisoner never fired gun therefore must not be guilty of murder imputed to mr trevor have felt upon hero assertion that case be hopeless roused up however to make strong appeal to jury unfortunately be declamation only not disproof of charge reply of prosecuting counsel completely established guilt of hero upon what be called presumptive evidence jury retired for few minute after summing up of judge then returned verdict against hero of guilty recommended to mercy although time to refer be one in leniency be seldom extended still there be youth of hero so much mystery in transaction when judge passed sentence distinctly stated that royal mercy must be so far extended that sentence must be commuted to transportation hero made reply bowed be led back to place of confinement in few minute afterwards arm of weeping mary be encircled round neck blame mary said joey sobbed mary that world can do be nothing when be innocent will soon be far from here mary said joey sitting down on bedstead thank heaven be over form of emma phillips rose up in hero imagination
