packed up ready for embarkation message from governor be received stating that in three day troop must be embarked also informing mr campbell that if have not purchased cow horse officer at fort

of verdure tree have burst into leaf in course of three day before quitted quebec so rapid be vegetation that appeared a if summer have come upon at once heat be also very great although when have landed weather be piercing cold in canada a well a in northern america transition from heat to cold from cold to heat be very rapid reader will be surprised to hear that when winter set in at quebec animal required for winter consumption be at once killed if troop be numerous perhaps three four hundred bullock be slaughtered hung up family kill cattle sheep pig turkey fowl etc be put up in garret where carcass immediately freeze hard remain quite good sweet during six seven month of severe winter occur in climate when portion of meat be to be cooked be gradually thawed in lukewarm water after be put to fire if put at once to fire in frozen state spoil there be strange circumstance occurs in cold latitude small fish called snow fish be caught during winter by making hole in thick ice fish coming to hole in thousand to breathe be thrown out with hand net upon ice where become in few minute frozen quite hard so that if wish may break in half like rotten stick cattle be fed upon fish during winter month have be proved be very strange that if after have be frozen for twenty four hour more put fish into water gradually thaw a do meat will recover swim about again a well a ever to proceed however with history mr campbell found that after expense have still three hundred pound left money left in quebec bank to use a might find necessary expenditure have be very great first there be removal of so large family passage out then have procured at liverpool large quantity of cutlery tool furniture etc of article be cheaper there than at quebec at quebec have also much to purchase most expensive portion of house such a window ready glazed stove boarding for floor cupboard partition salt provision crockery of description two small wagon ready to be put together several cask of nail variety of thing must be too tedious to mention procuring with expense of living have taken away money except three hundred pound have mentioned be on th of may that embarkation took place be not until afternoon that be prepared mr campbell niece be conducted down to bateaux lay at wharf with troop ready on board of governor aide de camp besides many other influential people of quebec escorted down a soon a have paid adieu word be given soldier in bateaux gave three cheer away went from wharf into stream for short time there be waving of handkerchief other token of good will on part of who be on wharf be soon left behind family found separated from acquaintance silently listening to measured sound of oar a dropped into water be not to be wondered at that be silent for be occupied with own thought called to mind beautiful park at wexton have quitted after having resided there so long so happily hall with splendor comfort rose up in remembrance room with furniture window with view be recalled to memory have crossed atlantic be now about to leave civilization comfort behind to isolate in canadian wood to trust to own resource own society own exertion be indeed commencement of new life for felt little adapted after luxury have enjoyed in former condition if thought reminiscence made grave silent did not make despairing repining trusted to power who alone must protect who give who take away doeth with a judge best if hope be not buoyant in of still there be confidence resolution resignation gradually be roused from revery by beauty of scenery novelty of what met sight song also of canadian boatman be musical cheering by degree have recovered usual good spirit alfred be first to shake off melancholy feeling to attempt to remove from others be unsuccessful officer who commanded detachment of troop who be in same bateau with family have respected silence upon departure from wharf perhaps felt much a did name be sinclair rank that of senior captain in regiment handsome florid young man tall well made very gentleman like very gentle in manner how very beautiful foliage be on point mother said alfred first breaking silence what contrast between leaf of sycamore so transparent yellow with sun behind new shoot of spruce fir be indeed very lovely replied mr campbell branch of tree feathering down a do to surface of water like good samaritan said emma extending arm that unfortunate drowning person who be swept away by stream might save by assistance have idea that tree have so much charity reflection emma rejoined alfred can not answer for charity by side of clear water must allow reflection cousin replied emma presume will add vanity to attribute answered alfred for certainly appear to be hanging over stream that may look admire in glassy mirror pretty well that for midshipman be not aware that used such choice language in cockpit retorted young lady perhaps not cousin answered alfred when sailor be in company of lady become refined from association well must admit alfred that be great deal more polished after have be month on shore thank cousin emma even for slight admission replied alfred laughing what be said mary percival at point be village one two three house just opening upon be raft miss percival be coming down river replied captain sinclair will see when be nearer to that perhaps cover two acre of water there be three tier of timber on raft be worth many thousand pound be first framed with log fastened by wooden tree nail timber placed within frame there be perhaps from forty to hundred people on raft to guide down stream house see be built on for accommodation of people have seen a many a fifteen house upon raft will sometimes contain cargo of thirty forty large ship be very wonderful how guide direct down stream said mr campbell be very dexterous seems strange that enormous mass can be so guided be done a will perceive there be three four rudder made of long sweep a may observe several sweep on side party be now standing up in sternsheets of bateau to look at people on raft who amounted to about fifty sixty men now running over top to one side dragging at sweep required joint power of seven eight men to of now passing again over to opposite sweep a directed by steersman bateau kept well in to shore out of way raft passed very quickly a soon a be clear of point a course to quebec be now straight there be slight breeze down river people on board of raft hoisted ten fifteen sail upon different mast to assist in descent again excited admiration of party conversation now became general until bateaux be made fast to shore of river while men took dinner have be prepared for before left quebec after repose of two hour again started at arrived at st anne where found thing ready for reception although bed be composed of leaf of maize indian corn be so tired that found very comfortable at daylight arose quite refreshed anxious to continue route martin super who with two youngest boy have be placed in separate boat have be very attentive to comfort of lady after embarkation appeared that have quite won heart of two boy by amusing anecdote during day soon after embarkation name of pontiac being again mentioned by captain sinclair mr campbell observed man super mentioned that name before confess know thing of canadian affair know only that pontiac be indian chief can captain sinclair give information relative to person who appears so well known in province will be happy mr campbell a far a be able to satisfy on one point can certainly speak with confidence a uncle be one of detachment in fort of detroit at time that be so nearly surprised have often told history of affair in presence pontiac be chief of lake tribe of indian will not repeat name of different tribe own particular tribe be that of ottawa ruled at time that canada be surrendered to by french at first although very proud haughty claiming sovereignty of country be very civil to english at least appeared so to be for french have given so bad reputation with northern tribe that have hitherto shown nothing most determined hostility appeared to hate very name be now inclined to be quiet be to be hoped fear of after severe conflict between will induce to remain so be perhaps aware that french have built many fort at most commanding spot in interior on lake of when gave up country be garrisoned by troop to keep indian under control fort be isolated communication between be rare be in pontiac first showed hostility against determination if possible to drive from lake be a cunning a be brave a indian showed more generalship than might be expected be according to system of war be always based upon stratagem plan of operation be to surprise fort at same time if possibly must so excellent be arrangement that be only fifteen day after plan be first laid that succeeded in gaining possession of three be surprised ten out of thirteen fort of course attack be made by other chief under direction a pontiac must not be at simultaneous assault did murder garrison capt sinclair said alfred major portion of be spared afterward be ransomed at high price ought to have mentioned a singular instance of advance of chief in comparison with other indian at time issued bill of credit on slip of bark signed with totem otter that bill unlike many of more civilized society be taken up paid be very remarkable in savage observed mr campbell how did pontiac contrive to surprise fort almost whole of be taken by singular stratagem indian be very partial to exceedingly dexterous at game called 'baggatiway be played with ball long handled sort of racket divide into two party object of party be to drive ball to own goal be something like hurley in england golf in scotland many hundred be sometimes engaged on side european be so fond of seeing activity dexterity shown by indian at game that be very common to request to play when happened to be near fort upon pontiac arranged plan be that indian must commence game of ball under fort after playing short time strike ball into fort of course of must go in for having done two three time recommenced play to avoid suspicion be to strike over again follow up by rush after through gate then when be in must draw concealed weapon overpower unsuspicious garrison be certainly very ingenious stratagem observed mr campbell succeeded a have observed except on three fort one pontiac directed attack upon be that be most anxious to obtain be detroit in a have before observed uncle be garrisoned there failed by singular circumstance pray tell how captain sinclair said emma know how much have interested too captain sinclair continued mary be very happy have be able to wear away portion of tedious journey miss percival so will proceed with history fort of detroit be garrisoned by about three hundred men when pontiac arrived there with large force of indian encamped under wall have warrior so mixed up with woman child brought so many article for trade that suspicion be created garrison have not heard of capture of other fort have already taken place at same time unusual number of indian be pointed out to major gladwin who commanded fort have suspicion pontiac sent word to major that wished to 'have talk with in order to cement more fully friendship between indian english to major gladwin consented appointing next day to receive pontiac chief in fort now so happened that major gladwin have employed indian woman to make pair of moccasin out of very curious marked elk skin indian woman brought moccasin with remainder of skin major be so pleased with that ordered to make second pair of moccasin out of skin then told that might keep remainder for woman having received order quitted major instead of leaving fort remained loitering about till be observed inquired why did not go replied that wanted to return rest of skin a set so great value on a appeared strange conduct be questioned then said that if took away skin then never must be able to return major gladwin sent for woman upon hearing of expression have used be evident that wanted to communicate something be afraid on being pressed hard encouraged assured of protection then informed major gladwin pontiac chief be to come into fort to morrow under plea of holding talk that have cut barrel of rifle short to conceal under blanket that be intention at signal given by pontiac to murder major gladwin officer who be at council while other warrior who must also come into fort with concealed arm under pretense of trading must attack garrison outside having obtained information major gladwin did must to put fort into state of defense took necessary precaution made known to officer men what intention of indian be instructed officer how to act at council garrison how to meet pretended trader outside about ten o'clock pontiac thirty six chief with train of warrior came into fort to pretended council be received with great politeness pontiac made speech when came forward to present wampum belt receipt of by major be a indian woman have informed to be signal for chief warrior to commence assault major officer drew sword out of scabbard troop with musket loaded bayonet fixed appeared outside in council room ready to present pontiac brave a really be turned pale perceived that be discovered consequently to avoid open detection finished speech with many profession of regard for english major gladwin then rose to reply to immediately informed that be aware of plot murderous intention pontiac denied major gladwin stepped to chief drawing aside blanket exposed rifle cut short left pontiac chief without word to say in reply major gladwin then desired pontiac to quit fort immediately a otherwise must not be able to restrain indignation of soldier who must immolate follower who be outside of fort pontiac chief did not wait for second intimation made haste must to get outside of gate be prudent in major gladwin to allow pontiac chief to leave after have come into fort with intent to murder men said henry campbell must not major have be justified in detaining certainly think must have be so did uncle

call be upon will perhaps be more teachable year two hence must be aware that have common disposition to deal with in child however maternal feeling may oppose judgment be still strong enough to make feel that decision be for benefit must not here put value upon finished education used to do let give advantage peculiarity of position will allow to do be now in wood to certain degree returned to state of nature first most important knowledge be to learn to gain livelihood well dear think be correct in view on subject therefore john may go to school with malachi bone come to see when can

replied campbell come john wish good by remember promise john bade farewell to whole party with due decorum then trotted off after schoolmaster chapter xiii in course of week two thing found place family began to feel more comfortable there be also degree of regularity order established must not be effected during time that soldier be employed mr campbell percival took upon work inside round house during morning latter attending to pig fowl bringing water from stream etc mary emma milked cow then assisted mother during day in washing etc mr campbell instructed percival worked in garden assisted a much a must where might be found most useful be too advanced in year to be capable of much hard work alfred henry martin super be employed during whole day clearing ground felling timber other day one other went out with martin into wood to procure food bringing home with deer wild turkey other game with occasional piece of salt pork fish caught be sufficient for family consumption percival be now permitted to accompany hunting party became somewhat expert with rifle required only little more practice to be good shot rose at half past five be assembled to prayer at past seven previous to going to breakfast dined at one have combined tea supper at seven o'clock at nine o'clock went to bed before two month have passed away thing went on like clock work one day passed away so like that time flew imperceptibly wondered that sunday came round so quick have now time to unpack thing book mr campbell have selected brought with have be arranged on shelf in parlor have not a yet much time to read be generally too tired before day be over not to long for bed indeed only interval of leisure during whole day be between supper bedtime when must assemble in kitchen talk over little matter have occurred either during chase at home be now in middle of october winter be fast approaching looked forward to with degree of anxiety john have kept word very sacredly be occasionally absent for three four day if so invariably came to house remained day two at home alfred martin have long finished fishing punt a be light easily handled henry percival went out in together when be at home john with percival must pull mile out into lake soon return with supply of large fish mr campbell therefore have salted down sufficient to fill barrel for winter use one day be agreeably surprised by captain sinclair making appearance have walked from fort to communicate to that hay have be gathered in must be sent round in day two also to inform mr campbell that commandant must spare young bullock if must wish to have for winter provision offer be gladly accepted having partaken of dinner captain sinclair be obliged to return to fort being that night on duty previous however to return have conversation with martin super unobserved by rest of party afterward invited alfred to walk back to fort with return on following morning alfred agreed to do so two hour before be dark set off a soon a be on opposite side of brook be joined by martin super reason for asking to come back with be twofold said captain sinclair to alfred in first place wish to know road to fort in case must be necessary to make communication during winter secondly wished to have conversation with martin relative to information have received about indian can tell privately what be unwilling to say before mother cousin a must put in state of restlessness anxiety must avail nothing only annoy fact be have for time have information that indian have held several council doe not appear however that have a yet decided upon thing although be certain that have gathered together in large number not very far from fort doubt have french emissary inciting to attack from what can learn however have not agreed among therefore in probability nothing will be attempted until next year for autumn be season for sending out war party at same time there be security for there be great difference between junction of tribe against common indian war party must therefore be on alert for have treacherous foe to deal with now for portion of interest in affair if attack fort may withstanding treaty with of course must not be safe where be unfortunately may not be safe even if be not molested for when indian collect even though main body decide upon nothing there be always band of five to ten indian who having left home will not return if can help without booty be not regular warrior if warrior not much esteemed by tribe in fact be worst class of indian who be mere robber bandit must therefore be on look out for visit of people be fortunate for old bone have shifted abode so many mile to westward that be on such good term with a be not very likely that party of indian can approach without meeting with track during excursion be true captain observed martin will go put on guard will not attack before attack said alfred why must replied sinclair be a much indian almost a be be well known to most of besides what must gain by attacking straggling party have to fear be in quest of booty will not expect to find thing in wigwam except few fur will not venture near rifle fear when there be nothing to be obtained by so doing mention to alfred that may be prepared keep sharp look out be very possible that nothing of kind may occur that winter may pas away without danger mention to martin a consider that probability be not sufficient to warrant alarming other member of family especially female portion of how far may consider advisable to communicate what have now passed to father henry be for to decide a said before imagine have much to fear from general attack be too late in year know that council broke up without coming to decision have only to fear attempt of small party of marauder think be quite strong enough in number in defense of habitation to resist successfully if be not suddenly surprised be that have to fear now that be warned danger be over well captain will leave now said martin will go over to old malachi to night for occurs to that attack be more likely to be made between fall of leaf fall of snow than afterward so sooner put malachi on guard better good evening sir captain sinclair alfred continued on way to fort have contracted strong friendship be unreserved in communication with other have idea alfred said captain sinclair how peculiar position of family occupies thought really appears almost like madness on part of father to bring out mother cousin to such place expose to such privation danger can hardly sleep at night when reflect upon what might happen believe replied alfred that if father have known exactly what present position must have be must have decided upon not leaving england must remember that came out with much encouragement idea that must only have to surmount hardship of settler in clearing land fancied at least be sure did that must be surrounded by other farmer have particular danger to incur when at quebec found that good land near to civilization be bought up possessed by french canadian be advised to come further westward by who ought to have be aware of what must have to encounter by so doing who probably considered that danger now apprehend no longer existed have followed that advice have doubt be conscientiously given think even now that advice be good although be accompanied by female who have be brought up in so different sphere for whose welfare such anxiety be shown for observe now sinclair suppose without having made acquaintance have heard that settler men woman have located where have done must have considered so very rash undertaking presuming that be merely farmer farmer wife certainly must have troubled very little about perhaps not thought upon subject supposing subject have be brought up at fort have heard party have stockaded house four five good rifle to depend upon with fort to fall back upon if necessary admit must most probably have said that be in position to protect most assuredly therefore be equally so feeling of interest in magnify danger therefore trust that in future will not allow position to interfere with night rest wish must bring to feeling of security alfred if be only with to assist in protecting must sleep sound enough then must not be of much use a watch replied alfred laughing never fear sinclair will do well enough continued if require assistance will apply for party of soldier there must be much difficulty about alfred replied captain sinclair if there be sufficient danger to make demand upon commandant same danger must require that must not weaken force in fort must have to retreat to fort leave farm to mercy of indian certainly must be wisest plan of two replied alfred at event must send woman indian have not come yet must hope that will not conversation be then changed in hour more arrived at fort alfred be welcomed at fort by colonel forster with whom be great favorite colonel must not refrain from expressing opinion that mr campbell family be in position of danger lamenting that female portion of family who have be brought up with such very different prospect must be so situated even ventured to hint that if mr campbell two miss percival must pas winter in fort must make arrangement to accommodate alfred at once replied that be convinced inducement must persuade mother cousin to leave father have shared prosperity must cling to in adversity that be aware of what must have to risk before came out father preferred life of honorable independence attended with danger to seeking assistance of others still can not perceive reason for lady remaining to encounter danger more be stronger be to repel danger replied alfred woman surely will only be incumbrance think differently replied alfred young delicate a cousin be will not shrink more than mother when service be required now can of use rifle if required to defend house determined woman be almost a effective a man depend upon if come to necessity will do so see therefore colonel that by taking away lady will weaken force continued alfred laughing well dear fellow will press more only recollect that will always be ready to send assistance when required have be thinking colonel forster a have horse at present if have rocket might be useful in such case at distance be from rocket must be seen immediately if fired at night promise that will not be fired without great necessity be glad that have mentioned alfred will have dozen to take with go back with boat carry hay to morrow morning do not yes will take opportunity to save wearing out shoe a have cobbler near to presume will be last trip made by boat season yes replied colonel frost will soon set in now in fortnight will probably be visited with heavy fall of snow ground will then be covered till spring suppose will see hear from occasionally yes a soon a can push along in snow shoe will pay visit replied alfred have art to learn yet following morning sky be clear day brilliant sun shone upon dark scarlet tinged foliage of oak through transparent yellow leaf of maple slight frost have appeared for two three morning about month back now be enjoying what be termed indian summer be return of fair rather warm weather for short time previous to winter setting in soldier be busy carrying hay down to bateaux before noon alfred bade farewell to colonel forster other officer of fort accompanied by captain sinclair went down to embark be ready alfred stepped into boat captain sinclair being on duty not able to accompany back will not fail to give direction to sentry about rocket alfred said captain sinclair so tell mother cousin mind to show how to fire off from out of barrel of musket good by god bless dear fellow good by replied alfred a boat pulled from shore chapter xiv after alfred return from fort few day passed away without incident martin have paid visit to malachi bone who have promised that must be on look out must give immediate information assistance in case of hostile measure on part of indian told martin that in few day must discover what have taken place what might be looked forward to when martin returned with communication alfred be satisfied did not acquaint body except brother henry with information have received from captain sinclair monotony of

that money into agent hand be extremely liberal of mr douglas campbell certainly did not expect a found plant there on taking possession be entitled to remuneration for what left however be too poor to refuse offer from feeling of delicacy will therefore write thank for generous behavior alfred have read letter from captain lumley made very thoughtful fact be promotion observation in captain lumley letter have brought back former regret at having quitted service be very melancholy in consequence a cousin read letter aloud gradually recovered spirit at last letter be read then newspaper be distributed no more work be done day in evening sat round kitchen fire talked over intelligence have received until long after usual time of retiring to bed have be thinking dear emily said mr

say must therefore wait winter be devoured by wolf in mean time replied emma laughing why be getting over fright already emma yes feel pretty bold now think there be nothing to be afraid of remainder of week be passed away in practicing upon snow shoe by male of party woman scarcely ever venturing out of door a cold be very severe mary emma be accompanied by alfred for first three four day after notwithstanding that howling of wolf be heard night took courage when found that animal never made appearance by daylight went a before to milk cow by on saturday be in hope of seeing old malachi bone did not make appearance john who must now get on very well in snow shoe became very impatient alfred martin be also very anxious to see old man that might ascertain if have made discovery relative to indian sunday a usual be day of rest from labor service be read by mr campbell evening passed in serious conversation mr campbell although usually in good spirit be certainly not so on that evening whether be that severity of winter have set in known long duration of have to encounter have effect upon spirit be melancholy a well a serious more than once referred to former residence when in england be very unusual thing for to do by degree conversation be turned in direction although one said so felt what change there be in present position from have be forced to leave mr campbell who perceived that gloom be gathering over whole party made several remark tending to reconcile to present lot after time mr campbell observed perhaps dear child may be divine mercy have sent here to wilderness true be that be removed from civilization shut up here by severe winter deprived of enjoyment pleasure be to be found in society be compelled to leave let also bear in mind that be removed from many temptation might have there assailed still papa must be very glad if circumstance must permit to return to england must not said percival yes child must even if have remained here so long a to have become attached to place to isolation at first be felt so irksome must still return to england to society if have mean a christian be not to fly from world temptation to buckle on armor putting trust in who will protect fight good fight be doing duty in state of life to will please god to call if ever be to return to england there must be chance of living a did before left must there papa see none dear boy never know what be in store for must of ever return presume must be to live in more humble way for part must prefer that be so for although trust did not greatly misuse that wealth so long supposed to be mine must not be sorry to have much le therefore le responsibility indeed dear campbell imperfect a be believe that many must have made better use of than did thought so at time dear replied mr campbell since have be lost to have often thought that might have done more good with fact be dear child there be nothing so dangerous to eternal welfare a great wealth tends to harden heart by affording mean of constant self indulgence under such circumstance man be apt to become selfish easily satisfied with own work too proud to see error did observe in litany read at morning service how very appropriately be inserted prayer for deliverance under peril of wealth 'in time of tribulation in time of wealth in hour of death in day of judgment good lord deliver ' examine dear child in time of tribulation be in poverty distress perhaps famishing from want in few position be people so incited to crime then in time of wealth evidently distinctly placing wealth a more dangerous to soul welfare than extremest poverty accompanying temptation observe only exceeded by most critical of dangerous position when have be done nothing can be undone hour of death followed by day of judgment mr campbell ceased speaking there be pause for minute two in conversation when mary percival said what then dear uncle do consider a most enviable position in life consider moderate independence a most enviable not occupied in trade a spirit of barter be too apt to make bend to be actually fraud must say country gentleman living on own property among own tenant employing poor around hold position in have least temptation to do wrong most opportunity of doing good agree with dear campbell said wife yet how few be satisfied even with lot because craving after wealth be so strong that one must have more than hath few men will be content desire of aggrandizement overcomes master yet what can be more absurd than to witness care anxiety of to gain rich who have already more perhaps than be necessary for want thus 'heaping up rich not knowing who may gather endangering soul to obtain that must leave behind when die others amass wealth not actuated by avarice of hoarding up by appetite for expending who collect unjustly that may lavish profusely be equally foolish how important be that lesson given in scripture mr campbell opened bible lay before read spake parable unto ground of certain rich man brought forth plentifully said what will do because have room where to bestow fruit said will do will pull down barn build greater there will bestow fruit good will say to soul soul thou hast much good laid up for many year take thine ease eat drink be merry god said unto thou fool night thy soul will be required of thee after short silence mr campbell observed have often reflected since have be here upon what might have be position have decided upon remaining in england might at moment have be in greatest distress even wanting meal have therefore often thanked god that left mean of coming here providing for a have done a have doubt will with blessing continue to do how much better off be at moment than many thousand of countryman who remain in how many be starving how many be driven into crime from want while have good roof over head sufficient clothing more than sufficient food have therefore great reason to thank god for mercy have vouchsafed to have heard prayer 'give day daily bread yes continued mr campbell 'give day daily bread ' be that be taught to ask for comprehends yet how heartlessly be pronounced by many of who do repeat daily prayer so be blessing asked at meal be by too many considered a mere matter of form forget that who give can also take away in presumption suppose own ability exertion to have be sole mean of procuring daily supply of food thanking rather than giver of good how many thousand be there who have be supplied with more than require from cradle down to grave without grateful feeling toward heaven considering butcher baker a provider debt canceled a soon a bill be paid how different must be feeling of poor cottager who be uncertain whether labor may procure family meal for morrow who often suffers privation hunger what be more painful witness suffering of love how earnest must be prayer when cry 'give day daily bread ' conversation have very strong effect upon party when retired to rest did shortly after laid head upon pillow not only with resignation with thankfulness for mercy have be vouchsafed to felt that in wilderness be under eye of watchful gracious providence

a have many beaver other skin while of martin others consisted chiefly of deer skin question be whom to send down with malachi be not inclined to go martin must not well be spared moreover must very probably get into scrape if went to montreal whereas henry alfred did not know thing about value of skin otherwise mr campbell who wished to purchase flour pork besides several other article must have preferred sending one of difficulty be soon removed by old malachi who observed that have made valuation of skin that others must be valued also before be packed up that if not sold for what ought to fetch nearly so have better be brought back mr campbell be satisfied with arrangement henry be appointed to undertake journey mr campbell made out inventory of article mr campbell added list be ready a soon a received notice that boat be to leave martin did not appear at annoyed at not being selected for expedition since malachi bone have informed that strawberry be not wife a have supposed martin be continually by side began to speak few word of english have become great favorite with body mr campbell a soon a perceived that malachi longer avoided thought duty to offer land back again malachi must not consent to accept said did not want land although perhaps might raise lodge little nearer to than be at present thing have better remain a be after mr campbell did not renew subject malachi soon acted upon remark that perhaps might raise lodge little nearer for few day afterward made appearance with strawberry john three loaded with household utensil in very short time have erected wigwam within sight of house at western end of mr campbell prairie gave great satisfaction to mr campbell because john be now always near indeed no longer slept in lodge at house in room with brother major part of day passed at lodge in company with old hunter by new arrangement gradually became a be one family not day passed that strawberry did not come to house make useful assisting in thing that must rapidly learning what did not know one two evening after message from fort mr campbell asked question relative to habit of beaver a have heard much of sagacity of animal well ma'be said malachi be most reasonable animal certainly will say never be tired with watching have even forgot in summer time what came out for from having fallen in with at work so have said martin once be lying down under bush by side of stream saw whole council of meet together talked after own fashion so earnestly really think have language a good a own be always old one who talk young one who listen be true replied malachi once saw hold council then separated to go to work for be about to dam up stream build lodge what did do malachi said mr campbell why ma'be did same a christian must have done injun say that beaver have soul a well a certainly if sense gave injun must be in right first thing that did be to appoint sentinel to give notice of danger for moment one come near sentinel give signal away dive disappear till danger be over there be many beast a well a bird do same observed mr campbell indeed most of be gregarious live in flock be true sir replied martin well ma'be beaver choose place fit for work what require be stream running through flat bottom stream of water may dam up so a to form large pond of sufficient depth by water flowing over covering flat bottom several foot when have found spot require begin work perhaps observed mr campbell choice requires more sagacity than rest of labor for beaver must have engineering talent to make selection must be able to calculate a exactly a if took level to secure size depth of water in pond be necessary be most wonderful perhaps of instinct reasoning power rather allotted to be sir have often thought so replied malachi then to see how carry tool about carpenter basket must not be better provided strong teeth serve a ax to cut down tree then tail serve a trowel for mason work fore foot use just a do hand tail be also employed a little cart wheelbarrow pray go on malachi said mary be quite interested already well miss have known little creature a be raise bank four five hundred pace in length matter of

pick out tree by bank of stream examine how tree incline to see if will fall into stream if not will not cut down when be cutting down be nearly ready for falling if wind must change be against fall will leave tree till wind will assist a soon a tree be down saw off branch arm float log down to where dam be to be made lay across a lay one upon other of course water rise enables to float down place upper one before that a soon a lower log be in place animal go fetch long grass clay load upon flat tail drag to dam filling up hole between timber till be a strong a wall water be completely stopped yes said martin have heard at night working away so hard flapping spattering with tail must imagine there be fifty men at work instead of hundred of small animal work by day by night never seem tired till dam be sound work be complete raising of dam be only preparatory be not to building own house observed mr campbell nothing more ma'be think rest of work be quite a wonderful be time to go to bed observed mr campbell must therefore leave remainder of malachi story till evening be sure that there be not one of party who be more anxious to hear than be replied mr campbell rising a say be past ten o'clock malachi strawberry have to go home so good night oh dear what pity cried percival will dream of beaver night be sure will chapter xxiii for two three day mr campbell be very busy

hand a soon a seed be sown hope when colonel come over observed martin to alfred that will persuade to let have soldier summer for will want for fencing getting hay crop in summer be not very long there be plenty to do think father intends to make request replied alfred ah sir will now see value of bit of prairie land to new settler instead of having to go in search of hay a must do at fort now

about time be fit to break in be in two three year yes will be great farmer by by replied alfred with sigh for at moment be thinking of captain lumley nautical profession in evening of day on conversation took place malachi bone be requested to resume observation upon beaver well ma'be a said other night a soon a have dammed up river made lake then build house how manage to work under water fix post in ground be puzzle to do fix six post in ground very firmly then build house be very curious be in form of large oven made of clay fat earth mixed up with branch herb of sort have three set of room one above other so that if water rise from freshet sudden thaw may be able to move higher keep dry beaver have own little room entrance be made under water so that dive down to go into nothing can harm how very curious what do live upon bark of what call asp wood ma'be be kind of sallow lay up great quantity of in autumn a provision for winter when be frozen up for month well how do take malachi there be many way ma'be sometimes indian break down dam let off water then kill except dozen of female dozen male after stop up dam again that animal may breed increase sometimes when beaver lake be frozen hard break into beaver house from top when do that beaver dive escape a must come up to breathe at hole in ice place net take in way always leave sufficient number to keep up stock also take in trap baited with asp wood be more difficult there be sort of beaver ma'be called land beaver be more easily taken observed martin make hole in earth like rabbit indian say that

then set trap for beaver otter martin mink cat fox other animal trap large small build hut set trap about examine day cut what flesh be good employ skinning animal take be beaver flesh good yes ma'be very tolerable eating perhaps best find at time what miserable life must be said mr campbell well ma'be may think so hunter think otherwise replied malachi be used to to being left alone to own thought be true observed martin 'd rather pas winter hunting beaver than pas at quebec miserable a may imagine life to be there must be charm in life be certain observed mr campbell for how many be engaged in who go out year after year never think of laying up of earnings very true sir replied martin what make from skin be spent a soon a get to quebec a know well then set off again why be like sailor observed alfred who after long cruise spend wage prize money in few day then go to sea again for more exactly replied malachi what be use of money if keep trapper can always take up a much powder ball a want upon credit pay with portion of skin on return what doe want with rest be of use to so of course spends must not be better to put by until have sufficient to buy farm live comfortably doe live comfortably ma'be said malachi have not more work to do more thing to look after more to care for with farm than when have nothing be very true philosophy after observed mr campbell happy be man who be content to be poor if man prefers to live entirely upon flesh a hunter do there be reason why must work hard till ground to procure bread when want be few care be few also still even savage must feel necessity of exertion when have wife family yes sir to be sure doe work hard in own way to procure food trapper seldom have wife must be no use to in wood have one to provide for appears to like savage life very independent one said mr campbell presume be independence give such charm be depend upon ma'be replied martin what do do summer time malachi why ma'be take to rifle then there be deer lynx wild cat squirrel bear many other animal to look after sometimes go bee hunting for honey pray tell how take honey malachi why ma'be bee always live in hollow of old

honey then let go again bee a soon a be allowed to escape fly straight toward hive watch till can no longer see walk in direction catch so go on till see settle upon tree then know that hive honey must be in tree so cut down how very clever said percival requires sharp eye though said martin to watch bee far of trapper catch bee give sugar mixed with whisky make tipsy can not fly so fast then discover hive much sooner a can run almost a fast a bee fly that be capital cried percival tell martin how do kill bear why master percival with rifle to be sure easiest way to kill be when be in hole in hollow tree how do get out why knock tree with ax come out to see what be matter a soon a put head out shoot be in earnest martin yes ma'be quite in earnest replied martin be true ma'be said hunter bear about here be not very savage have much worse down in maine have seen indian in canoe on river watching bear a swam across kill in water six seven in one day still bear be awkward sort of animal when be angry replied martin a may have down here in autumn be a well not to let be thought too lightly of indeed there be fear of said emma a for malachi think nothing dangerous have wish to see bear say may expect martin why so because miss be very fond of maize have field of sown may tempt well if do come must trust to rifle replied emma laughing at event fear so much a did when first came here fire miss without be sure of killing said creature be very dangerous when wounded be afraid will only fire in self defense malachi be when have other chance left have rather trust to heel than rifle be ever hugged by bear well be ever hugged once be much closer to one than ever wish to be again oh when be that do pray tell said emma be when be young that one day sounded tree in forest with ax be certain that bear be in animal did not show so climbed up tree to examine hole at top see if bear be at home a if so be determined to have out well miss be on top of hollow trunk be just putting head down into hole when of sudden edge of tree kneeled upon gave way like so much tinder down went into hollow luckily for did not go down head foremost there must have remained till time for hole in middle of tree a found be too narrow for to have turned in there must have stuck a be went down with dust crumbles smothering almost till came right on top of bear who lay at bottom fell with such force doubled head down so that must not lay hold of with teeth must not have be pleasant indeed bear be quite a much if not more astonished than there lay beneath very quiet till must recover little then thought of getting out a may suppose fast enough hollow of tree providentially be not so wide must work up again with back to one side knee to other by mean gradually got up again to hole fell in at perched across timber to fetch breath have not be there more than quarter of minute intended to have remained much longer when perceived of sudden bear head within foot of have climbed up after saw that be very angry so in moment threw off perch down went to ground at foot of tree matter of near twenty foot even faster than went down inside of be severely shaken with fall bone be broken in fact be more frightened than hurt lay quite still for little while when growl of bear put in mind of jumped on leg found that be coming down tree after be within six foot of ground there be time to lose caught up rifle have just time to put to ear settle a be placing fore foot on ground what narrow escape well perhaps be there be saying miss beat till fight be over chapter xxiv notice arrived that

in daily expectation of summons be not long in preparation in few minute made appearance accompanied by mary percival then sat down to dinner not very cheerful for captain sinclair unexpected departure have thrown gloom over however rallied little toward close of meal mr campbell produced one of bottle of wine to drink success happiness to traveler be then time to start captain sinclair henry shook hand with mr campbell miss percivals accompanied by gentleman of party walked down to beach ca bear parting with one have be so intimate with said emma after be left alone declare must sit down have hearty cry at captain sinclair departure mary sighed made answer be not surprised to hear say so emma said mr campbell in england when be surrounded with friend parting be always painful here where have so few might almost say only captain sinclair be of course most painful however be only for time hope must be very dull to be on duty at fort said mary must not be surprised at captain sinclair not returning must be most exceedingly surprised replied emma be sure that will come back if be not unavoidably prevented since have expressed so much desire to rejoin regiment must be surprised a well a emma said mr campbell be not volatile young man come must clear away dinner table mr campbell alfred percival martin soon returned for captain sinclair be obliged to push off immediately that might return in time to fort in obedience to order malachi john have gone out on hunting expedition strawberry be at own lodge party sat in kitchen in evening be therefore much reduced taking farewell of captain sinclair did not dispose to be very lively few word be exchanged now then conversation drooped emma spoke of captain sinclair expectation project never know what may come in world of change dear emma said mr campbell captain sinclair plan may be overthrown by circumstance over have control how seldom do meet with result equal to expectation when be practicing in profession little expected must be summoned to take possession of wexton hall when once in possession a little did expect must be obliged to quit to come to desolate wild be in hand of god who doe with a think fit have be reading morning made observation not only how often individual even nation be out in expectation know more convincing proof of than narration of event from recent occurrence can hardly yet be considered a history have offered to perhaps there never be so short period in cause have produced effect so rapidly in in case effect have be directly opposite to what short sighted mortal have anticipated be in scarcely forty year ago that french being in possession of province attempted to wrest from portion of america occupied what be result after war for cruelty atrocity be perhaps unequaled in history party employing savage by whom french english be alternately tortured burned to death france in attempting to obtain lost be compelled in to surrender own province to great britain here be one instance in affair turned out contrary to expectation of france now again at period be england more prosperous more respected by foreign nation than at close of war prosperity made arrogant unjust wronged colony thought that dared not resist imperious will imagined that now that french be driven from canada america be own whereas be because french be driven from canada that colony ventured to resist a long a french held country english colonist have enemy on frontier consequently looked up to england for support protection required aid assistance a long a did require be not likely to make remonstrance at being taxed to pay portion of expense be incurred have french possessed army under montcalm ready to advance at time that stamp act duty upon tea salt etc be imposed question very much if colonist must have made remonstrance longer requiring army for own particular defense same duty induced to rise in rebellion against what considered injustice eventually to assert independence here again find that affair turned out quite contrary to expectation of england observe again american colonist gained independence in probability must not have done have not be assisted by numerous army fleet of france who irritated at loss of canada wished to humiliate england by loss of own american possession little did french king noblesse imagine that in upholding principle of american allowing french army navy may say people of france en masse to be imbued with same principle of equality that be sowing seed of revolution in own country be to bring king a well a major part of nobility to scaffold there again event did not turn out according to expectation will observe in attempt made by party result be that blow fell upon own head not upon of party be intended to crush remember said alfred after mr campbell have finished speaking having somewhere read story of eastern king who purchased proverb of dervise ordered to be engraven on gold silver utensil in palace proverb be 'never undertake thing until have well considered end so happened that there be conspiracy against king be arranged that surgeon must bleed with poisoned lancet surgeon agreed king arm be bound up one of silver basin be held to receive blood surgeon read inscription be so struck with force of that threw down lancet confessed plot thus be life of king preserved very apt story alfred said mr campbell question now be continued alfred a two of party france england have proved so short sighted whether american having thrown off allegiance have not be equally so in choice of democratical government how far modern democracy may succeed be not prepared to say replied mr campbell do know that in ancient time duration be generally very short continually changing to oligarchy tyranny one thing be certain that there be form of government under people become so rapidly vicious where who benefit be treated with such ingratitude how do account for sir said alfred there be two principal cause one be that where men be declared to be equal man never will permit fellow to be if can prevent only source of distinction be wealth thus desire of wealth becomes ruling passion of whole body there be passion so demoralizing other be that where people more properly speaking mob govern must be conciliated by flattery servility on part of who must become idol now flattery be lying habit equally demoralizing to party who give to party who receives depend upon there be government so contemptible so unpleasant for honest man to live under a democracy be opinion sir believe very general one said alfred how far american may disprove opinion continued mr campbell remains to be seen be certain have commenced new form of government with act of such gross injustice a to warrant assumption that boasted virtue be pretense refer to not liberating slave have given lie to own assertion in declaration of independence in have declared men equal born free can not expect divine blessing upon who when emancipated be so unjust a to hold fellow creature in bondage time will come have doubt although perhaps not of here present may see day when retribution will fall upon head rather upon head of offspring for sin of father be visited upon child even to third fourth generation be time for to think of retiring good night god bless chapter xxv in two day malachi john returned bringing with skin of three bear have killed at period of year animal be so thin so poor that flesh be not worth bringing home indeed be hardly worth while going out

other article to be sent up spring a present to tribe hope will procure good will have taken up several french emissary who be working mischief still will be liable to assault of straggling party said mr campbell be true replied colonel against have own mean of defense must in so isolated position be equally liable to burglary in england only with difference that in england must have law to appeal to whereas here must take law into own hand certainly be not pleasant to be in continual state of anxiety observed mr campbell knew what have to expect before came here must make best of so have lost captain sinclair colonel be great loss to yes be to go to england for short time replied colonel will soon have back again must be very fond of profession to remain in with mean told that be about to

taken fire why miss replied malachi in autumn when thing be a dry a tinder nothing be more easy indian light fire take trouble to put out be generally cause of then requires wind to help danger that have escaped made serious impression on whole party following day being sunday mr campbell did not forget to offer up prayer of thankfulness for preservation roof of cow house be soon repaired by alfred martin indian summer passed away without further adventure day after fire dispatch arrived from fort to ascertain welfare colonel officer be greatly rejoiced to learn comparatively so little damage have be done for expected to find that family have be burned out have made arrangement at fort to receive gradually weather became cold fire be lighted month after evil have described winter again set in chapter xxix once more be ground covered with snow to depth of three foot cattle be littered down inside inclosure of palisade round cow house sheep be driven into inclosed sheep fold horse be put into portion of barn in sheep fold have be parted off for be made secure preparation be made for long winter although there have be fall of severe frost have not yet come on did however in about fortnight afterward then according to wish of colonel six ox be killed for use of fort taken there by horse on sledge be last task that have to fulfill then alfred bade adieu to officer of fort a did not expect to meet again till winter be over having experienced one winter be more fully prepared for second a malachi strawberry john be now regular inmate of house for did not keep separate table there be greater feeling of security monotony dreariness be not so great a in preceding winter moreover thing be now in place have more to attend to two circumstance greatly contributed to relieve ennui arising from continual confinement hunting party went out a usual only henry occasionally alfred remained at home to attend to stock to perform other office increase of establishment required new book brought by henry from montreal by common consent have be laid aside for winter evening be now great source of amusement a mr campbell read aloud portion of evening time passed away quickly a always doe when there be regular routine of duty employment christmas came before be aware of approach be great comfort to mr campbell that now always have john at home except when be out hunting on score have long dismissed all anxiety a have full confidence in malachi latterly malachi john seldom went out alone indeed old man appeared to like being in company misanthropy have wholly disappeared now invariably spent evening with family assembled round kitchen fire have become much more fond of hearing own voice john did not so much admire evening party cared nothing for new book indeed book must amuse making moccasin working porcupine quill with strawberry at one corner of fire others might talk read be same john never said word appeared to pay least attention to what be said father occasionally tried to make learn something be useless must remain for hour with book before mind be elsewhere mr campbell therefore gave up attempt for present indulging hope that when john be older must be more aware of advantage of education must become more attentive at present be only inflicting pain on boy without advantage being gained john did not always sit by kitchen fire wolf be much more numerous than in preceding winter having be attracted by sheep be within palisade night howling be incessant howl of wolf be sufficient to make john seize rifle leave house must remain in snow for hour till one came sufficiently near for to fire have already killed several when circumstance occurred be cause of great uneasiness john be out one evening a usual crouched down within palisade watching for wolf be bright starry night there be moon when perceived one of animal crawling along almost on belly close to door of palisade surrounded house surprised a generally speaking animal prowled round palisade encircled sheep fold else close to pig sty be at opposite side from entrance door john leveled rifle fired when to astonishment wolf appeared to spring up in air on hind leg then fall down roll away key of palisade door be always kept within john determined to go in fetch that might ascertain whether have killed animal not when entered malachi said did kill boy know replied john come for key to see like gate being opened at night john said mr campbell why leave a usually do till to morrow morning will be time enough know if be wolf replied john what then boy tell said malachi well think be indian replied john who then explained what have passed well must wonder replied malachi at event gate must not be opened to night for if be indian fired at there be more than one of will keep fast john see what be to morrow mr campbell girl be much alarmed at event be with difficulty that be persuaded to retire to rest will keep watch to night at event said malachi a soon a mr campbell niece have left room boy be right have doubt be angry snake party who be prowling about if boy have hit indian have doubt of will make off however will be just a well to be on guard nevertheless martin can watch here will watch in fold have before observed that lodge of malachi martin wife be built within palisade of sheep fold that there be passage from palisade round house to surrounded sheep fold passage have also palisade on side of will watch here said alfred let martin go home with wife will watch with said john well perhaps will be better said malachi two rifle be better than one if assistance be required there will be one to send for what do think must do malachi said mr campbell can not climb palisade not well sir do think must attempt unless have large force be sure have not sir must rather endeavor to set fire to house if must be not so easy one thing be certain that snake will try can to get possession of what saw in storehouse that doubt said alfred will not find so easy matter have be reconnoitering sir be truth of if john have helped one of to bit of lead will do good for will prove that be on alert make careful how come near house again after few minute more conversation mr campbell henry percival retired leaving others to watch alfred walked home with malachi party to see if be right at sheep fold then returned night passed without further disturbance except howling of wolf to be accustomed next morning at daybreak malachi martin came to house with john alfred opened palisade gate went out to survey spot where john have fired yes sir said malachi be indian doubt of here be dent made in snow by knee a crawled along john have hit for here be blood let follow trail see sir have be hard hit there be more blood way a go on have continued malachi a passed by mound of snow here be wolf skin be covered up with then be dead thereabouts have carried off for never must have parted with skin if have have sens about yes observed martin wound be mortal that be certain pursued track till arrived at forest then satisfied by mark on snow that wounded man have be carried away returned to house when found rest of family dressed in kitchen alfred showed skin of wolf informed of what have discovered be grieved that blood have be shed observed mr campbell wish have not happened have heard that indian never forgive on such occasion why ma'be be very revengeful that be certain still wo like to risk too much have be lesson to only wish have be angry snake who be settled a then must have more trouble anxiety about perhaps may be said alfred sir be not likely be one of young men know indian custom well be time before alarm occasioned by event subsided in mind of mr campbell niece mr campbell also thought much about betrayed occasional anxiety party went out hunting a before at home now felt anxious till return from chase time however not hearing thing more of indian gradually revived courage before winter be half over thought little about indeed have be ascertained by malachi from band of indian fell in with near small lake where be trapping beaver that angry snake be not in part of country have gone with band to westward at commencement of new year satisfied that enemy have left immediately after attempt have made to reconnoiter premise hunting party therefore a said continued a before indeed be necessary for supply of so many mouth percival who have grown very much since residence in canada be very anxious to be permitted to join never have be during former winter be very natural saw younger brother go out almost daily seldom return without having be successful indeed john be next to malachi best shot of party be therefore very annoying to percival that must always be detained at home doing drudgery of house such a feeding pig cleaning knife other menial work while younger brother be doing duty of man to percival repeated entreaty objection be constantly raised by mother must not spare be not accustomed to walk in snow shoe mr campbell observed that percival became dissatisfied unhappy alfred took part pleaded for alfred observed very truly that strawberry must occasionally do percival work that if must be avoided must not be cooped up at home in way that be mr campbell agreeing with alfred mr campbell very reluctantly gave consent to occasionally going out why aunt have objection to percival going out with hunter said mary must be very trying to to be always detained at home feel truth of what say dear mary said mr campbell assure be not out of selfishness because will have more work to do wish to remain with have instinctive dread that accident will happen to can not overcome there be arguing with mother fear mother love be quite a uneasy dear aunt when john first went out be continually in alarm about now be perfectly at ease replied emma very true said mr campbell be perhaps weakness on part ought to get over be liable to such feeling trust in god there be real cause for apprehension that reluctance be mere weakness folly see poor boy have long pined at being kept at home for nothing be more irksome to high couraged spirited boy a be have therefore given consent because think be duty still feeling remains so let say more about dear girl for subject be painful to dear aunt did not say that must talk to strawberry on subject of religion try if must not persuade to become christian be very serious at prayer observe appears now that understands english to be very attentive to what be said yes dear emma be intention so to do very soon like to be in too great hurry mere conforming to usage of religion must be of little avail fear that too many of good missionary in anxiety to make convert sufficiently consider point religion must proceed from conviction be seated in heart heart indeed must be changed not mere outward form attended to what be religion of indian dear aunt said mary one make conversion more difficult be in many respect so near what be right that indian easily perceive necessity of change believe in one god fountain of good believe in future state in future reward punishment perceive have same foundation a have although know not christ having very incomplete notion of duty have very insufficient sense of manifold transgression offense in god sight consequently have idea of necessity of mediator now be perhaps easier to convince who be entirely wrong such a worship idol false god than who approach so nearly to truth have have many hour of reflection upon proper course to pursue do intend to have conversation with on subject in very short time have delayed because consider absolutely necessary that must be perfectly aware of what say before try to alter belief now indian language although quite sufficient for indian want be poor have not same copiousness a ours because require word to explain what term abstract idea be therefore impossible to explain mystery of holy religion to one who doe not well understand language think however that strawberry now begin to comprehend sufficiently for to make first attempt say first attempt because have idea of making convert in week month even in six month can do be to exert best ability then trust to god who in own good time will enlighten mind to receive truth next day hunting party went out percival to great delight be permitted to accompany a have long way to go for have selected hunting ground set off early in morning before daylight mr campbell having particularly requested that must not return home late chapter xxx party have proceeded many mile before arrived at spot where malachi thought that must fall in with venison be principal game that sought be not till near ten o'clock in morning that stood on ground have be selected for sport

of tree that might not be seen by animal at last arrived at spot malachi desired then changed course eastward toward more open ground where expected to find deer a entered upon open ground moved forward crouched to ground malachi martin in advance when in hollow collected together on ascending swell of land be malachi martin who first crept up looking over summit gave notice to others to come forward be continually repeated for three four mile when martin having raised head just above swell made signal to who be below that deer be in sight after moment two reconnoitering went down informed that there be twelve thirteen head of deer scraping up snow about one hundred yard ahead of upon swell of land that appeared to be alarmed anxious a if have idea of danger being near malachi then again crawled up to make observation returned be sartin said that be flurried about something appear just a if have be hunted yet be not likely must wait let settle little find out whether other party

single handed for be so hard to kill where did ball hit said alfred here sir under shoulder well placed too must have gone quite close to heart unless hit through brain through heart be certain to make dying spring be ugly wound on shoulder will put stop to hunting for five six week expect however be well that be worse feel quite strong now replied alfred ten minute sir let john whip off skin

turned on heel walked away into forest when malachi returned to house took opportunity of communicating to alfred what have taken place after conversation agreed that must make captain sinclair who have that morning arrived from fort confidant a to what have occurred decide with upon what step must be taken captain sinclair be very much surprised equally delighted when heard that percival be still alive warmly entered into subject great question be whether must not be better to accede to term of scoundrel of indian chief observed captain sinclair be few pound of powder rifle two compared with happiness will be produced by return of percival to parent who have so long lamented a dead be not that sir replied malachi know that mr campbell must give whole store room to regain boy must consider what will be consequence if doe so one thing be certain that angry snake will not be satisfied with trifling present will ask many rifle perhaps more than have at farm powder shot in proportion for have mixed much with white people especially when french be here know how little value such thing how much love child sir in first place supply band with arm to use against at other time really make formidable in next place encourage to make other attempt to obtain similar present for will not be idle recollect sir that have in probability killed one of band when came to reconnoiter house in skin of wolf will never be forgotten revenged a soon a can be now sir if give arm ammunition will put mean of revenge in hand must not be surprised to find one day attacked by band may be overpowered by mean of rifle propose to give there be much truth much good sense in what say malachi indeed think almost at once decides point that must not consent to term then what must do to recover boy be question puzzle replied alfred for perfectly agree with malachi that must not give arm ammunition doubt if must accept of thing else sir that will not depend upon replied malachi think there be one way will give chance what then be idea malachi angry snake with band be tracking have not be too strong must have attacked murdered be clear not daring to do that have stolen percival detains to return at own price now sir young otter have come to offer to come again have given pledge of safe conduct therefore when come again must have ambush ready for make prisoner then see sir must have assistance of colonel for must be confined at fort must not well keep at farm in first place must be impossible then to withhold secret from mr mr campbell in next must have to be on look out for attack night for rescue if colonel be to know whole circumstance must assist might capture indian lad hold a hostage for master percival till must make term with angry snake like idea very much malachi replied captain sinclair if alfred agree with will acquaint colonel with whole of what have passed when return to night see if will consent to taking such step when be to meet indian malachi in three day be on saturday will be full of moon then meet at night at end of prairie nearest to fort so that there will be difficulty in doing propose without mr mr campbell being aware of

of colonel make such arrangement a may be necessary be right sir replied malachi now have to do be to keep own secret so perhaps captain sinclair have better go back to young lady for miss mary may imagine that must be something of very great importance can have detained so long from presence malachi smiled a finished remark there be good sense in observation malachi said alfred laughing come sinclair captain sinclair quitted in evening went back to fort returned at time appointed informed that colonel fully approved of plan of holding young indian a hostage that must secure in fort a soon a be brought in now do want assistance from fort surely not to capture indian lad at least so said to colonel continued captain sinclair sir want assistance a say be match if be be not strength be

be somebody coming way be behind large tree said martin see head now be too dark to make out who may be a martin said low singular sort of whistle between teeth be heard upon strawberry gently put down martin rifle with hand saying be john john impossible said alfred be replied strawberry know well that whistle go to fetch have fear strawberry stepped out from group went up to tree calling john

said malachi did not perceive that have with said captain sinclair certainly ought to have known john better john having finished supper lay down to rest one keeping watch that might not be surprised at daylight made breakfast then went down again to border of lake where trail have be lost after long examination malachi called strawberry pointing to edge of water asked to look there strawberry did so at last decided that there be mark of bottom of canoe have be grounded yes thought so said malachi have have canoe ready have crossed water now must walk quite round lake to discover trail again that will give day start of immediately set off coasting shore of lake until arrived at other side carefully examining ground a went took till noon by time have arrived at part of lake be opposite to large rock behind have kindled fire night before trace be to be perceived have not crossed over in straight line said captain sinclair be evident must now try more to northward did at last discovered that canoe have crossed over to north point of lake having coasted along eastern shore whole way spot of landing be very evident for distance must trace where canoe have be hauled up be now late in afternoon became question whether must follow trail discover place of concealment of canoe a might be advantageous to know where be when returned be decided that must first discover canoe be not done till after search of two hour when found concealed in bush about one mile from lake then followed trail about two mile twig have be bent broken a before be great help to night be now closing in having arrived at clear knoll took up quarter under tree retired to rest at daybreak again started after two hour walk have to track across small prairie gave trouble succeeded in finding trail on arrival at wood on opposite side then made very rapid progress for twig be now more frequently broken bent than before during day with bow arrow brought by strawberry martin have procured two wild turkey be very acceptable a provision must not last more than seven eight day longer be impossible to say how far must have to travel be not far from dark when quick ear of strawberry be attracted by noise like of person breathing heavily at last pointed with finger to bush advanced cautiously on other side of found indian woman lying on ground bleeding profusely raised up discovered that be indian whom have cured of sprained ankle who presumed have be then discovered breaking twig that might follow trail for on examination found that have received heavy blow on head with tomahawk fortunately have glanced sidewise not entered into brain be not sensible however at time that discovered for have lost great deal of blood stopped effusion of blood with bandage torn from linen poured water down throat be now dark be not possible to proceed further night strawberry went into wood collected herb with dressed wound having made poor indian a comfortable a must again lay down to rest not until malachi have said to alfred there be doubt sir that indian have discovered woman be marking trail for that have tomahawked for so doing have left for dead think that wound although be very ugly one be not dangerous so say strawberry however to morrow will decide point if be not sensible then will be of use waiting must go on a fast a can when awoke next morning found strawberry sitting by indian woman who be now quite sensible collected although very weak exhausted malachi martin went to have long conversation with at interval malachi have be right in supposition angry snake have discovered in act of bending twig have struck down with tomahawk gained from following information angry snake irritated at detention of young otter resolved to have hostage in lieu of have carried off mary percival have six indian with be whole of grown up warrior be now one day journey ahead of a miss percival be very sore on foot must not get along that in other respect have be well treated that indian be not going to lodge in direct course by circuitous route must make difference of at least six seven day that did that might not be seen by other tribe who be located in direct route who might give information said that be who have written indian letter malachi have received autumn before that have done because have be so kindly treated by mr mr campbell when have be found in forest with ankle sprained that percival be at indian lodge quite well when left that if angry snake did not receive large quantity of powder shot great many rifle in exchange for be intention to adopt boy a be very partial to on being asked if boy be happy replied that be not at first now be almost indian that be seldom permitted to leave lodge never unless accompanied by angry snake in answer to question a to direction distance to lodge said that be about seven day journey by straight road that party with miss percival must not arrive there in le than fifteen day if so soon a be day le able to travel having obtained information council be held spoke first having be requested so to do opinion be said malachi that can do better than remain here at present wait till woman be sufficiently recovered to travel show direct road to lodge in two three day will probably be well enough to go with then will take direct road be there before knowledge of place path will enable to lay ambush for to rescue young lady without much danger to will have idea of falling in with for of course imagine woman be dead tomahawk seldom fails after long parley advice of malachi be considered most judicious further conversation with indian woman confirmed in resolution a have fear of indian discovering that be on trail martin alfred went out in pursuit of game for provision while others raised up large hut with branch of tree for accommodation of whole party in evening martin alfred returned carrying fine buck between fire be lighted very soon be busy cooking eating indian woman also begged for something to eat recovery be now no longer considered doubtful chapter xxxviii be great annoyance to captain sinclair to have to wait in manner there be help for be satisfied that be most prudent course therefore raised objection alfred too be uneasy at delay a be aware how anxious father mother must be during whole time of absence be glad however to find that indian woman recovered rapidly on fifth day of taking up abode in forest said that be able to travel if walked slow be therefore agreed that on sixth day must start again did so having saved salt provision that might not be compelled to stop use
