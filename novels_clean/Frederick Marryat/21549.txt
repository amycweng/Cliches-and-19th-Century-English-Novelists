other man under yes replied marables hastily have be thinking jacob that may a well remain on shore till start can be of use here to have objection often went on board during fortnight that barge remained soon became very partial to marables there be kindness about that won be distressed to perceive that be often very melancholy what surprised most be to find that during first week cabin be constantly locked that marables have not key appeared so strange that a master of barge must be locked out of own cabin by inferior one day went early on board found not only cabin door open other man belonging to walking up down deck with marables be well looking tall active young man apparently not thirty with general boldness of countenance strongly contrasted with furtive glance of eye have

made silent retreat gained bed be well that have made resolution for just a be putting head below hatch drawing over scuttle door be thrown open fleming came out pondered over circumstance remark of fleming that marables have not earned more felt convinced that story told by marables relative to fleming be false conviction stimulated more than ever to discover secret many many night did watch with hope of being able to examine cabin be to purpose fleming marables be always on board continued to report to dominie have discovered agreed at last that be better must not say anything to mr drummond until there be fullest proof of nature of proceeding cabin be now sole object of thought many be scheme resolved in mind to obtain entrance fatima never coveted admission to dreadful chamber

continual cycle in feverish brain must have remained probably much longer in state of absorption have not be summoned to attend mr drummond appeared that in meantime mr hodgson have come to own sens have given own version of fracas have be to unjustifiable degree corroborated by stupid young clerk who be friend of mine who sought favour with principal walked up to drawing room where found mr mr drummond little sarah whose eye be red with cry entered without feeling of alarm breast be too full of indignation mr drummond looked grave mournful mr drummond severe jacob faithful have sent for to tell that in consequence of disgraceful conduct to senior clerk can no longer remain under roof appears that what have be witness to day have be sequel to behaviour equally improper impertinent so far from having a thought done duty have constantly neglected that association have formed with drunken old man insolent son have led into folly may say that be not wish to remain on shore that preferred being on river at age be too often case that young people consult wish rather than interest be well for if find who be older wished well to decide for have hoped to have be able to place in more

lesson be now about to receive will bring to sense of what be right that will forget evil counsel have received from late companion attempt to justify be useless mr drummond then rose left room must have replied have not be for last sentence of mr drummond again roused feeling of indignation in presence have be gradually giving way to softer emotion therefore stood still firmly met glance of mr drummond a passed look be construed into hardness of heart appeared that mr drummond have left room by previous arrangement that might not be supposed to be moved from purpose that mr drummond be then to have talked to to have ascertained how far there be chance of pleading guilty begging for mitigation of sentence firm composure of innocence be mistaken for defiance blood mounting to forehead from feeling of injustice of injustice from loved venerated perhaps most poignant feeling in existence to sensitive generous mind be falsely estimated a proceeding from impetuous disgraceful source mr drummond looked upon with mournful face sighed said nothing little sarah watching with large black eye a if must read inmost soul have nothing to say jacob at last observed mr drummond can tell mr drummond when anger be not so great nothing madam replied except will try to forgive reply be offensive even to mild mr drummond rose from chair come sarah said walked out of room wishing in kind soft voice good bye jacob a passed eye swam with tear tried to return salutation be too much choked by feeling must not speak silence be again looked upon a contumacy ingratitude little sarah still remained have not obeyed mother injunction to follow be now nearly fourteen year old have known a companion friend for five year during last six month have resided in house have become more intimately acquainted joined in evening in pursuit mr mr drummond appeared to take pleasure in intimacy loved a dear sister love be based on gratitude have never forgotten kindness to when first came under father roof long acquaintance with sweetness of disposition have rendered attachment so firm that felt must have died for never knew full extent of feeling until now be about to leave perhaps for ever heart sank when mr drummond left room bitter pang passed through a form of mr drummond vanished from sight now be to be bitterest of felt remained with handle of door in hand gasping for breath blinded with tear coursed other rapidly down cheek remained minute in state when felt that sarah touched other listless hand jacob must have said before half name be out burst into tear sobbed on shoulder heart be too much surcharged not to take infection grief found vent mingled sob with of affectionate girl when be more composed recounted to have passed one at least in world acknowledged have be treated unjustly have just finished when servant interrupted with message to sarah that mother desired presence threw into arm bade farewell released hastened to obey mother perceiving money still upon table pointed to money jacob sarah will not accept must accept of anything from who treat kindly feel more more grateful to will not accept can not must not let be left here say must not take sarah must have remonstrated perceiving be firm at same time perhaps entering into feeling again bade farewell hastened away reader may easy imagine did not put off departure hastened to pack up clothes in le than ten minute after sarah have quitted be on board lighter with old tom son who be then going to supper knew part of what have happened narrated rest well replied old tom after have finished story did know have done harm jacob be sorry that mr drummond must suppose so be fond of drop be true appeal to whether ever force on whether check boy a much a can then d 'ye see although preach practise be worst of know have to answer for making tom so fond of grog though never say anything about often think to myself that if tom must chance to be pressed of day be punished for being

if ever curse who have be so kind to replied tom taking father hand well must hope for best dear boy replied old tom jacob have not have fair play sartain be very true that master did take a orphan

history of life remark upon mother appeared to have made decided impression upon conduct be much more staid demure a remembrance wore off so did conduct become coquettish flirting a before still be impossible not to be fond of even with caprice there be such fund of real good feeling amiableness when called forth be certain to appear that often thought how dangerous captivating girl must be when grew up have again produced book have thrown aside with disgust to teach to read write improvement be rapid must have be still more so if have not be just a busy in trying to make fond of a be in surmounting difficulty of lesson be very young although a father declared be natur ' to run after men there be reason to hope that year two must render le volatile add to sterling good quality really possessed in heart feeling be modest girl although buoyancy of spirit often carried beyond bound prescribed by decorum often called forth blush upon own animated countenance when good sense remark of

must even if must permit repay for life have preserved towards felt unbounded regard towards who have ill treated unlimited hatred towards world in general mixture of feeling must hardly analyse a far a regarded love of liberty independence nothing must ever have induced to compromise a did not wish to hurt captain turnbull feeling by direct refusal to proffer of service remark upon advantage might arise generally made evasive answer when on day proposed for departure at once came to point offering everything observing that be childless therefore acceptance of offer must be injurious to nobody

be likely to be said upon such occasion shortly afterwards clothes have be sent to care of old shipmate of tom father be brought on board hardly have received when signalman reported that captain be coming off there be so many of men in frigate who have never seen captain that little anxiety be shown by ship company to ascertain how far by cut of jib be outward appearance might draw conclusion a to what might expect from one who have such unlimited power to make happy miserable be looking out of maindeck port with tom when gig pulled alongside be about to scrutinise outward visible sign of captain when be attracted by face of lieutenant sitting by side whom immediately recognised be mr wilson officer who have spun oar sunk wherry from a reader may remember rescued friend senior junior

desired first lieutenant to turn hand up men be ordered on larboard side of quarter deck a soon a be gathered together looking with a much awe on captain a flock of sheep at strange mischief meaning dog thus addressed lad a so happens that be to trust to same plank may be just a well that must understand one like to see officer attentive to duty behave a gentleman like to see men well disciplined active sober what like will have understand now continued putting on stern look now just look in face see if think can play with men looked in face saw that there be chance of playing with so expressed by countenance captain appeared satisfied by mute acknowledgment to encourage smiled showed white teeth a desired first lieutenant to pipe down a soon a scene be over walked up to mr lieutenant who be standing aft accosted perhaps sir recollect met one night when be sinking in wherry asked name recollect lad be faithful be not yes sir then entered into explanation of circumstance requested advice assistance shook head captain said be very strange person have commanding interest will do more in defiance of rule of admiralty than one in service if admiralty order came down to discharge must obey a for regulation care very little for besides sail in hour however will speak to although will probably get rap on knuckle a be business of first lieutenant not mine sir if requested first lieutenant to speak if did must not in probability men be too valuable first lieutenant know that captain must not like to discharge will therefore say nothing until be too late then throw blame upon for forgetting captain have such interest that recommendation must give commander rank to morrow must take care of however will try although can give very little hope mr wilson went up to captain who be still walking with first lieutenant touching hat introduced subject stating a apology that be acquainted with oh if man be acquaintance of yours mr wilson certainly must decide replied captain with mock politeness where be advanced tom followed stated case always like to put people out of suspense said captain because unsettles man so now hear if happened to press one of blood royal king queen little princess be to go down on knee 'd keep without admiralty order for discharge now lad do perceive chance then turning away to mr wilson said will oblige by stating upon what ground ventured to interfere in behalf of men trust explanation will be satisfactory mr knight continued to first lieutenant send men down below watch station went below by gangway ladder watched

seaman first lieutenant so decided saying that be sure that in few week there must be smarter men in ship be soon clear of channel hand be anxious to know destination in almost solitary instance have be really kept secret although surmise be correct there be one point by present arrangement invariably make known whether ship be fitting foreign for home service be by store provision ordered on board store be so arranged according to station to vessel be bound that be generally pretty well known what destination be to be be bad at same time easily remedied for if ship whether for home service foreign be ordered to fit foreign one must be able to ascertain where be about to proceed with very little trouble strict secrecy might be preserved now that navy board be abolished during

proud to refuse to follow be nearly drowned a be first lieutenant be obliged to lower cutter to pick up be brought on board confound that fellow said captain to first lieutenant be always at head of mischief follow leader indeed send tom beazeley here thought that tom be about to catch hark ye lad said captain joke joke everybody ca swim a well a ca afford to lose of men by prank so try again

little see little more of when be broad daylight at broad daylight schooner with appointment be distinctly to be made out be pierced for sixteen gun be formidable vessel to encounter with boat calm still continuing launch yawl pinnace be hoisted out manned armed schooner got out sweep be evidently preparing for reception still captain appeared unwilling to risk life of men in such dangerous conflict there lay alongside man sitting in place with oar raised on end cat paw of wind a call flew across water here there ruffling smooth surface portending that breeze must soon spring up hope of chance rendered captain undecided thus did remain alongside for tom be stationed in first second cutter until twelve o'clock when be ordered out to take hasty dinner allowance of spirit be served out at one be still calm have started when boat be first hoisted out affair must have be long before decided at last captain perceiving that chance of breeze be still smaller then than in forenoon ordered boat to shove off be still about same distance from privateer from three half to four mile in le than hour be within gun shot privateer swept broadside to commenced firing gun with single round shot with great precision ricochetted over boat at shot made sure of being struck at time slight breeze swept along water reached schooner filled sail increased distance again died away neared fast swept round again recommenced firing one of shot passed through second cutter in be stationed ripping open three of plank wounding two men beside boat heavy with gun ammunition chest etcetera immediately filled turned over with be with difficulty that must escape from weighty hamper be poured out of one of poor fellow who have not be wounded remained entangled under boat never rose again remainder of crew rose to surface clung to side of boat first cutter hauled to assistance for have separated to render shot effectual be three four minute before be able to render assistance during time other two wounded men who have be apparently injured in leg body exhausted with loss of blood gradually unloosed hold disappeared under calm blue water have received splinter in left arm held on longer than others who have be maimed must not hold on till cutter came lost recollection sank tom who be in bow of cutter perceiving go down dived after brought up again to surface be hauled in other five men be also saved a soon a be picked up cutter followed other boat continued to advance towards privateer recovered sens found that piece of one of thwart of boat broken off by shot have be forced through fleshy part of arm below elbow where still remained be very dangerous a well a painful wound officer of boat without asking laid hold of splinter tore out pain be so great from jagged form effusion of blood so excessive after operation again fainted fortunately artery be wounded must have lost arm bound up laid at bottom of boat firing from schooner be now very warm be within quarter of mile of when breeze sprang up increased distance mile there be prospect of wind from appearance of sky although for time again died away be within le than mile of privateer when perceived that frigate be bringing up smart breeze rapidly approached scene of conflict breeze swept along water caught sail of privateer be again in spite of exertion of wearied men out of gun shot first lieutenant very properly decided upon making for frigate be now within mile of in le than ten minute boat be hoisted in wind now rising fast be under sail going at rate of seven mile hour privateer having also gained breeze gallantly holding own be taken down into cockpit only wounded man brought on board surgeon examined arm at first shook head expected immediate amputation on re examination gave opinion that limb might be saved wound be dressed be put into hammock in screened bulk under half deck where cooling breeze from port fanned feverish cheek must return to chase in le than hour wind have increased so that must with difficulty carry royal privateer be holding own about three mile right head keeping three mast in one at sunset be forced to take in royal sky gave prospect of rough gale still carried on stitch of canvas frigate must bear keeping chase in sight with night glass watching motion breeze increased before morning there be heavy sea frigate must only carry top gallant sail over double reefed top sail at daylight have neared schooner by sextant about quarter of mile captain officer went down to take repose refreshment not having quitted deck for twenty four hour day did chase privateer without gaining more than mile upon now blew up furious gale topgallant sail have be before taken in top sail be close reefed be running at speed of nearly twelve mile hour still so well did privateer sail that be barely within gunshot when sun went down below horizon angry fiery red there be now great fear that must escape from difficulty of keeping glass upon during night in heavy sea expectation that must furl sail allow to pas appeared however that manoeuvre did not enter into head of captain of privateer stood on under press of sail even in day time must have be considered alarming at daylight owing to steerage during night never being so correct a during day have recovered distance be about four mile from gale if anything have increased captain maclean determined notwithstanding to shake reef out of topsail in morning a usual tom came to cot asked how be told be better in le pain that surgeon have promised to dress wound after breakfast for bandage have not be removed since have first come on board privateer tom hope will take will be comfort to that be captured think will if mast stand jacob have enormous press of sail a may guess by way in frigate jump there be standing on forecastle there be regular waterfall down in waist from forward be nearing now be beautiful to see how behaves when heel over can perceive that men be lashed on deck take whole sea into fore aft mainsail pours out again a rise from lurch deserves to escape at event did not however obtain desert for about twelve o'clock in day be within mile of at two marine be firing small arm at for must not yaw to fire at gun although be right under bow when within cable length shortened sail so a to keep at distance astern chase after having lost several men by musketry captain of waved hat in token of surrender immediately shortened sail to keep weather gage pelting until sail be lowered down then rounded to keeping under lee firing at man who made appearance on deck taking possession of be difficult task boat must hardly live in such sea when captain called aloud for volunteer heard tom voice in cutter a be lowering down heart misgave lest must meet with accident at last knew from conversation on deck that cutter have got safe on board mind be relieved surgeon came up dressed arm then received comparative bodily a well a mental relief be not until next day when lay to with schooner close to that weather became sufficiently moderate to enable to receive prisoner put own men officer on board prize proved to be american built schooner fitted out a french privateer be called cerf agile mounting fourteen gun of nearly three hundred ton measurement with crew of one hundred seventy men of forty eight be away in prize be perhaps fortunate that boat be not able to attack a must have received very warm reception thus did succeed in capturing mischievous vessel after chase of two hundred seventy mile a soon a arrangement be made shaped course with

after there be more said about matter america be not seat of war at period with exception of chasing french runner there be nothing to be done on north american station have therefore little to narrate during remainder of time be on board frigate tom did duty in foretop never be in disgrace on contrary be great favourite with officer men took more liberty with captain than one else dared to have done captain maclean knew that tom be one of foremost best men always active zealous indifferent a to danger tom knew exactly how far must venture to play with remained in clerk office a be soon discovered that have received excellent education always behaved respectfully to superior be kindly treated have reason to complain of man of war such be state of affair when other frigate arrived from honduras who have be cruising for last four month in boston bay be ordered in by cutter to join admiral at halifax have now be nearly year from england without receiving letter reader may

tom discharge be sent out by accident never reach take new station in society on arrival front gate be opened by gardener wife who made profound courtesy gardener soon afterwards made appearance hat in hand everything be neat in good order entered house a soon a possible rid myself of obsequious attention wished to be alone powerful feeling crowded on mind hastened to mr turnbull study sat down in chair so lately occupied by proud feeling of possession softened into gratitude to heaven sorrow at death came over remained for long while in deep reverie more much more be mine mentally exclaimed sailor before mast waterman on river charity boy orphan sits down in quiet possession of luxury wealth what have done to deserve heart told nothing if anything be almost valueless poured forth soul in thanks to heaven felt more composed after have performed duty thought then dwelt upon benefactor surveyed room drawing fur skin harpoon other instrument remaining in respective place a when last have interview with mr turnbull remembered kindness singleness of heart honesty good sense real worth shed many tear for loss thought then passed to sarah drummond felt much uneasiness on score must receive must still remember what have be recollected kindness good will towards weighed present condition against origin former occupation must not ascertain how scale might turn will soon see thought to morrow even may decide question gardener wife knocked at door announced that bed be prepared went to sleep dreaming of sarah young tom dominie mary stapleton be up early next morning hastened to hotel when having arranged person to best of power at same time never so little to satisfaction proceeded to house of mr drummond knocked time be not desired to wait in hall be immediately ushered up into drawing room sarah drummond be sitting alone at drawing name be announced a entered started from chair blushed deeply a moved towards joined hand in silence be breathless with emotion never have appeared so beautiful party appeared willing to break silence at last faltered out miss drummond then stopped mr faithful replied then after break how very silly be ought to have congratulated upon safe return upon good fortune indeed mr faithful one can do so more sincerely miss drummond replied confused when be orphan charity boy waterman called jacob if alteration in prospect induces to address in so formal manner if be in future to be on such different term can only say that wish be again jacob faithful waterman nay replied recollect that be own choice to be waterman might have be different very different might at time have be partner with father for said so last night when be talking about refused threw away education talent good quality from foolish pride considered independence father almost humbled to not that be ever humiliating to acknowledge attempt to repair fault still did more than must be expected from most people friend persuaded rejected advice what be still more unpardonable even have influence over a long a punished did not upbraid now that have be so fortunate tell plainly what that be more than deserve be have said truth miss drummond be very proud very foolish have repented of folly long before be pressed candidly acknowledge that merit good fortune have met with can say more be satisfied with repentance acknowledgment so now may sit down make agreeable before do allow to ask a address a mr faithful how be to address must not wish to be considered impertinent name be miss drummond who feel intimate with call sarah may reply that name be faithful who feel intimate with call jacob very true allow to observe that show very little tact must never force lady into corner if appear affronted when call sarah then will do wise to fall back upon miss drummond why do fix eye upon so earnestly can not help must beg pardon be so improved in appearance since last saw thought one must be more perfect well be not bad beginning jacob like to hear of perfection now follow up hardly know what be going to say think be feel a if ought can address otherwise than a miss drummond oh have thought better of have well begin to think that look so well in present dress have become so very different person ought not to address by other name than mr faithful so now be agreed be not what mean to say well then let know what did mean to say puzzling question fortunately did not require answer for mr drummond came into room extended hand dear jacob said in most friendly manner be delighted to see back again to have pleasure of congratulating on

remainder in progress still be so late when have accomplished have time to dress on return mr drummond received with usual kindness narrated during evening adventure since parted took opportunity to acknowledge to mr drummond how bitterly have repented folly may add ingratitude towards jacob said a be sitting at tea table with mr drummond sarah knew at time that be toiling on river for shilling that be inheritor of thousand for not only witnessed read will of mr turnbull thought best that must have lesson must never forget in after life there be such thing in world a independence unless in savage state in society be mutually dependent upon other independence of mind may have more a waterman be dependent upon customer a poor man must be upon who have more mean in refusing offer be obliged to apply for employment to others rich be a entirely dependent upon others a poor depend upon for food clothes necessity luxury such ever will be case in society more refined society may be more civilised part greater be mutual dependence still be error originating in from high feeling therefore must be considered a error on right side recollect how much might have thrown away have not in first place secured friend a mr turnbull secondly if death of friend have not so soon put in possession be too ready to acknowledge truth of remark evening passed away so rapidly that be midnight before rose to take leave returned to hotel a happy in mind a grateful a ever mortal must possibly be next day removed to house left by mr turnbull first order gave be for wherry such be force of habit must not do without one half time be spent upon river pulling day down to mr drummond returning in evening late at night thus passed away two month during occasionally saw dominie stapletons old
