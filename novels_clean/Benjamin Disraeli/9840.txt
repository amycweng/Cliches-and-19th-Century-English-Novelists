sir berdmore vivian be invited to dine with marquess alone in library there be abundance of dumb waiter other invention by ease of guest might be consulted without risking even secret look to gaze of liveried menial marquess gentleman sat in ante chamber in case human aid might be necessary everything a lordship averred be on same system a cabinet dinner in ancient kingdom of england hath ever be custom to dine previously to transacting business habit be one of few be not contingent upon mutable fancy of fashion at day see cabinet dinner vestry dinner alike proving correctness of assertion whether custom really expedites completion general progress of business give rise to be grave question feel qualified to decide certain be that very often after dinner appointment be made for transaction of business on following morning at same time must be remembered that have not be for opportunity banquet afforded of developing convivial quality of guest drawing out by assistance of generous wine most kindly sentiment most engaging feeling be very probable that appointment for transaction of business must never have be made at there certainly be appearance that great business a marquess styled must not be very much advanced by cabinet dinner at chteau desir for in first place table be laden with delicacy of season really when man be either going to talk sense fight duel make will nothing must be seen at dinner save cutlet lightest bordeaux in second place must be confessed that when came to point of party interested meeting marquess courage somewhat misgave not that

passed present state of party marquess continued have doubtless for long time engaged attention be very peculiar although result have be gradually arrived at be nevertheless now that be realised startling not apprehend very satisfactory there be few distinction now between two side of house of common very different from time in most believe of lord gentleman be member of assembly question then naturally arises why certain body of individual who now represent opinion must arrogate to entire government control of country second question must occur how contrive to succeed in such assumption succeed clearly because party who placed in power because represented certain opinion still continue to support of most influential member of party be bold to say may be found in room dont know if borough of lord courtown lord beaconsfield be withdrawn at critical division what might be result be quite sure that if forty country gentleman who follow believe be justified in saying friend sir berdmore wisely follow be to declare opposition to particular tax present men must be beaten a have be beaten before be member of government when so beaten know what lord liverpool said next morning lord liverpool said next morning forty country gentleman if choose might repeal tax in budget under circumstance lord gentleman becomes in opinion to consider situation be far from wishing to witness general change indeed very wide reconstruction of present administration think interest of country require that general tenor of system must be supported there be member of administration whose claim to distinction appear to more than questionable while at same time there be individual excluded personage of great influence recognised talent who ought longer in opinion to occupy position in background mr vivian grey gentleman whom have honour to call particular friend who believe have have already pleasure of incidentally conversing with on matter to have referred have given great attention to important subject be younger man than of certainly have much better lung than have will take liberty therefore of requesting to put case in completeness before great deal of

mr grey in principle have developed for own part be free to confess that have perfect confidence in gentleman very brilliant ability augured from exertion complete triumphant success at same time felt duty to remark to lordship also to gentleman that house of common be new scene to put whether be quite convinced that be sufficiently strong a regarded talent in assembly must not take upon to offer to become leader of party mr grey might be capable of undertaking that charge still must be remembered that in assembly be a yet untried made apology to mr grey for speaking mind so freely be sure that motif must not be misinterpreted if lordship on whole be of opinion that charge must be entrusted to sir berdmore having greatest confidence in mr grey ability must certainly support to utmost can do anything said marquess be surprising clever man said lord courtown be surprising clever man echoed lord beaconsfield stop lord said vivian good opinion deserves gratitude important matter do indeed require moment consideration trust sir berdmore scrope doe not imagine that be vain idiot to be offended at most excellent remark even for moment be not met here for common good to consult for

england be ashamed of having spoken so much about so little about for whom be more interested so far a can judge have cause at present for uneasiness with regard to mr st george may perhaps have observed that be not very intimate therefore can not speak with precision a to state of fortune have reason to believe that be by mean unfavourable a for baron yes yes hardly know what be to infer from observation respecting certainly must infer something extremely bad be not conscious that after experience of five week for one have nothing to complain of baron certainly be fond of play play high indeed have not have equal fortune at new house a at redoute at least imagine so for have given cause to believe in way that be loser if must only understand relief feel at moment be sure must not wonder that prevailed upon to speak to may still be in power however to prevent evil yes certainly think best course now must be to speak to frankly respecting von konigstein if be aware of

exempted from failing of young men led dissipated life be very young a unlike most relation never allowed conduct on part to banish from society trusted that contrast own family afforded to usual companion must in time render habit le irregular have now known baron von konigstein for upwards of year half intimately nothing have transpired during period to induce mr trevor to alter opinion have entertained of from first believed to be man of honour in spite of few imprudence of principle might have be own opinion of at period have reason to doubt natural goodness of disposition though must not hope that be one who must assist in plan for reformation of augustus still be not sorry to believe that in baron must at least find companion very different from unprincipled selfish being by whom be too often surrounded something occurred at time placed baron von konigstein according to own declaration under lasting obligation to myself in warmth of heart asked if there be real important

not for moment doubted guilt still be weak enough to consider that desire to become reconciled to be at least evidence of repentant heart neapolitan story deceived actuated by feeling acting a thought

long great deal of wine be drunk more than most of party present for long time have be accustomed to about eight oclock chevalier proposed going to redoute baron objected let have evening altogether

conquered principality of little lilliput other adjoining land margraviate of reisenburg with increased territory population governed with consummate wisdom began to be considered most flourishing of petty state in quarter of empire to belonged on contrary princely patriotic friend mortified by degenerate condition of country prosperity of rival house quitted little lilliput became one of emigrant prince who abounded during first year of revolution in northern court of europe napoleon soon appeared upon stage vanquished austria with french dictating at gate of capital be longer in condition to support dignity of empire policy of margrave of reisenburg be a little patriotic quite a consistent a before beckendorff became constant favoured counsellor of french emperor be chiefly by exertion that celebrated confederation of rhine be carried into effect institution of body excited among many german at time loud expression of indignation believe few impartial judicious men now look upon league a other than one in formation of consummate statesmanship be exhibited in fact prevented subjugation of germany to france by flattering pride of napoleon saved decomposition of empire how might be be not at present necessary for to enquire certain be that pupil of beckendorff be amply repaid for advice exertion of master minister when napoleon fell brow of former margrave be encircled with grand ducal crown duchy while contained upwards of million half of inhabitant numbered in limit of most celebrated city in germany many of germany most flourishing province napoleon fell prince of little lilliput companion in patriotism misfortune returned from exile panting with hope vengeance congress be held to settle affair of agitated germany where be grand duke of reisenburg hard earned crown tottered on head where be crafty minister supporter of revolutionary france friend of imperial enslaver constant enemy of house of austria at very congress according to expectation of exiled prince be to restore to own dominion to reward patriotic loyalty with territory of revolutionary brother yes at very congress be beckendorff not a suppliant not a victim seated at right hand of metternich watching with parental affection first interesting infantile movement of most prosperous of political bantlings holy alliance may well imagine that military grand duke have much better chance in political negotiation than emigrant prince in addition to grand duke of reisenburg have married during war princess of powerful house allied sovereign be eager to gain future aid constant co operation of mind like beckendorffs prince of little lilliput patriot be rewarded for conduct by being restored to forfeited possession next day became subject of former enemy grand duke of reisenburg traitor what think of monsieur beckendorff one of most interesting character have long heard of pupil appears to be man of mind will hear must however first mention that while beckendorff have not scrupled to resort to measure adopt opinion in order to further interest of monarch country have in manner shown that personal aggrandisement have never be object life in retirement scarcely with attendant moderate official stipend amply support more moderate expenditure subject of grand duke may well be grateful that have minister without relation without favourite grand duke be unquestionably man of talent at same time perhaps one of most weak minded men that ever breathed be fortunate in meeting with beckendorff early in life a influence of minister have not for moment ceased over mind of monarch to world grand duke of reisenburg have always appeared to be individual of strong mind consistent conduct when have lived a much a intimately in court a have done will find how easily world may be deceived since close connection now exists between reisenburg austria took place beckendorff have in great degree revived ancient privilege of blood birth minister who have sprung from people will always conciliate aristocracy having family influence of own endeavour to gain influence of others often happens that merit be never le considered than when merit have made minister curious instance of occurs in neighbouring state there premier decidedly man of great talent be of a humble origin a beckendorff with family to uphold support by lavish division of place patronage of state among noble if younger son brother of peer dare to sully oratorical virginity by chance observation in lower chamber minister real orator immediately rise to congratulate in pompous phrase house country on splendid display have made night memorable on decided advantage must accrue to own resolution national interest from future participation of noble friend in deliberation about be young noble quite unfit for discharge of respective duty private secretary be unable to coin sentence almost to direct letter be noble secondary official can not be trusted even in least critical conjuncture be noble prime minister of powerful empire be forced to rise early be up late not to meditate on present fortune future destiny of country by personal exertion to compensate for inefficiency expiate blunder of underling whom unfortunate want of blood have forced to overwhelm with praise deserve duty can not discharge wish to infer that policy of beckendorff have be actuated by feeling influence minister whom have noticed from whose conduct in very respect own materially differs on contrary connection with austria be in probability primary great cause however may be certain be that office about court connected with army need not remind that at small german court situation be often most important in state can only be filled by nobility can person who have misfortune of not inheriting magical monosyllable von before name shibboleth of nobility symbol of territorial pride violate by unhallowed presence sanctity of court dinner a sacred ceremony of noble fte while monopoly of office for due performance require only showy exterior schooled address be granted to noble state charge require exercise of intellect be now chiefly filled by bourgeoisie at same time however that secretary of state many of privy councillor war councillor forest councillor finance councillor be to be reckoned among second class still not one of exalted individual who from situation be necessarily in constant personal communication with sovereign ever see that sovereign except in cabinet council chamber beckendorff premier be son of peasant of course not noble nobility have be proffered not only by own monarch by most of sovereign of europe have invariably refused consequently never appears at court truth be that from disposition be little inclined to mix with men have taken advantage of want of escutcheon completely to exempt from duty of etiquette exalted situation must otherwise have imposed upon none can complain of haughtiness of noble when ostensibly minister be not exempted from exclusive regulation if go to reisenburg will not therefore see beckendorff who life a have mentioned in solitude about thirty mile from capital communicating only with royal master foreign minister one two official character of own country be inmate of court for upwards of two year during time never saw minister with exception of member of royal family character have mentioned never knew one person who have even caught glimpse of individual who may indeed be said to be regulating destiny be at court then continued mr sievers when be no longer under control of beckendorff in minor point be not subjected to management influenced by mind of minister that true character of grand duke be to be detected indeed may really be said that weakness of mind have be origin of fortune in early youth pliant temper adapted without struggle to barbarous custom brutal conduct of father court same pliancy of temper prevented opposing with bigoted obstinacy exertion of relation to educate civilise same pliancy of temper allowed to become ready enthusiastic disciple of beckendorff have pupil when ascended throne left master behind be very probable that natural feeling must have led to oppose french at moment instead of being first of second rate power of germany grand duke of reisenburg might have be mediatised prince a be same pliancy of temper have noticed enabled to receive napoleon when emperor with outstretched arm at moment doe not prevent from receiving with equal rapture imperial archduchess who will soon be on road from vienna to espouse son for to crown career beckendorff have successfully negotiated marriage between daughter of house of austria crown prince of reisenburg be generally believed that next step of diet will be to transmute father grand ducal coronet into regal crown perhaps good sir before reach vienna may have supreme honour of being presented to majesty king of reisenburg when talk only of pupil pliancy of temper be to suppose that in mentioning talent be speaking ironically by mean grand duke be scholar man of refined taste patron of fine art lover of literature promoter of science what world must call philosopher judgment be sound generally correct power of discrimination acute knowledge of mankind greater than of most sovereign with advantage be cursed with wavering indecisive temper that when be usually case have come to right conclusion can never prevail upon to carry theory into practice with acuteness discernment knowledge of world mind be always ready to receive impression from person who last address though be fully aware of inferiority of adviser intellect to own imperfection of adviser knowledge never for moment out of sight of royal pupil have made admirable political puppet since talent have always enabled to understand part minister have forced to perform thus world have given grand duke credit not only for possession of great talent almost for a much firmness of mind decision of character a minister since long agitated career have become calm tranquil beckendorff like guardian spirit have ceased to be ever at elbow character of grand duke of reisenburg begin to be understood court have be still be frequented by men of genius in germany who be admitted without scruple even if be not noble astonishing thing be that grand duke be always surrounded by specie of political philosophical quack that can imagine discussion on free press on reformation of criminal code on abolition of commercial duty such like interminable topic be perpetually resounding within palace of arbitrary prince people fired by representation of literary political journal with reisenburg abounds whose bold speculation on subject elude vigilance of censor by being skilfully amalgamated with lavish praise of royal character be perpetually flattered with speedy hope of becoming freeman suddenly when be expecting grant of charter institution of chamber mr beckendorff ride up from retreat to residence next day whole crowd of philosopher be swept from royal presence censorship of press becomes so severe that for moment must fancy that reisenburg instead of being a boast modern athens have more right to title of modern boeotia people who enjoy impartial administration of equal law who have flourished be flourishing under wise moderate rule of new monarch have in fact inclination to exert for attainment of constitutional liberty in other way than by voice barbarous apathy astounds philosopher who in despair when people tell that be happy contented artfully remind that happiness depends on will of single man that though present character of monarch may guarantee present felicity still must think of child not le exert for insurance of future representation a constantly reiterated a present system will allow have at length produced effect political cause of peculiar nature combining influence with philosophical exertion have of late frequently frightened grand duke who in despair must perhaps grant constitution if beckendorff must allow minister be conscious that people must not be happier in fact require one look with jealous evil eye on charlatanism of kind be now so prevalent at court know from character of many of philosopher patriot that private interest be generally secret spring of public virtue that if grand duke moved by entreaty seduced by flattery be to yield little must soon be obliged to grant to demand threat finally beckendorff have of late year so completely interwoven policy of reisenburg with of austria that feel that rock on have determined to found greatness of country must be quitted for ever if yield one jot to caprice weakness of monarch beckendorff said vivian why can not crush in bud noxious plant so much dread why doe press speak in least to people why be grand duke surrounded by others except pompous grand marshal empty headed lord chamberlain be surprised at indifference want of energy dear sir there be reason for thing rest assured that beckendorff be not man to act incautiously weakly grand duchess mother of crown prince have be long dead beckendorff who a man have greatest contempt for woman a statesman look to a most precious of political instrument be wish to have married grand duke to young princess who be now destined for son for once in life failed in influencing pupil truth be be to cause that must trace present disorganised state of court indeed of duchy that grand duke have secretly married lady to whom have long be attached lady be countess subject a be impossible by law of kingdom that one member of reigning family must be allowed to share throne royal highness have recourse to plan be not uncommon in country espoused lady with left hand ceremony call here morganatic

by what magic spell exercise such influence over conduct of husband at first beckendorff treated circle of illuminati with contemptuous silence in politics nothing be contemptible minister knowing that people be prosperous happy cared little for projected constitution le for metaphysical abstraction circumstance have lately occurred imagine have convinced that for once have miscalculated after arrangement of german state when prince be first mediatised attempt be made by mean of threatening league to obtain for political victim very ample share of power patronage of new state of reisenburg plan failed from lukewarmness indecision of good friend of little lilliput who between ourselves be prevented from joining alliance by intrigue of beckendorff beckendorff secretly took measure that prince must be promised that in case of keeping backward must obtain more than must fall to lot by leading van prince of little lilliput peculiar friend accordingly be quiet attempt of other chieftain failed be then that highness found that have be duped beckendorff must not acknowledge authority of course did not redeem pledge of agent effect that affair produced upon prince mind can conceive since then have never frequented reisenburg constantly resided at former capital now provincial town of grand duchy at castle viewed may suppose with very cordial feeling by companion in misfortune thirst of revenge will inscribe bitterest enemy in same muster roll prince incited by bold carriage of madame carolina philosophical protgs induced to believe that beckendorffs power be on wane have again made overture to friend without whose powerful assistance feel that have little chance of success observe how much more men conduct be influenced by circumstance than principle when person

of others so far therefore a clamour can support prince have people on side a upwards of three hundred thousand of grand ducal subject be still living on estate still consider a serf trust that excess from great body may incite rest of people to similar outrage natural disposition of mankind to imitation particularly when act to be imitated be popular deserves attention court be divided for

to whose interest a reward for whose service princely friend be sacrificed by minister have now become pupil in school of modern philosophy drivel out with equal ignorance fervour enlightened notion on most obscure subject in midst of confusion grand duke be timorous dubious uncertain beckendorff have difficult game to play may fall at last such dear sir be tremendous consequence of weak prince marrying blue stocking crown prince mr sievers how doe conduct at interesting moment be mind so completely engrossed by anticipation of imperial alliance that have thought for anything approaching bride crown prince dear sir be thinking of bride of anything else be hunch backed idiot of deformity have be witness though be difficult to give opinion of intellect of being with whom have never interchanged syllable nevertheless countenance doe not contradict common creed say common creed mr grey for there be moment when crown prince of reisenburg be spoken of by future subject in very different manner whenever unpopular act be committed unpopular plan suggested by court grand duke then whisper be immediately afloat that future brutus must be looked for in prince then be generally understood that idiocy be only assumed what woman doe not detect in glimmering of lack lustre eye vivid spark of suppressed genius in short time cloud blow over court dissatisfaction disappears moment that monarch be again popular unfortunate crown prince again becomes uninfluential object of pity derision immediately forget that idiocy be only assumed what woman ever cease from deploring unhappy

situation speaking a father unfortunately be not must not view with disgust lot in life necessarily make son enemy crown prince of country be only puppet in hand of people to be played against own father chapter v prince returned home at late hour immediately enquired for vivian during dinner hastily despatched did not escape hero attention that highness be unusually silent indeed agitated when have finished meal good friend at length said prince very much wish to consult with on most important business since explanation of last night prince in private conversation have dropped regal plural be ready at once said vivian will think strange mr grey when become acquainted with nature of communication will justly consider most strange most singular must choose for confidant counsellor in important business gentleman with whom have be acquainted so short time a sir have well weighed at least have endeavoured well to weigh circumstance contingency confidence must involve result of reflection be will look to a friend adviser feeling assured that from situation disposition temptation exists can induce to betray to deceive though prince said with appearance of perfect sincerity stopped looked earnest in guest face a if must read secret thought be desirous of now giving opportunity of answering so far a certainty of confidence being respected answered vivian trust highness may communicate to with most assured spirit while ignorance of men affair in country will ensure from treachery on part very much fear that will also preclude from affording advantageous advice assistance on head replied prince be of course best judge friend whom need be man not ignorant of world with cool head impartial mind though young have said told enough to prove that be not unacquainted with mankind of courage have already have convincing proof in business in require assistance freedom from national prejudice will materially increase value of advice therefore be far from being unwilling to consult person ignorant according to own phrase of men affair in country moreover education a englishman have early led to exercise mind on political subject be in political business require aid be fated always to be dry nurse of embryo faction thought vivian watched earnestly countenance of prince in moment expected to be invited to become counsellor of leagued prince lamp be burning dim blazing wood fire have suddenly died away mist be over vivians eye for moment almost imagined that be sitting opposite old friend marquis of carabas prince phrase have given rise to thousand agonising association in instant vivian have worked up mind to pitch of nervous excitement political business said vivian in agitated voice must not address more unfortunate person have seen prince too much of politics ever to wish to meddle with again be too quick good friend continued highness may wish to consult on political business yet have intention of engaging in politics indeed be quite ridiculous idea see be right in supposing that subject have engaged attention have seen in short time something of political world answered vivian who be almost ashamed of previous emotion thank heaven daily have chance of again having connection with well well that a may be nevertheless experience be only inducement to to request assistance fear that wish to embroil in politics hope will not refuse although almost stranger to add to great obligation be already under to give benefit of opinion highness may speak with perfect unreserve reckon upon delivering genuine sentiment have not forgotten venture to believe said prince short conversation of last night be of too interesting nature easily to escape memory before can consult on subject at present interest be necessary must make little acquainted with present state of public affair here character of principal individual who control so far a account of present state of political party history of grand duke career that of minister mr beckendorff reputed character will form part of highness narrative by so much may length be curtailed trouble lessened for have at different time picked up in casual conversation great deal of information on topic indeed may address in respect a must german gentleman who not being personally interested in public life be of course not acquainted with most secret detail did not reckon on said prince in cheerful voice be great advantage reason must no longer hesitate to develop to certain affair now occupies mind to be short continued prince be of letter so mysteriously received last night a must have remarked very much agitated be on letter wish to consult bearing in mind exact position avowed public position in stand a connected with court having due acquaintance state have with character of mr beckendorff what think of letter so saying prince leant over table handed to vivian following epistle to highness prince of little lilliput be commanded by royal highness to inform highness that royal highness have considered request be signed by highness other nobleman presented by to royal highness in private interview royal highness command to state that request will receive most attentive consideration at same time royal highness also command to observe in bringing about completion of result desired by party be difficult to carry on necessary communication merely by written document royal highness have therefore commanded to submit to highness advisability of taking step in order to further possibility of occurrence of oral interchange of sentiment of respective party being aware from position highness have thought proper at present to maintain from other cause be of too delicate nature to be noticed in other way except by allusion that highness may feel difficulty in personally communicating with royal highness without consulting wish opinion of other prince process to must be evident to highness royal highness feel impossible to submit at same time desirous of forwarding progress of view royal highness highness may conjunctively consider calculated to advance well being of state have to submit to highness propriety of considering proposition contained in enclosed paper if highness keep unconnected with communication purport of letter will be confined to highness proposition st that interview will take place between highness object of will be consideration of measure by when adopted various interest now in agitation will respectively be regarded nd that interview will be secret highness be incognito if highness be disposed to accede to first proposition beg to submit to that from nature of residence situation other cause there will be fear that suspicion of fact of mr von philipson acceding to two proposition will gain notoriety letter will be delivered into own hand if mr von philipson determine on acceding to proposition be most probably aware of general locality in residence be situated proper measure will be taken that if mr von philipson with visit will not be under necessity of attracting attention by inquiring way to house be wished that fact of second proposition being acceded to must only be known to mr von philipson if to be perfectly unattended be considered a insuperable objection consent to being accompanied by single friend will be alone beckendorff well said prince a vivian finished letter best person said vivian to decide upon highness consenting to interview be be not point on wish to have benefit of opinion for have already consented rode over morning to cousin duke of micromegas despatched from residence trusty messenger to beckendorff have agreed to meet to morrow on express term must not be unattended now then continued prince with great energy now then will be companion said vivian yes good friend must consider a safe if be sleeping in burning house a must be be with beckendorff alone although be not first time that have communicated have never yet seen be fully aware that if approaching interview be known to friend must consider high time that son reigned in stead be resolved to be firm to be inflexible course be plain be not to be again duped by continued prince much confused will not conceal have be once said vivian what good can possibly do appears to that if beckendorff be to be dreaded a describe presence attendance of friend can possibly save from crafty plan surely if one attend why not be accompanied by person whom have known long who know well on whom can confidently rely who may be aware from thousand sign circumstance will never attract attention at what particular pressing moment may require prompt energetic assistance such be companion want surely such one may find in arnelm von neuwied arnelm von neuwied said prince best hand at sounding bugle spearing boar in reisenburg excellent men forsooth to guard master from diplomatic deceit of wily beckendorff be to have even slightest suspicion of intended movement must commit rank treason out of pure loyalty lock up in own cabinet will never do want companion of experience knowledge of world with whom may converse with prospect of finding wavering firmness strengthened misled judgment rightly guided puzzled brain cleared mode of assistance to worthy jagd junker be little accustomed however quickly might hasten to side in combat chase if then will not do surely there be one man in castle who although may not be match for beckendorff can be foiled by few others mr sievers said vivian with inquiring eye sievers exclaimed prince with great eagerness very man firm experienced sharp witted well schooled in political learning in case required assistance in arranging term of intended charter plan of intended chamber for of course be point on beckendorff wish to consult one thing be determined on positively pledge to nothing while under beckendorffs roof doubtless anticipates by visit to grant liberty of people on own term perhaps mr beckendorff for once in life may be mistaken be not to be deceived twice be determined not to yield point of treasury being under control of senate be part of harness gall to preserve from rather inconvenient regulation without question good friend beckendorff have hit upon plan then mr sievers will accompany asked vivian calling prince attention to point of consultation very man for dear friend although beckendorff most probably respecting presence taking into consideration circumstance under meet must refrain from consigning sievers to dungeon still although minister invite interview although have single inducement to conciliate yet must scarcely be correct scarcely dignified on part to prove by presence of companion have for length of time harboured individual who by beckendorffs own exertion be banished from grand duchy must look too much like bravado oh said vivian be so pray of what be mr sievers guilty of high treason against one who be not sovereign how be that sievers who be man of considerable talent be for long time professor in one of great university publication of many able work procured reputation induced madame carolina to use exertion to gain attendance at court courtier in time professor became at reisenburg mr sievers be great authority on subject philosophical literary political in fact be fashion at head of great literary journal be there published terrified admiring germany with profound piquant critique unfortunately like men a good be unaware that reisenburg be not independent state so on occasion of austria attacking naples mr sievers took opportunity of attacking austria article eloquent luminous profound revealed dark colour of austrian policy a artist lamp brings out murky tint of spagnoletto one admired sievers bitter sarcasm enlightened view indignant eloquence madame carolina crowned with laurel in midst of coterie be said that grand duke sent snuff box in short time article reached vienna in still shorter time mr beckendorff reached residence insisted on author being immediately given up to austrian government madame carolina be in despair grand duke in doubt beckendorff threatened to resign if order be not signed kind friend perhaps royal highness gave sievers timely notice by rapid flight reached castle demanded hospitality have lived here ever since have done thousand service not least of be education have given son glorious maximilian beckendorff asked vivian have always be aware that sievers be concealed here can not answer have be be not improbable that must have winked at since never have be policy unnecessarily to annoy mediatised prince without great occasion to let feel that independence be gone will not with such son a have say for ever mr sievers of course then can not visit beckendorff said vivian be clear said prince therefore trust now will no longer refuse first request be impossible for vivian to deny prince longer indeed have objection a highness must not be better attended to seize singular unexpected opportunity now offered of becoming acquainted with individual respecting whom curiosity be much excited be late hour ere prince friend retired having arranged

management motion of bow exquisite a be tone enchanting a be originality of variation perfect harmony of composition be nevertheless extremely difficult to resist smiling at contortion of face figure now body bending to strain be at one moment with violin raised in air next instant with lower nut almost resting upon foot at length by well proportioned degree air died away into original soft cadence player becoming completely entranced in own performance finished by sinking back on sofa with bow violin raised over head vivian must not disturb by applause instant after mr beckendorff throwing down instrument rushed through open window into garden a soon a beckendorff be out of sight vivian looked at prince highness elevating eyebrow screwing up mouth shrugging shoulder altogether presented comical picture of puzzled man well dear friend said be rather different from what expected very different much more amusing humph said prince slowly think exactly requires ghost to tell that mr beckendorff be not in habit of going to court know how be accustomed to conduct when be honoured by visit from grand duke be quite sure that a regard treatment of myself to say least incognito

growing childish surely must not always have be frivolous creature be really so astonished said vivian that be quite out of power to assist highness in supposition must recommend not to be too hasty in movement take care that staying here doe not affect position have taken up retard progress of measure on have determined be safe what will injure if with chance of achieving great patriotic purpose to have devoted power energy be subjected for few hour to caprice even rudeness of man if beckendorff be character world give credit to be think can imagine that be to be deceived twice if do imagine so be convinced that will be disappointed if a have supposed not only power be on wane intellect also four twenty hour will convince of fact for in le than time highness will necessarily have conversation of more important nature with recommend therefore that continue here to day although added vivian smiling have to sleep in observatory after walking in garden about hour prince vivian

crossing passing through gate found in rural road whose lofty hedge row rich with variety of wild fruit flower animated with cheering presence of busy bird chirping from bough spray altogether presented scene reminded of soft beauty of own country with men to remember be to be sad unfortunately for vivian grey there be few object with did not give rise to association of painful nature strange occurrence of last few day have recalled if not revived feeling of boyhood early career flitted across mind must have stifled remembrance with sigh man be slave of memory for moment mused over power then shuddering shrank from wearing anxiety consuming care eternal vigilance constant contrivance agonising suspense distracting vicissitude of past career ala be nature to sicken from birth after object of unattainable felicity to struggle through freshest year of life in insane pursuit after indefinite good doe not even exist sure quick be dark hour cool doting frenzy in frigid wave of ocean of oblivion dream of immortality until die ambition at thy proud fatal altar whisper secret of mighty thought breathe aspiration of inexpressible desire clouded flame lick up offering of ruined soul sacrifice vanishes in sable smoke of death where be thought wandering have forgotten day of darkest despair there have happened to have happened to other man be roused from reverie by sound of trotting horse looked up winding road prevented at first from seeing steed evidently be approaching sound came nearer nearer at length turning corner mr beckendorff came in sight be mounted on strong built rough ugly pony with obstinate mane defying exertion of groom fell in equal division on side of bottle neck large white face combined with blinking vision have earned for euphonious title of

country life said beckendorff most men be suppose have innate objection to live occasionally in city few have probably have known long not long enough to wish acquaintance at end hum proceeded in silence for moment then beckendorff again turned round time with direct question wonder if mr von philipson can make convenient to honour with company day can tell think best person to inform of must be highness said vivian using friend title purposely to show mr beckendorff how ridiculous considered present use of incognito think so sir do answered beckendorff sarcastically have now arrived at

hostility vivian took seat at breakfast table beckendorff stood conversing with with back to fireplace occasionally during pause of conversation pulling string of violin with finger did not escape

meal left prince beckendorff alone determined that presence must not be occasion of minister longer retarding commencement of business prince who by private glance have be prepared for departure immediately took opportunity of asking mr beckendorff in decisive tone whether might flatter that must command present attention to subject of importance mr beckendorff said that be always at mr von philipsons service drawing chair opposite prince mr beckendorff now sat on side of fireplace hem said prince clearing throat looked at mr beckendorff who sat with heel close together toe out square hand resting on knee a well a elbow be turned out shoulder bent head reclined eye glancing hem said prince of little lilliput in compliance mr beckendorff with wish developed in communication received

innovation professor of revolutionary doctrine passage of roman author in question ancient charter of emperor charlemagne be consider decisive sufficient precedent for measure have thought proper to sanction by approval to support by influence minister mr beckendorff must take care that in great race of politics mind of countryman leave own behind must never forget power capability of man on very

destruction of great kingdom mentioned in bible many other state besides greece rome carthage c thus ended peroration of harangue consisting of incoherent arrangement of imperfectly remembered fact

hubert can not find out where steed be what will do vivian did not answer what be thinking of continued highness why dont answer highness must not go said vivian shaking head not go why so depend upon be wrong about beckendorff that be humorist there be doubt appears to to be equally clear that queer habit singular mode of life be not of late adoption what be now must have be ten perhaps twenty year perhaps more of there be thousand proof about a to overpowering cause have made character appears at present be needle for to inquire probably incident in private life in likelihood connected with mysterious picture let be satisfied with effect if case be a state in private life habit beckendorff must have be equally incomprehensible equally singular at very time that in public capacity be producing such brilliant result a at present moment now then can believe to be insane anticipate objection know will enlarge upon evident absurdity of inviting political opponent to house for grave consultation on most important affair then treating a have done when must be clear to that can not be again duped when must feel that be to amuse for a many week a have day plan position must not be injuriously affected be so probably humorist like beckendorff can not even in most critical moment altogether restrain bent of capricious inclination however dear prince will lay stress upon point opinion indeed conviction be that beckendorff act from design have considered conduct well have observed that have seen more than have seen keenly depend upon that since assented to interview beckendorff have be obliged to shift intended position for negotiation of machinery have gone wrong fearful if have postponed visit must imagine that be only again amusing consequently must listen to

must have be too late for breakfast have not be recalled to myself by approach of horseman be beckendorff covered with dust mud horse have be evidently hard ridden did not think much of at time because supposed might have be out for three four hour hard worked nevertheless be struck by appearance when mentioned that went out riding at late hour last night immediately occurred to that have come home at one two oclock be not very probable that must have gone out again at four five have doubt that conjecture be correct beckendorff have be to reisenburg have placed business in new important light said prince expiring hope reviving what then do advise to do to be quiet if own view of case be right can act a well to morrow next day a moment on contrary if mine be correct one moment may enable beckendorff to bring affair to crisis in case must recommend to be silent in manner to allude more to object of visit if speak only give opportunity to beckendorff of ascertaining opinion inclination silence after such frequent attempt on side to promote discussion upon business will soon be discovered by to be systematic will not decrease opinion of sagacity firmness first principle of negotiation be to make adversary respect after long consultation prince determined to follow vivians advice so firmly did adhere to purpose that when met mr beckendorff at noon meal asked with very unembarrassed voice manner what sport have have in morning noon meal again consisted of single dish a exquisitely dressed however a preceding one be haunch of venison be dinner gentleman said beckendorff let be luncheon have ordered dinner at sunset after having eaten slice of haunch mr beckendorff rose from table said will have wine in drawing room mr von philipson then will not be disturbed by bird left room to drawing room therefore two guest soon adjourned found busily employed with pencil prince thought must be chart fortification at least be rather surprised when mr beckendorff asked magnitude of mirac in botes prince confessing utter ignorance of subject minister threw aside unfinished planisphere drew chair to at table be with satisfaction that highness perceived bottle of favourite tokay with little astonishment observed that to day there be three wine glass placed before be of peculiar beauty almost worthy for elegant shape great antiquity of being included in collection of grand duke of johannisberger after exhausting bottle in be assisted to extent of one glass by host who drank mr von philipsons health with cordiality assented to mr beckendorffs proposition of visiting fruitery to prince great relief dinner time soon arrived having employed couple of hour on meal very satisfactorily vivian adjourned to drawing room having previously pledged honour to other that nothing must again induce to play dummy whist resolution promise be needle mr beckendorff who be sitting opposite fire when came into room by word motion acknowledged that be aware of entrance vivian found refuge in book prince after having examined re examined brilliant bird figured on drawing room paper fell asleep upon sofa mr beckendorff took down guitar accompanied in low voice for time then suddenly ceased stretching out leg supporting thumb in armhole of waistcoat leant back in chair remained motionless with eye fixed upon picture vivian in turn gazed upon singular being fair pictured form seemed to idolise be too unhappy have too be bereft in hour of proud perfect joy have too lost virgin bride agony overcame book fell from hand sighed aloud mr beckendorff started prince awoke vivian confounded unable to overpower emotion uttered hasty word explanatory apologetical contradictory retired in walk to summer house man passed in spite of great cloak vivian recognised a messenger guide ample mantle did not conceal riding boot spur glistened in moonlight be hour past midnight when door of summer house softly opened mr beckendorff entered started when found vivian still undressed pacing up down little chamber young man made effort when witnessed intruder to compose countenance whose agitation must not be concealed what be up

in poetical than scientific spirit hum confess there be moment continued vivian when can not refrain from believing that mysterious luminary have more influence over fortune than modern time be disposed to believe feel that be getting le sceptical perhaps must say more credulous day sorrow make superstitious discard such fantasy said mr beckendorff only tend to enervate mental energy

on third day of visit to mr beckendorff just a gentleman be composing mind after noon meal with favourite cremona in moment of rapture raising instrument high in air that door be suddenly dashed open essper george rushed into room intruder moment that eye caught vivian flew to master seizing by arm commenced continued loud shout of exultation accompanying scream whole time by kind of quick dance though not quite a clamorous a pyrrhic nevertheless completely drowned scientific harmony of mr beckendorff so astounded be three gentleman by unexpected entrance that moment elapsed ere of found word at command at master of house spoke mr von philipson beg favour of being informed who person be prince did not answer looked at vivian in great distress just a hero be about to give mr beckendorff requisite information essper george taking up parable seized opportunity of explaining mystery who be who be be honest man traitor if be same why then there must be rogue in reisenburg who be man there arm there leg can see through wood by twilight if so yours be better eye than mine can eat unskinned hare dine on haunch of bounding stag if so teeth be sharper than mine can hear robber

baltic merchant greek pirate tell will tell who went in mourning in moon at death of last comet who be indeed embarrassment of prince vivian while essper george addressed to mr beckendorff choice query be indescribable once vivian tried to check in vain did not repeat attempt for be sufficiently employed in restraining own agitation keeping own countenance for in spite of mortification anger that esspers appearance have excited in still unfortunate innate taste for ludicrous did not allow to be perfectly insensible to humour of scene mr beckendorff listened quietly till essper have finished then rose mr von philipson said a personal favour to to own great inconvenience consented that in interview must be attended by friend did not reckon upon servant be impossible that can tolerate presence for moment know how live that sole attendant be female allow male servant within house even when royal highness honour with presence be unattended desire be immediately released from presence of buffoon so saying mr beckendorff left room who be said essper following with back bent head on chest eye glancing imitation be perfect essper said vivian conduct be inexcusable mischief that have done irreparable punishment will be severe severe why what day did master sell gratitude for silver groschen be return for finding out saving from thousand time more desperate gang than baron at em severe indeed will be lot when be in dungeon in reisenburg castle with black bread for roast venison sour water for rhenish why what be talking about talking about about treason arch traitor old scoundrel who life in lone lane dare not look straight in face why very blink be enough to hang without trial essper cease immediately rhodomontade then in distinct term inform highness of cause of unparalleled intrusion impressiveness of vivians manner produced proper effect except that spoke somewhat affectedly slow ridiculously precise essper george delivered with great clearness see sir never let know that be going to leave so when found that did not come back made bold to speak to mr arnelm when came home from hunting must not get enough breath out of to stop ladybird on rose leaf did not much like honour for be among stranger so be know well then went to master rodolph be very kind to seeing in low spirit thinking suppose in love in debt have done piece of mischief have something other preying on mind come to say essper said remember master rodolphs voice sir to point never let hear master rodolphs name again yes sir well well said to come dine with in room say will good offer must never be refused unless have better one at same time whereupon after dinner master rodolph said to will have bottle of burgundy for treat see sir be rather sick of rhenish well sir be free with wine master rodolph who be never easy except when know everything must be trying see to get out of what be that made so down in mouth seeing thought must put off secret to bottle being produced did not conceal from longer what be making so low rodolph said like young master going out in odd way be of temper to get into scrape must like very much to know what prince saving highness presence be after have be shut up in cabinet two night though walked by door pretty often devil bit of word ever came through key hole so see rodolph said requires bottle two of burgundy to keep spirit up well highness strange to say sooner have spoken than master rodolph put head across little table dined at little table on right hand of room a enter go on be going on well put head across little table said to in low whisper cocking odd looking eye at same time tell what essper be deuced sharp fellow so giving shake of head wink of eye be quiet smelt rat did not begin to pump directly after third bottle rodolph said with regard to last observation for have not spoken lately burgundy being too fat wine for talking be of sharp fellow dare say now be thinking of same thing doubt of said rodolph so sir agreed to tell what be thinking of on condition must be equally frank afterwards well then told that there be sad going on at turriparva deuce said prince let tell story said vivian sad going on at turriparva wished that highness must hunt more attend le to politics then told quite confidentially that highness prince heaven know how many other prince besides have leagued together be going to dethrone grand duke that master be to be made king master rodolph prime minister hearing duly allowing for tale over bottle made doubt a find to be case that good master be about to be led into mischief a know that conspiracy be always unsuccessful have done best to save master beseech upon knee to get out of scrape a soon a possibly can here essper george threw at vivians foot entreated to quit house immediately be ever anything so absurd so mischievous ejaculated prince then conversed with vivian for time in whisper essper at length vivian said have committed one of most perfect most injurious blunder that must possibly perpetrate mischief may result from imprudent conduct be incalculable how long be since have thought proper to regulate conduct on absurd falsehood of drunken steward highness wish to consult in private on account leave house now mind if leave house without permission forfeit little chance remains of being retained in service where be to go sir stay in passage suppose here imitated beckendorff come to then open door come into room well said prince when door be at length shut one thing be quite clear doe not know who beckendorff be so far satisfactory feel force of highness observation be most puzzling case to send back to turriparva must be madness whole affair must be immediately revealed over bottle of burgundy with master rodolph in fact highness visit must be secret to one in country host must be soon discovered evil consequence be incalculable know one to send to at reisenburg if did appears to that same objection equally apply to proceeding to city a to returning to turriparva what be to be done surely demon must have inspired can not now request beckendorff to allow to stay here if did be convinced from tone manner that nothing must induce to comply with wish only course to be pursued be certainly annoying one so far a can judge be only mode by very serious mischief can be prevented let proceed forthwith to reisenburg with essper placed immediately under eye solemnly adjured by to silence think can answer particularly when give gentle hint of station of beckendorff for preserving confidence with will now be policy partially to entrust be to say least awkward distressing to leave alone what be to be done doe not appear that can now be of material service to have assisted a much a more than must reasonably have supposed must have be in power to have done by throwing light upon character situation of beckendorff with clue to conduct chance meeting with yesterday morning have afforded only point for highness to determine be a to length of time will resolve to wait for communication a to final agreement together with highness settled view decided purpose difficulty of negotiation will be on side dear prince continued vivian with significant voice marked emphasis dear prince may be secret wish be assured that to attain in present negotiation have only to be firm let nothing divert from purpose termination of interview must be gratifying to prince of little lilliput be very disinclined to part with shrewd counsellor who have already done considerable service strongly opposed vivians proposition opposition however like of most other person be unaccompanied by suggestion of own a agreed that something must be done of course ended in prince being of opinion that vivians advice must be followed prince be really much affected by sudden unexpected parting with one for whom though have known so short time began to entertain sincere regard owe life said prince perhaps more than life here be about suddenly to part never to meet again wish must get to make turriparva home must have own suite of room own horse own servant never feel for instant that be not master of around in truth continued prince with great earnestness wish dear friend must really think seriously of know must visit vienna even italy yet return to max must be delighted to see love already sievers library must be at command agree to proposition dear friend can not express to highness how sensible be of kindness friendship sincerely value will never forget be too unhappy unlucky being to burden one with constant presence adieu will go with to beckendorff oh go with by mean said prince taking ruby ring of great antiquity off finger must feel happy if must wear for sake prince be so much affected at thought of parting with vivian that must scarcely speak vivian accepted ring with cordiality kind hearted donor deserved yet hero unfortunately have have rather too much experience of world not to be aware that most probably in le than week affectionate friend must not be able to recall name under hour recollection such be friend moment that be not at side be neglected moment that die be forgotten found mr beckendorff in library in apprising mr beckendorff of intention of immediately quitting roof vivian did not omit to state cause of sudden departure not only accounted for abruptness of movement also gave opportunity of preventing necessity by allowing essper to remain opportunity be not seized by mr beckendorff truth be that gentleman have particular wish to see vivian out of house in allowing prince of little lilliput to be attended during interview by friend beckendorff have prepared for reception of brawny jagd junker thick headed chamberlain who reckoned must act rather a incumbrance than aid to opponent be with great mortification therefore that found accompanied by shrewd experienced wary educated englishman man like beckendorff soon discovered that vivian grey be common mind conversation with of last night have given notion of power moment beckendorff saw essper george enter house determined that must be cause of vivian leaving there be also weighty reason for mr beckendorff desiring that prince of little lilliput must at moment be left to mr grey will ride on to reisenburg immediately said prince dear friend may depend upon having luggage by day after to morrow will be at turriparva early to morrow will be first care be said in loud voice gentleman watched mr beckendorffs countenance a information be given emotion be visible well sir good morning to said mr beckendorff be sorry be going have known sooner must have given letter mr von philipson said beckendorff do favour of looking over paper so saying mr beckendorff put official report into prince hand while highness attention be attracted by sudden request mr beckendorff laid finger on vivians arm said in lower tone will take care that find powerful friend at reisenburg book vii chapter a vivian left room mr beckendorff be seized with unusual desire to converse with prince of little lilliput highness be consequently debarred consolation of walking with friend a far a horse at little gate vivian essper encountered only male attendant who be allowed to approach house of mr beckendorff a vivian quietly walked horse up rough turf road must not refrain from recurring to conversation of previous night when called to mind adventure of last six day have new cause to wonder at perhaps to lament over singular fate in short time have saved life of powerful prince being immediately signalled out without exertion on part a object of prince friendship moment arrives at castle by wonderful contingency becomes depositary of state secret assist in consultation of importance with one of most powerful minister in europe now object of so much friendship confidence honour be suddenly on road to capital of state of late host be prime minister friend chief subject without even convenience of common letter of introduction with little prospect of viewing with even usual advantage of common traveller one of most interesting of european court when have proceeded about halfway up turf lane found private road to right with spirit of adventure for englishman be celebrated immediately resolved must not only lead to reisenburg also carry to city much sooner than regular high road have not advanced far up road before came to gate at have parted with beckendorff on morning that gentleman have roused so unexpectedly from reverie in green lane be surprised to find horseman dismounting at gate struck by singular circumstance appearance of stranger be not unnoticed be tall well proportioned man a traveller passed stared vivian so fully in face that hero did not fail to remark handsome countenance expression of however be rather vacant unpleasing be dressed in riding coat exactly similar to one always worn by beckendorffs messenger have vivian not seen so distinctly must have mistaken for person stranger be rather indifferently mounted carried cloak small portmanteau at back of saddle suppose be butler said essper george who now spoke for first time since dismissal from room vivian did not answer not because entertained angry feeling on account of exceedingly unpleasant visit by mean be impossible for man like vivian grey to cherish irritated feeling for second did not exchange syllable with essper george merely because be not in humour to speak must not refrain from musing on singular event of last few day above character of beckendorff particularly engrossed meditation conversation of preceding night excited in mind new feeling of wonder revived emotion thought be dead everlastingly dormant apparently philosophy on beckendorff have regulated career by have arrived at pitch of greatness be exactly same with vivian grey have started in life have found so fatal in consequence believed to be so vain in principle how be what radical error have committed required little consideration thirty more than thirty year have passed over head of beckendorff ere world felt power indeed be conscious of existence deep student not only of man in detail of man in group not only of individual of nation beckendorff have hived up ample knowledge of subject must interest fellow creature when opportunity in world occurs to men occurred to beckendorff be prepared with acquirement equal to genius beckendorff depended only upon succeeded vivian grey with mind inferior to man dashed on stage in year boy though in feeling man brilliant a might have be genius acquirement necessarily be insufficient must not depend only upon consequent necessity arose to have recourse to assistance of others to inspire with feeling must not share humour manage petty weakness must not experience colleague be at same time to work for gratification of own private interest most palpable of abstract thing to carry into execution great purpose feeble mind interested only by first point cared not to comprehend unnatural combination failed originator fell to believe that must recur again to hope feeling pursuit of boyhood felt to be vainest of delusion be expectation of man like beckendorff whose career though difficult though hazardous have be uniformly successful of man who mistook care for grief anxiety for sorrow traveller entered city at sunset proceeding through ancient unseemly town full of long narrow ill paved street black unevenly built house ascended hill on top of be situated new residence town of reisenburg proud palace white square architectural street new church elegant opera house splendid hotel gay public garden full of bust vas statue surrounded by iron railing cast out of cannon taken from side during war by reisenburg troop now formed into pike fasces glittering with gilded head shining in setting sun produced effect at time in place must have be beautiful striking on present occasion be still more so from remarkable contrast afforded to ancient gloomy filthy town through vivian have just passed where from lowness of situation sun have already set there be a much difference between old new town of reisenburg a between old barbarous margrave new noble grand duke on second day after arrival at reisenburg vivian received following letter from prince of little lilliput luggage did not accompany epistle dear friend by time have received will have returned to turriparva visit to certain gentleman be prolonged for one day never can convey to by word sense entertain of value of friendship of service trust that time will afford opportunity of testifying by action return home by same road by came remember how excellent road be a indeed be road in reisenburg must be confessed by fear that most partial admirer of old rgime can not say a much for convenience of travelling in time of father good road be most excellent thing one of first mark of civilisation prosperity emperor napoleon who must be confessed have after common mind be celebrated for road have doubtless admired route napoleon on rhine if travel into italy be informed that will be equally even more struck by passage over simplon other italian road reisenburg have certainly kept pace with spirit of time nobody can deny confess to that more consider subject appears to that happiness prosperity content of state be best evidence of wisdom beneficent rule of government many thing be very excellent in theory be reverse in practice even ludicrous while must do most to promote cause uphold interest of rational liberty still at same time must ever be on guard against crude idea revolutionary system of who be quite inexperienced in sort of particular knowledge be necessary for statesman nothing be so easy a to make thing look fine on paper must never forget that there be great difference between high sounding generality laborious detail be reasonable to expect that men who have passed life dreaming in college old musty study must be at calculated to take head of affair know what measure at head of affair ought to adopt think not certain personage who by bye be one of most clear headed most perfect men of business that ever have pleasure of being acquainted with real practical man in short tell that professor skyrocket whom will most likely see at reisenburg wrote article in military quarterly review be published there on probable expense of war between austria prussia forgot commissariat altogether did ever know anything so ridiculous what business have such fellow to meddle with affair of state must certainly be put down think none can deny liberal spirit in government be certainly most excellent thing must always remember that liberty may degenerate into licentiousness liberty be certainly excellent thing that admit a certain person very well observed so be physic yet be not to be given at time only when frame be in state to require people may be a unprepared for wise discreet use of liberty a vulgar person may be for management of great estate unexpectedly inherited there be great deal in in opinion there be case in to force liberty down people throat be presenting not with blessing curse will send luggage on immediately be very probable that may be in town at end of week for short time wish much to see to consult therefore hope that will not leave reisenburg before see faithful obliged friend little lilliput two day after receipt of letter essper george ran into room with much le solemn physiognomy than have thought proper to assume since master arrival at reisenburg lord sir whom do think have just met whom asked vivian with eagerness for a be always case when such question be asked be thinking of person in world except right one might be to think must see continued essper be man then thought vivian who be at once essper thought must not guess sir will quite cure to hear master rodolph master rodolph ay there great news in wind of course have confidentially extracted from pray let have prince of little lilliput be coming to reisenburg said essper well have idea of before said vivian oh then know sir suppose said essper with look of great disappointment know nothing more than have mentioned said master what do not know sir that prince have come over that be going to live at court be heaven know what that be to carry staff day before grand duke at dinner doe not master know that know nothing of so tell in plain german what case be well then continued essper suppose know that highness prince be to be excellency grand marshal unfortunate principal officer of state having received dismissal yesterday be coming up immediately not moment be to be lost seems to very odd master rodolph be arranging everything have morning purchased from master predecessor palace furniture wine picture in short whole establishment late grand marshal consoling for loss of office revenging on successor by selling property at hundred per cent profit however master rodolph seems quite contented with bargain luggage be come sir highness prince will be in town at end of week men be to be put in new livery mr arnelm be to be highness chamberlain von neuwied master of horse so see sir be right old pus in boot be traitor after upon soul did not much believe sir until heard good news chapter ii about week after arrival at reisenburg a vivian be at breakfast door opened mr sievers entered did not think that next meeting must be in city said mr sievers smiling highness of course informed of arrival said vivian a greeted cordially understand be diplomatist whom be to thank for finding again at reisenburg let at same time express gratitude for kind office to congratulate on brilliancy of talent for negotiation little did think when be giving other day account of mr beckendorff that information must have be of such service to be afraid have nothing to thank for though certainly have office of arranging term between party devolved on first thought must have be for gentleman for whom have so much regard respect a mr sievers sir feel honoured already speak like finished courtier pray what be to be office fear mr beckendorff will not resign in favour ambition be so exalted that can not condescend to take anything under premiership be not to be tempted by grand marshalship said mr sievers hardly expected when be at turriparva to witness rapid termination of patriotism of good friend think said have seen since arrival interview must have be piquant not at immediately congratulated on judicious arrangement have be concluded to relieve awkwardness took credit to myself for having partially assisted in bringing about result subject be not again mentioned dare say never will be be curious business said sievers prince be man who rather than have given up to grand duke with whom be not connected who of own accord sought hospitality sooner repeat than have delivered up must have have castle razed to ground fifty sword through heart yet without slightest compunction have same man deserted with greatest coolness party of ten day ago be zealous leader how can account for except be a have long suspected that in politics there positively be feeling of honour one be conscious that not only colleague rival be working for own private purpose that however party may apparently be assisting in bringing about result of common benefit that nevertheless in fact be conscious that be tool of with understanding treason be expected affair only point to consider be who will be so unfortunate a to be deserted instead of deserter be only fair to highness to state beckendorff gave incontestable evidence that have have private interview with one of mediatised prince be dupe of wily minister in negotiation became acquainted with plan character must estimate probability of success golden bribe be in turn dandled before eye of have be always reserved for most powerful friend secession consequent desertion of relative destroy party for ever while at same time that party have not even consolation of good conscience to uphold in adversity feel that in case of clamour of attempt to stir up people by hollow patriotism be in power of minister to expose crush for ever said vivian make more rejoice that friend have got out of clutch will make excellent grand marshal must not forget dear sir that did not forget to tell truth although did not flatter must benefit during stay at reisenburg by influence be not least surprised at termination of visit to mr beckendorff have seen too many of affair not to have be quite aware whole time that must require very little trouble very few sacrifice on part of mr beckendorff to quash whole cabal by bye visit to be highly amusing be singular man have have nevertheless said sievers difficult part to play have not be for prince must have perhaps imagined that be only trifling with again terminated interview abruptly in disgust having brought grand duke to term having arranged interview beckendorff of course imagined that be finished very day that arrived at house have received despatch from royal highness recalling promise revoking beckendorffs authority to use unlimited discretion in business difficulty then be to avoid discussion with prince with whom be not prepared to negotiate at same time without letting highness out of sight to induce grand duke to resume old view of case first night that be there beckendorff rode up to reisenburg grand duke be refused through intrigue of madame carolina requested authority resigned power when be mile on return be summoned back to palace royal highness asked a favour from tutor four twenty hour consideration beckendorff granted on condition that in case grand duke assented to term proposed royal highness must be bearer of proposition that there must be more written promise to recall more written authority to revoke term be hard beckendorff be inflexible on second night of visit messenger arrived with despatch advising beckendorff of intended arrival of royal highness on next morning ludicrous intrusion of amusing servant prevented from being present at great interview in understand beckendorff for moment laid aside caprice friend acted with great firmness energy must not be satisfied even with personal pledge written promise of grand duke demanded that must receive seal of office within week so that have court not be sincere situation with former party must not have be injured be astonishing how very acute even dull man be when own interest be at stake have highness be agent of person must probably have committed many blunder have made disadvantageous term perhaps have be thoroughly duped self interest be finest eye water what say madame carolina to oh according to custom have changed already think whole business admirably arranged highness be grand favourite little pupil max pet think however on whole boy be fondest of grand duke whom if remember be always informing in confidence that intended to assassinate a for obedient servant said sievers bowing here be once more aristarchus of coterie friend by bye view accession of prince with pleased eye anticipating that juncture with minister be only prelude to final dispersion be compensating for approaching termination of career by unusual violence fresh fervour stinging like mosquito before storm conscious of impending destruction from clearance of atmosphere a for have nothing more to do with liberty philosophy be fine word until find men be prepared to cultivate in wiser spirit will remain quiet have idea of being banished imprisoned because parcel of knave be making vile use of truth disseminate in opinion philosopher have said enough now let men act time have

on contrary danced in true vienna style whirled like dervish good english prejudice against soft swimming sentimental melting undulating dangerous waltz must quickly disappear if only executed dreaded manoeuvre in true austrian style one might a soon expect daughter to get sentimental in swing vivian did not choose to presume upon late acquaintance with mr beckendorff a have not be sought by gentleman consequently did not pay respect to minister mr beckendorff continued at top of room standing between state chair of royal highness madame carolina occasionally addressing observation to
