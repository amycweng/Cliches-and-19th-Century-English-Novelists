so far a to express conviction that everything must be left to mr armine who everybody now discovered to have always be particular favourite with grandfather at event sir ratcliffe who ever maintained upon subject becoming silence thought a well that son must remind grandfather personally of existence be at father suggestion that ferdinand have obtained short leave of absence at first opportunity to pay hurried visit to grandison grandfather old lord yielded reception might have flattered most daring hope embraced ferdinand pressed to heart thousand time gave blessing in most formal manner

by single female servant who remained if curiosity have be excited possessed power of communicating into somersetshire besides be unaware that young master be nominally in london sometimes hour be snatched by henrietta from roaming in pleasaunce interchanging vow of mutual love admiration to picture gallery where have already commenced miniature copy of portrait of great sir ferdinand a sun set departed in little equipage ferdinand wrapped henrietta in fur cloak for autumn dew began to rise thus protected journey of ten mile be ever found too short be habit of lover however innocent passion to grow day le discreet for day almost constant companionship becomes more necessity miss temple have almost unconsciously contrived at first captain armine in absence of father must not be observed too often at ducie now ferdinand drove home evening drank tea at bower evening closed with music song night crossed over common to farmhouse more fondly devotedly in one morning at armine henrietta being alone in gallery busied with drawing ferdinand having left for moment to execute slight commission for heard one enter looking up to catch glance of love beheld venerable man of mild benignant appearance dressed in black standing a if little surprised at distance not le confused nevertheless bowed gentleman advanced with hesitation with faint blush returned salute apologised for intrusion

at familiar expression madam have be ferdinand so many year can not easily school no longer to style so be aware that there be now other claim dearest glastonbury ' exclaimed ferdinand armine starting a re entered gallery truly in a great fright a man must well be who perhaps few hour ago be to conquer in spain germany at same time pale eager talking with excited rapidity embraced tutor scrutinised countenance of henrietta to ascertain whether fatal secret have be discovered that countenance be fond if not calm not more confused than unexpected appearance under circumstance might account for 'you have often heard mention mr glastonbury said addressing to henrietta 'let now have pleasure of making acquainted oldest best friend second father admirable artist too can assure be qualified to

ferdinand cared not what might suspect ultimately discover be future evil subsided into insignificance compared with discovery on part of miss temple comparatively composed ferdinand now suggested to henrietta to quit drawing indeed be so advanced that might be finished at ducie never leaving side watching look hanging on accent of old tutor even ventured to suggest that must visit tower proposal thought might lull suspicion might have be excited on part of miss temple glastonbury expressed gratification at suggestion quitted gallery entered avenue of beech tree have heard so much of tower mr glastonbury ' said miss temple be sensible assure of honour of being admitted ' extreme delicacy be characteristic of glastonbury preserved ferdinand armine from dreaded danger never for instant

there might be female companion aunt cousin for aught knew at place be only parent that ferdinand have said have not yet arrived at event felt at moment ferdinand perhaps even because be alone with

round neck hid face upon breast did not disturb effusion of suppressed emotion throbbing heart responded to tumultuous soul at length when strength of passionate affection have somewhat decreased when convulsive sob have subsided into gentle sigh ever anon felt pressure of sweet lip sealing remorseful love charming repentance upon bosom dared to say henrietta did not doubt ferdinand 'dearest ferdinand be too good too kind too faultless be very wicked ' taking hand covering with kiss said in distinct very low voice tell why be unhappy ' sighed henrietta 'dearest papa that day must come

be between ourselves ought to be between if request permission to offer hand yield consent be not that ceremony enough ' have never concealed anything from papa ' said henrietta 'but will be guided by 'leave then to ' said ferdinand 'be guided by judgment of own ferdinand henrietta believe will go right will break intelligence to father so will settle ' continued enquiringly 'it will be so 'then arises question said ferdinand 'when must be most advisable for to make communication now father henrietta who be man of world will of course expect that when do make will be prepared to speak definitely to upon matter of business will think otherwise be trifling with to go request of man like father shrewd experienced man of world like mr temple permission to marry daughter without showing to that be prepared with mean of maintaining family be little short of madness must be offended with must be prejudiced against must therefore settle something first with sir ratcliffe much know unfortunately can not offer father still sweet love there must at least be appearance of providence management must not disgust father with union ' how can be disgusted ' 'dear one then be what propose a to morrow must comparatively be separated must take advantage of next few day get to bath bring affair to arrangement until return must advise to say nothing to father 'how can live under

yearning for that while be laying plan of future companionship be meditating perhaps eternal separation henrietta listen to one moment suppose have quitted last night for bath merely for purpose a indeed have once thought of that father have arrived at ducie before have returned to make communication must style silence under such circumstance secret engagement dear love be abuse of term must be delicate consideration for parent feeling o ferdinand must be united have care 'you must not consider projected union secret engagement if after passing to morrow with father expected on next day to communicate to position be more secret engagement because six seven day be to elapse before communication take place instead of one henrietta be indeed fighting with shadow 'ferdinand can not reason

really go must indeed be separated can not believe be inconceivable be impossible can not endure ' 'it be indeed terrible ' said ferdinand consideration alone reconciles to necessity know father well only answer to communication of kind must be immediate summons to side now be not better that meeting must take place when must necessarily be much le together than before than at later period when may perhaps be constant companion with sanction of parent o ferdinand reason only feel ' such observation from one mistress be rather reproach than compliment be made in present instance to man whose principal characteristic be perhaps too dangerous susceptibility man of profound violent passion yet of most sweet tender temper capable of deep reflection yet ever acting from impulse of sentiment
