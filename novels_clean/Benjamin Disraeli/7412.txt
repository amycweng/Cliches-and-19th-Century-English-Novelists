gay one party wish to keep old borough other to get new peer chapter vii future historian of country will be perplexed to ascertain what be distinct object duke of wellington proposed to in political manoeuvre of may be known that passing of reform bill be condition absolute with king be unquestionable that first general election under new law must ignominiously expel anti reform ministry from power who must then resume seat on opposition bench in house with loss not only of borough of reputation for political consistency might have be compensation for parliamentary influence of have be deprived be difficult to recognise in premature effort of anti reform leader to thrust again into conduct of public affair indication of prescient judgment might have be expected from such quarter savoured rather of restlessness than of energy while proved in progress not only ignorance on part of public mind of feeling of own party terminated under circumstance be humiliating to crown painfully significant of future position of house of lord in new constitutional scheme duke of wellington have ever be votary of circumstance care little for cause watch event rather than seek to produce be characteristic of military mind rapid combination result of quick vigilant comprehensive glance be generally triumphant in field in civil affair where result be not immediate in diplomacy in management of deliberative assembly where there be much intervening time many counteracting cause velocity of decision fitful precipitate action be often productive of considerable embarrassment sometimes of terrible discomfiture be remarkable that men celebrated for military prudence be often found to be headstrong statesman in civil life great general be frequently strangely creature of impulse influenced in political movement by last snatch of information often creature of last aide de camp who have ear will endeavour to trace in chapter reason on a on previous subsequent occasion

representing house of lord sympathises with king pledge utmost effort for majesty relief after five day exertion man of indomitable will invincible fortune resigns task in discomfiture despair alleges a only sufficient reason for utter hopeless defeat that house of common have come to vote ran counter to contemplated exercise of prerogative from moment power passed from house of lord to assembly if peer have ceased to be magnifico may not also happen that sovereign may cease to be doge be not impossible that political movement of time seem on surface to have tendency to democracy may have in reality monarchical bias in le than fortnight time house of lord like james ii having abdicated function by absence reform bill passed ardent monarch who few month before have expressed readiness to go down to parliament in hackney coach if necessary to assist progress now declining personally to give assent to provision in protracted discussion to celebrated measure gave rise nothing be more

lord liverpool have be insensible to grace peculiar fitness for such duty strength be required in house of common where have only one secretary of state young man already distinguished yet untried a

unconsciously approximated to opinion because from careful experiment be convinced of beneficial tendency thus bore unintentional impartial testimony to truth like many men who think be inventor be only reproducing ancient wisdom one must ever deplore that ministry with talent generous ardour did not advance to principle be always perilous to adopt expediency a guide choice may be sometimes imperative statesman however took expediency for director when principle must have given expediency ensured much more ministry strong in confidence of sovereign parliament people might by courageous promulgation of great historical truth have gradually formed public opinion must have permitted to organise tory party on broad permanent national basis might have nobly effected complete settlement of ireland shattered section of very cabinet be forced few year after to do partially in equivocating equivocal manner might have concluded satisfactory reconstruction of third estate without

devising sustaining intricate continuous scheme be in short man who felt thought who possessed in very remarkable degree restless instinct for adroit baseness on present occasion got into carriage drove at utmost speed from windsor to foreign office secretary of state be engaged when arrived mr rigby must listen to difficulty rushed upstairs flung open door with agitated countenance eye suffused with tear threw into arm of astonished mr canning be right exclaimed devoted rigby in broken tone have convinced king that first minister must be in house of common one know be certain have seen that at early period of career mr peel withdrew from official life course have be one of unbroken prosperity hero of university have become favourite of house of common retreat therefore be not prompted by chagrin need have be suggested by calculating ambition for ordinary course of event be fast bearing to to man must aspire one might rather suppose that have already gained sufficient

statement in parliament of determining circumstance of conduct coupled with subsequent almost immediate policy may perhaps always leave painful ambiguous passage in career in passing judgment on public men behoves ever to take large extended view of conduct previous incident will often satisfactorily explain subsequent event without illustrating aid be involved in misapprehension mystery must

nation called to council absent chief of parliamentary section scarcely numbering at moment one hundred forty individual of party in country supposed to be utterly discomfited by recent revolution two

dinner gave one to numerous party indeed saloon to day during half hour of gathering precedes dinner offered in various group anxious countenance inquiring voice mysterious whisper rather character of exchange bourse than tone of festive society here might be marked murmuring knot of greyheaded privy councillor who have held fat office under perceval liverpool who looked back to reform act a to hideous dream there middle aged aspirant might be observed who have lost seat in convulsion who flattered have done something for party in interval by spending nothing except breath in fighting hopeless borough occasionally publishing pamphlet really produced le effect than chalking wall light a air proud a young peacock tripped on toe young tory who have contrived to keep seat in parliament

to open mouth who have treated leader with servility even behind back be happy for day if future secretary of treasury bowed to who have not only discountenanced discontent in party have regularly reported in strict confidence instance of insubordination came to knowledge might there too be detected under agony of crisis just beginning to feel dread misgiving whether being slave sneak be sufficient qualification for office without family connection poor fellow industry have wasted on cheerless craft might have made fortune in decent trade in dazzling contrast with throe of low ambition be brilliant personage who have just scampered up from melton thinking probable that sir robert might want moral lord of bed chamber may have be private fear feeling however seemed smiling

arrangement of minister of course have not even thought can not trace to authority wonder who will be master of horse said great noble loving gossip though despised gossiper clifford have done nothing for party said mr earwig dare say rambrooke will have buckhounds said great noble musingly lordship have not heard cliffords name mentioned continued mr earwig must think have not come to sort of thing said great noble with ill disguised contempt first thing after cabinet be formed be household thing talk of be done last turned upon heel met imperturbable countenance clear sarcastic eye of lord eskdale have not heard anything asked great noble of brother patrician yes great deal since have be in room unfortunately be untrue there be report that rambrooke be to have buck hound can not

of affair mind of nation be often mentioned something to be written be written speedily have ever since be talked of believe may venture to assume at period during movement of did sir robert peel ever believe in success of administration mere failure must occasion little dissatisfaction be compensated for by noble opportunity afforded to for display of great quality moral intellectual swaddling clothes of routine prosperity have long repressed of opposition to reform bill have given to nation significant intimation brief administration elevated in public opinion even in eye of europe be probable that much longer term of power must not have contributed more to fame probable effect of premature effort of party on future position a minister be however far from being so satisfactory at lowest ebb of political fortune can not be doubted that sir robert peel looked forward perhaps through vista of many year to period when national mind arrived by reflection experience at certain

of being leader of confederacy must have be supported by earnest enduring enthusiasm instead of by churlish sufferance be result of supposed balance of advantage in favour be consequence of tactic of

to open mouth on such subject said taper nod wink will speak volume affectionate pressure of hand will sometimes do great deal have promised many peerage without committing by ingenious habit of deference can not be mistaken by future noble wonder what will do with rigby said tadpole want good deal said taper tell what mr taper time be gone by when marquess of monmouth be letter very true mr

father die that in long run practically interfere with well name be mentioned said tadpole there be concealing will speak to earwig said taper will just drop into sir robert ear by chance chudleigh used to quiz in smoking room little bit of information do great deal of good well leave to said tadpole be heartily with in keeping out fellow like chudleigh be very well for opposition in office dont want wit when will have answer from knowsley inquired taper anticipate possible difficulty tell be carte blanche replied tadpole four place in cabinet two secretaryship at least do happen to know

peerage have yet to learn be richer than be better informed wiser more distinguished for public private virtue be not monstrous then that small number of men several of whom take title of duke earl from town in very neighbourhood town never saw never heard of did not form build establish say be not monstrous that individual so circumstanced must be invested with highest of conceivable privilege privilege of making law duke earl indeed say there be nothing in masquerade more ridiculous do not argue from exception sir said coningsby question be whether preponderance of aristocratic principle in political constitution be a believe conducive to stability permanent power of state whether peerage a established in england generally tends to end must not forget in such estimate influence in
