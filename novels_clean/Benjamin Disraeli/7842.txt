fish wooden bowl filled from pure stream flowed beneath simple meal welcome guest seated upon rushy couch while refreshed gently inquired history of adventure a be evident that eremite from apparel mistook sex of iduna nicaeus thought fit not to undeceive passed off a brother described a two athenian youth who have be captured while serving a volunteer under great hunniades who have effected escape from adrianople under circumstance of great peril difficulty when have gratified eremite curiosity respecting christian brother in paynim land sympathetically marvelled with at advancing fortune of crescent nicaeus who perceived that iduna stood in great need of rest mentioned fatigue of more fragile brother requested permission for to retire whereupon eremite fetching load of fresh rush arranged in one of cell invited fair iduna to repose daughter of hunniades first humbling before altar of virgin offering gratitude for late mercy vouchsafed unto then bidding word of peace to host companion withdrew to hard earned couch soon be buried in sleep a sweet innocent a herself repose fell not upon eye lid of nicaeus in spite of labour heart of athenian prince be distracted by two most powerful of passion love jealousy when eremite pointing out to guest allotted resting place retired to regular simple slumber nicaeus quitted cavern standing upon bank of river gazed in abstraction upon rushing water foaming in moonlight prince of athens with many admirable quality be one of men who be influenced only by passion who in affair of life be invariably guided by imagination instead of reason at present thought feeling consideration circumstance merged in overpowering love entertained for iduna determination to obtain at cost peril resolution that must never again meet iskander except a wife of nicaeus compared with paramount object future seemed to vanish emancipation of country welfare of friend even maintenance of holy creed great noble object for under other circumstance must have be prepared to sacrifice fortune life no longer interested influenced while legion of crescent be on point of pouring into greece to crush patriotic christian cause over iskander have so often mused whose interest disinterested absence of iskander occasioned solely by devotion to nicaeus have certainly endangered perhaps must event of last few hour be known even sacrificed prince of athens resolved unless iduna must consent to become at once to carry off daughter of hunniades to distant country indeed even with easily excited vanity be nicaeus sanguine of obtaining purpose by le violent mean be already rejected suitor under circumstance scarcely have left hope nothing sole credit of chivalric rescue must perhaps have obtained for interest in heart of

iduna have not at former period endeavoured to conceal to be principal came of rejection now by unhappy course of circumstance very deed on counted with sanguine hope a sure mean of success seemed a be to have placed in more inferior situation than before constant society of mistress have fanned to former force ardour flame apart from hopeless have endeavoured to repress while on other hand must not conceal from that iduna must feel that have played in rest proceeding secondary part genius generosity of exploit rested with iskander who after having obtained freedom by so much energy peril sagacity skill have secured by devoted courage might shame knight of christendom perhaps too have secured by own life what if iskander be more be great contingency eternal servitude of greece shameful triumph of crescent be involved perhaps in single event must possession of iduna compensate for such disgrace infamy let not record wild response of passion be midnight ere restless nicaeus more

eremite attracted attention to patch of cress on opposite bank of stream morn rise only to discover fresh instance of omnipotent benevolence exclaimed yesterday ye tasted honey fish to day can offer ye fresh dainty will break fast in pleasant glen rest thou here gentle youth will summon thy brother to meal fear much doe not bear so contented spirit a thyself be older have seen more replied iduna eremite shook head leaning on staff returned to cavern iduna remained seated on mossy rock listening to awakening bird musing over fate of iskander while be indulging in reverie name be called looked up with blush beheld nicaeus how fare gentle comrade inquired prince of athens a well a hope be dear nicaeus have be indeed fortunate in finding so kind host think may now congratulate on safety said

exclaimed iduna in firmer voice withdrawing hand suddenly rose be time place for such conversation have not forgotten that few day back be hopeless captive that life fame be even now in danger great mercy have be vouchsafed to still perhaps need hourly interposition of heavenly aid other than such worldly thought must fill mind do dear nicaeus continued in more soothing tone have nobly commenced most heroic enterprise fulfil in like spirit must have replied at moment staff of eremite sounded among rock baffled dark with rage passion prince of athens quitted iduna strolled towards upper part of glen to conceal anger disappointment eat gentle youth said eremite will not thy brother join may be name nicaeus holy father thine iduna blushed hesitated at length in confusion replied iskander
