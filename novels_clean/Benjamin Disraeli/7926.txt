upon a masterpiece of management mountain who knew jorrocks by heart felt that have in rank men in sense superior that must be representative of intelligence opinion so by degree prepare for gradual admission to sacred land at first sulked over promotion of late companion only did not publicly deride from feeling by so doing might be playing game of ministry at time of be writing having become

though none of audience have arrived at before meeting be hushed be rapt in intellectual delight for did not give speaker enthusiasm of sympathy be not shared perhaps by moiety of who listened to when case be fairly before speaker dealt with opponent in press in parliament with much power of sarcasm power be evidently rather repressed than allowed to run riot what impressed endymion a chief quality of remarkable speaker be persuasiveness have air of being too prudent to offend even opponent unnecessarily language though natural easy be choice refined be evidently man who have read not little there be taint of vulgarity scarcely provincialism in pronunciation spoke for rather more than hour frequently during time endymion notwithstanding keen interest in what be taking place be troubled

article in consequence on character career of political chief perhaps with passing reference to jack in office superficial impertinence of private secretary wise amiable speculator on public affair

outside have be not inconsiderably passed yet beautiful berengaria showed disposition of returning to england myra be uneasy at own protracted absence from lord having made last fruitless effort to induce lady montfort to accompany said one day to endymion think must ask to take back indeed ought to be with lord little time before meeting of parliament endymion be really of same opinion though be conscious of social difficulty must have to encounter in order to effect purpose occasionally statesman in opposition be assisted by same private secretary who be confidant when in office be not always case perhaps not even generally in present instance principal of lord roehampton several secretary have be selected from permanent clerk in foreign office therefore when chief retired from official duty private secretary resumed previous post act necessarily terminated relation between late minister save of private though often still intimate acquaintance now one of great object of lady roehampton for long time have be that brother must occupy confidential position near husband desire have originally be shared even warmly by lady montfort unexpected entrance of endymion into house of common have raised technical difficulty in respect seemed to terminate cherished prospect myra however be resolved not to regard technical difficulty be determined to establish at once intimate

great policy if friend lord roehampton when be settling levant have only seized upon egypt must have be somewhere now be party who wanted to give not even cheap bread to people only cheaper bread

of mr pitt in have be said that be unwise in protectionist assuming office when on occasion on subsequent one be far from being certain of majority in house of common must however be remembered that unless have dared venture never must have formed body of men competent from official experience practice in debate to form ministry result have rather proved that be right have continued to refrain from incurring responsibility must have broken up merged in different connection for party numerically so strong a protectionist must have be sorry business probably have led to disastrous result mr

secret society socialist republican count of ferroll also whose opinion weighed much with majesty government be decidedly in favour of combination english prime minister listened to representation
