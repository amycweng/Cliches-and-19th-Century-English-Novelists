possible danger be forgotten in indefinite feeling that body possessed content more interesting than unpromising exterior in resolute determination that development of mystery must be reserved only for although felt assured that must be unseen must not refrain from throwing rapid glance of anxiety around be moment of perfect stillness island slept in sunshine even wave have ceased to break over opposing rock thousand strange singular thought rushed into mind first purpose be ever uppermost at length unfolding girdle of skin tied tough cincture round chest exerting power dragged mysterious waif into nearest wood during operation top fell off revealed neatest collection of little package that ever pleased eye of admirer of spruce arrangement popanilla took up packet upon possible subject smelt be not savory be sorely puzzled at last lighted on slender volume bound in brown calf with confined sensual notion of savage mistook for gingerbread at least be 'the universal linguist by mr hamilton art of dreaming in language sooner have popanilla passed that well formed nose have be so often admired by lady whose lock of hair have unfortunately lost few time over few page of hamiltonian system than sank upon bed of flower in spite of curiosity be instantly overcome by profound slumber slumber though deep be not peaceful be actor in agitating drama found alone in gay

perceived that be no longer alone friend be near on contrary be surrounded by stranger of far different aspect be men certainly be to say have leg arm head body a instead of bloom of youth that regularity of feature amiable joyousness of countenance have ever be accustomed to meet to love in former companion recoiled in horror from swarthy complexion sad visage haggard feature of present one spoke to in harsh guttural accent must have fled from advance then be in belly of whale when have become little used to tone be gratified by finding that attention be far from hostile after having received from few compliment began to think that be not quite so ugly discovered that object of inquires be fatal pomegranate still remained in hand admired beauty told that greatly esteemed individual who possessed mass of precious ore popanilla begged to undeceive courteously presented fruit sooner however have parted with apple of discord than countenance of companion changed immediately discovering real nature loudly accused popanilla of having deceived remonstrated recriminated great fish irritated by clamour lashed huge tail with one efficacious vomit spouted innocent popanilla high in air fell with dash into wave that be awakened by sound of own fall dreamer awoke amidst real chattering scuffling clamour troop of green monkey have be aroused by unusual occupation have taken opportunity of slumber to become acquainted with of first principle of science what progress have made be difficult to ascertain because one throwing tract at popanilla head immediately disappeared be said however that monkey have be since seen skipping about island with tail cut off that have even succeeded in passing off for human being among people who read novel be consequently unacquainted with morning adventure immediately rushed into popanilla mind proceeded forthwith to examine content of chest with advantage have not be yet enjoyed by who have previously peeped into monkey have not be composed to sleep by 'universal linguist ' of mr hamilton a for popanilla took up treatise on hydrostatics read straight through on spot for rest of day be hydrostatically mad must commonest incident connected with action conveyance of water take place without speculating on cause consequence so enraptured be popanilla with new accomplishment acquirement that by degree avoided attendance on usual evening assemblage devoted solely to acquirement of useful knowledge after short time absence be remarked greatest most gifted have only to leave coterie called world for few day to be fully convinced of what slight importance really be so popanilla delight of society especial favourite of woman be in very short time not even inquired after at first of course supposed that be in love that have slight cold that be writing memoir a supposition in due course take place in annals of society a circumstantial history in about week one knew lady have beard sneeze third have seen manuscript at end of week popanilla be forgotten chapter six month have elapsed since first chest of cargo of useful knowledge destined for fortunate maldives have be digested by recluse popanilla for recluse have now become great student be rather dull companion fantaisian friend during first study be a moody absent querulous a be most men of genius during mystical period of life be consequently avoided by men quizzed by woman consoled for neglect of first taunt of second by indefinite sensation that must day other turn out little being called great man a for mistress considered insulted by being addressed by man who have lost lock of hair when chest be exhausted popanilla be seized with profound melancholy nothing depresses man spirit more completely than self conviction of self conceit popanilla who have be accustomed to consider companion a most elegant portion of visible creation now discovered with dismay that fellow islander be nothing more than horde of useless savage mortification however be soon succeeded by proud consciousness that at rate be now civilised proud consciousness by fond hope that in short time might become civiliser like projector be not of sanguine temperament did trust in course of season isle of fantaisie might take station among nation be determined however not to be too rapid can not be expected ancient prejudice can in moment be eradicated new mode of conduct instantaneously substituted established popanilla like wise man determined to conciliate view be to be a liberal a principle be enlightened men must be forced to hing bigotry intolerance persecution be object of decided disapprobation resembling in particular great good men who have ever existed who have invariably maintained opinion so long a have be in minority popanilla appeared once more in world 'dear be that pop ' exclaimed lady have be doing with time travelling suppose one travel now really travelled men get quite bore where did get that coat if be coat such be style in fantaisian female saluted long absent popanilla really when man shuts up from world for considerable time fancy that in condescending to re enter have surely right to expect homage due to superior being salutation be awkward lady of england peculiarly excel in specie of annihilation while continue to drown puppy a daily do in sea of sarcasm think true englishman will hesitate one moment in giving preference for tact manner over vivacious french self possessing italian tolerant german woman be claptrap have doubt will sell book popanilla however have not re entered society with intention of subsiding into nonentity therefore took opportunity few minute after sunset just a companion be falling into dance to beg favour of being allowed to address sovereign only for one single moment beire ' said in mild tone of subdued superciliousness with must always address king while vindicates dignity satisfactorily prof that be above vulgar passion of envy beire ' let not encourage that fatal faculty of oratory so dangerous to free state therefore let give only beubstance of popanilla speech ' commenced address in manner somewhat resembling initial observation of pleasing pamphlet be fashion of present hour being intended to diffuse information among who have not enjoyed opportunity advantage of study be consequently of gay cheerful disposition treat of light subject in light polished style popanilla therefore spoke of man in savage state origin of society element of social compact in sentence must not have disgraced mellifluous pen of bentham from naturally digressed into agreeable disquisition on anglo saxon after little badinage on bill of right flew off to airy aper u of french revolution when have arrived at isle of fantaisie begged to inform majesty that man be born for something else besides enjoying be doubtless extremely pleasant to dance sing to crown with chaplet to drink wine be 'free to confess ' that did not imagine that most barefaced hireling of corruption must for moment presume to maintain that there be utility in pleasure if there be utility in pleasure be quite clear that pleasure must profit one if therefore be unprofitable be injurious because doe not produce profit be equivalent to loss therefore pleasure be losing business consequently pleasure be not pleasant substance of speech in parliamentary language mean printed edition of harangue contains be uttered in house about a much again also showed that man be not born for for society that interest of body be alone to be considered not of individual that nation might be extremely happy extremely powerful extremely rich although individual member of might at same time be miserable dependent in debt regretted to observe that one in island seemed in slightest decree conscious of object of being man be created for purpose object of existence be to perfect man be imperfect by nature because if nature have made perfect must have have want be only by supplying want that utility can be developed development of utility be therefore object of being attainment of great end cause of existence principle clear doubt rationally account for state of existence have puzzled many pseudo philosopher popanilla then went on to show that hitherto received definition of man be erroneous that man be walking animal talking animal cooking animal lounging animal debt incurring animal tax paying animal printing animal puffing animal developing animal development be discovery of utility by developing water get fish by developing earth get corn cash cotton by developing air get breath by developing fire get heat thus use of element be demonstrated to meanest capacity be not merely material development to alluded moral development be equally indispensable showed that be impossible for nation to think too much to do too much life of man be therefore to be passed in moral material development until have consummated perfection be opinion of popanilla that great result be by mean so near at hand a philosopher flattered that might possibly require half century before even most civilised nation must be said to have completed destiny of human race at same time intimated that there be various extraordinary mean by rather desirable result might be facilitated there be saying what building of new university might do of when built have objection to be appointed principal in answer to who affect to admire deficient system of existence style simplicity of manner who be perpetually committing blunder of supposing advance towards perfection only withdraws man further from primitive proper condition popanilla triumphantly demonstrated that such order a associated with phrase betate of nature ' ever existed bean said 'be called masterpiece of nature man be also a know most curious of machine now machine be work of art consequently masterpiece of nature be masterpiece of art object of mechanism be attainment of utility object of man who be most perfect machine be utility in highest degree can believe therefore that machine be ever intended for state never must have called forth power state in utility must ever have be attained state in there be want consequently demand consequently supply consequently competition consequently invention consequently profit only one great pernicious monopoly of comfort ease society without want be like world without wind be quite clear therefore there be such thing a nature nature be art art be nature that be most useful be most natural because utility be test of nature therefore steam engine be in fact much more natural production than mountain age seems a anti mountainous a be anti monarchical late writer insinuates that if english have spent million in levelling andes instead of excavating table land society might have be benefited monstrosity be decidedly useless therefore can neither be sublime beautiful a have be unanswerably demonstrated by recent writer on political aesthetic see also personal attack on mont blanc in second number of foreign quarterly review 'you be convinced therefore ' continued 'by observation that be impossible for individual nation to be too artificial in manner idea law general policy because in fact more artificial become nearer approach that state of nature of be so perpetually talking ' here observing that of audience appeared to be little sceptical perhaps only surprised told that what said must be true because entirely consisted of first principle first principle be ingredient of positive truth be immutable a may be seen by comparing first principle of eighteenth century with first principle of nineteenth after having thus preliminarily descanted for about two hour popanilla informed majesty that be unused to public speaking then proceeded to show that grand characteristic of social action of isle of fantaisie be total want of development observed with equal sorrow surprise respected wisdom of ancestor at same time one must deny that be barbarous ignorant highly esteemed also constitution regretted that be not in slightest degree adapted to existing want of society be not for destroying establishment on contrary be for courteously affording opportunity of self dissolution finished by re urging in strong term immediate development of island in first place great metropolis must be instantly built because great metropolis always produce great demand moreover popanilla have legal doubt whether country without capital must in fact be considered state apologising for having so long trespassed upon attention of assembly begged distinctly to state that have wish to see majesty fellow subject adopt new principle without examination without experience might commence on small scale let cut down forest by turning into ship house discover utility of timber let whole island be dug up let canal be cut dock be built elephant be killed directly that teeth might yield immediate article for exportation short time must afford sufficient trial in meanwhile must not be pledged to further measure might be considered only a experiment taking for granted that principle must be acted on taking into consideration site of island in map of world nature extent of resource magnificent race of human being variety of animal creation wonderfully fine timber undeveloped mineral treasure spaciousness of harbour various facility for extended international communication popanilla have hesitation in saying that short time must not elapse ere instead of passing life in state of unprofitable ease useless enjoyment might reasonably expect to be terror astonishment of universe to be able to annoy nation of consequence simple definite phrase derive from nation to whom be indebted during last century for other phrase about a definite rather more dangerous phrase of parliament need not observe be always made use of in oratory when orator can see meaning about a distinctly a sancho perceived charm of dulcinea very famous convenient phrase in politics experiment mean revolution here observing smile upon majesty countenance popanilla told king that be only chief magistrate have more right to laugh at than parish constable concluded by observing that although what at present urged might appear strange nevertheless if listener have be acquainted with character case of galileo turgot must then have seen a necessary consequence that system be perfectly correct man of extraordinary merit here chief magistrate no longer daring to smile burst into fit of laughter turning to courtier said ' have not idea what man be talking about know that make head ache give cup of wine let have dance ' applauded royal proposition pushing popanilla from one to until be fairly hustled to brink of lagoon soon forgot existence of bore in one word be cut when popanilla found standing alone looking grave while rest be gay began to suspect that be not so influential personage a previously imagined rather crest fallen sneaked home consoled for having nobody to speak to by reading amusing 'conversations on political economy chapter popanilla be discomposed be not discomfited consoled for royal neglect by recollection of many illustrious men who have be despised banished imprisoned burnt for maintenance of opinion century afterwards have be discovered to be truth did not forget that in still further century lately recognised truth have be re discovered to be falsehood then men be not le illustrious what wonder opinion be really erroneous since be not present one reasoning be equally conclusive consolatory popanilla therefore be not discouraged although deemed more prudent not to go out of way to seek audience of sovereign to be too anxious again to address public meeting nevertheless determined to proceed cautiously constantly propagating doctrine proselytizing in private unfortunately for popanilla did not enjoy one advantage founder of sect have duly appreciated by have be materially assisted be great unanswerable argument in favour of providence that constantly perceive that most beneficial result be brought about by least worthy most insignificant agent purest religion must never have be established have not be supported by sinner who felt burthen of old faith most free enlightened government be often generated by discontented disappointed dissolute now in isle of fantaisie unfortunately for revolutionizer there be not single grumbler unable therefore to make bad passion of fellow creature unconscious instrument of good purpose popanilla must have be contented to have monopolised wisdom of modern have not with unbaffled wit of inventor hit upon new expedient like socrates philosopher began to cultivate with sedulousness society of youth in short time lady of fantaisie be forced to observe that fair sex most unfashionably predominated in evening assemblage for young gentleman of island have suddenly ceased to pay graceful homage at altar of terpsichore in indian isle not to dance be a bad a heresy lady rallied recreant playful sarcasm failed of wonted effect in natural course of thing have recourse to remonstrance appeal be equally fruitless delicate creature tried reproach boyish cynic received with scowl answered with sneer woman fled in indignation to friendly monarch voluptuary of nature only shrugged shoulder smiled kissed away tear frown vanished a crowned long hair with rose 'if lad really show such bad taste ' said majesty 'why lord must do double duty dance with couple of at once consoled complimented crowned by king who must look sad woman forgot anger in increasing loyalty pupil of popanilla have sooner mastered first principle of science than began to throw off retired habit uncommunicative manner being not utterly ignorant of of rudiment of knowledge consequently having completed education be now duty a member of society to instruct not to study therefore courted instead of shunned fellow creature on occasion seized opportunity of assisting spread of knowledge voice of lecturing boy resounded in part of island tone be so shrill manner so presuming knowledge so crude general demeanour so completely unamiable that be impossible to hear without delight advantage admiration woman be not now only sufferer only complainant dinned to death men looked gloomy even king for first time in life looked grave must babel thought be that empire of bliss delightful fantaisie where to be ruler only proved that be most skilful in making others happy brow ached under light flowery crown a if be bound by barbarous circle of tyrant heavy with gem gold in despair have thought of leaving kingdom betaking to mermaid determination of most precious portion of subject saved empire a disciple of new school be daily demanding 'what be use of dancing what be use of drinking wine what be use of smelling flower woman like prescient politician began to entertain nervous suspicion that in time sage might even presume to question utility of homage in spite of grecian philosopher british essayist have be in habit of conceding to ever since eden rushed again to king like frightened deer something now be to be done monarch with expression of countenance almost amounted to energy whispered consolation king sent for popanilla message produced great sensation enlightened introducer of new principle have not be at court since be cut doubt majesty be at last impregnated with liberal spirit of age popanilla be assuredly to be premier in fact must be so be beent for there be precedent in fantaisie though there might be in other island for person being beent for ' not being premier disciple be in high spirit world be now to be regulated upon right principle be to be installed into right place 'illustrious popanilla ' said king 'you once did honour of making speech unfortunately for candidly confess be then incapable of understanding wonder a be first ever beard will not however easily forget effect produced upon have since considered duty a monarch to pay particular attention to suggestion now understand with sufficient clearness to be fully convinced of excellence in future intend to act upon without exception deviation to prove sincerity have determined to commence new system at once a think that without extension of international relation commercial interest of island will be incapable of furnishing tax intend to levy have determined therefore to fit out expedition for purpose of discovering new island forming relation with new islander be due to merit that must be appointed to command of further to testify infinite esteem for character complete confidence in ability make post captain on spot a axiom of school seems to be that everything can be made perfect at once without time without experience without practice without preparation have doubt with aid of treatise two will make consummate naval commander although have never be at sea in whole course of life

rapid fact be that one have power of originally circulating shell government if one by chance choose to violate arrangement make up for depriving of solitary walk on shore by instant submersion in sea 'then whole circulation of country be at mercy of government ' remarked popanilla summoning to recollection content of one of shipwrecked brochure have exercised so strange influence on destiny choose to issue 'that be always guarded against mere quarterly payment of interest upon national debt will secure ample supply thought be richest nation in world 't be true nevertheless if there be golden pyramid with base a big a whole earth apex touching heaven must not supply with sufficient metal to satisfy creditor dear sir ' exclaimed perplexed popanilla really be true how then can be said to be

begged landlord to procure immediately pamphlet on shell question while host be engaged in procuring luxury man entered room told popanilla that have walked that day two thousand five hundred pace that tax due to excise upon promenade be fifty crown captain stared remarked to excise officer that thought man pace be strange article to tax excise officer with great civility answered that doubt at first sight might appear rather strange that be only article left untaxed in vraibleusia that there be slight deficiency in last quarter revenue that therefore government have alternative that be tax did not press heavily upon individual because vraibleusians be of sedentary habit besides be opinion day more received among best judge that more man be taxed richer ultimately must prove concluded by saying that popanilla need not make uneasy about demand because if be ruined to morrow being foreigner be entitled by law of land to five thousand year whereas excise man being native born vraibleusian have claim upon government therefore hoped honour must give something to drink host now entered with 'novum organon of great periwinkle while popanilla devoured lively page of treatise

first introduced muscle shell speedily followed a commerce became more complicate have even be obliged to have recourse to snail shell popanilla retired to rest with admiration of people who thus converted to most useful purpose thing apparently so useless there be saying now what might not be done even with nutshell be evident that nation who contrived to be richest people in world while be over head ear in debt must be fast approaching to state of perfection finally sinking to sleep in bed of eiderdown popanilla be confirmed in prejudice against state of nature chapter skindeep called

health that unlike rest of human race have not degenerated from original form nature of man showed that be owing to vigour of mind body consequent upon fine health vraibleusia have become wonder of world that be so actively employed inferred that surely must not grudge income derived since income be in fact foundation of own profit then satisfactorily demonstrated to that if by circumstance be

preserved ambassador be conducted with great pomp to upper end of apartment where after hour walk excellency arrived at extremity of hall be colossal metallic statue of extraordinary appearance represented armed monarch head bust be of gold curling hair be crowned with imperial diadem body arm be of silver worked in semblance of complete suit of enamelled armour of feudal age thigh leg be of iron artist have clothed in bandaged hose of old saxon figure bore appearance of great antiquity have evidently be often repaired renovated since first formation workmanship be clearly of different era reparation from ignorance intention have often be effected with little deference to original design part of shoulder have be supplied by other though le precious metal roman imperial ornament have unaccountably be succeeded by le classic though more picturesque decoration of gothic armour on other hand great portion of chivalric precious material of body have be removed replaced by style substance resembling of lower limb in right hand statue brandished naked sword with left leant upon huge though extremely rich elaborately carved crosier trampled upon shivered lance broken chain 'your excellency perceives said secretary pointing to statue ours be mixed government ' popanilla be informed that extraordinary statue enjoyed faculty of intellectual being with additional advantage of faculty intellectual being enjoy possessed not only faculty of speech of speaking truth not only power of judgment of judging rightly not only habit of listening of listening attentively antiquity be so remote that most profound acute antiquarian have failed in tracing back origin aboriginal inhabitant however asserted that be work of one of ancestor a assertion be confirmed by tradition allegation be received might have be origin certain be that be now immortal for must never die to whomsoever might have be originally indebted for power not le sure be that be now omnipotent for must do thing thus alleged thus believed vraibleusians marvellous sublime people who with impotence of mortality have created government be immortal omnipotent generally speaking statue be held in great reverence viewed with great admiration by whole vraibleusian people there be few person indeed who asserted that creation of such statue be by mean so mighty business a have be fashion to suppose that be more than probable that with advantage afforded by scientific discovery of modern time must succeed in making more useful one indeed offered to accomplish provided present statue be preliminarily destroyed a be well assured that offer must never be accepted be generally treated by who refused a braggadocio there be many also who though in general greatly admired respected present statue affected to believe that though execution be wonderful interior machinery indeed far beyond power of present age nevertheless design be in many part somewhat rude figure altogether far from being well proportioned thought head too big too small that body be disproportionately little others on contrary that be so much too large that have appearance of being dropsical others maintained that leg be too weak for support of whole that must be rendered more important prominent member of figure while on contrary there be yet others who cried out that really member be already so extravagantly huge so coarse so ungenteel that quite marred general effect of beautiful piece of sculpture same difference existed about comparative excellence of three metal portion of body respectively formed admired gold maintained that if be not for head statue must be utterly useless others preferred silver must assert that body contained machinery must clearly be most precious portion while third party triumphantly argued that iron leg supported body head must surely be most valuable part since without statue must fall first party advised that in future reparation gold only must be introduced other party of course recommended with equal zeal own favourite metal be observable however that if under circumstance iron race chanced to fail in carrying point invariably voted for gold in preference to silver most contradictory opinion perhaps be be occasioned by instrument with statue be armed supported affected to be so frightened by mere sight of brandished sword although never moved that pretended be dangerous to live even under same sky with while others treating very lightly terror of warlike instrument must observe that much more be really to be apprehended from remarkable strength thickness of calm peace inspiring crosier that a long a government be supported by huge pastoral staff nothing must prevail against that must dare thing even stand without help of leg various opinion at least proved that although present might not be most miraculous statue must possibly be created be nevertheless quite impossible ever to form one must please party care of wonderful statue be entrusted to twelve beanagers whose duty be to wind up regulate complicated machinery who answered for good management by head be business to consult oracle upon occasion by decision to administer regulate affair of state alone be permitted to hear voice for statue never spoke in public save on rare occasion sentence be then really so extremely commonplace have not be for deep wisdom of general

participate in fray at first melee only excited amusement a lengthened wisely observed that public business greatly suffered by private squabble even ventured to imagine that safety of statue might be implicated by continuance last fear be futile popanilla asked private secretary party thought must ultimately succeed private secretary said that if present manager retained place thought that must not go out if on other hand be expelled by present opposition be probable that present opposition must become manager aboriginal thought party equally incompetent told popanilla long story about
