pleasant self love have be respected there have be total cessation of petty care enjoyment of establisnment without of solicitude have beheld civilization only in favoured aspect tasted only sunny side of fruit sometimes there be association with visit of still sweeter softer character on need not dwell glance can not be forgotten tone linger in ear sentiment subdues soul flirtation agitates fancy matter may be cause one too often drive away from country house rather hipped specific must be immediately to drive to be favourite remedy sometimes be not in power sometimes for instance must return to household god in shape of nursery though be not form assumed by penates of lord marney presence presence of individual so important so indefatigable be still required lordship have passed time at mowbray to satisfaction have have own way in everything selfishness have not received single shock have down law have not be questioned have dogmatised impugned assertion have passed current doctrine be accepted a orthodox lord mowbray suited liked consideration of so great personage lord marney also really liked pomp curious table luxurious life liked under roof rather than own not that be what be commonly called screw be to say be not mere screw be acute malicious saw everybody worth position at glance must not bear to expend choice wine costly viand on hanger on toad eater though at same time man encouraged required hanger on toad eater more lord marney have petty social vice none of petty social weakness soften harshness hideousness to receive prince of blood great peer must spare nothing have to fulfil of public duty of station performance must baffle criticism enjoyed making vicar of marney captain grouse drink claret be on wane praise bottle of burgundy that knew be pricked little thing affect little mind lord marney rose in very good humour be kept at station aggravated spleen during journey on railroad spoke little though more than once laboured to get up controversy be unable for lady marney who rather dreaded dull home be not yet in tone of mind must hail presence of little poinsett a full compensation for brilliant circle of mowbray replied in amiable monosyllable egremont in austere one for be musing over sybil gerard thousand thing a wild sweet everything went wrong day even captain grouse be not at abbey to welcome back be playing in cricket match marney against marham nothing else must have induced to be absent so happened that three fellow traveller have to dine together utterly weary of of other captain grouse be never more wanted must have amused lord marney relieved wife brother reported have be said done in neighbourhood during absence introduced new tone effected happy diversion leaving mowbray detained at station grouse away disagreeable letter letter ill humoured man chooses to esteem disagreeable seemed to announce climax lord marney ordered dinner to be served in small dining room be contiguous to saloon in lady marney when be alone generally passed evening dinner be silent sombre happily be also short lord marney tasted several dish ate of none found fault with own claret though butler have given choice bottle praised lord mowbray wondered where got wine at mowbray be good then for twentieth time wondered what must have induced grouse to fix cricket match day returned home though chose to forget that have never communicated to grouse even probable day on might be expected a for egremont must be admitted that be scarcely in more contented mood than brother though have not such insufficient cause for dark humour in quitting mowbray have quitted something else than merely agreeable circle enough have happened in visit to stir up deep recess of heart to prompt to investigate in unusual spirit cause attribute of position have found letter on return to abbey not calculated to dispel somewhat morbid feeling letter from agent urging settlement of election account primary cause of visit to brother lady marney left dining room brother be alone lord marney filled bumper drank off rapidly pushed bottle to brother then said again what cursed bore be that grouse be not here well can not say george particularly miss presence of captain grouse said brother lord marney looked at egremont pugnaciously then observed grouse be capital fellow one be never dull when grouse be here well for part said egremont much admire that amusement be dependent on effort of hanger on grouse be more hanger on than one else said lord marney rather fiercely perhaps not said egremont quietly be judge of such sort of people must like to know what be judge of certainly not of making agreeable to young lady arabella can not particularly charmed with result of visit to mowbray a far a lady joan be concerned arabella most intimate friend by bye if for other reason ought to have paid more attention can not pay attention unless be attracted said egremont have not ever ready talent of friend captain grouse know what mean by friend captain grouse captain grouse be more friend than friend one must have people about house to do thousand thing one can not do one can not trust to servant grouse doe capitally exactly be just what said capital hanger on if like still hanger on well what then suppose be hanger on may not have hanger on a well a other man of course may be not bound to regret absence who said be will regret absence if choose regret absence of grouse regret very much if did happen to be inextricably engaged in unfortunate match say may contradict if please that ought to have taken care that slimsey dined here to tell have happened be very glad omitted to do so said egremont prefer grouse to slimsey dare say do said lord marney filling glass looking very black must like have doubt to see fine gentleman saint like friend mr st lys at marney preaching in cottage filling people with discontent lecturing about low wage soliciting plot of ground for new church inveigling arabella into subscription to painted window certainly must like to see man like aubrey st lys at marney said egremont quietly rather doggedly if be here must soon see who must be master said lord marney must not succumb like mowbray one might a well have jesuit in house at once dare say st lys must care very little about entering house said egremont know be with great reluctance that ever came to mowbray castle dare say very great reluctance indeed very reluctant be make doubt to sit next to lady maud wonder doe not fly higher preach to lady joan be too sensible woman for such fanatical trick st lys think duty to enter society be reason why go to mowbray castle a well a to squalid court cellar of town take care that who be clad in purple fine linen will know state of neighbour can not at least plead ignorance for nonfulfilment of duty before st lys time family at mowbray castle might a well have not existed a far a benefiting miserable vicinage must be well perhaps for other district not le wretched for other family a high favoured a mowbrays if there be mr st lys on spot instead of mr slimsey suppose be meant for cut said lord marney wish people be a well off in part of country a be on estate get here eight shilling week always at least seven hand be at moment in employ except parcel of scoundrel who prefer woodstealing poaching who must prefer wood stealing poaching if gave double wage rate of wage be nothing certainty be thing man at marney may be sure of seven shilling week for at least nine month in year for other three can go to house very proper place for be heated with hot air have comfort even marney abbey be not heated with hot air have often thought of make mad sometimes to think of lazy pampered menial passing life with back to great roaring fire be afraid of flue wonder talking of fire that be not more afraid of burning rick said egremont be infernal lie said lord marney very violently what be said egremont that there be incendiarism in neighbourhood why there be fire day after came that have nothing to do with wage be accident examined into so did grouse so did slimsey sent about everywhere told be sure fire be purely accidental to go see about came back agreed that be purely accidental dare say did said egremont one have discovered accident for part believe be spontaneous combustion said lord marney be satisfactory solution said egremont for part fire being fact being painfully notorious that people of marney well sir people of marney said lordship fiercely be without question most miserable population in county did mr st lys tell that interrupted lord marney white with rage no not mr lys one better acquainted with neighbourhood will know informant name said lord marney with energy informant be woman said egremont lady maud suppose second hand from mr st lys mv informant be woman one of people said egremont poacher drab care what woman say high low always exaggerate misery of family who live upon seven even eight shilling week can scarcely be exaggerated what must know about did ever live on seven eight shilling week what can know about people who pas time at london club in fine country house suppose want people to live a do at house dinner at boodle say that family can live very well on seven shilling week on eight shilling very well indeed poor be very well off at least agricultural poor very well off indeed income be certain that be great point have care anxiety always have resource always have house people without care require a much food a whose life entail anxiety see how long live compare rate of mortality among with of manufacturing district incendiarism indeed if there have be proper rural police thing a incendiarism must never have be heard of there be pause lord marney dashed off bumper egremont sipped wine at length said argument made forget principal reason george why be glad that be alone together to day be sorry to bore be bored deucedly find letter from agent election account must be settled why thought be settled how do mean thought mother have given thousand pound doubt of be long ago disposed of in opinion quite enough for seat in time instead of paying to get into parliament man ought to be paid for entering there may be good deal in what say said egremont be too late to take view of business expense have be incurred must be met see that said lord marney have paid one thousand pound there be balance unsettled when be there ever contest without balance being unsettled remember hearing father often say that when stood for county grandfather paid more than hundred thousand pound yet know to day there be account unsettled regularly year receive anonymous letter threatening with fearful punishment if pay one hundred fifty pound for breakfast at jolly tinker jest

particularly a have given thousand pound in fact after come out of pocket have said to before what doe mean fought battle at instigation of family from feeling of own be head of family be consulted on step unless have concluded that be with sanction certainly must not have made appearance on hustings be very glad did though said lord marney parliament be great point for class in day especially more even than in old time be truly rejoiced at success mortified whig about most confoundedly people thought there be only one family in world to have richmond malton getting in for old borough be really coup well now to retain interest said egremont quick payment of expense be most efficient way believe have got six year perhaps seven said lord marney long before hope to find husband of lady joan fitz warene wish to connect two contingency said egremont firmly be inseparable said lord marney what do mean mean that think pedantic acquittance of electioneering account be in highest degree ridiculous can not interfere in legal expense be say paid if be not must feel bound a head of family to defray can go further can not bring to sanction expenditure for certainly very unnecessary perhaps much fear for illegal very immoral purpose really be determination after most mature reflection prompted by sincere solicitude for benefit well george have often suspected now feel quite

felt surprised that father must have met mr franklin not have mentioned circumstance naturally interesting to egremont be about to speak when street door be opened be to part again explanation be sybil to be left with father who be evidently in haste perhaps have great tendency to give explanation feeling of ingenuous spirit urged egremont personally to terminate prolonged misconception will permit hope said appealing a much to gerard a to daughter to enter with for few moment be not possible to resist request yet be conceded on part of gerard with cordiality so entered large gloomy hail of house towards end of long passage gerard opened door went into spacious melancholy room situate at back of house looking upon small square plot of dank grass in midst of rose very weather stained

of room however though dingy be not squalid what with spaciousness extreme repose association raised by such few image a did suggest impression on mind of spectator be far from unpleasing partaking indeed of vague melancholy spring from contemplation of past at time softens spirit gerard walked to window looked at grass plot sybil seating invited guest to follow example egremont not without agitation seemed suddenly to make effort to collect then in voice not distinguished by accustomed clearness said explained yesterday to one who hope may still call friend why assumed name to have right sybil started little slightly stared did not speak must be happy if also must give credit in taking step at least for motif of need not be ashamed even added in hesitating voice even if deemed conduct indiscreet eye met astonishment be imprinted on countenance of sybil uttered not word father whose back be turned to did not move be told continued egremont that impassable gulf divided rich from poor be told that privileged people formed two nation governed by different law influenced by different manner with thought sympathy in common with innate inability of mutual comprehension believed that if be indeed case ruin of common country be at hand must have endeavoured feebly perchance not without zeal to resist catastrophe possessed station entailed on portion of responsibility to obtain that knowledge must alone qualify for beneficial action resolved to live without suspicion among fellow subject who be estranged from even void of celebrity a be must not have done without

must say reverential regard tone of passionate emotion ceased sybil with countenance beautiful disturbed gazed at for instant seemed about to speak trembling lip refused office then with effort turning to gerard said father be amazed tell then who be gentleman who address brother of lord marney sybil said gerard turning to brother of lord marney repeated sybil with air almost of stupor yes said egremont member of family of sacrilege of oppressor of people whom have denounced to with such withering elbow of sybil rested on arm of chair cheek upon hand a egremont said word shaded face be thus entirely unseen for moment there be silence then looking up with expression grave serene a if have just emerged from deep thinking sybil said be sorry for word sorry for pain unconsciously gave sorry indeed for have past that father have lost pleasant friend why must be lost said egremont mournfully yet with tenderness why must not still befriends oh sir said sybil haughtily be one of who believe gulf be impassable yes added slightly with singular grace waving hand somewhat turning away head utterly impassable there be tumult of mind when like great convulsion of nature seems anarchy returning chaos yet often in moment of vast disturbance a in material strife new principle of order new impulse of conduct develops control regulates brings to harmonious consequence passion element seemed only to threaten despair subversion so be with egremont looked for moment in despair upon maiden walled out from sympathy by prejudice conviction more impassable than mere consequence of class looked for moment only for moment in despair found in tortured spirit energy responded to exigency of occasion even otherwise embarrassing presence of gerard must not have prevented just at moment door opened morley person entered room book chapter morley paused a recognised egremont then advancing to gerard followed by companion said be mr hatton of whom be speaking last night who claim to be ancient acquaintance of yours perhaps must rather say of poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with clear blue eye then added be of great service to in youth one be not apt to forget such thing

a be speaking word turned addressed to sybil beheld with little interest mysterious name have sounded so often in young ear be associated with so many strange high hope dark blending of doubt apprehension discordant thought hatton in appearance realised little of fancy in sybil have sometime indulged with regard to that appearance be prepossessing frank even benevolent expression played upon intelligent handsome countenance once rich brown hair still long though very thin be so arranged a naturally to conceal baldness be dressed with great simplicity with remarkable taste care did repose suavity of manner hushed tone of voice detract from favourable effect that always at once produced qui laborat orat said sybil with smile be privilege of people of whom be one said hatton bowing well recollecting that be addressing daughter of chartist delegate be labour labour said sybil be yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there be so much of beauty of goodness by fine maxim of church be held to include force efficacy of prayer be sure must complain of toil must benefit said hatton then addressing again to gerard led to distant part of room where be soon engaged in earnest converse morley at same moment approached sybil spoke to in subdued tone egremont feeling embarrassed advanced bade farewell rose returned salute with ceremony then hesitating while soft expression came over countenance held forth hand retained for moment withdrew be with more than hour continued morley at first recollected nothing even name of gerard though received a familiar to seemed to produce little impression recollected nothing of paper be clear that must have be quite insignificant whatever be doubtless have now a never destroyed paper must order search to be made for so on be about to withdraw when asked carelessly question about father what be doing whether be married have child led to very long conversation in suddenly seemed to take great interest at first talked of writing to see father offered that gerard must call upon took down direction in order that might write to father give appointment when observing that be westminster said that carriage be ordered to go to house of lord in quarter of hour that if not inconvenient to must propose must at once accompany thought might be result must be satisfaction to gerard at last to see man of whom have talked thought so much so be here did well good stephen a always do said sybil with musing abstracted air one have so much forethought so much energy a threw glance at immediately withdrew eye have met hers be kind calm egremont said morley rather hurriedly abruptly looking on ground how came here when discovered yesterday father agreed that must not mention to mystification of have be dupe did wrong said sybil there be wisdom like frankness have told must not have be here today met addressed only recognised acquaintance who have once contributed so much to pleasantness of life have not accompanied to door met father precipitated explanation on part found have not be given by others might have remained in ignorance hereafter might have produced inconvenience be right said morley looking at rather keenly have of opened too unreservedly before aristocrat must hope that none of have said to word that wish to be forgotten said sybil chose to wear disguise can hardly quarrel with frankness with spoke of order family for rest have not be injured from learning something of feeling of people by living among yet if anything be to happen to morrow said morley rest assured man have eye on can walk into government office like tell tale for though one of pseudo opposition moment people move faction become united sybil turned looked at then said what must happen to morrow that must care for government being acquainted with know everything meet in very sight pursue avowed legal aim by legal mean do not what then be there to fear why must anything happen must make apprehensive be very well at moment said morley may continue well popular assembly breed turbulent spirit sybil father take leading part be great orator be in element in clamorous fiery life doe not much suit be man of closet convention a well know be never much to taste charter be coarse specific for social evil spirit must cure ill must be of deeper finer mood then why be here said sybil morley shrugged

have not done be still movement great one must work for end try to shape to form if have refused to be leader must not have prevented movement must only have secured own insignificance father have not fear be full of hope exultation said sybil surely be great thing that people must have parliament lawfully meeting in open day delegate from whole realm declaring grievance in language must not disgrace conquering race have in vain endeavoured to degrade when heard father speak other night heart glowed with emotion eye be suffused with tear be proud to be daughter gloried in race of

in long tress of luxuriant richness be drawn off forehead be very throne of thought majesty while rich lip still quivered with sensibility expressed impassioned truth father sybil stand alone at length morley replied surrounded by votary who have nothing enthusiasm to recommend by emulous intriguing rival who watch word action in order that may discredit conduct ultimately secure downfall

necessary in speech from throne not yet said companion what will to morrow bring forth after be only turn out can not recast majesty speech bring in rebellion closed mill instead of loyalty good harvest must be bore well will see to morrow colleague left room now for deputation said gentleman in downing street of thing in world dislike deputation care how much labour in closet house real work machine be advanced receiving deputation be like sham marching immense dust progress to listen to view a if did not know what view be before stated to put on countenance of respectful candour while be developing exploded impracticable system be not that at practised crisis permit to see conviction slowly stealing over conscience believe fellow must never stop can not really receive deputation must leave to hoaxem gentleman in downing street rang bell well mr hoaxem resumed gentleman in downing street a faithful functionary entered there be deputation understand to day must receive a be going to windsor what be there be only two sir of moment rest must easily manage two in first place there be friend colonel bosky member for county of calfshire deputation of tenant farmer pah must be attended to member have made strong representation to that really can not longer vote with government unless treasury assist in satisfying constituent what do want statement of grievance high tax low price mild expostulation gentle hint that have be thrown over by friend polish corn holstein cattle british income tax well know what to say said gentleman in downing street tell generally that be quite mistaken prove to particularly that only object have be to render protection more protective by making practical divesting of surplusage of odium that foreign corn can come in at fifty five shilling that there be not enough cattle in holstein to supply parish of pancras daily with beef steak that a for income tax will be amply compensated for by diminished cost of living through agency of very tariff of be so superficially complaining diminished cost of living said mr hoaxem little confused must not that assurance humbly suggest clash little with previous demonstration that have arranged that reduction of price must take place not at previous demonstration be of course true at same time must impress upon necessity of general view to form opinion of particular instance a for example gentleman of five thousand pound per annum pay to income tax by bye always call property tax one hundred fifty pound year well have materially reduced duty on eight hundred article consumption of of article by establishment of five thousand pound per annum can not be le than one pound per article reduction of price can not be le than moiety therefore saving of four hundred per annum placed against deduction of property tax leaf clear increase of income of two hundred fifty pound per annum by see that property tax in fact increase income see said mr hoaxem with admiring glance what be to say to deputation of manufacturer of mowbray complaining of great depression of trade total want of remunerating profit must say exactly reverse said gentleman in downing street show how much have done to promote revival of trade first of in making provision cheaper cutting off at one blow protection on corn a for example at moment under old law duty on foreign wheat must have be twenty seven shilling quarter under new law be thirteen to be sure wheat must come in at price that doe not alter principle then a to live cattle show how have entirely opened trade with continent in live cattle enlarge upon subject be speculative admits of expensive estimate if there be dissenter on deputation who having freed negro have subject left for foreign sympathy hint at torture of bullfight immense consideration to humanity that instead of being speared at andalusian toro will probably in future be cut up at smithfield cheapness of provision will permit to compete with foreigner in neutral market in time beat in own be complete compensation too for property tax impress upon be great experiment entirely for interest ring change on great measure great experiment till be time to go down make house official duty of course must not be interfered with will take hint have doubt will get through business very well mr hoaxem particularly if be 'frank explicit ' be right line to take when wish to conceal own mind to confuse mind of others good morning book chapter two day after conversation in downing street special messenger arrived at marney abbey from lord lieutenant of county duke
