confounded absolutely mute at length lady annabel spoke tone be severe choking very different to usual silvery voice be sorry daughter must feel so keenly want of parent love ' said ladyship what must not venetia have given for power speech seemed to have deserted for ever there sat mute motionless with eye fixed on table with burning cheek a if be conscious of having committed act of shame a if have be detected in base degrading deed yet what have done daughter have delicately alluded to grief at loss of parent expressed keen sense of deprivation be autumnal afternoon doctor masham looked at sky after long pause made observation about weather then requested permission to order horse a evening came on apace have distance to ride lady annabel rose doctor with countenance unusually serious offered arm venetia followed like criminal in few minute horse appeared lady annabel bid adieu to friend in usual kind tone with usual sweet smile then without noticing venetia instantly retired to own chamber be mother mother who never before quitted for instant without sign symbol of affection playful word of love winning smile passing embrace seemed to acknowledge that pang of even momentary separation must only be alleviated by graceful homage to heart what have done venetia be about to follow lady annabel checked agony at having offended mother for first time be blended with strange curiosity a to cause hesitating indignation at treatment venetia remained anxiously awaiting return of lady annabel ladyship did not reappear instant astonishment grief of venetia increased be first domestic difference have occurred between shocked much thought of plantagenet mr cadurcis there be mortifying resemblance however slight between respective situation of two family venetia too have quarrelled with mother that mother who for fourteen year have only looked upon with fondness joy who have be ever kind without being ever weak have rendered child happy by making good that mother whose beneficent wisdom have transformed duty into delight superior yet gentle being so indulgent yet so just so gifted yet so condescending who dedicated knowledge time care intellect to daughter venetia threw upon couch wept be first tear of unmixed pain that have ever shed be said by household of venetia when child that have never cried not single tear have ever sullied that sunny face surrounded by scene of innocence image of happiness content venetia smiled on world smiled on radiant heroine of golden age have indeed wept over sorrow departure of cadurcis be soft shower of sympathy affection sent from warm heart like drop from summer sky now grief be agony brow throbbed hand be clenched heart beat with tumultuous palpitation streaming torrent came scalding down cheek like fire rather than tear instead of assuaging emotion seemed on contrary to increase fierce fervid power sun have set red autumnal twilight have died away shadow of night be brooding over hall of

friend in hurry of society must scarcely dwell upon association be calculated to call up yet more than once found quite absent dwelling on sweet recollection of cherbury that have so loved ever anon tone of familiar voice caught ear so that almost made start be not le striking because a masham be seated on same side of table a cadurcis eye have not become habituated to bishop presence sometimes almost doubted seized first opportunity after dinner of engaging old tutor in conversation took affectionately by arm led a if unintentionally to sofa apart from rest of company seated by side cadurcis be agitated for be about to inquire of whom must not mention without emotion 'be long since have seen friend said lordship indeed may call ' 'lady annabel herbert ' said bishop cadurcis bowed

circle few week indeed passed ere ladyship taught even to contemplate possibility of union between daughter lord cadurcis change have occurred in own feeling position have in estimation removed very considerable barrier to such result must not become again to urge peculiarity of temperament a insuperable objection to marriage be out of question even if conscience of lady annabel now that be so

great improbability of such event occurring now that venetia have a be resigned connection with native country a to daughter marrying foreigner very idea be intolerable to venetia appeared therefore

have never have place in herbert temperament now be insensible even to emulation spoke of cadurcis a thought with highest admiration a one without rival in whose power be to obtain imperishable fame be liveliest pleasure to assist full development of such intellect to pour to with lavish hand treasure of taste learning fancy meditation kind heart winning manner subdued perfect temper remembrance of relation bore to venetia completed spell bound cadurcis to with finest feeling of nature be indeed intercourse peculiarly beneficial to cadurcis whose career have hitherto tended rather to development of power than refinement of genius to whom active communion with equal spirit of more matured intelligence be incident rather to be desired than expected herbert cadurcis therefore spent morning together sometimes in library sometimes wandering in chestnut wood sometimes sailing in boat of brig for be fond of sea in excursion george be in general companion have become great favourite
