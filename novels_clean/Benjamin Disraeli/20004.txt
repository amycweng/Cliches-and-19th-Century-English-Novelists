must of course assumed independently of own interesting personal quality enlist kind feeling of astarte in favour difficulty be to obtain audience of astarte for fakredeen keferinis be to be found other mean of achieving result be obvious about two hour before noon baroni brought word that have contrived to see cypros from whom gathered that astarte have repaired to great temple of god

halo a tancred recognising queen withdrew few pace shadow clearly defined rested on glowing wall of rock temple astarte uttered exclamation rose quickly from kneeling position looking round eye met of lord montacute instantly withdrew gaze blushing deeply ' be about to retire ' murmured tancred 'and why must retire ' said astarte in soft voice looking up 'there be moment when solitude be sacred ' be too much alone often of late especially feel painful isolation moved forward re entered together chief temple then emerged into sunlight stood beneath broad ionic portico beholding strange scene around then be that tancred observing that astarte cared not to advance deeming occasion very favourable to wish proceeded to explain to cause of venturing to intrude on morning spoke with earnestness if phrase may be used that passionate repose distinguished enlarged on character of besso great virtue amiable quality benevolence unbounded generosity sought in way to engage kind feeling of astarte in favour of family to interest in character of eva on dilated with eloquence of heart truly almost did justice to admirable quality vivid mind lofty spirit heroic courage occasion be too delicate to treat of personal charm of woman did not conceal own deep sense of obligation to eva for romantic expedition to desert in behalf can understand then concluded tancred 'what must have be astonishment grief when found yesterday captive be consolation to to remember in whose power have fallen hasten to throw at foot to supplicate for safety freedom ' 'yes can understand said astarte in low tone

astarte changed though lost painful vindictive expression did not assume one of le distress after moment pause murmured be true 'who must have told otherwise ' enemy of hers of family ' continued astarte in low voice speaking a if absorbed in thought 'one who admitted to long hoarded vengeance against house ' then turning abruptly looked tancred full in face with glance of almost fierce
