revived in england whig have ever be opposed to national institution because be adverse to establishment of oligarchy local institution supported by landed gentry check hence love of centralisation hatred of unpaid magistrate independent hierarchy check hence affected advocacy of toleration patronage of dissenter power of crown check therefore always labour to reduce sovereign to nonentity by establishment of cabinet have virtually banished king from own council above parliament of england check therefore may be observed that whig at time be quarrelling with portion of august estate despair of destroying parliament by by alone can succeed in object corruption for one part force for other then be motto in attempted to govern country by house of common because aristocracy be then

be to prolong existence of first house of common in must command majority in present instance became sincerely parliamentary reformer for by parliamentary reform must alone subsist art be dedicated so to contrive in reformation own interest must secure irresistible predominance how be oligarchical party to predominate in popular election here be difficulty whig have resource from own limited rank to feed muster of popular levy be obliged to look about for ally wherewith to form new popular estate estate of common modelled on equitable principle of property population must have be fatal to whig therefore very dexterously adopted small minority of nation consisting of sectarian inaugurating a people with vast bewildering train of hocus pocus ceremony invested dissenter with political power by

late tool of selfish faction slave of stern usurper chapter iv english constitution chapter on english constitution be natural episode on spirit of whiggism there be connection between subject that spirit of whiggism be hostile to english constitution political institution ever yet flourished have be more topic of discussion among writer of country party than famous establishment of 'king lord common institution ever yet flourished of character have be more misrepresented more misconceived one fact alone will illustrate profound ignorance perplexed idea present whig leader of house of common member of family who pique on constitutional reputation author who have even written elaborate treatise on polity in one of speech delivered only so late a last session of parliament declared desire determination to uphold present settlement of 'three estate of realm viz king lord common now gracious majesty be more estate of realm than lord john russell three estate of realm be estate of lord spiritual estate of lord temporal estate of common estate be popular class established into political order be section of nation invested for public common good with certain power privilege lord john russell first writes upon english constitution then reform yet even at moment be absolutely ignorant of what consists political estate be complete independent body now power be independent be necessarily irresponsible sovereign be responsible because be not estate be responsible through minister be responsible to estate to alone when whig obtained power in found three estate of realm opposed to government therefore must not proceed resolved therefore to remodel declared that house of common be house of people that people be not properly represented consequently enlarged estate of common increased number of privileged order who appear by representative in lower house of parliament rendered estate of common more powerful by proceeding because rendered more numerous did not render representative one jot more representative of people throwing common of ireland out of question for can not speculate upon political order so unsettled that have be thrice remodelled during present century individual sent up at last general election representative to westminster well be person people of england grant that be grant that member be divided into two equal portion well then people of england consist of person know that there be well disposed person tremble at reasoning because although admit justice allege lead to universal suffrage must not show assert that house of people be not elected by people admit must not show that house of people be not elected by people must show that house of common be not house of people that never be intended to be house of people that if be admitted to be so by courtesy become so in fact be over with english constitution be quite impossible that whole people can be branch of legislature if whole people have power of making law be folly to suppose that will allow assembly of individual solitary being on throne to thwart sovereign will pleasure deny that people can govern self government be contradiction in term form government may assume power must be exercised by minority of number will perhaps be reminded of ancient republic answer that ancient republic be a aristocratic community a flourished in middle age demo of athens be oligarchy living upon slave there be great slave population even in united state if society of yesterday be to illustrate argument on ancient civilisation be useless to argue question abstractedly phrase people be sheer nonsense be not political term be phrase of natural history people be specie civilised community be nation now nation be work of art work of time nation be

religious state secures alike orthodoxy toleration church sect agriculture manufacture military service statute law supplementary equity adventurous commerce landed tenure unprecedented system of credit form among many others such variety of interest apparently so conflicting that think even abbe sieyes must devise scheme by nation must be absolutely definitely represented framer of english constitution be fortunately not of school of abbe sieyes first object be to make free next to keep so while therefore selected equality a basis of social order took care to blend man ambition with perpetuity of state unlike levelling equality of modern day ancient equality of england elevates creates learned in human nature english constitution hold out privilege to subject a inducement to do duty a have secured freedom justice even property to humblest of commonwealth so pursuing same system of privilege have confided legislature of realm to two order of subject order however in english citizen may be constitutionally enrolled lord common two estate of peer be personally summoned to meet in chamber more extensive single estate of common meet by representative be political order complete in character independent in authority legally irresponsible for exercise of power be trustee of nation not master there be high court of chancery in public opinion of nation at large exercise vigilant control over privileged class of community to be equitably morally amenable estimating therefore moral responsibility of political estate may fairly be maintained that instead of being irresponsible responsibility of lord exceeds that of common house of common not being estate of realm only representative of estate owes to nation responsibility legal moral house of common be responsible only to privileged order who be constituent between lord common there be prime difference that lord be known seen marked common be unknown invisible unobserved lord meet in particular spot common be scattered over kingdom eye of nation rest upon lord few in number notable in position eye of nation wanders in vain for common far more numerous far le remarkable a substitute nation appeal to house of common sometimes appeal in vain for if majority of common choose to support representative in course of conduct adverse to opinion of nation house of common will set nation at defiance have done so once may never repeat that destructive career such be two house of parliament most illustrious assembly since roman senate grecian areopagus of be 'house of people alike represent 'nation chapter v true democracy there be two proposition however at first glance may appear to contradict popular opinion of day be nevertheless a believe just true be first that there be probability of ever establishing more democratic form of government than present english constitution second that recent political change of whig be in fact departure from democratic spirit of constitution form government may assume spirit must be determined by law regulate property of country may have senate consul may have hereditary title may dub householder inhabitant citizen if spirit of law preserve mass of property in particular class government of country will follow disposition of property so also may have apparent despotism without formal popular control with aristocracy either natural artificial spirit of government may nevertheless be republican thus ancient polity of rome in best day be aristocracy government of constantinople be nearest approach to democracy on great scale maintained during great period history offer constitution of france during last half century have be fast approaching that of turk barbarous jacobin blended modern equality with refined civilisation of ancient france barbarous ottoman blended equality with refined civilisation of ancient rome paris secured to jacobin luxury system never must have produced byzantium served same purpose to turk french turbaned prototype commenced system with popular enthusiasm terminated with general subjection napoleon louis philippe be playing same part a suleimans mahmouds chamber be second rate divan prefect inferior pacha solitary being rule alike in seraglio tuileries whole nation bow to despotism on condition that have other master save disposition of property in england throw government of country into hand of natural aristocracy believe that scheme of suffrage method of election must divert power into other quarter be necessary consequence of present social state believe wider popular suffrage more powerful must be natural aristocracy seems to inevitable consequence admit proposition on clear understanding that extension must be established on fair not factious basis here then arises question of ballot into merit of will take opportunity of entering recording only now opinion that in present arrangement of constituency even ballot must favour power of natural aristocracy that if ballot be simultaneously introduced with fair not factious extension of suffrage must produce difference whatever in ultimate result quitting then consideration let arrive at important point be there probability of different disposition of property in england disposition of property by producing very general similarity of condition must throw government of country into hand of individual whom popular esteem fancy might select appears to that question can only be decided by ascertaining genius of english nation what be prime characteristic of english mind apprehend may safely decide upon being industry taking general not superficial survey of english character since reformation thousand circumstance convince that salient point in national psychology be passion for accumulating wealth of industry be chief instrument value freedom principally because leaf unrestricted in pursuit reverence for law for be established also eminently distinguishes english nation be occasioned by conviction next to liberty order be most efficacious assistant of industry thus see that great revolution must occur in history of nation when happen here produce permanent effect upon social state revolution be brought about by passion of creative mind taking advantage for own aggrandisement of peculiar circumstance in national progress be never called for by great body of nation church be plundered long rebellion maintained dynasty changed parliament abolished when storm be passed feature of social landscape remain unimpaired there be trace of hurricane earthquake volcano have be tumult of atmosphere have neither toppled down old spire palace swallowed up city seat of learning blasted ancient wood swept away port harbour english nation ever recurs to ancient institution institution have alike secured freedom order after ebullition find when sky be clear again at work toiling on at eternal task of accumulation there be difference between revolution of england revolution of continent european revolution be struggle against privilege english revolution be struggle for if new class rise in state becomes uneasy to take place in natural aristocracy of land desperate faction wily leader take advantage of desire revolution be consequence thus whig in present day have risen to power on shoulder of manufacturing interest to secure in post whig have given new interest undue preponderance new interest having obtained object be content manufacturer like other englishman be a aristocratic a landlord manufacturer begin to lack in movement under walpole whig played same game with commercial interest century have passed commercial interest be a devoted to constitution a manufacturer soon will be having genuine party whig seek for succour from irish papist lord john russell however be only imitating pym under same circumstance in when english movement be satisfied constitutional party headed by such men a falkland hyde be about to attain power pym friend in despair at declining influence close division in once unanimous parliament fled to scotch covenanters entered into 'close compact ' for destruction of church of england a price of assistance so event repeat if study of history be really to profit nation at present day will take care that same result always occur from same event when passion have little subsided industrious ten pounder who have struggled into privileged order of common proud of having obtained first step of aristocracy will be last man to assist in destroying other gradation of scale posterity may yet ascend while new member of manufacturing district have eye already upon neighbouring park avail of political position to become county magistrate meditates upon baronetcy dream of coroneted descendant nation that esteem wealth a great object of existence will submit to law secure enjoyment of wealth now deprive wealth of greatest source of enjoyment a well a of best security if deprive of power english nation therefore insists that property will be qualification for power whole scope of law custom be to promote favour accumulation of wealth perpetuation of property can not alter therefore disposition of property in country without change national character far from present age being hostile to supremacy of property there have be period of history where property have be more esteemed because there have be period when nation have be so industrious believing therefore that change will occur in disposition of property in country can not comprehend how government can become more democratic consequence of wealth be aristocratic constitution consequence of love of liberty be aristocratic constitution founded on equality of civil right who can deny aristocratic constitution resting on basis where legislative even executive office may be obtained by subject of realm be in fact noble democracy english constitution faithful to national character secures to enjoyment of property delight of freedom honour be perpetual reward of industry englishman be toiling to obtain be constitution to englishman will always be devoted except be whig in next chapter will discus second proposition chapter vi result of whiggism tory assert that whole property of country be on side whig wringing hand over lost election bellowing about 'intimidation ' seem to confess soft impeachment prime organ also assures that man with l per annum be opposed to yet whig radical writer have recently published by way of consolation to penniless proselyte list of twenty duke marquis who assure be devoted to 'liberal principle whose revenue in paroxysm of economical rhodomontade assert must buy up whole income of rest of hereditary peerage whig radical writer seem puzzled to reconcile anomalous circumstance with indisputably forlorn finance of faction in general now little tract on bepirit of whiggism ' may perhaps throw light upon perplexing state of affair for see in only fresh illustration of principle have demonstrated from whole current of history to form basis of whig policy union of oligarchical wealth mob poverty be very essence of bepirit of whiggism ' english constitution from tithing man to peer of parliament have thrown whole government of country into hand of who be qualified by property to perform duty of respective office have secured that diffused general freedom without national industry must neither have fair play just reward by variety of institution while prevent who have property from invading social commonwealth in whose class industrious citizen have right to register offer also equally powerful check to ambitious fancy of great family over whose liberal principle huge income whig radical writer gloat with self complacency of lackey at equipage of master there be ever union in perverted sense between who be beneath power who wish to be above oligarchy despotism be usually established by agency of deluded multitude crown with constitutional influence over military service parliament of two house watching other proceeding with constitutional jealousy independent hierarchy not least independent magistracy be serious obstacle in progressive establishment of scheme of government small knot of great family duke marquis whose revenue according to government organ must buy up income of whole peerage naturally wish to introduce find therefore throughout whole period of more modern history powerful section of great noble ever at war with national institution checking crown attacking independence of house of parliament in happen to be in minority matter patronising sect to reduce influence of church playing town against country to overcome authority of gentry be evident that aspiring oligarch a party can have little essential strength can count upon nothing retainer to secure triumph of cause therefore be forced to manoeuvre with pretext while aim at oligarchical rule apparently advocate popular right hold out consequently inducement to uneasy portion of nation to enlist under standard play discontented minority against prosperous majority dubbing partisan people flatter that project be irresistible attack be unexpected brisk dashing well matured dexterously mystified before nation be roused to danger oligarchical object be often obtained then oligarchy entrenched in power count upon nation to defend from original revolutionary ally if succeed dynasty be changed parliament reformed movement be stopped if tory conservative can not arrest fatal career whig have originally impelled then away go national institution crown fall from king brow crosier be snapped in twain one house of parliament be sure to disappear gentleman of england dexterously dubbed malignants anti reformer other phrase in fashion dreg of nation estate install in hall 'liberal principle having thus gloriously triumphed after due course of plunder bloodshed imprisonment ignoble tyranny people of england sighing once more to be english nation secure order by submitting to despot in time when have got rid of despot combine ancient freedom with newly regained security by re establishing english constitution whig of present day have made assault upon nation with usual spirit have already succeeded in controlling sovereign in remodelling house of common have menaced house of lord violently assailed church reconstructed corporation will take two most comprehensive measure have succeeded in carrying be at time certainly very popular apparently of very democratic character reform of house of common reconstruction of municipal corporation let see whether great measure have in fact increased democratic character of constitution not whether veil oligarchical project be in fact popular concession inevitably offered by whig in oligarchical career result of whig remodelling of order of common have be that have placed nomination of government in hand of popish priesthood be that great advance of public intelligence popular liberty be parliamentary nominee of m'hale kehoe more germane to feeling of english nation more adapted to represent interest than parliamentary nominee of howard percy papist majority again be superstructure of basis formed by scotch presbyterian english dissenter in general returned by small constituency of small town class whose number influence intelligence wealth have be grossly exaggerated for factious purpose class avowedly opposed to maintenance of english constitution see that cause of popular power have much risen even with addition of leaven if suffrage of common of england be polled together hustings book of last general election will prove that very considerable majority of number be opposed to present government that therefore under new democratic scheme great body of nation be by hocus pocus tactic other obliged to submit to minority truth be that new constituency have be so arranged that unnatural preponderance have be given to small class one hostile to interest of great body be more democratic apparent majority in house of common be produced by minority of common so that small favoured class command majority in house of common sway of administration a far a house be concerned be regulated by smaller number of individual than who governed previous to reform be not whole evil new class with unnatural preponderance be class hostile to institution of country hostile to union of church state hostile to house of lord to constitutional power of crown to existing system of provincial judicature be therefore class fit willing to support whig in favourite scheme of centralisation without whig can never long maintain in power now centralisation be death blow of public freedom be citadel of oligarch from if once erected will be impossible to dislodge can that party be aiming at centralised government have reformed municipal corporation will see reform of municipal corporation of england be covert attack on authority of english gentry great body perhaps form most substantial existing obstacle to perpetuation of whiggism in power by democratic act county magistrate be driven from town where before exercised just influence while elective magistrate from town jostle on bench at quarter session present in peculiar position anomaly in constitution of bench flattering to passion however fatal to interest of giddy million here be lever to raise question of county reform whenever obstinate shire may venture to elect representative in parliament hostile to liberal oligarch let admit for moment that whig ultimately succeed in subverting ancient hereditary power of english gentry will municipal corporation substitute a equivalent check on centralising government whence spring influence from property not dozen have estate influence spring from factitious power with reforming government have invested of same government will deprive in session moment cease to be corresponding committee of reforming majority in house of common will either be swept away altogether function will be limited to raising local tax will discharge expense of detachment of metropolitan police local judge governor whom downing street may send down to preside over constituent with one two exception english corporation posse more substantial durable element of power than municipality of france what check be on paris corporation have prescription in favour property influence be maintained neither by tradition substance have indirect authority over mind of townsman have only modish charter to appeal to

instrument in hand of faction member of country corporation will play game of london party to secure factitious local importance obtain consequent result of opportune service think have now established two proposition with commenced last chapter will close concluding one of bepirit of whiggism ' with recapitulation inference draw from if there be slight probability of ever establishing in country more democratic government than english constitution will be a well conceive for who love right to maintain constitution if more recent measure of whig however plausible first aspect have in fact be departure from democratic character of constitution will be a well for english nation to oppose with heart soul strength machination of whig bepirit of whiggism '
