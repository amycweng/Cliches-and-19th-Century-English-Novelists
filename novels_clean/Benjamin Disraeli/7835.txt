monsignore question with be not so simple a put secret society will not tolerate roman interference to say nothing of diplomatic hubbub might if necessary defy what if taking advantage of general indignation new kingdom of italy may seize golden opportunity of making popular reputation declare champion of national independence against interference of foreigner friend tread on delicate ground if rome fall not existing dynasty in europe will survive five year said berwick may be so said companion with expression of incredulity know how consistently anxiously have always labored to support authority of holy see to maintain territorial position a guarantee of independence fate have decided against can not indulge in belief that holiness will ever regain lost province capital without country be apparent anomaly fear will always embarrass can treat possession a capital of christendom ala world be not a good christian a ourselves christendom be country no longer marked out in map of world continued gentleman in tone almost coaxingi wish must devise plan humanly speaking must secure to holiness possession of holy throne forever wish must induce to consider more favorably that suggestion that holiness must content with ancient city in possession of st peter vatican leave rest of rome to vulgar care mundane anxiety of transient generation yes added with energy if dear berwick must see way to something like think even now at once must venture to undertake that emperor master must soon put end to disturbance danger non possumus said berwick sternly stopping sooner

legion be daily expected to join frontier force that nicotera be stirring in old neapolitan kingdom while liberator at florence in other part of tuscany be even ostentatiously certainly with impunity

holy father pius ix have resolved to summon oecumenical council oecumenical council said lothair be weak phrase resumed cardinal to say will be greatest event of century believe will be greatest event since episcopate of st peter greater in consequence to human race than fall of roman empire pseudo reformation revolution of france be much more than three hundred year since last oecumenical council council of trent world still vibrates with decision council of trent compared with impending council of vatican will be a mediaeval world of europe compared with vast complete globe man have since discovered mastered indeed said lothair why very assembly of father of church will astound freemason secret society atheist that alone will be demonstration of power on part of holy father conqueror from sesostris to napoleon have ever equalled be only bishop of europe assembled at trent inspired by holy spirit decision have governed man for more than three hundred year now bishop of whole world will assemble round chair of st peter prove by presence catholic character of church asia will send patriarch pontiff america australia prelate at home dear young friend council of vatican will offer striking contrast to council of trent great britain will be powerfully represented bishop of ireland might have be counted on be england also will send prelate now of will take ordinary share in transaction will give new form color to human existence be true sir that object of council be to declare infallibility of pope in matter of faith moral said cardinal quickly there be other infallibility be secret with god that can know of decision of council on awful head be that decision inspired by holy spirit must infallibly be right must await decision when made known must embrace not only with obedience with interior assent of mind will there be other result of council on may speculate believe will certainly accomplish first will show in manner can not be mistaken that there be only one alternative for human intellect rationalism faith secondly will exhibit to christian power inevitable future be now preparing for be among faithful said lothair then must be member of church catholic said cardinal basis on god have willed that revelation must rest in world be testimony of catholic church if considered only a human historical witness affords highest most certain evidence for fact content of christian religion if be denied there be such thing a history catholic church be not only human historical witness of own origin constitution authority be also supernatural divine witness can fail err when oecumenically speaks be not merely voice of father of world declares what hath seemed good to holy ghost to there be pause then lothair remarked said air that council must show to civil power of christian world inevitable future be preparing for even so now mark child at council of trent christian power be represented properly so seat will be empty at council of vatican what doe mean separation between church state talked of for long time now demonstrated what doe separation between church state mean that society be no longer consecrated civil

brink of precipice over monarchy law civil order will ultimately fall perish together then be hopeless said lothair to human speculation said cardinal none can fathom mystery of divine interposition coming council may save society on must speak to most earnestly holiness have resolved to invite schismatic priesthood to attend labor to bring about unity of christendom will send ambassador to patriarch of heresy of photius be called greek church will approach lambeth have little hope of latter though there be more than one of anglican bishop who revere memory example of laud by mean despair of communion being present in form at council there be true spirit at oxford who sigh for unity will form hope considerable deputation a not yet being prelate can not take seat formally in council wish in order to increase assert influence that must be accompanied by band of powerful layman who will represent pious pure mind of englandthe coming guardian of land in dark hour may be at hand considering previous knowledge of rome acquaintance with eminent men language considering too a well know that holy father look to a one marked out by providence to assert truth must please meand trust must be wise in youwere to visit rome on sublime occasion perhaps put mark on world history must yet be long time before council meet said lothair after pause not too long for preparation

perplexity sometimes without warning preparation suddenly fall upon family living in world of happiness ease meriting felicity by gift of fortune disposition perhaps there never be circle enjoyed life more deserved to enjoy life more than brentham family never be family more admired le envied nobody grudged happy gift accident for demeanor be so winning manner so cordial sympathetic that one felt a if shared amiable prosperity yet at moment duchess whose countenance be always a serene a soul be walking with disturbed visage agitated step up down private room of duke while grace seated head upon arm with eye on ground be apparently in anxious thought now what have happened seems that excellent parent have become acquainted almost at same moment with two astounding disturbing fact son wanted to marry euphrosyne cantacuzene daughter must not marry duke of brecon be so perfectly unprepared for communication said duke looking up have doubt did not express a ought to have done think said thing wrong showed surprise sorrowno anger be careful not to say thing to hurt feelingsthat be great point in mattersnothing disrespectful of young lady invited to speak to again about when have little got over surprise be really catastrophe exclaimed duchess only think came to for sympathy in sorrow after though distressing be only mortification be very sorry about brecon said duke who be man of honor must have suited very well dear augusta never took exactly same view of affair a didi be never satisfied that corisande returned evident might say avowed admiration of spoke of always

be to ireland seen county of own country will go said duke thought with st aldegonde be safe from getting into scrape of kind must like to speak to granville about said duchess when be serious judgment be good be to see st aldegonde before speak to bertram said duke must not be surprised if be here immediately one of social mystery be how thing get about be not interest of of person immediately connected with subject that society must be aware that lady corisande have declined proposal of duke of brecon society have right even to assume that proposal be either expected contemplated duke of brecon admired lady corisande so did many others many others be admired by duke of brecon duchess even hoped that a season be waning might break up people go into country abroad nothing be observed yet got about way thing get about be through hugo bohuns nothing escape quick eye slow heart mission be to peer into society like professional astronomer ever on watch to detect slightest change in phenomenon never embarrassed by passion of own only social scheming being to maintain transcendent position life energy be devoted to discovery of what be taking place around experience combined with natural tact invests with almost supernatural skill in detection of social secret so happened that scarcely week have passed before hugo began to sniff air then to make fine observation at ball a to whom certain person danced with did not dance with then began curious process of what called putting two two together putting two two together proved in about fortnight that be up between lady corisande duke of brecon among others imparted information to lothair set lothair thinking went to ball that evening solely with purpose of making social observation like hugo bohun lady corisande be not there though duke of brecon be apparently in high spirit waltzing more than once with lady grizell falkirk lothair be not very fortunate in attempt to see bertram called more than once at crecy house too in vain fact be bertram be naturally entirely engrossed with own difficulty duchess harassed mortified must no longer be at home in morning grace however evinced just appreciation of character for woman be remarkable in confidence reposed in good sense of lord st aldegonde at crisis st aldegonde be only one of son in law whom duke really considered little feared when st aldegonde be serious influence over men be powerful be serious now st aldegonde who be not conventional have made acquaintance of mr cantacuzene immediately on return to england have become friend have dined in tyburnian palace of descendant of greek emperor more than once have determined to make second son who be only four year of age greek merchant when duke therefore consulted on catastrophe st aldegonde took high ground spoke of euphrosyne in way deserved a one equal to elevated social position deserving if ask opinion sir continued think except for bertrams sake that have cause to fret family wish to marry cousin eldest son of prince of samos be alliance of highest suit much better than connection with besides cantacuzene will give child large fortune like money to

merchant banker be great merchant banker descendant of prince daughter one of most beautiful gifted of woman worthy to be princess there be good deal in what st aldegonde say said duke afterward to wife affair take rather different aspect appears be really people of high consideration great wealth too nobody must describe a adventurer might gain little time said duchess dislike peremptory decision be pity have not opportunity of seeing young lady granville say be most beautiful woman ever met except sister be artist wife said duchess yes said duke believe most distinguished man rather add to imbroglio perhaps thing may turn out better than first promised fact be be more amazed than annoyed granville know father seems intimately know so many odd people want to meet at dinner what do think about be good thing sometimes to judge for one say prince of samos be half betrothed to be attach to turkish embassy at vienna be to visit england nervous system be quite shaken said duchess wish must go to brentham mentioned to corisande morning be surprised to find that wished to remain in town well will decide nothing dear in hurry st aldegonde say that if decide in sense will undertake to break off whole affair may rely on need consider business only with reference to bertrams happiness feeling be important issue doubt be limited one business be not of so disagreeable nature a seemed be not affair of rash engagement in discreditable quarter from can not extricate there be doubt be thoroughly reputable people will sanction nothing be not decorous honorable st aldegonde have be comfort to in matter will find out great deal when speak to about thing might be worse wish be a easy about duke of brecon met morning rode with himto show there be change in feeling

of brentham lady corisande who deported a if there be care at crecy house except occasioned by brother rash engagement be of opinion that mamma must only brood over vexation in country that must be much better not to anticipate close of waning season so duchess lovely daughter be seen everywhere where ought to be seen appeared picture of serenity satisfaction a for bertrams affair under manipulation of st aldegonde began to assume le anxious more practicable aspect duke be desirous to secure son happiness wished nothing to be done rashly if for example in year time so bertram
