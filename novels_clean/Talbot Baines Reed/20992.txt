if be tired of throwing stick into pond must only throw one more even be fag must do what plump noisy splash made sending out circle far near gurgling in sickening way a sank in very unsticklike fashion to bottom whistling ceased air of dejection increased must be unsociable longer let rejoin dear schoolfellow making little detour in order to appear to reach from direction not of pond of

who have by time joined what be odds if did do demanded dux look out said faulkner here come be beckoning in now be in for thought plummer evidently meant business time melancholy ceremony at have just assisted have kindled fire within sat at desk glowering a boy dropped into place with air of wolf selecting victim a encountered that awful eye found secretly wondering whether by chance might have shot dog in fit of absence of mind brown think be troubled by similar misgiving of senior evidently resented way in head master glared at tried to glare back faulkner assumed air of real affliction presumably for departed tempest on other hand drummed finger indifferently on desk looked more than usually bored by whole business now boy began plummer in short sharp tone used to affect when be wont to administer justice about hector ah that fatal name again administered nervous shock round dead silence ensued showed that boy present be alive to critical nature of situation have already told have occurred have asked if one here know anything about matter said doctor repeat question if of know anything let there be hesitation in speaking up reply boy looked straight in front of held breath very well said doctor voice becoming harder sterner be to understand boy here be able to throw light on mystery be that so if silence give consent question be ever more emphatically answered in affirmative hoped must be unnecessary to ask question twice said dr plummer decline to accept silence a answer let head boy come forward tempest left place advanced to desk tempest do know anything of matter sir said tempest felt skin on top of head grow tight breath catch in throat never have known dux to tell to one be to do when turn came go to seat next boy come forward parkin obeyed answered question with clear negative next boy next boy be faulkner who suspected must fain have be able to say knew anything for once be at fault have to reply with apologetic no in due time be dicky turn do know anything of matter brown sir said brown almost noisily doctor looked at keenly then ordered to place jones come forward felt blood fly out of cheek heart jump to mouth a obeyed a passed up room glanced nervously at dux where sat listlessly regarding scene took notice of jones said doctor do known anything of matter word must not come glanced around again for succour turn face to sir thundered doctor answer question what must say where must look question be repeated once more only know fancy heard shot in night stammered at last flutter of interest went round room failing other clue evidently seemed to be something to most of present to elicit even why did not say so when be asked morning answer do hear sir please sir must be sure have not be dreaming when did hear sound know what time sir have be asleep be light dark dark be that heard thought heard yell too did get up wake of others sir did hing at be frightened sir hid under clothes be that be about enough thought yes sir staggered back to seat like wounded man after fray knew have lost caste with fellow have seriously compromised with head master at least told have escaped desperate fate of saying anything against dux for sake of must afford to put up with other two consequence grand inquest came to end one candid youth admitted that knew of matter be that be very glad hector be dead for impious irrelevance be ordered to write appalling imposition forfeit several half holiday for time being be worst thunderbolt fell from doctor armoury dux be kindly waiting for outside if be grateful to concealed feeling wonderfully for seized by coat collar invited to step with to quiet retreat where administered soundest thrashing have have that term without interruption explanation knew must be of avail tempest made point of always postponing explanation till after deed be done when at length gathered together inquired a pleasantly a must to what special circumstance be indebted for painful incident replied for being idiot sneak get away will kick brown whom presently encountered put matter rather more precisely well said told about a much a must how sorry must have be not to tell more dicky said be almost a big as a look said dicky be saying something come see experiment be not in scientific mood anything be welcome to change subject so took dicky arm went dicky be queer boy be of inventive turn of mind given up to science experiment rarely succeeded when did almost invariably landed in disgrace still persevered hoped day to make hit explained to a walked down garden that have lately be taking interest in pond be must do to appear only moderately interested in announcement have not interest in pond too what followed be even more uncomfortable know lesseps chap said left before came think said dicky laughed unfeelingly mean chap who cut suez canal said oh beg pardon said know well have be having go in at same kind of job continued dicky know what drop there be at end of pond where saw yesterday in shrubbery well struck must take much engineering to empty exclaimed empty pond will get in awful row dicky think of think be done tell said man of science be what be at when saw thought be digging up primrose digging up grandmother be letting in pipe to drain be rare job to shove in from bottom corner of pond through bank into shrubbery managed be coming through like one o'clock when left expect pond will be empty by time quailed with horror if so must be discovered be tempted to turn tail must be even worse only thing be to stay see through confronted with reflection that dicky experiment so rarely succeeded that in probability pistol still lay safe under four foot of water if not hooray exclaimed dicky a came in sight of place be done trick time see tom did see in place of water left there in morning be large empty basin of mud with few large puddle of water lying at bottom few hillock of mud denoting place have once be willow quick eye hurriedly took in dismal landscape for moment spirit rose for must nowhere discern compromising object dreaded to see be doubt buried in mud a safe a if pond be full to brim be ripping said dicky be easy to do only wanted little management mean to go in for engineer hullo what be rummy stone out there be stone fish say tom added clutching arm be bothered if be not pistol white face chattering teeth made reply unnecessary there snugly perched on little heap of stone a if set up for inspection lay unlucky pistol gleaming in afternoon sun dicky looked first at pistol then at began slowly to take in state of affair took cautious step out in mud in direction of weapon came back thought must hardly be chucking in thing for fun said presently stood gaping in imbecile way said nothing know whose be have up here once before say gulped ca let water in again dick have not considered triumph have be letting water out however must see what must be done went down into shrubbery about foot of water lay on ground promising great fertility day decidedly muddy looking to day thing will be to bung up hole first said dicky so set to work to hammer up end of zinc pipe stuff aperture round with sod stone even sacrificed cap to good cause bell began to ring before have well completed task ought to keep more from running out said dicky if be lucky water will come in on own hook at other end theory be not exactly scientific for scientific men believe in luck still be best must think of a turned to go stop bit said a be leaving may a well tidy up bit in there before go eh in there be bed of pond might look better said dick turning up trouser decently interred pistol in mud raised small heap of stone to keep down then cautiously obliterating footstep in mud made for terra firma scuttled back to school a fast a leg must carry fortunately entered unobserved disencumbered ourselves of muddy boot without attracting attention to condition ten minute later be deep in work in big schoolroom preparation that night be solemn gloomy ceremony dicky kept catching one eye then glancing on to where dux cool a cucumber sat turning over leaf of lexicon be got cheek of own have dux said to myself if did know be signalled ungrammatical dicky across room must never have believed may make a many face a like at young brown glared tempest at if catch making more at mother will need extra pocket handkerchief jones observed dr plummer aloud double poena for aggravated inattention right be getting pretty full up with engagement for one day began to think bed time must be rather relief came at last in dormitory ramsbottom successfully interfered with conversation by patrolling chamber until boy be asleep one doubted that have be set to task by head master augured rather badly for resumption of inquest next day however even patrol go to sleep sometimes when woke early next morning usher have vanished to own chamber first thought be not hector doctor poenas dux pond how wondered be getting on routed up dicky very quietly dressed slipped out knew that early rising if be discovered must probably be set down to zeal for discharging imposition even must wait now till be sure about pond for dicky stood liable to a big row a assassin of hector if anything went wrong with experiment in engineering luckily very few fellow haunted particularly muddy corner of ground now that hector be above daily bath there be little chance of plummer discovering remarkably low tide on premise still le of poking about among stone in bed of pool to great relief found that dam at foot be holding out bravely that comparatively little water be trickling through bank into shrubbery flow at upper end however be distressingly small though whole night have passed must still see heap of stone under pistol be buried rising up from willow puddle around inviting investigation with astounding industry worked away that morning widening deepening little channel along rivulet made way to pond before have done have satisfaction of seeing fairly brisk inflow must fain have waited to see fatal little island disappear below surface first bell be already sounding when water completed circle leaving standing up more prominent than ever to horror at precise moment tempest strolled down hullo what be two after fishing one way to catch letting water out be experiment said dicky who like be very pale a looked first at dux then at guilty hillock in pond so seems in other word be making jolly mess be enjoying yourselves hope will enjoy equally of when plummer see what have done will tell asked somewhat breathlessly dux laughed scornfully deserve hiding for asking thing come here jump out on to little island there stay there till tell oh dux please not said in tone of terror be quite out of proportion to penalty pistol be only two inch below surface do hear look sharp will chuck there might be worse might hurt cut up soil so jumped gingerly out stood poised with foot in water on side dreading at moment to see stone slip tell tale gleam of buried weapon if stand properly said dux will make sit down come along young brown be time went up to school how long be to stay please inquired till be in water up to knee said dux a turned away with faithless dicky beside up to knee stood loyally for five minute during water gained about eighth of inch up ankle then second bell rang thing became desperate accordingly knelt in water until must confidently assert be wet very wet indeed up to knee done posted a fast a ill used leg must carry to morning school chapter three when will three meet again once more dr plummer reserved for afternoon perhaps be haunting tyranny of defunct hector perhaps be pique at being baffled so far in finding culprit may have be reason be in ominously uncompromising mood when at last returned to fateful question come up first boy said abruptly dux be evidently getting tired of business wonder seemed to obeyed summons not in best of humour tempest said doctor repeat question of yesterday do know anything of matter sir said so replied dux in clear voice dr plummer scowled somewhat at tart reply rather liked head boy be not prepared to find of others recalcitrant ask what said sir ask what say said said be not liar replied dux rather fiercely doctor received rather more meekly than most of expected proceeded with next question have slightest reason to suspect one of having done of knowing anything about tempest remained silent with flushed angry face do hear sir asked doctor now thoroughly roused yes sir then why answer at once must not answer question if must said dux defiantly dr plummer stared at boy a if have be wild beast how dare say thing to demanded heard question have slightest ground for suspecting one dux bit lip remained silent do hear tempest reply go to seat sir will speak to presently tempest obeyed with head erect red spot on cheek gazed at in amazement have always given credit for hardihood have never believed capable of mutiny of kind especially seems to whispered dicky might a well tell right away will get expelled way anyhow brown come forward dicky started a if have be detected in act of holding pistol to hector head be not in least prepared to be summoned thus out of turn morally went to piece a rose to obey mum word whispered encouragingly a started for front doctor be on alert with vengeance to day jones come forward too said be turn to jump now now sir what be that said to brown just now back went up instinctively at tone said beum be word replied a doggedly a must doctor changed colour be getting serious have precedent for case at dangerfield for moment be evidently at loss how to proceed perhaps regretted for once in way policy of believing boy guilty till can prove innocent whether did be too late to surrender now go to seat jones will deal with presently marched off with blood of jones tingling in vein ingenuous dicky be left to ordeal single handed now brown said doctor have heard question to mean to have answer caution before repeat to be careful will know what interpretation to put on attempt to prevaricate tell brown do know anything at of matter have ground for suspecting one of being concerned in dicky shut mouth with snap looked a if wished devoutly one must turn key on keep so speak sir said doctor coming down from desk by one of strange freak of perversity be so hard to account for dicky spirit went up higher moment when doctor stood over repeated question third time almost believe enjoyed have never imagined courage be so easy to surprise dr plummer did not strike returned quietly to desk brown said may go tell housekeeper to pack box in time for early train to morrow what exclaimed poor old dick fairly electrified into speech be expelled sir will be unless speak at once give last chance dicky looked up at doctor then down at floor knew struggle in mind thought of people at home of disgrace of being expelled of suspicion must leave behind then must see steal doubtful glance at dux at then pas eye along row of face eagerly waiting for decision then held up head knew dear old dicky be a sound a bell one have right to make turn sneak one must do will go pack said quietly turned to door dux saw last of poor dicky brown at dangerfield be otherwise engaged when departed home in four wheeled cab in charge of mr ramsbottom that evening be in point of fact in durance vile with prospect of speedily requiring service of two more four wheeled cabman on own account dux fury at dicky summary expulsion have be quite surprise even to be shame have shouted a door closed caddish shame who said that asked dr plummer did say be caddish shame so do yelled at top of voice quite carried away by occasion be getting very embarrassing for plummer perhaps behaved in best way open to under circumstance ignored proceeded to call up faulkner to answer precious question much depended on faulkner then if have refused to answer a dux have done brown have done others be prepared to do plummer might have seen that case be hopeless have given up faulkner be nothing like favourite with head master a tempest have following among boy still led party if chose now to leave in lurch plummer be saved be lost know nothing of matter sir said faulkner have reason at to suspect one sounded simple answer be rank treason for be a good a saying plummer have right to ask question that faulkner must inform if only knew who culprit be after that be evident game dux game mine be up boy after boy be called up interrogated one by one followed faulkner in submission few like graham junior attempted to hold out broke down under pressure few feebly compromised by explaining have known culprit must not have answered a did not saw reason for not saying so come to then said doctor that out of entire school three boy three only be silent only conclusion can draw from conduct be that dare not deny that know something of shameful outrage tempest be head boy have always looked on a credit to school good example to youngers see present behaviour involves trouble to others than wish to be hasty in matter be willing to give one more opportunity of answering question do know anything of affair have ground for suspecting one of being connected with dux flushed with indignation glared straight at head master by way of reply closed lip very well sir jones now repeat question to be little boy there be more excuse for a be led astray by bad example of senior caution now to do a others have done give plain answer to plain question otherwise must take consequence be afraid blushed looked far le determined than must have liked did best to glare back tighten lip like dux very well tempest jones go to study remain there till come have not long to wait for doom doctor be in study almost a soon a stood there while wrote letter put away book on shelf then rang bell handed letter to servant to post after sat in chair for quarter of hour in silence evidently ruminating at last deigned to notice presence tempest said be very grieved at have hoped better thing of know what consequence must be to be to be expelled know said dux sooner better doctor raised eyebrow there be dealing with reprobate like have written to grandfather to say will return home to morrow be sorry be not to night said dux jones said doctor to not heeding last speech be more sorry for be foolish misguided boy even now if atone for fault by replying to question be willing to spare mother misery seem bent on bringing upon be cruel thrust thought of mother have crossed mind once twice already almost brought tear to eye must be hard to explain to yet yet anything be better than turning sneak wo answer said 'd sooner be expelled desire will be gratified said doctor drily to morrow will go too thank sir tempest will remain here for rest of day jones will go to dormitory remain there forbid of to hold communication with late schoolfellow while remain here next morning after breakfast be finally brought up before whole school harangued publicly by head master punishment told have deliberately brought on own head aggravated insubordination like ours be not to be tolerated in school be sure must soon regret be ashamed of conduct if be not so already for own part must try to forget unfortunate affair to think kindly of mr ramsbottom must see tempest to station matron must escort good bye tempest said holding out hand good bye said dux not heeding hand walking to door good bye jones shook hand after plummer thought meant to be kind though took odd way of showing be thankful when ceremony be over dux found ourselves with luggage in hall waiting for cab at once old school be leaving seemed to become dearer than have thought hall where stood be full of memory of jolly coming going field out there seemed to echo with whizzing of ball war whoop of combatant very schoolroom have just left from even now came hum of work in be more to join have pleasant association of battle fought friend gained difficulty mastered how must have liked to run down to get last look at pond upstairs for farewell glance round dormitory now be out of dux place belonged to no more be outsider visitor whose time be up whose cab be due at front door at moment what be for if have be for beast hector said dux rather dismally

attained to dignity of senior be probably exempt from law binding on new boy a approached crossed road to meet full of joy at prospect of encountering at least one friend marching under protection into new quarter be doomed to slight disappointment for though for moment when looked up fancied recognised did not discontinue conversation with friend drew out into middle of road seemed to be enjoying joke between companion looked round once twice at tempest who be looking quite flushed apparently did not take in walked on looking other way be little shock to must have be have not remembered friendly warning about etiquette of junior not accosting senior till senior accosted wished have spoken to for just then help must have be particularly patronising a be be tantalised by

fellow sharper can see mr sharpe inquired thinking best to take bull by horn ca wait said servant do suppose master have nothing to do run out see wild indian here followed laugh at expense will see quite soon enough here shove from behind precipitated into bosom of speaker who returned with thanks before must apologise into hand of sender thence found passed on by side impetus to knot of

mischief called little man in presence of whole house be triumphant entry then sooner have mr sharpe retired than greeting of little man spiteful sarah run along with smiley then beset on side must fain have explained corrected wrong impression only laughed when tried finally when mr smiley grabbed at hand walked off scene like baby humiliation be complete mr smiley who be far too busy with young gentleman luggage to relish extra duty put upon by mr sharpe have very summary way of dealing with case of kind sit down there move till be told said pointing to little three legged stool in corner in box room began hold tongue how dare speak to retorted only stand in corner with hand behind for disobedience said be getting serious little three legged stool must not have be exactly luxurious to be stood in corner with hand behind by person of feminine gender called smiley be really too bad worst of be that if made further protest might be smacked in addition possibility hardly dared risk so rather to own surprise found standing in corner with hand at back scrutinising blue pink rose on wall paper wondering whether must not be worth while to write to time about whole business must not help thinking that mr smiley did not hurry on account be conscious of box after box being dragged to front emptied of content put back to be removed presently by porter who probably looked at time came in be bound to say received very little encouragement from studiously averted head after nearly hour began to get tired blood of jones began to rise within be seriously meditating

spoken to pretty strongly too then be end of elaborately prepared toilet horrid suspicion began to come over at last not only that tempest have be having little joke at expense have lent to with alacrity eagerness have almost nay very nearly wholly be ridiculous what doe reader think further conversation with good mr smiley after have to use own expression made decent only tended to confirm painful impression even went to length of adding of own accord six button lavender glove to pile of sacrificed finery strewed bottom of trunk when in due time bell rang mr smiley said there now go down to call over be silly more obeyed with meekness diffidence of must hardly have believed capable have not be quite sure of fact chapter eight tempest talk to like father a entered hall in be already assembled most of fellow sharper first idea occurred to be that low heath be not such big place after have expected to encounter whole school instead of fifty boy of own particular house be relief to to find for present at rate be to blush before only limited company next thing struck be that fellow evinced wonderfully little interest in appearance considering active interest have shown in not long since be quite shock have made up mind to be howled at laughed out of countenance instead of contented with half glance to see who new comer be then went on talking together a if nothing have happened conceit be already sufficiently knocked out of to enable to take indifference in good part possibly when name be called reference must be made to exhibition must make few of look twice

head have not flung glove along with hat boot into trunk thinking must not be needed have considered a part of tempest little joke evidently have made fearful mistake for senior who have given admonition be not tempest at next neighbour fact that be not given to to monitor made clear that however have be humbugged over other detail of form glove be order of day for new boy at first call over in panic rose tried to go out with wild idea of rescuing glove from trunk be impossible to escape not only have companion foot up more uncompromisingly than ever sudden movement called down upon general remark shut up sit down ca said neighbour what be up to glove have have left upstairs what glove thought be mistake about new boy having to wear did bring boy looked grave oh will catch ca go

be already in place register have begun register ceremony with be destined to become painfully familiar in time consisted in calling over of name of boy in house in order of place by minor prefect who took stand at side of master desk for purpose instead of answering here adsum in usual way boy whose name be called stood in place held up hand have be so preoccupied with lack of six button lavender glove remark of two left hand neighbour have failed altogether to observe boy on right who now quietly nudged presented to astonished gaze serene serious countenance of dicky brown what have got glove on for inquired a if have seen daily since parted be form have got say will get in jolly row said quite delighted to be able to lord little over inferior why who told tempest tempest be regular humbug tried to stuff up by making bring cheese cutter cap be such fool a look ala be turn to colour up have dicky wondered seen square billycock at moment tempest name be called saw old dux rise complacently in seat hold up hand be difficult to feel angry with looked so cool determined shoulder be so square year have elapsed since met have added three good inch to stature be feather in fellow cap to know tempest even if did have little joke at one expense now then came to conclusion that dicky must be only two new boy in house for none of numerous hand grimy otherwise went up be cased in anything native skin presently register clerk came to end of list be beginning to congratulate brown on probable escape from detection when mr sharpe said new boy come forward left hand neighbour interposed obstruction now a followed by dicky sidled out of place advanced along with five other youth to front be conscious of smile a went past desk of recognition of late owner of tan boot of appreciation of blush others a supposed of greenness have led companion to commit fatal error of not appearing in glove of error though in smaller degree of appearing in bright yellow two button good instead of lavender of regulation half dozen exchanged glance with tempest among others who looked very serious be evidently chagrined that after kind trouble on behalf must now land in dilemma good old tempest be fault answer to began mr sharpe when suddenly catching sight of said why sir what nonsense be what do mean by wearing glove beg pardon sir faltered felt that not word of speech be being lost by assembled house have left lavender six button glove in trunk mr sharpe mouth curled at corner in curious way general titter greeted explanation from bench behind be fully convinced now that

yes sir be sorry kicked shin hope did hurt much thought be one of boy be sure meant harm by seemed to regard a studied insult visited with wrath not only for for smile from boy behind accompanied what be boy name inquired severely looking round wondered who must answer question be evidently not intended for astonished that mr sharpe must not apply at headquarters be sure must have told think said voice recognised a tempest name be jones sir think surely tempest might have have little more confidence than perhaps will see what can make of presently tempest if have intelligence at nice be for exhibitioner may be able to make understand of rule of place if not be afraid will have to put down a silly little boy bear with accordingly go to seat now sir report to tempest after register be not very dignified end to interview still felt lucky to be handed over to tender mercy of old comrade retired to place puzzled not amused boy what perplexed most be to notice brown other new boy who have

on calf made exclaim oh rather more loudly than must have chosen to do under ordinary circumstance luckily general movement of class somewhat deadened sound if mr sharpe heard did not consider worth while to deprive tempest of task of elucidating reason of kept man carefully in view followed upstairs into little study about size of commodious sentry box with window book case sofa table chair requirement of single man of few need seemed to delightful little sanctum for moment began to wonder whether being exhibitioner might not be entitled to one like for perhaps be mine tempest soon

fond of tempest weakness reconciled to from first tempest however seemed if anything to prefer third member of party present who be in way contrast to genial host wale struck one a far more imposing

eleven veteran only be playing next fifteen who having best of wind be giving dangerously good account of be acute enough to make use must of favouring element by keeping open order kicking whenever have chance whereas of course other side played tight game ran with ball even for novice like be interesting to watch contest of kind fifteen evidently hoped to rush thing carry goal before half time deprived of wind whereas eleven be mainly concerned to keep on defensive risk nothing by over haste among veteran must distinguish big form of redwood always close to ball near with shudder recognised crofter working hard while hovering on wing of scrimmage be genial pridgin looking a if must fain be in bed when time for action came making very uncomfortable for enemy on other side be not long in finding out tempest with glow of enthusiasm on cheek a now again broke through ruck sent ball into quarter wale too be there spick span a usual playing neatly effectively withal elegantly a time wore on be evident veteran be being penned closer closer by antagonist presently dangerous scrimmage be formed just in front of goal for minute ball be invisible then by apparently preconcerted movement forward of fifteen loosened let dart back into open behind where lurked tempest ready to receive did not wait to pick up ran to meet with flying kick for moment seemed doubtful whether must clear onward rush of redwood forward did rose steadily beautifully over head with wind straight upon reached goal skimmed over bar amid loud shout of one conspicuous among be shrill voice half time now be chance before shouting have ceased discomfited eleven have quite realised misfortune darted into sacred enclosure presented captain with belt be awfully sorry be in time said 'd just begun when got back thanks youngster be right said redwood wonderfully cheerful a seemed to here take care of for divested of belt be wearing donned new one will have wind with now ventured to observe yes said with nod think will do trick time eh rather said departed elated not so much to have be spared rebuke expected to be talked to by hero a if be not junior at comrade chum when rejoined be anxious to prevent being too much puffed up by exploit good old sarah toady cried trimble a approached be coming who where inquired thought be asking redwood to tea something be only there be jarman cried langrish run cadge up to perhaps will pat on back too despite taunt must not fail to notice depressing effect of new arrival on onlooker generally mr jarman gymnasium master be ruddy restless looking man of about thirty five with cold grey eye air of man who knew be unpopular be resolved to do duty nevertheless if have heard nothing about before must have disliked at first glance instinctively tried to avoid eye yet a stood there talking to mr melancholy master of reputedly fast house at low heath did not look particularly offensive look out now be starting again there be mistaking veteran now back be up order have evidently gone out for quarter to be given to audacious fifteen redwood kick off carried goal from middle of field from moment never got out of thirty a imaginary line between two distance flag be called to crofter belonged honour of first wiping off score with enemy after redwood dropped goal first from one side line then from other pridgin too scored smart run in unluckily kick fouled goal post saved fifteen further disaster then before time be called fourth goal be placed to credit of veteran vanquished fought gamely to end once twice tempest broke away for want of effective backing be repulsed once smart piece of dribbling down touch line by wale gave eleven half back anxious moment be match ended a one expected in slashing victory for old hand together with general verdict that tempest wale at rate have won laurel be safe for two of vacant cap in stampede followed missed opportunity of restoring redwood property a vanished immediately after game comrade must by mean allow out of sight indeed be not till after evening chapel contrived to elude vigilance start on second run to bridge street if eluded be le fortunate with sentinel for at gate encountered forbidding presence of mr jarman what be doing here please sir be redwood belt promised to give to go back what be name jones sir whose house be in mr sharpe let find out of bound again jones fixed with eye a if to impress with fact that must certainly know again sir redwood did hear sir capitulated cowed indignant be beginning to understand what fellow said about mr jarman be rot said philosopher when confided grievance to be not out of bound before if be be business of be house master business house captain if get lagged by right be got right to lag fellow cad in present humour be far from disputing appellation chapter eleven cheap advertising extraordinary spent bad quarter of hour that evening before bed time in inditing letter of explanation to crofter have come to conclusion must be easier safer than personal interview that sooner be done better how to do be problem to write letter in raggery be out of question tried failed miserably for paper be twitched away from under pen one looked over shoulder pretended to read expression of endearment be not there one got under table heaved about tempestuously to detriment of handwriting one drew skeleton figure of spider legged biped on margin of paper worse still be evident word wrote must be common property did not desire have therefore to abandon attempt till later on when finding in pridgin study ventured to inquire if might write there pridgin be good enough to express admiration of cheek said if spread one newspaper over carpet over table cloth to catch blot did ask how to spell word of le than four letter borrow stamp might faithfully undertook to do sat down to delicate task took long time considering result be by mean satisfied with performance when be done dear crofter wrote that seemed too familiar whereas dear sir from one schoolfellow to be too formal so attempted explanation in oblique oration jones iv be sorry accidentally told crofter be beast yesterday did not know be when saw must not have told what tempest said about be quite unintentional also must explain that what said about being expelled be in consequence of dog death about there be misunderstanding hope crofter will not tell told a must be very angry with done said pridgin who comfortably ensconced in easy chair with foot upon window ledge be reading comic paper yes thanks said half terrified lest must demand to read not too lucid epistle right go tell crofter want will look alive then cut to bed here be blow have be at labour in order to avoid painful necessity of interview with crofter here be a badly off a ever ca hear said pridgin a hesitated if please pridgin said resolved to take bull by horn be awfully sorry want crofter to catch fact be pridgin good humoured reply be to shy book at be fortunate enough to miss tempest who entered study at moment caught fairly on forehead hullo be kid playing catch said sorry to disturb really fag skulking somewhere want to borrow yours to take message to crofter be plot what have far better have written in faggery after be exactly subject about kid be playing catch just now said pridgin asked to go to crofter too what have be sending billet doux said tempest well yes seems to be sore did ask to tea yesterday say be afraid one have be libelling though how knew have one here last night ca imagine be funny said tempest writes to to say be sorry must take trouble to call beast in public understands fellow right to private opinion say must be sorry not to be allowed about think imprudent to shout out for one to hear just style be going to send word to ask to come in make cup of tea out of pot just to show there be ill feeling said pridgin be going to say that hope wo trouble to think better of in private then think of in public though for life of ca imagine what refers to fact be tempest said pridgin putting foot up on window ledge again be just a well to be above board with crofter be slippery customer if know what think of know what think of will get on much better if 'd only give chap chance of row with said tempest wo more down on be more affectionate be sweeter smile ugh who on earth have be blabbing to said pridgin not wale wale said tempest rather not be not that sort think be said pridgin yet old man fact be fancy wale know hardly that mind be more of pull over than have over ca be bothered with fashion be too much grind be lazy like well know run into lot of expense picnic last term for instance must have have quite jolly day for cost chicken ham very well cold boiled egg be just a good for keeping chap going wale ca stand thing not being dear said pridgin flare up old chap have got work cut out for term ca afford to spend time paying bill even if have tin very well for who have let in for cocking house said tempest with laugh anyhow have right to talk to like father same fancy have little downer on old wale be good sort of chap there be nothing of eel about brings back to crofter said one have told that be not popular in study doe like wonder who candid friend be be said coming out at last with pent up confession be awfully sorry tempest be take seat said tempest putting off in identical way that crofter have done yesterday be not to be put off took seat continued met did know who be mentioned that 'd come from here that tea be going on that crofter be out of reason be because tempest thought beast be awfully sorry tempest let out to that 'd be expelled from dangerfield 'd not least idea be suggested pridgin have just be writing to to explain rather tough job eh said tempest may see letter said two senior read with gravity scarcely seemed genuine think may pas said tempest coming out at last with laugh there be only about twelve 'he be ' in a will be absolutely unintelligible ca possibly do harm if crofter have least sense of literary taste will frame said pridgin trust dog death will occur here confusion be tempered by relief felt that took indiscretion in such good part saw only what failed to see humorous side of incident begged hard to be allowed to tear up letter must by mean allow on contrary be compelled to address stamp then there place in post box in hall then with compliment good wish be dismissed to bed left two friend talking school politics felt good deal more humbled by manner in have received confession than if have a have expected roundly abused to

with expensive wale strangely enough last trouble weighed on most a dressed tempest knew be not well off be proud not sort of fellow to shirk thing on account of cost must remember at dangerfield spending money at beginning of term on absurdly expensive cricket bag having to go without spike in shoe because must not afford set at low heath where senior be allowed to run up bill in certain shop be certain ignorance about money matter added to friendly encouragement of exquisite like wale must make worse for why even knew more about money than did must reckon that if brought thirteen shilling up at beginning of term must have just shilling week to bless with till break up whereas verily believe must consider that have thirteen shilling week worst of be must never let one know how hard up

till morning of day when lot must be drawn member of council must then be permitted to write name of place on piece of paper must be shuffled in hat drawn for last paper drawn to be place must not help admiring elaborateness of precaution have only drawback a far a be concerned that did not yet know one place from casually asked dicky one day if knew of place round what for picnic sort of thing demanded well that sort of thing said anxious not to betray object too precisely know heard chap talking about camp hill bottom where battle be know did not know sounded likely place made mental note of for eventful day meanwhile there be much to be decided first a to applicant for admission on reduced term be agreed if brought fair share of provender in consideration of being taken on cheap must undertake to row tow boat up stream might come then a to bill of fare be resolved that one must be allowed to take more than must carry in pocket great coat pocket not to be used then a to programme be drawn up with view to combine entertainment instruction in even quantity for entertainment be set down president inorgural spelling be langrish address part song of committee public open air debate conservation on beauty credit of last suggestion really belonged to tempest whom unofficially consulted a to good subject for philosophical discussion for instructive part of day proceeding there be to be dinner boat race tug of war if fund permitted display of firework what concerned chiefly in arrangement be that a president be held responsible for everything of difficult hazardous nature for instance be sent down to select two boat drive bargain for hire then again when owing to prompt payment of two three of pauper a applicant for reduced term be politely styled rather than submit to term imposed be discovered that crown of club fund remained unused be who be sent into low heath to buy squib roman candle be who be appointed to take charge of explosive in hat box under bed till time arrived for letting off began to be anxious about numerous responsibility to by way be added that of replying in negative on question of beauty for day something fresh be put on shoulder day found school work falling into arrears tempest pridgin mildly hinted to that did seem to be knocking up with work succeeded in making uncomfortable on score what concerned still more be to find dicky brown although not exhibitioner kept steadily above in class put under frequent obligation by helping out of difficulty never mind thought will soon be right when once conversation club picnic be over morning of eventful day dawned at last fair on whole not brilliant faggery be astir early before breakfast solemn ceremony of drawing lot for scene of revel took place faithfully set down camp hill bottom on paper committed to hat tempest who chanced to look in with order for fag be requested a favour to officiate a drawer good naturedly did be anxious work while pulled out first five paper tossed unopened into fireplace then drew sixth opened camp hill botton read one seemed pleased first because one have written on paper secondly because be only really good place for river picnic there be one comfort about said tempest a thanked for service will have little quiet in house for hour two take care of yourselves good bye chapter thirteen picnic at camp hill bottom jorrocks school boatman be careful person suited accommodation to company knew something about expedition of learned society to camp hill bottom elsewhere conclusion have evidently come to be that boat best suited for purpose be craft broad in beam deep in draught in must be possible to argue out subject without danger to life limb by coincidence afforded more pleasure to fellow voyager than to one of two boat reserved for use of conversation club be named sarah other rejoicing in inappropriate name of firefly be of course voted to place of honour in former along with langrish trimble seven other philosopher of same kidney while coxhead warminster purkis took official charge of firefly with equal number of passenger be noticeable by way at starting be impossible for two boy to sit close together by reason of stoutness of pocket stood out on side like rope buoy on side of penny steamer indeed of party seemed to to be exceeding limit laid down by committee a not only be prominent on side unusually stout in front led one to suspect that have converted entire waistcoat into pocket for time being stowed with provision a chief delinquent in respect be member of executive committee be hardly for to take official notice of hitch occurred at starting owing to uneven distribution of pauper in two boat sarah boasted of six of whereas firefly only possessed one who when called upon to fulfil part of bargain row whole company up stream single handed showed inclination to rat crew of firefly also began to be concerned a to length of voyage under such condition clamoured for at least two of pauper claim trimble langrish indignantly repudiated at length however after little judicious splashing threat to go off on picnic of own point be yielded two of pauper be ignominiously ejected to make room for equal number of passenger being done question arose a to whether must row up stream tow be decided to proceed by latter method at least until towing path became impracticable whereupon band of pauper be turned ashore harnessed to end of respective rope rest of settled down to enjoy well earned leisure stimulate exertion of tug with friendly exhortation regret to say that philosophy of galley slave failed to sustain in arduous effort began well sarah led way firefly following close in wake a long a friendly emulation between two team endured made fair progress when be discovered that firefly have meanly hitched on to stern of sarah be permitting four pauper to pull whole cavalcade difference of opinion arose firefly tug having nothing to do amused by peppering inoffensive crew of sarah with pebble from bank while outraged puller of sarah finding tricked struck work altogether alter pulling head round into bed of tall bulrush cast off yoke went for fellow pauper to add to general confusion real barge towed by real horse came down to meet threatening with rope to decapitate whole of party whether liked not to drag back to low heath in midst of trouble a president be loudly angrily appealed to to look out make shut up port helm lout a if be fault tried to explain that be nobody must trouble to listen to how avoided peril of barge really can not tell lumbered past in very bad temper deluging a did so with splashing from suddenly slackened rope indulging in remark on thing in general schoolboy in particular be not pleasant to listen to quite impossible to repeat however a have be truly said common danger be often common blessing turned out so in present case mutinous pauper brought argument on bank to close be decided for rest of way to attach firefly officially to sarah allow seven tug to pull lot be quite sufficiently alive to own interest to see pulled fair share progress made although not racing speed be compared at rate with bad quarter of hour in bulrush satisfactory further adventure happened till langrish pointed to wooded hill quarter of mile further up stream said be camp hill jump in chap row whereupon tug glad to be relieved came on board two boat cast loose oar be put out botheration said trimble there be boat ahead of only fisherman wo hurt said langrish a approached spot perceived not one boat only two drawn up under tree empty be worse be low heath boat bore name of jorrocks on stern committee looked glum a party stepped ashore proceeded to make fast boat to tree why ca jorrocks send excursionist somewhere else growled langrish must wonder if have bagged bottom camp hill bottom be curious dell among tree almost in shape of basin with heather gorse round top beautiful velvety grass in hollow for picnic be ideal place close to water sheltered from wind with plenty of room to sit round expanse of delightful heath wood behind on side be on heath legend went that one of most furious battle in war of rose be fought camp hill marked place where earl warwick standard waved during engagement bottom be popularly supposed to have be hollowed out by monk a burial place for slain benevolent intention have be thwarted by swoop of band of marauder who preferred robbing slain to burying left most of monk dead in own grave there be little sign now of tragic story about quiet grass grown hollow with fringe of overhanging bush carpet of mossy velvet just at present however a made way to spot have something more important on mind than earl warwick unlucky monk what if bottom be already bagged by crowd of common holidaymaker carefully planned picnic be to be spoiled by unwelcome intrusion be too true a advanced must hear sound of revelry laughter interspersed with singing cheer who must be voice sounded suspiciously youthful suppose just suppose that yes be too true a reached edge looked down on coveted dell first sight greeted eye be party of low heathen sporting day boy colour spread out luxuriously on one of sloping bank solacing with provender song leap frog never saw twenty philosopher look more blank than did when slowly realised horror of situation be done there must

something besides tuck flitwick rather said flitwick have got latin motto wo parse meet to improve mind not stuff body vote mr quin take chair serene said quin perching on hamper now call upon mr brown iii to read paper on bemains be first mention of old comrade during interchange of courtesy during lunch have kept steadily silent anxious doubt to spare feeling now chance be come be reserved to to show off urbans on intellectual side before must come to front clear throat for action langrish have loudly called philosopher to order now fellow said have programme to get through be not going to give up even if place of meeting be swarming with day idiot mr president have better lead off thus called upon loudly summoned mr philosopher trimble to open debate on subject of beauty venturing to add fellow have be told discus subject know nothing about such a bemains that sort of thing conversation club make point of sticking to what be familiar with be why speak to day of beauty must not be easy to give verbatim report of proceeding followed for party be evidently more attentive to what fell from other side than to what fell from own speaker be evidently le concerned to impress friend than enemy one who have chanced to stand on ridge above way between two party must have heard medley somewhat of following kind gentleman in addressing on subject of remains need hardly explain what mean when speak of beauty remains be thing dug up out of earth where make great mistake in calling thing people eat beautiful in fact very few of be to be found unless know where be when talk of beautiful face mean face be plastered over with mud grime hardly recognisable till be scraped clean people differ very much about what one person think beautiful generally dig for with spade shovel may spend day trying to look le ugly than really be people find quite impossible have to employ person to make personal remark about neighbour gentleman need not remind that among urbans be to be found of most hideous type of ugliness imaginable what need be little common sense to enable to tell difference between sham like ourselves baboon be not always easy in conclusion gentleman beg to point to dirty hand face one who be really interested in hunting for remains of native ugliness ought to be ashamed of so on be too busy cheering own orator listening to enemy to take in full humour of medley at time opening speech be evidently prepared beforehand good part of possibly copied bodily out of book a soon a chairman on side declared subject open for discussion interest thickened flitwick led off on remains whereas fell to lot to reply on beauty by little sharp practice got lead a happened turned out more to enemy profit than own gentleman shouted for breeze made necessary to speak out beg to disagree with that last speaker have said gentleman came answering voice of flitwick in consequence of donkey braying somewhere near fear will find difficult to make heard when people have nothing to say continued le try to say better will not imitate idiot who call philosopher yet know what gender simple latin word like corpore be be sad to think how many afflicted one there be close to who can not possibly be a big fool a look look a big fool a be one kind of remains ca find be remains of philosopher lunch 'greedy ' be mild word to use for sickening gluttony if want to look for beauty gentleman must look anywhere straight in front of cheer gentleman a hear goose quacking a well a donkey braying find difficult to say what want laughter deny that there be beauty in laugh of pack of hyena if there be anybody here called sarah continued flitwick wandering farther farther from point who have be brought up in girl school wear tan boot lavender glove in school loud derisive shout be well known a dunce of house hear hear must advise never to look in looking glass if be afraid of chimpanzee be too much for pent up feeling of philosopher not that particularly resented flitwick facetious allusion to myself in capacity a president of club felt called upon to support shut up cheap jack cried trimble defiantly have given away at last hullo cried flitwick there be somebody here wonder if little cad of sharpe have found out place place thundered warminster knew be ours mean to kick out ho ho when be going to begin shouted twenty urbans now yelled twenty philosopher battle now seemed imminent a fierce disastrous a fought four century before on adjoining heath blood of party be up might even have found engaged in hand to hand combat with old chum dicky have not tempest unexpectedly appeared on scene like bolt out of blue be pushing along bicycle have evidently be attracted to bottom by noise what be up inquired taking advantage of temporary silence day boy cad have come bagged place spoiled fun said no be kid who have come stopped ours protested enemy be going down into middle to have mill said tempest just a like why try tug of war across instead be pretty evenly matched will umpire be not bad idea took beautifully only drawback be that tempest being sharper be presumably prejudiced in favour of philosopher however have reputation of being addicted to fair play side be pulled down said clear out go somewhere else side win will photograph in group be tremendous prize to offer served to stimulate team to uttermost have rope with easily stretched across dell admitted twenty pair of hand on side to grasp tempest carefully saw that side started with least advantage waited till be ready before giving signal tug of war in side be ranged up steep slope of hollow be very different work from tug on level a soon found out indeed a soon a rope be stretched lowest down be hanging on to by finger tip while higher up be obliged to sit down to get within anything like reach under circumstance contest be short sharp ended in draw for side lost footing moment strain be applied almost before tempest have given signal whole forty of be sprawling in confused heap on grassy floor of bottom abortive contest have effect probably tempest intended of smoothing over to extent angry dispute be on foot be still further allayed by undertaking to take monster joint photograph of two club provided stood sat still for process after that good naturedly remained at invitation to officiate a judge in impromptu sport in once again rival party proved most evenly matched finally a evening be drawing on consented just to witness hurried display of joint firework after told must at once take to boat repair home be imposing display twelve roman candle be set up at regular distance round hollow with fellow in charge of two rocket be set in position one on side green red light alternately be planted on bank above at given signal from tempest be simultaneously lit in perfect blaze of glory accompanied by babel of cheer concluded programme at least not quite one unrehearsed incident be yet to come for a smoke cleared off noise ceased eye once more grew accustomed to twilight became aware of presence of mr jarman standing in midst chapter fourteen extra drill mr jarman must have felt flattered at gloomy dead silence fell on philosopher urbans alike a looked round saw be of course impossible to believe have found by accident still le that have come with friendly purpose advanced into middle of bottom watch in hand be contrary to rule said be now quarter past six be hour from low heath in addition to have already said that firework be only to be have with leave tempest must have put end to will kindly send in name of boy here of boy must attend extra drill to morrow write out one hundred line except added catching sight of except jones iv whom have already have to punish who must write two hundred line be study to watch tempest face during speech be must do to wait to end be not fair said with pale cheek angry brow be half holiday boy always get hour grace be not rule said master be practice sir boy be in house have given leave to stay also allowed firework tempest will speak of presently sir blurted out tempest fellow have done nothing wrong if have be responsible to dr england about mr jarman be not man to give away in public discussion coolly walked off observing will expect list of name to night tempest tempest reply be short defiant laugh made master turn moment a if about to notice departed silently left to recover a well a must from surprise of whole scene general opinion be that policeman have met match at last in tempest more enthusiastic of tried to express feeling in word tempest be by mean inclined to discus situation shut up replied angrily when ventured to applaud courage cut back to school at once speak to be blow to of party who have calculated on general revolt to be headed by rock of sharpe house in person celebrated by general orgy on spot sha' do line will said dicky a trotted down to boat rather not think chap will turn up for extra drill just like old tempest said brown enjoys row of kind did look a if did remarked perhaps be because such lot of day chap be mixed up in brown looked little glum at need bother about unless like said can take care of ourselves fancy luckily at stage reached boat further discussion be interrupted voyage home be comparatively uneventful be of course enlivened by desultory race with urbans way in regret to say mr jorrocks boat received few scratch owing to desire of boat to take water of opponent before be clear ahead town boy unrighteously claimed in end to have won by quarter of length a in passing leader have pulled away one of bow oar further turned nose of sarah into bank stoutly resisted claim very lively argument ensued in mr jorrocks lost good deal of varnish most of combatant became rather wet however be back in school within hour of embarking on whole be not bad record curiosity to know what tempest must do prevented from so much a thinking of line took early opportunity of presenting in pridgin study feeling sure must be likely to hear something of matter there a happened tempest wale be there too in deep confabulation look here old chap pridgin be saying spoil term for parcel of yelping young puppy like kid here lot be not worth for said wale be question of whether cock of house be to be allowed right not be more question whether jarman be to be allowed right said tempest quite agree that young muff be nuisance be more aggravating to be dragged into mess by 'd no right to interfere strictly speaking suppose be right said pridgin there be rule about junior being in by although one know hour grace be given on half holiday suppose be right about firework think ought to cave in asked tempest say that 'd let matter alone will never stop jarman at rate said wale must say fight out very well for said pridgin who be comfortably out of mean big job for old tempest will have to bear brunt of ca well drop when be told to give list of youngster present said tempest certainly be not called upon to give list of day boy well a only know one of must be easy if 'd only lagged given extra drill line must have be so bad be playing low down to here came knock at door school messenger entered with letter answer said handing to tempest be plain to see by flush on tempest face a read that contained anything pleasant news be from jarman said throwing down on table wale took up read mr jarman informs tempest that list of name required in connection with afternoon incident will not be required a mr jarman already have tempest will please attend extra drill with other boy of house to morrow a conduct afternoon be neither respectful good example to others whew exclaimed pridgin rising for wonder out of chair be nasty one if like be taken at word old man who be given list of name did young sweep demanded of oh said glad to be recognised under term of endearment must think of doing such thing will tell what think really jones iv be nice to know do think if mind must rather not hear if know anything let hear spare thought pridgin be rather crushing sometimes meant be marked off by porter at lodge a came in said perhaps be how be got name evidently said pridgin be have for once tempest guessed there 'd be bother about list have taken wind out of sail will attend extra drill of course certainly so that said wale will score by affair will be public disgrace before junior tempest half dismal half wrathful face be answer enough sha' consider disgrace said thank very much jones iv if be so will feel be worth living for to have approbation now have better go write out line what said thought be none of going to do have warned once against peril of thinking be bad habit for little boy off go wo get poena done in time what be to tell others inquired may tell be fine evening cut do hear be great come down philosopher thought so when reported case be inclined to be angry with tempest others to pity one be unanimous know why in expressing burning desire to kick expectation of general revolt headed by tempest in person reinforced by urbans faded dismally away a company saw going down to knock off mr jarman line come said langrish rather illogically thought of getting mixed up with day boy cad knew must land in mess so have anyway be in mess too said trimble be little rough on tempest having to show up for a well a for said shut up let fellow write line ca growled coxhead when want sarah advice will ask for reader will gather from that philosopher be in bad temper president be in imminent danger of losing at noon next day when most of school be turning out after morning class into field melancholy band might have be seen dropping in in irregular order at door of school gymnasium except one be junior looked a if be used to thing other betrayed shy conscious embarrassment of first delinquent none looked cheerful not few looked savage exception in point of age be well set up square shouldered proud faced senior who entered with air of reckless disgust be not comfortable to look at might be dangerous if provoked none of spoke to tempest vouchsafed sign of recognition of squad of school volunteer chiefly composed of smart boy from mr selkirk house be concluding drill a entered of course took stock of dejected look of tempest unwonted appearance a filed out row on eh whispered one a passed doe look like fun doe snarled langrish where doe tempest come in persisted inquirer by door sooner get out by better have have poor little naughty boy extra drill will do good come on chap let leave to enjoy will get used to in time ho ho fall in called mr jarman painfully conscious not only that few of volunteer be hanging about to look on that school porter be at moment conducting party of visitor through building obeyed listlessly dismally tempest taking place at end of line be of volunteer heard one of lady spectator ask madam be extra drill for breach of rule replied official number from right cried mr jarman numbered answer to name said discipline master producing paper must not help noticing that tempest name be mixed in along with ours that difference be made on account of age status be then formed into double rank four open order put through hideous series of extension exercise irksome enough at time under present circumstance specially so heard dicky brown beside groan a stood leaning over with left knee bent right leg stretched out behind two arm doubled up at side wonder kick whispered not easy like said how tempest must be enjoying dick murmured poor beggar be nasty dose for if mr jarman counted on protest resistance from senior victim be disappointed tempest went patiently impassively through drill with rest of a must see with blazing eye fixed while on master must guess struggle be going on in friend breast mr jarman may have flattered be taking out of dicky knew better took cue from tempest that morning inclination to rebel mutiny be suppressed contented with glaring at tormentor denying excuse probably desired of prolonging agony impression be that mr jarman be never so happy a when realised that be absolute master of situation roman emperor be not in with attention front said at last when proceeding be becoming dull even to stand at ease attention stand at ease attention left turn dismiss a be dismiss be prolonged insult knew tempest stood so consequently did a filed from place felt that mr jarman turn must come day tempest contrary to general expectation evinced haste to leave scene of tribulation there be yet quarter of hour to next bell evidently decided to spend a have right to do where be mr jarman be evidently annoyed to find not only that senior be apparently unaffected by humiliation through have passed that now drill be over evinced entire unconcern in master presence tempest be one of best gymnast in school be always worth while to watch on trapeze horizontal bar so philosopher urbans by one consent trooped back into gymnasium to look on what must have be particularly annoying to master because have authority to stop to cheer how did cheer what good did have tempest be meanest of performer done nothing swing with leg doubled up under from one ring to next must have applauded to day flight be terrific fellow be le given to show off probably objected to applause a much a mr jarman be bound to relieve feeling somehow trapeze be just what wanted when finally bell rang be hoarse with cheering be way of relieving feeling came to earth decidedly better for exercise mr jarman evidently be impressed to surprise even ventured on compliment did well tempest tempest reply be to walk away putting on coat a went be plain to see by angry twitch of mr jarman mouth that shaft of public snub have gone home who looked on witnessed have little need to tell civil war have already be declared be hardly necessary to state that extraordinary meeting of conversation club that evening be lively that there be lack of topic besides own contingent few of outsider including muskett corderoy from selkirk house few of pauper dropped in a faggery must only conveniently hold six person a at least twenty be present be considered advisable to adjourn to shoe room where in dim light of small candle several particularly revolutionary motion be discussed company sitting on floor for purpose meeting opened by calling on langrish to read minute accordingly did inaugural picnic of phcc be held other day present usual lot seven pauper president have chartered sarah firefly two of vilest crock at jorrocks said be best have got explained shut up will be kicked out young sarah have right to speak have unless hold tongue if held tongue must possibly speak explained turn out cried pauper subsided pauper continued minute have beastly little go in ought to have have meal of hay before starting interruption will be badly kicked if shut up firefly have best of race up here there be most indignant protest from crew of gallant sarah question be argued out with energy on floor of shoe room before langrish must proceed nature be dressed in most pristine colour incandescent hue of autumn leaf brought cry of enjoyment out of mouth of phcc except pauper whose mouth be too full for utterance paragraph be not likely to pas unchallenged coxhead impeached grammar trimble taste pauper accuracy very heated argument ensued at end of be agreed to let door stand open few minute to get rid of dust arrived at camp hill flock of jibbering ape be discovered headed by president arch enemy brown iii be not enemy protested never said so minute say so be more likely to be right than like dicky brown said that sound like poetry said warminster ho ho like dicky brown cheek be so cool if kick call fool can do whether kick not said quite unmoved by brilliant impromptu here be compelled to vacate chair for few moment in order to discus matter further with warminster on order being restored minute proceeded philosopher soon made too hot for mule be only allowed to stay on ground a amused to see idiotic snigger paper on 'beauty ' be rot invoked well deserved hiss say that again ejaculated outraged trimble that there be said langrish hurriedly trimble have more to say on subject once again meeting became warm dusty order please let hear rest said when have be brushed down by friend a for sarah speech in reply be drivellingest balderdash ever heard made club blush speaks well for suggested mildly meeting did not seem to know how exactly to take concluded be meant to be complimentary contented with ordering to shut up if did want to be kicked out tempest loud cheer turned up presently backed up cheer baboon be in in sport pulled off tug of war on head cheer speech be even drivellinger than trim sarah interruption just at end howling sneak cad outsider called jarman came lagged including tempest groan president behaved like mutton head throughout going home philosopher led by several mile meeting then adjourned for extra drill in gym to day mean to pay jarman out cheer patriotic sentiment with minute concluded did away with little difference arising earner be evening be carried unanimously be then moved seconded thirded fourthed fifthed that jarman be be hereby hung ought to be kicked be further agreed that tempest be elected honorary philosopher be let off entrance fee also that town cad be about biggest outsider going also trimble be requested to wash face last be not carried without opposition trimble amendment that be hung being lost only by narrow minority finally be resolved unanimously that philosopher conversation club make hot round for one who doe want to kick jarman back up tempest with highly satisfactory piece of business accomplished adjourned to own study finally to bed chapter fifteen explosive material be plain to be seen that tempest although have borne humiliating penalty like man have be badly bruised by not that broke out into wild rebellion tried to make for party to avenge wrong seemed to have lost interest in work a house captain to enjoy disturbing sensibility of friend by reckless indifference to affair story of extra drill have become public property in low heath most of fellow sympathised with must not understand why have not appealed to head master few very few suggested that have come badly out of business one particularly cared to discus matter with to pridgin wale insisted that be use referring to dr england head be bound to support policeman why not get redwood to take up suggested pridgin redwood must go yard out of way what doe matter to day boy old chap can take care of there will be return match one day concerned to hear old friend talk like still more to notice how began to lose grip in sharpe house news fly so fast in school a of responsible head boy being slack out of collar when once be known admitted take good deal to keep house from going slack out of collar too in particular department relaxing of authority be specially apparent destroyed of interest in philosophical extravagance for dread of coming across power be lends certain flavour to routine of junior boy also tended to substitute horseplay rowdyism for mere fun greatly to detriment of self respect enjoyment on whole then sharpe house have heavier grudge against mr jarman than suspected worst of whole business be that tempest seemed not to see effect of attitude on house at large did not realise how much junior be impressed by what said how looked how much example counted with others of le imitative turn looked upon grievance a own affair failed to give credit for influence really possessed one curious result of upset be that crofter be now then to be found in fellow senior room have blossomed out a ardent anti jarmanite belonged to party who not only vowed revenge be impatient at delay tempest wrong seemed to feel a keenly a if have be own insult put upon sharpe house took to heart a warmly a one tempest must hardly help tolerating effusively offered sympathy although made profession of liking continued to warn against having more to do than must help with crofter pridgin be even le cordial laziness prevented taking active step to cut connection wale on other hand though tempest chum took more kindly to new comer amused now again by defending against detractor wonder to be said crofter jarman have not caught before now be not only house be insulted although think be tried on with of others a have with day will find be sailing little too near wind said tempest with pleasant confusion of metaphor then will get bowled out upon word though said wale think have right to get extra drill of yours wiped out stand against on register be scandal to house seem to think so observed pridgin a just then loud chorus of war whoop came up from region of faggery somebody have better stop row jarman have better come do said tempest laughing be got charge of moral of sharpe house now when in due time returned somewhat depressed by what have overheard to faggery discovered that particular occasion of triumphal shout referred to have be proposal by langrish to celebrate approaching fifth of november by hanging if possible burning mr jarman in effigy for purpose overcoat of mine have already be impounded have greatest difficulty in rescuing from hand of marauder who represented to that be duty to sacrifice something for public good why let have

watching boat below when voice at side startled ah polite letter writer be that very chap want be crofter instinct at first especially on sly reference to letter of apology be to fly on second thought seemed to wiser to remain crofter tempest be on better term now must be best to be civil what be asked can steer boat little said doe that mean can run into bank few yard oh have often steered tempest pridgin come along then be going to have spin up to middle weir if there be one thing enjoyed be steering boat be not long in accepting invitation crofter be not conferring favour on only making convenience of so be not in way making up to relation be that of senior fag only tempest pridgin warning to beware when be particularly friendly even if have not already be cancelled by fact that now frequently have crofter in room must hardly apply now for did not feel quite comfortable be glad on whole that embarkation did not take place under eye of patron for time crofter sculled on in silence giving direction now again to keep in stream take boat well out at corner considered superfluous presently however when be clear of low heath slacked off began to talk enjoyed letter of yours said did write yes said feeling looking very uncomfortable tempest must be quite old chum yes be very rough on business yes be said somewhat won over by admission worst of be make house run down expected be going to do big thing term be not tempest fault if said of course not be jarman one know that be rather pity tempest take so meekly though fellow will think be afraid doe care must be true must think not there be pause during crofter sculled on then said tempest hit somehow doe like doe well fancy doe admitted dare say advises to fight shy of sort of thing eh be awkward must not well get out of yes crofter laughed sweetly wish 'd let be friend hate to see fellow coming to grief not be allowed to give leg up tempest not coming to grief said well not perhaps that only be pity be adding to other trouble by getting head over ear in debt hear be be going pretty well in shop must give friendly tip be revelation to have gathered time ago from what pridgin have said that there be fear of have hoped have made mistake who told said good many people be talking about including of shopmen be just one of thing that fellow never dream anybody know about till be public property be why wish be on good enough term to give tip if be owing anybody will pay said feeling great sinking in heart look out for stake in water there pull left narrow shave of course mean to pay what be afraid of be jarman england of getting to hear of ever since sweeten last year got turned out of headship of house afterwards expelled be seemed to to be risky thing for fellow to run into debt shopmen be such sneak if ca get money from fellow send bill in to house master sometimes to head master then be precious awkward thing how be getting on in form have not much spirit to tell if have there be time for just then swish of pair of scull came round corner behind presently boat at almost racing speed appeared in sight pull right said crofter hallo be one of fellow look like tempest wished at bottom of river then what must think of if saw if knew what have be listening to in perturbation over pulled line sent boat into bank tempest who evidently be relieving with spin of hard exercise after fashion imagined have river to be bearing down straight upon hallo there keep out shouted crofter tempest looked round in startled way held water hard to avoid collision then a suddenly took in who be face lengthened came to halt alongside there jones iv yes must like to come steer said considering difficulty into have just landed present boat be difficult to natter one must exactly compete for service tempest answered shortly come along hullo say said crofter suavely with flush on cheek be steering tempest be doing good be stuck in bank already come along jones have done with yet said crofter flushing still more deeply a voice became sweeter want to stay with want to stay with blurted out tempest losing temper have told so already can do a like though began to dip scull again in water said want to come in boat tempest come along then backed stern up towards crofter made further protest greeted desertion with mellifluous laugh made more uncomfortable than storm of objurgation tempest said nothing dug blade viciously in water spun away with grim face clenched teeth for quarter of mile sculled on before lay on oar exclaimed young fool why pleaded did think 'd mind be be friendly enough to lately bah what do care what be to told to fight shy of fellow there go give away to did not quite like tempest spoke to a if have not soul of own have right to do anything without leave be speaking quite kindly about persisted tempest checked contemptuous exclamation came to lip said more earnestly than have heard yet look here jones that fellow be cad will make cad of if let believe word say to unless call fool hope what be be saying to day will turn out to be lie said oracularly to disappointment tempest evinced curiosity a to meaning relapsed into gloomy silence for rest of voyage for first time in life felt out of humour with old dux have right to treat like baby dictate to whom be to know whom be not to know in low heath doubt thought be doing good turn honestly thought ill of crofter did not follow be not doing injustice demanding must join in at rate felt heartily miserable wished have never put foot outside faggery that day about mile from home tempest got out on towing path said must trot to school while paddled boat home be relief to be left alone relief however be considerably tempered by fear of meeting crofter having to explain matter to that difficulty fortunately did not occur got back to bosom of philosopher without further adventure in sweet society gradually recovered spirit enthusiasm for tempest be still unabated avowed contempt for enemy world over be refreshing night reflection further repaired loyalty after thought tempest meant well by be willing to make enemy for sake might be wrong of course suppose be right result of inward musing be that offered trimble to do tempest fagging in place next morning seemed half to expect old friendly look be back in face a saw enter be sorry offended yesterday tempest said fancied be offended said must stand seeing in cad clutch be really cad then asked suppose asked into boat for fun do said shortly went on for time with work then said must like to know what be saying about not bit said so decisively that relapsed again into silence look here kid said presently with unwonted seriousness be not saint profess to be may not be able to manage own affair to judge by what dozen other of fellow seem to think want to see well come to grief be what be likely to do if let that fellow get hold of be not got hold of said feeling little hurt once more may be civil to fellow even why be saying if shut up did tell want to hear said oh all right if have only vouchsafed to tell why disliked crofter if have given counsel in le authoritative way must have be different must not even let repeat friendly remark crofter have made about be determined neither to say good word for fellow let say one consequence be that interview ended in wishing once more have confined to own quarter let ill alone companion be not long in discovering that something be on mind in gentle way tried to cheer up what be row ear ache demanded trimble be blue because be not have line to day suggested langrish perhaps washerwoman have sent in bill said coxhead will get kicked out of here if look so jolly blue said warminster be stale enough term without having chap with face like boiled fish gaping at look here said resolved to be candid a far a dare be in jolly mess never knew out of be up said langrish really though lark said tempest down on because went out with crofter crofter down on because cut for tempest be enough to give chap blue be there seems to be run on sarah said trimble anybody got halfpenny what for inquired a requisite coin be planked down on table head tempest tail crofter said langrish be head be solemnly ordered to adhere to crofter will square with tempest said will probably keep shutter up for day two will soon get over said mean to stick to tempest a well fact be from what hear little realised fatal error be making be in rather bad way how well tell be owing lot in shop if ca pay will get shown up there be whistle of dismay at sweeten fate be still fresh in memory of of faggery will have to give leg up be general verdict oh let out told said beginning to get alarmed at interest revelation have evoked who be going to say word about can back up cock of own house suppose without asking precious leave go black crofter boot will see old tempest through be not at what wanted have at least hoped to be recognised a tempest leading champion in company whereas here be coolly shunted revelation coolly appropriated service unceremoniously dispensed with did not like at dodge about stringing up jarman guy said trimble ought to help man bit will show be taking matter up by way sarah not heard latest be going to blow up a well a hang proceeded to explain that guy be to be filled chock full of firework gunpowder tongue to be made of touch paper altogether be to be most dangerous explosive effigy a president of philosophical conversation club be naturally selected to take charge of pleaded hard for sub committee to assist must not hear of will only be day two said to fifth of november will have stuffing in to morrow there be almost enough firework left over from picnic to load then can stow away quiet somewhere till day must stick under bed oh might go off know said one might see besides will be too stout to go under bother where can go then vote stick in lumber room under gymnasium nobody ever go there can get into time by area outside said coxhead be voted excellent idea at rate if be discovered did go off there gymnasium be far enough away from sharpe so with much rejoicing guy be duly loaded with explosive internals clad in old derelict overcoat of late senior famous hat adorned hideous head unappreciated tan boot lent distinction to somewhat incoherent leg train of touch paper connected with roman candle be cunningly devised to protrude in form of tongue from mouth while ginger beer bottle filled with gunpowder served a hand whole work of art be one dark evening conveyed by tenderly deposited among wilderness of broken form empty hamper old bottle in lumber room under school gymnasium to be called for in few day time chapter sixteen gunpowder treason one result of boating excursion be that crofter ceased to frequent fellow senior study there be declaration of war indeed formal breaking off of relation crofter have sense enough of own dignity to feel that have be slighted by tempest tempest friend have inclination to heal trouble assume attitude of friendliness did not feel a for found very hard to steer even course between competing party crofter nodded spoke to just a usual be evidently amused by panic lest pacific overture must be observed misconstrued by tempest tempest on other hand did not refer again to subject took little more pain than before to look after help in work evening two later much to surprise when went a usual to tidy up in pridgin room while tempest be there too lord master said abruptly let thing alone kid tempest appreciates mess in place more than do so have swopped for trimble what said in tone of mingled amazement pleasure be be to go fetch blazer said tempest left on parallel bar in gymnasium afternoon look alive will stick to trimble really began to think there must be something unusually desirable about that fellow must be so anxious to posse philosopher have with one accord sought for president pridgin have wanted crofter have wanted even redwood have wanted now here be old tempest putting in claim must have must not be so selfish a to deprive of coveted privilege in somewhat tilted condition went off on errand not even delaying to announce great news to fellow philosopher be dark evening gymnasium be way off knew way by time have daily walked past area door glanced down at dangerous guy where lay with lolling tongue under grating to assure of welfare be all right up till now in two day must be off hand square be empty a crossed to satisfaction found gymnasium door unlocked groped way to corner where parallel bar stood there found blazer carried off in triumph a emerged from door came down step became aware of two point of light in front of voice out of darkness caused to jump almost out of skin who be that be mr jarman voice must just discern shadowy form accompanied by of mr selkirk standing before two master be evidently taking after dinner turn with cigar have heard footstep jones iv sir came to fetch tempest blazer who gave leave tempest sir take blazer back where found tell tempest if leaf thing in gymnasium must fetch at proper hour be third time have have to speak to jones iv must attend extra drill to morrow learn fifty line by heart constant irregularity must be stopped so saying took companion arm strolled off returned dismally into dark gymnasium flung blazer on to nearest seat then hurried back to report result of mission to tempest a guessed poor guy downstairs be likely to be nowhere in explosion last insult called forth with clenched teeth tempest sprang from seat snatched cap be awfully dark said if be going 'd better take match fetch said with harsh dry voice fled off returned with box of fusee philosopher have laid in for approaching celebration of guy fawkes day tempest snatched from hand strode off wished have let go with heard footstep swing heavily across quadrangle a if challenging notice of enemy whether enemy heard answered challenge must not say step died away into silence listened in vain for further sign presently returned to faggery where philosopher be just preparing to obey summons to bed hurriedly recited event of evening for once be honoured with rapt excited attention eye what shame ca go out see fun cried langrish hope make jelly of said trimble be jolly glad be fag brought on crisis have rather feared be not said pridgin have swopped for what screamed trimble taking running kick at shin did do shut up trim that leg be kicking be pridgin go kick said trim be in mood to listen to reason always said be sneak snarled now know come kick beast fellow be low dodge kick say company showed disposition to respond to appeal look here said be not fault if kick will tell about precious guy can look after sha there rather fetched a custodian of illicit effigy have us hardly cared to dispense with so trimble be ordered not to make as of discussion went back to tempest blazer tell said warminster vote hang about bit cheer when come in there be one to lag for not going to bed may a well stay back up with patriotic resolve resumed seat occupied interval with auditing account of club painful tedious operation gave rise to much dispute recrimination particularly when be discovered that on paper be shilling to good whereas in treasurer pocket be shilling to bad treasurer have bad quarter of hour of till be discovered that auditor have accidentally forgotten to carry total of one column to top of next oversight nearly brought about dissolution of club so fierce be storm raged over more than hour be spent over proceeding began to wonder why tempest have not come back be certain must have be stopped by somebody must have be back in ten minute have jarman have encounter be mr jarman at moment begging for quarter be man answering for riot to head master hour passed three quarter hour then just a be giving up hurried footstep came across quadrangle tempest with pale face disordered guise carrying blazer on arm entered passed rapidly to room countenance be too forbidding for to venture on promised cheer something unusual have happened how longed to know what be be thrust forward to follow to study on chance of ascertaining be on point of obeying when terrific sound broke silence of night sent back with white rigid face in heap into faggery sound proceeded from direction of gymnasium first of dull spasmodic thunder then fierce burst followed almost immediately by two tremendous report shook to sol of boot reminded of fearful night at dangerfield when tempest clung on to langrish who be next to in mute despair langrish in turn embraced trimble gasped voice of coxhead be ginger beer bottle what will do cut to bed sharp said resolute though quavering voice of warminster lie low there wo be much of left whispered trimble be one good thing a huddled off clothes in dark in dormitory be gleam of comfort certainly effigy of kind when do go off leave few mark of identity behind who let off ventured to ask one knew about except look out there be somebody coming be mr sharpe who looked in candle in hand to see if one have be disturbed by noise one be sleeping peacefully blissfully unconscious that anything have happened narrow shave said langrish when master have retired say said trimble wonder if tempest here pulled up muffled whistle of dismay took up meaning if did must have found out by never said word to said be bound to make mess of said coxhead why ever must stick thing where nobody must find so did be leaning up against cellar wall one must possibly get at why not area door open ai locked hid key said triumphantly for fear of accident under scraper good old sarah be lucky what about grating in gymnasium floor must twig through that not unless be looking for if must must get at well said trimble rather brutally hope be right for sake fellow who keep guy must take consequence must have be much safer if 'd kept under bed may keep next growled have done with considering probable condition of luckless effigy at moment nobody be inclined to contradict philosopher relapsed into gloomy silence eventually fell asleep be probably last to reach blissful stage for hour lay awake prey to most dismal reflection to do justice own peril afflicted at time perhaps because did not realise le than tempest whether have blown up guy not thing must be sure to look black against recollection of episode of hector death told must come out of badly how if have done have contrived to get at explosive must not fathom be sure even with grudge against jarman be not sort of fellow to take revenge be mean dastardly yet yet yet when with one accord woke next morning needed special intimation to be aware that something have happened at low heath master school attendant be talking in group in quadrangle boy be flitting across in direction of gymnasium senior in two three be deferring morning dip hovering about in serious confabulation something up said trimble with ill concealed artlessness wonder what be look like row of sort said langrish what be chap going across to gym for wonder let go see said coxhead need go together said warminster significantly so one by one casually at studied distance from comrade philosopher dropped into crowd made for scene of last night accident felt terribly nervous suppose one have be killed suppose gymnasium have be burnt suspicion fell on one what fix must be in distress met dicky brown full of news hullo jones say have heard chap be trying to blow up gym in night there be row half on front door be smashed floor knocked to bit come have look one killed hurt have not heard did hear noise yes chap heard row in night must hear at place said brown say chap known who did too who how do know chap who be be extra drilled most likely there be plenty of suggested well yes say lot of gunpowder have be stowed in lumber room just under door there do see have reached scene of tragedy be able to judge of mischief have be done door be broken whether by explosion ordinary violence be hard to say floor grating over lumber room be broken away one two window be smashed that be first feeling be one of relief that damage be so slight have pictured whole building wreck row of mangled remains on stretcher round compared with poor guy have really made very slight disturbance of be thankful to be able to observe trace except one tan boot fragment of ginger beer bottle in area that indeed be bad enough argued lumber room be full of old cast off shoe bottle must probably be set down a fragment of rubbish displaced by explosion brown however others to whom spoke failed to share view of slightness of damage if fellow found will be case of police court for blood left face a heard awful word have never occurred to yet that matter be one of more than school concern vision of penal servitude broken hearted mother swam before eye oh why have ever left tranquil seclusion of fallowfield for awful place a soon a possible edged quietly out of crowd made way dismally back to sharpe where met not few of fellow eager for news be too sick to give much information sent to inspect for while made way dismally to tempest room be up reading hullo youngster said what be row about what be noise in quad last night be of lot fooling about with firework know gasped fairly taken aback with question why one be trying to blow up gymnasium what exclaimed why be there not long before noise who be done be what nobody know be afraid there will be row about fool must tell said tempest with troubled face wish have be there said may think be let said with laugh be anything merry be longing to hear what have happened to last night did not volunteer information did not care to question horribly uneasy be about to seek questionable consolation of comrade when school messenger entered with long face master tempest head master want to see at once right said tempest said be to bring if want to carry may said tempest with short laugh if not wait moment will come jones tell pridgin want to speak to wait will go to school messenger looked a if felt duty to take senior at word have tempest be smaller boy might have done so a be repeated at once please sir tempest took notice went across passage to friend room when reappeared in minute two pridgin be with without taking further notice of messenger presence two walked arm in arm out of house across quadrangle news of summons spread like wildfire philosopher when in due time mustered in faggery after inspection of scene of outrage be not slow in taking in seriousness of situation of course be suspected be fault as for being such muff letting jarman catch ca do thing without making mess of how must help pleaded must have fetched blazer for without running into cad way what ca make out said langrish be how tempest knew about guy be able to let off believe did said be sure did 'd believe anything thing like go off by do be bound to admit did not persisted in belief that tempest have nothing to do with logic of philosopher be irresistible did see go over come back did blow up moment got into house said trimble did go over on purpose to have out with jarman said coxhead have got blazer with when came back so must have be in gym said warminster who else be likely to do said langrish suppose will try to make out jarman tried to blow up never said so all said be that be positive tempest never did say be that be about a big as a look be saving good deal chimed in philosopher how long wrangle might have gone on can not say for just then school messenger appeared on scene once more time in quest of young master jones iv be to go to head master at once what for said feeling cold shudder go down spine ask policeman replied ribald official have have short time merry one young gentleman be over at last never sharp word interrupted 'd better cut said philosopher will give lift if can be poor consolation such a be valued never criminal walked to gallows with a heavy heart a followed school messenger across quadrangle past fated gymnasium to head master study there found four people waiting to see tempest looking very sullen head master looking very grave mr jarman looking very vicious policeman looking very cheerful chapter seventeen before beak at sight of policeman gave up for lost sin error of youth rose in hideous procession before recalled vividly occasion when year ago have borrowed dicky brown nicker without acknowledgment lost recalled dismal series of assault libel in guardian office recollected with horror once travelling on half ticket two day after twelfth birthday above vision of ill favoured under grating rose gibbering mocking to face claiming for penal servitude if not for gallows how well remember detail of scene a entered doctor study bust of minerva looking askance at from above book case quill in doctor hand with fringe on end tempest necktie crooked showing collar stud above mr jarman eye coldly fixed on policeman helmet in hand standing with large boot on hearthrug picture of content prosperity jones said doctor have sent for to tell did at gymnasium last night be there understand after dark looked first at doctor then at tempest must have given world to be able to have two minute conversation with ascertain what wished to say if indeed wished to say anything at memory of similar dilemma at dangerfield only served to confuse more make impossible to decide how must act now while presence of policeman drove from head idea be ever there must tempest like to say that went there at bidding if not how must explain matter wished only knew what have be said already so that at least might put evidence on right side yes sir said saw mr jarman there what be doing there eh young master said policeman be unexpected attack from flank of battle for be wholly unprepared must have told doctor even mr jarman to be questioned thus by representative of law be too much for delicate nerve really be said did do know who did only went to get blazer left there directly mr jarman told to do so blazer said policeman with air of man who have made discovery what sort of thing be that blazer be alight here tempest laughed irreverently much to displeasure of policeman be however thankful for cue what said know what blazer be anybody know that be what have in field come young gentleman said officer whom tempest laugh have put on dignity prevaricating what be doing with there blazer what be doing with fetching policeman be evidently puzzled wished knew what blazer be in present distinguished company did not like to show ignorance that blazer must be produced said will be evidence looked at tempest a person best able to deal with matter said left in gym mr jarman made how long be that before explosion be alight when left blazer oh blazer explained head master blandly be flannel jacket see what use can be a evidence suppose said tempest jauntily who be evidently recovering presence of mind thought be lucifer match will laugh on wrong side of face young gentleman said policeman wrathfully here matter will have to be gone into there be be party injured will be matter for magistrate will have to come along with tell said tempest becoming grave once more have have more to do with than have yet said mr jarman speaking for first time explosion took place immediately after be there when be impossible for one else to be there say know nothing at about said tempest shortly care what think come tempest said dr england good will be gained by losing temper be very necessary to get to bottom of business especially a one have be injured seems almost impossible explosion must have happened by accident at same time knowing what do of believe that be boy who must commit outrage of sort a policeman intends to report affair to magistrate have better go with let investigate matter do injustice by losing temper mr jarman attendance will probably be necessary jones have better go too although so far have not thrown very much light on matter constable if will take compliment to captain rymer ask when can see beg pardon sir said constable evidently sore about blazer young gent must come along with now that duty ca take instruction contrary very well said doctor stiffly will go to captain rymer at once have better handcuff said tempest who appeared to be seized with wild desire to exasperate man of law policeman glared a if be disposed to take at word none of imperence can tell beauty said ai going to stand straight come stir be not necessary said head master for to come with give word that will be at police court immediately wish to avoid public scandal of one of boy going through street in charge ai going to let out of sight said ruffled constable know style tempest smiled provokingly 'd sooner walk sir said if policeman hold on one side mr jarman on other silence sir said doctor sternly while mr jarman raised brow deprecatingly be to come too said yes must like pridgin of fellow to be there too sir said tempest saw just before just after explosion doe not seem necessary to have more boy said mr jarman not to said tempest hotly fewer have better if choose to accuse sha' ask whom to have to speak for tempest said head master be only doing harm by jones go fetch pridgin of others speaks of to police court kindly say word of what have passed here how constable be ready school be fortunately within door at time so except to few who chanced to be gazing from window little procession headed by doctor mr jarman with policeman tempest bringing up rear passed unobserved be full of apprehension result knew tempest well enough to be sure that effect on must be bad must call out in that spirit of insubordination defiance have before now threatened to wreck career strong sense of responsibility be have hitherto held in check if be now shattered how must help being upset by charge must break out badly dangerously be not long in speeding over to sharpe where found pridgin just going over to class heard doctor message with groan of weariness what be use of going ca tell anything said can tell tempest never did said if believe wo anyhow be coming thereupon be inspired to tell secret history of effigy of mr jarman theory a to cause of explosion namely that tempest might have dropped match through grating not knowing on what must fall that in natural perversity of thing have lit on projecting tongue of guy 'd better make clean breast of guy said pridgin if want to get tempest out of mess will probably get expelled flogged low heath can spare better than can tempest strike 'd better fetch down one two of lot to corroborate sound too neat story a be whereupon sought out langrish trimble have satisfaction of making hair stand on end for once at first flatly refused to come reminded that a president of conversation club entire responsibility for guy rested on serene said only come let know how jarman brought on more go for better for man failed to see force of logic curiosity love of adventure induced to venture into lion den on way moreover captured dicky brown who to do credit be only too eager to come with stand by old dux contrary to expectation when arrived instead of finding crowded court be ushered into magistrate parlour where to judge by appearance comfortable little party be going on captain cheery old boy familiar to low heathen for presence on speech day sat at table with clerk beside doctor mr jarman be also sitting down tempest be standing restlessly near window lodge keeper son with head bound up for be victim of explosion suppose prosecutor be standing beside policeman cap in hand on mat at sight of three junior doctor frowned little mr jarman scowled what be boy doing here said former please sir thought wanted to hear how went off said langrish so do said magistrate sit down lad well hear what have to say in time please sir said tempest may speak to pridgin certainly lad said captain again so two friend hastily conferred together in window while stared round with awestruck apparently disconcerting gaze at gentleman on doormat who severally represented majesty of law injured innocence now then said magistrate presently let hear what be about one of boy doctor see be charged with attempting to blow up part of school gymnasium last night injuring poor fellow here who make charge by way do said doctor understand mr jarman doe be mr jarman said captain looking blandly round ah well sir be serious charge to make let hear what have to say be not sworn examination what say will be taken down boy accuse will have right to ask question now sir mr jarman thereupon with very bad grace for felt that magistrate tone be not cordial related how be walking in court at such such hour when saw boy attempting to enter gymnasium that stopped demanded name that boy pushed past entered gymnasium upon mr jarman turned key on outside in order to detain there by way of punishment that boy began to kick at door after hour broke open made escape that boy be tempest scarcely two minute after have left just after mr jarman having stayed to examine damage to door have turned to go away explosion occurred that heard cry from young sugden lodge keeper son who be passing at time be thrown violently forward against railing cutting head badly how do know boy be tempest asked magistrate recognised in dark said mr jarman in fact expected expected yes have sent fag for jacket just previously have sent fag back why boy be not allowed to enter gymnasium after dark be that rule of school be rule doe apply to senior boy a well a junior asked tempest be responsible for gymnasium be not question said magistrate have ever allowed senior boy in gymnasium after dark may have forbade tempest to enter last night what harm be there in fetching coat if be not against rule be against rule to go in when told not well well said captain rymer be matter need not detain have more question mr tempest yes please sir said be expecting mr jarman what made do expected from knowledge of conduct that must come try get blazer when have disobeyed before know a well a do tempest yes said magistrate answer question mr jarman thereupon gave version of affair at camp hill bottom offence being said magistrate that boy tempest among be out on afternoon of holiday hour from school with only one quarter of hour to get back punished boy understand yes tempest took punishment with rest yes suppose be special indignity to senior boy captain of house to be paraded for extra drill with lot of small boy eh dr england must consider so said doctor did not feel called upon to make difference said mr jarman apparently not on account of affair say expected tempest must attempt to defy last night mr jarman bit lip did not reply tempest resumed question with coolness surprised be smoking think mr jarman what if be nothing only wanted magistrate to know locked into gymnasium for hour till kicked out say have right to do what did do while be inside walked up down did try to stop when got out why asked tempest with sneer made contrast broad shoulder with master slouch decided to deal with matter to day how did see what have done to door in dark saw by light of match say be two minute after left that explosion took place immediately after left be what said be striking match during interval yes yet suggest that be who blew place up say be suspicious knowing frame of mind passion be in at time how must blow up place without explosive there must have be there already did know anything about be affair be chap blurted out trimble rather chimed in of sensation in court at announcement may be better imagined than described magistrate put on glass stared at mr jarman looked startled doctor looked bewildered see be way said trimble who have be working up to point through previous cross examination have wait moment boy said magistrate witness be too eager to listen to remark be way have guy belonging to phcc know be chock full of firework be keeping for guy fawkes day know must have known be jarman mr jarman mean to look at be sarah being president offered to look after be too big to stick under bed so so continued thought safest place to stick must be in lumber room under gym never thought one must be dropping match through grating on touch paper tongue tempest did know anything about see said langrish taking up parable meant to keep dark only philosopher be in have on sarah hat boot top coat found somewhere about 'd have never gone off of must have done harm on fifth when must have hung blown up in open tempest tempest broke in dicky brown putting in oar be kind of chap to do thing like on purpose must have be mr jarman blew up by mistake with one of match end of cigar something be mulish thing of sarah to stick there said trimble know better thought be right so did pridgin say be quite accident sir if one to get in row said 'd better because be guy mistake made be letting touch paper tongue hang out so far 'd have never blown up if have be for here there be general pause for breath magistrate who evidently have sense of humour said pray who be sarah man be what call when be fooling be not real name really sir jones iv be real name be right said trimble be only called sarah because look like be not more in than rest of because only have to take care of guy because be president be sorry tongue be made so long magistrate did best to look grave a turned to mr jarman doe explanation help to clear up mystery mr jarman bit lip said if be a say may account for explosion certainly dropped several match through grating be a say be chap said langrish must tell cram about rather not chimed very well then see that can do much good said magistrate dr england will know better how to deal with matter accident be accident after if may give opinion boy have done quite properly in coming here telling about little boy must not be allowed to play with explosive at same time must allow to say mr jarman that be unfortunate for master to put in position of being made subject of effigy a for tempest there be absolutely nothing against unless according to rule of school be offence for boy who be locked up in dark room at night to do best to get out be great pity matter be brought to at a have be advice be to let rest where be meanwhile poor fellow who have be injured have claim dare say sovereign will help get necessary bandage plaster for forehead good morning dr england good morning mr jarman good day lad let be lesson against touch paper tongue so ended famous affair of mr jarman guy chapter eighteen going down stream if one supposed that low heath have heard last of mr jarman guy little knew mr jarman tempest philosopher ghost of unhappy effigy be hardly likely to be laid by simple magisterial decision mr jarman be rumoured have bad quarter of hour with doctor that evening went about ordinary work for next few day with scowl boded good to one who chanced to cross least of to of who have contributed to defeat tempest on other hand took victory coolly talked over with chum came to conclusion that be quits with enemy must afford to leave alone be plain to see that have suffered jar found expression in reckless unconcern for duty of position a head of house increased disinclination to make exertion for credit of school considered have treated ill what troubled most be to notice that spirit have flagged that be dropping slowly into listless indifference have made pridgin only term ago shirk responsibility to school towards junior be utterly easy going perhaps in token of gratitude for assistance have rendered at critical time chiefly fear because be slack to check anything seemed

door of sharpe house reinforced by dozen recruit stalked urbans thirsting for reprisal longing to wipe out score then ensued notable battle failed to dislodge enemy by forward attack for time seemed a if flank movement must be equally unsuccessful at length by great effort succeeded in cutting off few of from main body be applying to task of annihilating rest when tempest appeared on scene looked fagged harassed be evidently not much interested in battle row be now too common thing in sharpe to be event allowed to proceed with complete unconcern just however a be taming to enter house mr jarman came up be almost first time have met officially since encounter in magistrate room a with one accord ceased hostility stared at one two of more audacious of party indulged in low hiss come in

have got ahead of by force of steady plodding while be wasting time good resolution have brought up with have one by one fallen overboard have be content enough to take place among rowdy without effort have counted through on tempest backing up if have be keen on credit of house felt must have be so too if have be down on for neglect of work felt must have stuck to a be slackness reigned supreme tempest be slack because be out of humour pridgin be slack because be lazy wale be slack because wanted to be in fashion of be slack because better set example need little courage for single boy to attempt to stem drift of slackness in school house dull dogged boy like dicky brown might have done must not afford to be peculiar therefore succumbed against judgment to prevalent dry rot now that crisis have come hoped tempest might if not for own sake for ours pull up take house in hand a well must do if chose short conversation overheard a be fagging in study that morning however be not encouraging what be to be said wale lecture row row hope said tempest wearily what be wrong old chap asked pridgin nothing out of curl be said tempest trying to assume laugh be not going to cave in to jarman at time of day said wale be do think likely said tempest tell what like said pridgin presently be way crofter lately taken to do virtuous be not worst of said wale be be chumming up with jarman have met twice lately walking together suppose be got eye on headship of house said tempest when get kicked out look here old chap responded pridgin looking really anxious be not to come to surely must be intolerable to have over come what will must stick to very well said tempest dismally be england affair more than mine if knuckling under to jarman be condition be out of crofter be welcome to be be bad enough when summons to assemble in hall came went there in state of dejection feeling that fate be against that new leaf hoped for be several page further on yet fellow philosopher regret to say neither shared in appreciated foreboding look at as sarah trying to look virtuous said trimble just like when there be row on be not trying to look virtuous said be sick of row though pity be sick when be getting into instead of after know have be at bottom of row there be be on term sweeping statement be not calculated to allay discomfort tell lie said more be who got into mess at camp hill bottom sarah did who landed in row about jarman guy old sarah who played fool with barge got licked cad sarah who started shindy last night be fetched in here lout sarah who be going to be expelled howling sarah who will be jolly good riddance of bad rubbish chimpanzee sarah there be make what like of talk to tirade took breath away knew said more than meant still be flattering taxed affection sorely to sit quietly hear out somehow to day be too anxious worried to care much what anybody said fortunately entrance of doctor mr sharpe mr jarman made further discussion for time being unnecessary gloomy silence fell over assembly dr england be evidently worried secretly believe be bored by whole affair wished mr sharpe prefect must manage affair of own house perhaps too fact that mr jarman be once more complainant have something to do with lack of humour now boy said be unusual unpleasant interview heartily wish be not necessary when whole house be reported for rowdiness show be afraid that sense of duty to school be in bad way be not first occasion term on house have be reported have previously refrained from interfering in hope that good feeling of boy must assert make action of mine unnecessary be sorry have not be so a to scrimmage in quadrangle yesterday be not disposed to make too much of at rate weighs le with than what understand to have be deliberate act of disobedience to master who quite properly interfered to restore order disobedience be sorry to say encouraged if not instigated by head boy of house hope there may be mistake about will boy who be engaged in fight stand up philosopher rose to man with promptitude be almost aggressive bother why must be backward in admitting that have gone for day boy put to bed for once ask boy to say whether heard mr jarman tell to wait till spoke to did sir said langrish so did said trimble did said why did not obey tempest told to come in so did said that be right sir said coxhead others assented very well said doctor tempest ask to say whether heard mr jarman tell boy to wait yes sir did tell in spite of to come in yes sir why because be head of house be responsible for order of house be glad to hear think so said doctor drily have always be equally jealous for order of house term tempest be facer a felt tempest flushed glanced up at head master sir have not said doctor be chivalrous man did not try to rub in sore tempest have made damaging admission against might be left alone to own sense of discomfort unluckily however mr jarman stood by matter must hardly be allowed to drop a regard incident last night said doctor know quite well of that boy even head of house have right to set authority against of master conduct be insult to requires apology small boy may have considered be not doing wrong in obeying tempest can plead such ignorance expect to apologise to mr jarman struggle evidently passed through tempest mind conscience have be roused by what doctor have said manner of saying have apology be demanded for one else mr jarman must have given in one word have put on side of duty apologise to jarman if mr jarman want to tell lie said slowly will say be sorry ca apologise to come tempest said doctor evidently disconcerted at threatened difficulty must be aware of consequence if refuse to do know sir ca help ca apologise to mr jarman dead silence followed broken only by hard breathing of philosopher doctor twirled tassel of cap restlessly mr sharpe looked straight before through glass mr jarman stroked moustache smiled tempest stood pale determined with eye on floor will not prolong scene said doctor at last for remaining week of term boy concerned in yesterday disturbance be forbidden to appear in playing field tempest will have day to think over determination come to in house time to morrow 'd sooner be settled now said tempest respectfully dismally can not apologise come to time to morrow repeated doctor a to other boy of house want to understand that be concerned in wellbeing of house if a fear spirit of insubordination be on foot own proper spirit loyalty to school be not enough to stamp out must use method have never have to use yet in low heath may need courage self sacrifice in boy to stand up against prevailing tone trust there be of left even in misguided house now dismiss have be memorable interview doctor might have stormed raged done nothing a be have talked like quiet gentleman made thoroughly ashamed of ourselves yet a of felt everything now depended on tempest if surrendered might count on to fall in line make up to for have sacrificed on behalf if held out refused chance too refused ours went out with if only one must have brought home to how much depended on yet who must blame for finding impossible to apologise to jarman who have persecuted term with petty rancour so far from deserving apology have to thank tempest moderation that did not receive much rougher treatment than have might go through word of apology must be farce tempest be too honest to be hypocrite there be unwonted quiet in sharpe house that afternoon fellow be too eagerly speculating a to fate in store for to venture on riot philosopher of course stoutly advocated policy of surrender one two of happened to know must have be unfeignedly glad to hear that tempest have squared matter with pride left free to take reform in hand tempest preserved glum silence until after afternoon chapel when said to be one of redwood evening youngster will go with if be going redwood have given open invitation to drop in thursday evening to tea bring friend have be several time with dicky once in great triumph have taken tempest a guest have be most successful experiment not only have tempest taken two little girl therefore mother by storm between redwood have sprung up unexpected friendship born of mutual admiration confidence since then have once repeated visit to night to great satisfaction proposed to go again to be miniature triumph to carry off hero of sharpe from under eye of house on occasion like present to destination of alone knew secret flattered that in spite of mocking comment philosopher be bursting with envy be always rare luxury to be envied by philosopher think duly appreciated blessing showed in swagger with marched man under faggery window tempest be depressingly gloomy a walked along gentle reminder that must not take short cut across playing field after doctor prohibition must have to walk round did not tend to cheer up half feared must propose to walk over in defiance of consequence possibly if have be alone must have done so on account made grudging concession to law order at redwood however cheered up at once received royal welcome from little girl in marked contrast to miss mamie sulky reception of a destroyer of nice sash redwood be delighted to see family tea be quite merry one when adjourned to captain den afterwards be decidedly out of indeed be broadly hinted to that little girl downstairs be anxious for one to teach consequence must mind considering there be game detested more than consequence young lady le open to instruction than miss redwood did not jump at offer be evident however tempest redwood wanted to talk with vague sense that by leaving to do so be somehow acting for benefit of low heath sacrificed sat down to assist in usual composite story how for instance square dr england met mealy faced little girl knew nickname a well a philosopher up tree said to must part for ever be said to ma will know of consequence be that there be row world said be up in present circumstance occult narrative be full of serious meaning for thought be far more with two senior above than with two exacting female junior below however time passed presently tempest come along youngster apprised that hour of release have come redwood walked back with from certain fragment of conversation fell on ear be able to gather something of result of conference if be only know said redwood 'd say stick out said tempest know be not sorry even if say so be choice between humble pie low heath losing said captain not much loss be know there be not fellow must spare le walked on in silence then redwood said england ought to see jarman rot everything way go on will be in better position to get altered if cave in once vowed must do will only chuckle said tempest with groan let who care whether jarman chuckle not retorted captain look here old chap think 'd chuckle more if got expelled must be biggest score must give take advice only give smallest know will think about said tempest of course will for sake of low heath next term will go ahead fellow will owe more than think here by odd chance just a came to school gate met mr jarman crofter walking out in deep confabulation know if saw if did pretended not to have done so walked on leaving to proceed do see said tempest rather know what mean too be extra reason why must swallow pride for once in order to sell tell be probably counting on sticking out nothing must disappoint more well old chap said tempest a came to door be not fault if do know be right be jolly bitter pill wish must swallow for good night have sense for once to keep what have heard to myself retired to bed more hopeful that must turn out right than have be for day two next morning be wandering about aloof from comrade in quadrangle waiting for bell to ring for first school when marple town bookseller tradesman familiar to most low heathen accosted be evidently not at home in school precinct with usual modesty felt have come to right source for information do belong to mr sharpe house young gentleman said with respectful nod quite captivated yes who do want want to see mr tempest very particular oh be up in room wait bit till bell ring will come out so mr marple stopped chatted about holiday be to begin in day two football match river know mr tempest pretty well said rather be fag know nice gentleman fancy pretty well off eh oh be swell people be poor know oh indeed not likely to buy much in way eh rather not be hard up a be be not much good trying to sell anything said remembering rumour about friend indebtedness anxious to screen from further debt ah indeed be in debt be round how do know said bristling up expect owes anything mr marple laughed be just what doe be why have stepped over like showing young gent up look here cried aghast for mercy sake show up marple be a likely a not be to be expelled a be must finish up if be likely to be expelled more reason must get money before go how much be gasped matter of two pound said tradesman look here said will promise will be paid wait till last day of term do marple mr marple stared at security fear be not good enough for on other hand probably knew that must not be good for trade if be to show up low heathen took envelope from pocket handed to contained be bill for sundry stationery magazine book postage stamp so on headed fourth final application envelope be addressed dr england with w marple respectful compliment bell rang just then be so anxious to get marple off scene wildly promised anything to be rid of be finally left just in time to meet tempest unconsciously strolling across quadrangle on way to keep appointment with doctor chapter twenty deepest depth did not see tempest again till afternoon a most of surmised be relieving feeling after interview with doctor by spin on river how wondered have interview gone have agreed to humiliating condition of apologising to mr jarman have pride be too much for after if so be probably last spin on river have house be selkirk there must doubt have be wager on event a be philosopher contented with bickering general impression seemed to be that have refused to surrender that being so game be up there be object in keeping up appearance spirit of defiance seemed to get hold of deliberately sat on fence of prohibited playing field in hope that mr jarman one must see trimble even went to length of crossing at one corner what made more trying be conduct of day boy who with acuteness did credit seemed to have discovered delicate situation resolved to make most of paraded field about twenty yard from fence jeering at openly daring to set foot on turf look at said one hung up like lot of washing on paling will make cut let have scientific meeting will clear out whereupon urbans ranged on grass under nose called upon mr flitwick to address on treatment of lunatic be too much be few in number paling be hard uncomfortable if thought be going to frighten away by demonstration be mistaken langrish in loud voice called out chair whereupon taking cue assuming that philosopher be in congress called upon mr trimble to favour with oration on mud oh serene said trimble who till that moment have have a little notion of subject a have have mud be dirty lump of stuff lying about on grass like what see in front of have brain sense be vile thing to look at worse to touch if if here broke in mr flitwick want to see what lunatic really be must look on paling of of school playing field if happen to see row of squinney eyed ill dressed mule with large boot turn up nose afraid of life to move off where be be prize lunatic have pleasure in exhibiting few choice specimen collected from various source one thing one thing about mud be dare come within reach of continued trimble getting little random in statement for fear of getting one in eye if want sample there be one shouted flitwick interrupting orator with fragment of mother earth in face of course be up after doctor doctor must sit by see treasurer assaulted so hurled on foe regardless of consequence deadly fight ensued of more cautious of number be lucky enough to be able to drag men off prohibited field engage on right side of fence be not so lucky indeed be doubly unlucky for not only be adversary dear friend dicky brown whom loved a brother edged further further afield a combat went on so at last be cut off from main body left to fight duel conspicuously in open dicky be not scientific pugilist have awkward way of closing in with getting round middle just at moment that left foot got round behind right calf grief to say that although boasted of far more talent in exercise of fistic art than did have on back on grass just a mr sharpe of person walked by what be two doing demanded master stopping short fighting sir said stalwart dicky licked why be fighting because flitwick shied mud at trimble said reason did not seem to appeal to mr sharpe who replied heard doctor order yesterday jones iv about keeping off playing field yes sir said realising for first time be well out in middle of field that rest of comrade be looking on from safe distance come to after school for exemplary punishment be most disorderly boy in house be evident lenient punishment be good in case please sir said loyal dicky lugged on good part of way did snarled taking a taunt whereas be intended a leg up came of own accord very well said mr sharpe will come to jones iv of accord walked away be reckless defiant deaf to dicky sympathy care said be good job for came up must have licked hollow must old chap have over twice said dicky come outside finish out so adjourned to other side of paling finished out in presence of assembled urbans philosopher grieve to say once more dicky have on back wrath of comrade be even more grievous to bear than rejoicing of enemy be promptly withdrawn from fray a bad lot have not be for opportune bell must probably have be kicked round at rate went in disgusted with with low heath with everybody be use of keeping up tempest ten to one be expelled dicky brown once inferior must put on back philosopher hated mr sharpe have marked down for exemplary punishment publicly denounced a worst boy in house in single term what wondered must be like if remained at end of second term looked dismally into tempest study be not back pridgin be in did not want faggery just now be impossible never felt more lonely miserable in life be wandering down passage with jacket flung over shoulder shirt sleeve still tucked up when voice of crofter stopped look here said content of pocket may be interesting to want littered about passage here catch hold held out handful of loose letter why what be matter how blue look have one be hurting rather not have be licking young cad be well look a if enjoyed anyhow have tempest come back probably be expelled said determined to have thing a miserable a possible sincerely hope not said crofter in tone quite softened to doe like 'd be sorry if left same think jarman must like to see kicked out be one reason why might stay on crofter laughed sweetly what notion why have have good mind to go to england stick up for be good job have said what be afraid be that be worried about other thing hope by way never said anything about what told other day said not quite candidly for have tried to tell tempest must not let be right hope be cleared debt off by now think have stammered really be pity doctor must be much more likely to be down on for being in debt than pulled up suddenly a tempest at moment walked up must have heard last few word if required look of guilt confusion on part to convince have be speaking of think gave proof positive have apparently intended to summon to study a saw with whom be conferring overheard subject of conversation thought better of with lowering face stalked away wished be dead then something told have lost friend that amount of explanation must do away with barrier have suddenly be erected between awkward said crofter be good job be talking harm of wo fancy talking about at said suppose have a much right to talk about a one else will be awfully down on know said miserably can say be if be be young fool if care two straw tempest good fellow be rather way of not allowing fellow to have soul of own failed to console made one effort to see tempest explain be occupied with book did not even deign to notice presence in study later on in evening speculation a to result of morning interview be set at rest unusual summons came to sharpe to meet doctor in hall assembled uncomfortably with sore spirit worry of whole business be telling on heartily hoped while clamoured for surrender in word tempest must disappoint for once doctor came presently looking very grave accompanied by mr jarman from head master face concluded at once that be up to surprise said be glad to say in reference to matter met boy about yesterday that tempest have taken proper sense of duty have undertaken to apologise for conduct to mr jarman that being so tempest will please take opportunity of expressing regret tempest flushed a rose in obedience to doctor summons be evidently a redwood have said bitter pill have be le brave fellow must hardly have swallowed a be even knowledge that welfare of entire house be somehow dependent on submission be scarcely able to break down pride advanced to mr jarman more like one who come to administer thrashing than ask for pardon after eyeing almost fiercely for moment summoned self control sufficiently to say hoarsely apologise sir mr jarman bit lip be not triumph have expected indeed whole manner of be such a to hurt instead of soothe feeling be hardly apology said to doctor trust tempest mean that regret action be awkward question tempest have gone further than one expected silence now reminded doctor what cost have be think said not waiting for reply to own question tempest have fulfilled pledged not cordially be sorry to say sufficiently very well sir said mr jarman accept apology for what be worth seems very little now regret to say continued head master producing letter made heart jump to mouth have more serious matter to speak about wish heartily what have just heard have be end of painful interview be necessary to refer to something different very serious offence against rule concern tempest be fact that be in debt to of tradesman tempest changed colour again replied yes sir be sorry to say be held on tight to desk be finishing touch surely if one felt criminal letter addressed to containing bill for more than two pound owing by part of since last term have be left at house presume by tradesman to whom be due come here look at tempest tempest obeyed be fact that be in debt to extent yes sir more be aware here must stand no longer sprang to foot shouted please sir be fault everybody turned to in amazement a well might fault jones iv come forward explain mean said rather shouted speaking while walked up room be fault got that bill sir know how got be meant to get to really must have dropped be going to try to get paid for sir really tempest gave glare knocked spirit out of what business have seemed to demand to meddle in private affair felt have done real bad turn by clumsiness have not wit to avoid making bad worse yes sir told marple purposely refrained from mentioning name jones iv why can not do so too told to keep dark got to give to knew tempest have enough money to pay exclamation of anger from tempest cut short be sent ignominiously back to place tempest said head master very sternly send in list of owe before go to bed to night understand that unless be paid by friday when break up will not be allowed to return to low heath after holiday must cease in case to retain headship of house even for few day of term remain understand crofter come next in form order will act a head boy in meantime in midst of anguish must see look of meek resignation on crofter face that of quiet satisfaction on mr jarman at tempest dared not look at fellow philosopher what have done what be to become of how must get out of be three question set poor brain spinning a wandered off alone to remotest corner of quadrangle a later on lay miserably awake in bed have done friend about a much harm a possibly must may not have meant who care what fellow mean so long a act like cad a to what be to become of have have taste of already faggery door have be locked against missive shoved under bottom have apprised of fate in quarter to beast sarah take notice that be kicked out of philosopher if dare show abominable face within mile of will get over with ruler have be resolved by mr langrish seconded by mr trimble passed by lot that be be hereby kicked whenever one see one not kicking will be lammed be also resolved that faggery be fumigated disinfected during holiday that chap seen talking to be refused to be let in till have be vaccinated be about lowest meanest vilest abominablest unmitigatedest sneak going three cheer for poor old tempest down with girl school washerwoman fiery document be formally signed by philosopher in house together with particular word of opprobrium addressed to by of former colleague be not long in realising be outcast in sharpe one must look at still le speak to pridgin ordered off like dog wale slammed door in face when appeared in preparation long hiss saluted even though mr sharpe be present even outside fellow seemed to have heard of crime looked askance gave wide berth can truly say found most miserable boy in low heath only longed for end of term to come might shake dust of hateful place from foot drop out of sight of school full of enemy indeed a lay awake that night have serious thought of making off there then if have only have boot think might have done so be in blacking room desperation drew line at walking off in bare foot be sitting up in bed half whimpering with headache misery when light appeared at end of dormitory be crofter in new capacity of head of house taking round before turning in sight of brought home to injury have done not only to tempest whole house for be fault mine only that crofter be at moment captain of sharpe to surprise alarm when came up to bed stopped short drawing letter from pocket put into hand saying put that under pillow till morning be more than nature must do to sleep with mystery like on top of misery listened to clock a struck hour through night thought day must never come indeed getting up bell have sounded before winter sun struggled in through dormitory window then by light of candle seized missive from under pillow tore open five pound note fell out with following letter have made nice mess of ought to be happy least can do be to try to make thing right for tempest call round on following six tradesman giving six name one of be marple early to morrow pay tempest bill at bring home receipt need mention who sent send receipt to if tempest asks question tell paid money by request of friend w crofter chapter twenty one be advised to lie low first impulse on reading crofter letter be to jump for joy

a must see be not a bad a made out certainly never said anything a bad about a said about what must be object now if be not disinterested one must be permanent captain of house if tempest left yet be doing very thing must keep tempest at school tempest have openly insulted during term yet here be helping enemy out of very tight place knew be well off so probably must afford l at end of term pocket money be not plentiful commodity said nothing about being paid back too surely did not mean to make tempest free gift of magnificent amount more thought over more felt crofter be brick have be scandalously misunderstood seemed to true type of virtuous man who when struck on one cheek turn other when robbed of coat offer cloak too only hoped tempest might know what owed in short in brief time took to dress have worked up into state of enthusiasm on subject of crofter a to mystery of mr marple letter having got into doctor hand doubt have be careless dropped compromising envelope foolish honest person did not occur to at time might have be crofter have picked up dropped in head master letter box supposing be doing very clever thing tempest must not be likely to allow to explain be hard on made more virtuous on part to assist now in putting thing right for luckily for have friend at low heath in spite of when encountered crofter in morning requested with knowing look of intelligence to give exeat into town to do shopping be probably first recognition have received of temporary authority a head of house made difficulty in granting request made way first of to

have seen pretty little pencil sharper be quite new will be pleased if will accept one young gentleman pencil sharpener be very thing wanted term have be wrestling with blunt penknife sooner uncovered lead at end of pencil than broke off so in weak moment accepted gift forfeited advantage from marple proceeded to confectioner where score of nearly pound stood against tempest here again experienced sweet of being treated with distinguished consideration being asked to partake of strawberry ice how rammage by way continued to have strawberry ice in middle of december have never yet clearly understood while receipt be being made out mr winget hatter rather disappointed by offering nothing more than sincere thanks for settlement of little bill might at least thought have offered mourning hatband new school ribbon bill however be only five shilling so probably profit did not permit of gratuitous allowance in recognition of distinguished service be consoled however by mr ringstead game man who presented with net bag for holding tennis ball urged whenever wanted little thing in way of repair to bat fresh spike to running shoe to let know be very pleasant grieve to say that shady side of petty bribery corruption never once occurred to simple mind returned to school covered with self satisfaction virtuously clutching in hand crown final change out of fiver in due course put in envelope together with batch of receipt laid on crofter table after morning school with laconic message under flap right tj iv be far too knowing to let out secret to philosopher whose agitation indignation at tempest probable expulsion knew bound somewhat amused look here sarah said langrish a entered for first time after disgrace of previous day knew comrade well enough to be sure must like

paid know that suppose said langrish a motion about sarah being kicked out be properly seconded be off be doe gentleman second motion said coxhead glancing round assembled philosopher one seconded jolly lucky shave for young sarah said coxhead thanks awfully said may a well divide up pool now suggested warminster with generosity be really touching philosopher have clubbed together shattered fragment of term pocket money to assist tempest in financial trouble have done ungrudgingly nay enthusiastically be not against that enthusiasm remained now a one unexpectedly received back philosopher mite from depth of kindly pool be very well keeping secret like mine for twenty four hour be effort did prevailed on comrade to keep too be even harder work to prevail upon a matter of policy to accept temporary supremacy of crofter in house nothing must induce to refrain from cheering tempest much to displeasure on possible occasion made awkward for sometimes when happened in crofter presence for a thing now be in sharpe cheer for old captain meant hoot at new felt that crofter did fellow only know did not deserve resentment after forty eight hour must not restrain longer be not fair to myself crofter low heath one must suppose tempest be to be expelled when really be not so with misgiving decided to put in way break agreeable news to so have everything cleared up before end of term be not difficult to find excuse have not be to tempest room since unlucky quarrel have be suffering inconvenience ever since by fact that latin gradus be there on last day one of term therefore developed burning desire to consult missing handbook must need go in search of tempest be sitting miserably enough before fire with foot on fender hand up to back of head a entered be not till be well in room have closed door that turned round saw thought at first meant to fly at face clouded so angrily changed to look of contempt a said well tempest be awfully sorry really be let have of if thought 'd meant must precious soon know what to do have done about worst turn fellow must if be conceited young as must be use thrashing a be somebody else may do when be gone wretchedness of tone quite touched forgot anger sense of resentment old affection loyalty came back with rush how must ever have imagined fellow like crofter be worthy to hold candle to old dux really tempest began losing head blundering scarcely knew whither when saw talking to crofter uttered angry exclamation there now shut up about friend crofter want to hear about be not friend tempest be be wheeled round in chair laughed bitterly be queer time to joke said with laugh cut through be joke tempest know what be done for fancy do about bill said faltering know ah come here to tell about that be of own accord paid what shouted tempest springing from chair facing round paid know at least paid for paid caught by collar shook like puppy said knew gasped paid bill say that blackguard have cheek to got to do be money though groaned a if one have wounded crimson flush of shame mortification overspread face for moment stared at speechless then pulled together strode out of room utterly bewildered half terrified followed what have done to offend have trouble of term turned head to alarm made straight for crofter study one be there turned saw tell crofter want at once departed with heart in mouth at foot of staircase met crofter tempest want to see said sent to to ask to come doe know inquired crofter yes told thought ought to let know crofter laughed sweet laugh if have wanted known over low heath said must hardly have done better than tell to keep secret 'd much sooner have not known however where be in study think felt constrained to follow crofter evidently be expecting to be recipient of outburst of effusive gratitude have not courage to disabuse walked pleasantly graciously into study where tempest stood flushing biting lip awaiting be true what that youngster say that have have that have paid bill of mine be sorry told tempest thought might get out of difficulty expect to thank take that for daring to meddle in affair struck crofter on cheek not hard blow one sent recipient reeling across room with astonishment for moment expected fight crofter however pale smiling still declined challenge will be sorry be sure said a coolly a must only wanted to do good turn be sorry already said tempest who have already gathered together hoped 'd fight like man a be afraid to be sorry touched see nothing to fight about said crofter see what there be to be angry about tempest waited motionless for few uncomfortable moment in hope that crofter must pluck up spirit to accept challenge a crofter only smiled turned on heel strode out of room a passed beckoned imperiously to follow did so in terror put piece of paper pen before write down there account of bill paid amount obeyed memory fortunately served for task now go have have satisfaction of seeing make as of in striking that cad be not worth may go tell be sorry if like a for want to see more of go to captain leave alone flung miserably into chair leaning forward with head on hand apparently indifferent whether stayed went went leaving thus memory of sitting there haunted night for week to come when next day news went round that tempest have escaped expulsion general delight be tempered with amazement at rumour accompanied that owed escape to crofter one crofter must have put latter story into circulation to one knowing two senior a well a did be obvious that what have completed humiliation of one have be crowning triumph of other crofter must not have avenged for insult of term more effectively tempest proud nature must not have suffered bitterer wound than to know that have be put under obligation in spite of without possibility of preventing by worst enemy ordinary sharper must hardly be expected to trouble about question of motive be sufficient for that hero be saved that credit of popular act saved belonged to crofter consequently be cheered equally when appeared in public of two crofter accepted popularity with far better grace than mortified adversary be very miserable to a slunk home afternoon in train hope of wonderful term have be disappointed be recognised dunce idler at low heath have lost best friend sold to enemy self respect be at low ebb knew that in post two must come report must bring tear to mother eye cause guardian to grunt say expected a much worst of be must not get out of head yet be rather fine young fellow if only people knew that

will pull together right enough take advice lie low bit be best thing for complaint why said be just exactly what tempest said to there be again broke in dicky cutting hunch of cake presently redwood began to draw on subject of tempest looked rather blank when told of dismal circumstance in term have closed at sharpe however did not favour dicky with much comment on matter finally got to help sharpen skate talk about other thing went to bed night at dicky more easy hopeful than have be for week felt half impatient for term to begin again so that might put into practice new trebly patent specific of lying low chapter twenty two putting on brake holiday went by rapidly enough tore away from dicky consoling companionship three day from end rushed home to see mother wonder what thought of difference couple of week have made in when started to dicky have be limp dejected down on luck now found chirpy with stiff upper lip did not make remark must see how relieved be mother be not

continued that will probably tool about more le to end of time be in line say rather back to pull together for so do tom best friend have doe so too journey next day be very different from strange journey of term ago have tan boot square topped hat lavender glove must afford to smile with langrish who joined en route at of poor little greenhorn on way to make entry into low heath how different be too to be hailed by dozen voice from top of omnibus at station told to hop up beside how jolly to ride in triumph up bridge street exchanging shout with familiar passenger on way uttering defiant war whoop at day boy how jolly to tumble in at sharpe door once more slap one on back crowd up into old familiar faggery hear old chaff slang interspersed with story of holiday second hand christmas joke how jolly to hear organ again in chapel prayer with friend round finally when day be over tuck up again in little cubicle hear chum voice across partition droning more more sleepily till finally dropped off together one of last to arrive during day be tempest who have run from station came in flushed with exercise grave tight about lip ovation received from philosopher scarcely drew smile from when reached own study slammed door ominously cheerlessly behind none of liked what be to be said coxhead be to be cock of house term have chucked up be question be agitating till form order be posted to morrow one must tell crofter knew have be doing knew to get ahead considering slack way in tempest have let thing go last term seemed very much a if might succeed if did duty must be difficult one crofter have claim on for having saved tempest from being expelled must hardly refuse to own must come out cock of house on other hand tempest be man of heart tender imagination failed to picture in secondary position in sharpe secondary to crofter above other thing day closed with one curious incident langrish came to after supper in state of wrathful perturbation look here young sarah said be tempest fag not be about know said be told told did want cad like hanging about place very well that doe follow be fag a well a crofter here catch hold have got to take to crofter be not going to take mean licking most likely see why be to be let in for handed envelope evidently containing coin addressed crofter in tempest well known writing did not relish commission for have guess a to content of missive curiosity however prompted to take proceed to crofter study well youngster said crofter turned up again have seen tempest yet yes sent said crofter took envelope opened five sovereign half sovereign dropped out on table letter accompanied money meaning be clear enough crofter brow contracted habitual smile deserted for once what be mistake said be what owes suggested suppose so be only l shilling penny perhaps rest be something for remarked making scarce in time to escape task of returning change bother crofter must square part of business up with enemy did want to be dragged more into there be rush for house board early next morning to learn fate a to captaincy of sharpe whew said langrish a reached bracketed so be tempest crofter name be braced together at head of list be nice go suppose will have to go worse for must think a tempest be captain last term will go on again said be captain when term ended crofter be vote fight out said warminster two to one on winner must save trouble if made pridgin head be third man up pridgin easy going owner of name be spared something by not being present to hear amused contempt with suggestion be greeted hour later doctor came down to settle matter for under circumstance said seems right that crofter must take charge of house understand that tempest debt on account of be removed from headship last term be now honourably settled a be more than once reported for breaking rule last term be only fair that crofter whose mark be equal against whom complaint be recorded must captain house be tempest on whole looked relieved crofter smiled satisfied smile pridgin wale looked blue philosopher took time to consider what thought a for although tempest have thrown over must guess what blow be for not personally for must probably be glad to be rid of responsibility a public disgrace be sure to wound keenly longed to be able to go tell how sorry be after what have happened last term dare not in respect whether liked not must lie low philosopher be not long in formally exchanging opinion on situation meeting be summoned for same evening to inaugurate thing generally be little doubtful what ought to do last term philosophy have not tended to diligent work with good resolution in view felt must be better out of little tiff with comrade before holiday have almost solved difficulty since then have be formally re admitted to fold must be almost treasonable to scratch now move third old trim second fourth announced langrish that old sal be be president a before carry motion said warminster who prided on acquaintance with procedure of public meeting move amendment said shut up will be kicked out again said secretary shut up will be kicked in retorted feeling must carry everything with high hand if be to carry at look here chap be not so green a look then must look fearfully green muttered coxhead took heed of interruption be not relevant proceeded be very well last term wo wash what say be that if cock of school be head boy in school cock of house be head boy in house president of philosopher have got to be chap highest up in philosopher be not now old warminster be be jolly clever chap got form prize on head be rattling good speaker middling sprinter writes fairly good hand be sort of chap want want one who can keep secretary treasurer auditor registrar lot in place doe mind telling be idiot when be never must do be rough on club not to have chap like warminster continued waxing warm undaunted by murmur of audience can make sit up be not sort of chap to let philosopher go rotting about talking what know nothing about that will see that lout be kept out of only fellow who have got record of something be let in bless used to let in sort of bounder asked look round see be sort of lot let in wo wash though fancy having lot of outsider who ca translate latin motto make 'corpore ' feminine genitive now old warminster nailer at latin can put one two of to bed at euclid will keep out of blunder of sort make school grin at therefore propose fifth fourth third second that tip warminster be president of philosopher that secretary treasurer auditor registrar lot get month notice to jack up unless be on front desk there be of course wo like ca help that back deskers for front desk nothing oration longest ever delivered so far in probability longest ever will deliver be listened to with curious mixture of discomfort attention at first be nearly howled down took a went on warminster for whom really did not feel quite so much admiration a word seemed to imply who yet be hard working man of lot warminster be wonderfully pleased with others one by one dropped noisy protest looked out of window trimble attempted little bravado by sticking tongue in cheek peroration be listened to with marked attention cut down club bit said coxhead who occupied desk in class on third row if be only to be top deskers cut old sal out to begin with said langrish who be just on bench of honour will cut out next week old ho said what be talking about wait till week order be up will see langrish glared indignantly if think idiot like be going to look here said warminster vote go easy at first make one who be not gone down in order in month say nobody who be not gone up one in term suggested langrish glancing defiantly at serene said that will suit book will be roughish on though will see how will feel when be chucked out neck crop beauty main object have be to get out of being president somehow in doing have struck note made philosopher sit up be credit to happened so be one of lucky fluke sometimes turn out well do good stroke without striker being aware of be unanimously elected president bore blushing honour with due meekness old sal philosopher have taken to abbreviating pet name term know not on what principle of familiarity old sal pile on bit remarked of course must help rotting club bit last term be way be born considering what rank outsider be suppose did best laughter cry of what about jarman guy yes be howling mess vote keep out of that term leave to lout tell what said vote make show up at sport next month take of side out of day boy kid fancy jolly sight too much dicky brown told said be sure of jump quarter mile tug that selkirk be going to pull off others except half mile handicap may get that say because will probably give fifty sixty yard lead howling cheek exclaimed one in furious rage idea of being given sixty yard start in half mile by day boy be too much even for philosopher whereupon solemnly considered list of event under divided out among ourselves with vow to eat head if did pull off a many for sharpe a rest of school put together decided to postpone making entry till last moment so a to delude enemy into impression that be shirking sport altogether then must a warminster politely put drop down rot lot before adjourned for night question of tempest crofter came up propos of report one mentioned that tempest have entered for open mile against redwood be expected to prove warm customer be crofter in pridgin be of course wo come up to scratch wale only enters for show of thing crofter must look in at tempest over mile said langrish ought to enter for can look in at tempest over anything said ask question wo be told whopper astutely replied trimble wonder if expects to back up sha' said one will said one two others vote let alone said coxhead what be got to do with when doe come across only when there be row on be got nothing at to say to at other time mean if want to let alone will have to shut up row inquired langrish rather rough be not if know reason suggested let send round robin let know not bad idea whereupon following candid epistle be concocted signed by present to t crofter esquire captain sharpe pro tem etcetera etcetera etcetera dear crofter undersigned philosopher wish to say be going steady term on own hook hope will not think be because of want to be interfered with by chap except old tempest who ought to be cock of sharpe so have decided to go steady so a not to be interfered with because must rather not interfered with because be serene be backing up tempest hope will pull off mile that have not entered for be down on because pulled tempest through last term be rough be cock of house instead of therefore on account be going steady so a not to give fag of interfering with mind tempest doing because consider have more right to interfere with than hoping be well in good health a leaf believe with kind regard to at home yours very kindly in alphabetical order so that need know who started letter samuel wilberforce coxhead thomas jones everard langrish jonathan t purkis alfred james remington trimble percy algernon warminster others important document writing of grieve to say necessitated frequent reference to english dictionary langrish a crofter fag undertook to deliver faithfully discharged mission by leaving on captain table when be out of study be decided to resist temptation of sending mr jarman similar explanatory letter for fear might lead to row must call for interference be deemed prudent under circumstance to commit in writing to tempest whom hoped to convince of loyalty by cheering on possible occasion otherwise making thing pleasant for how crofter enjoyed letter none of knew be inconsiderate enough to give sign of having received still more inconsiderate to allow on more than one occasion to be publicly complimented by doctor mr sharpe on order of house meanwhile philosopher stuck to new programme have satisfaction of pulling down langrish from place on top desk at end of first week have triumph of recovering seat at end of week after in seclusion of faggery indulged in few mild recrimination be natural outcome of rivalry only served to blow off steam be too keen to win self imposed battle in class to allow personal feeling to interfere much with work mr sharpe be fairly astonished took off glass rubbed mild eye a read over really meritorious exercise listened to sometimes positively coherent feat of construing secretly too with great precaution in spot far removed from detection of day boy practised grimly at jumping sprinting record breaking generally finally a critical time for making entry approached agreed upon particular exploit of be to undertake for honour glory of sharpe house in general philosophy in particular before time arrived however one awkward incident occurred to remind have even yet not quite purged myself of folly of last term stumbled against crofter just outside door come in said obeyed guessing that at last be to hear something of famous letter be disappointed however crofter made reference to said bill paid for last term jones iv did none of people allow discount discount said what be that have got to yet in syntax be young as did none of give change rather of brought back used to pay rest what mean be did make anything out of for did oh conscious blush suddenly mounted a grasped meaning yes well only see be come lie know about did did not not from hat man said from others only yes be what want to know yes will do now understand why be so pleased with job be profitable thing to help friend sometimes tempest will be amused when hears oh say really did fancy will do say cut do hear only wanted to know whether be right not in what told tempest oh pleaded with groan of misery if cut will lick for disobedience after good resolution hope that be squared that before long tempest must believe in again slunk away in despair curled up in bed night most miserable boy in low heath chapter twenty three pretty warm round dicky old chap be in howling mess same old one new one be about blessed bill of tempest wish 'd let alone see be way how be to know be sure never meant to do anything shady dare say not what be talking about why have be regularly let in see look here old chap let hear what be said practical dicky why fact be most of chap wanted to stand something when squared up with crofter try to make out be thief be going to show up to tempest did let well yes one two see marple gave pencil sharpener rammage strawberry ice ringstead net bag spike jolly bad one too came out in week doe crofter say swindled tempest did think be swindling anybody said evasively made pretty good thing out of though know say dicky what be to be done thought be going to pull round square term really did now be in regular fix dicky pondered be bit shady said with refreshing candour sort of thing ananias oh for pity sake dicky if be have got to say be not think 'd best make good somehow ca give back how can give back strawberry ice be poser certainly set dicky thinking again have got other thing asked no pencil sharpener smashed first time used net bag got lost at home awkward will have to buy new one who for tempest of course be bill be crofter money tempest have paid back result of conversation be that instead of practising for quarter mile afternoon went down town with bag expended five shilling of term pocket money in purchase of pencil sharpener strawberry ice net bag set of patent screw spike dicky like brick undertook to convey to tempest with following letter wrote at suggestion dear tempest send back change got out of bill got last term be sorrier than can say hope wo hate more than do dicky will tell how jolly blue be how hope will win mile be backing up crofter hope will soon be captain again please excuse writing like to come tell a be so down on truly t jones iv also penned further letter for crofter dear crofter need mind telling tempest a have done so paid back with thanks same yours truly tj iv felt vastly easier in mind when polite letter be at end when saw faithful dicky depart to execute brotherly mission one fear be lest strawberry ice must get warm before reached destination waited in vain for sign of response from tempest philosopher went down during afternoon to watch training for race vouchsafed regard for knew still put down a thief sharper dicky whom met later on explained that have failed to catch tempest in study have deposited article along with letter on table so that if did not know of yet soon must anxiety be not at allayed by casual encounter with crofter in evening summoned into study where saw billet doux lying on table suppose wrote said yes think everything clear now do be said dare say dr england will be able to tell by way why did only give shilling penny change instead of shilling penny there be only shilling penny to give really thought so too till clever management of tip tempted to look over bill again see that what paid only came to l shilling penny instead of l shilling penny want other shilling hope bought something nice with must consider present from tempest not timed red white in sudden confusion of announcement be positively certain shilling penny have be change that if there be mistake must be on part of tradesman not how be likely to convince crofter for matter of tempest that such be case promise said only have shilling penny change really crofter do believe believe word say said crofter with smile have reason to have really truly what be use of saying more of course be really truly have doubt tempest belief too please let see bill pleaded will show be right unfortunately tempest have dare say will be delighted have told about have gasped in helpless misery be going to be too good joke to be kept to myself suppose will mind certainly wo be surprised oh crofter for goodness ' sake tell said blundering on into appearance of guiltiness of be quite innocent be wanting so awfully to be friend with again have given back got out of shop will spoil everything if tell really be true either crofter laughed pleasantly be rather likely must shield be when term friend have be insulting defying setting to upset authority a captain of house oh be what doe precious thing mean demanded producing famous round robin be meant to be politeness suppose only mean faltered that be sorry tempest be not captain naturally be nice to have captain one can swindle rob be groaned miserably seemed use trying to put right if chose to be civil back up must be different said crofter be be going a steady a anything said what do mean by going to pridgin wale tempest for exeats special leave instead of to demanded be point be unprepared for be true that philosopher in desire not to be interfered with by new captain have made point of applying a be entitled to do to of other prefect of house in preference to crofter for exeats occasional leave to go without bound have always be considered prerogative of captain of house to grant strictly speaking other prefect have right too tried to explain a much of course said be very neat way of ignoring authority expect to come to will not refuse reasonable request be not going to be insulted in own house said there be 'but ' about if want to prevent being shown up to friend a amiable young swindler can stop by undertaking that lot will do what tell if not be own look out be luckily school bell enabled to get away without giving pledge fool a be knew what meant be attempt to buy over at cost of unlucky shilling with to secure crofter in authority so dearly coveted so far so imperfectly enjoyed philosopher a might be expected waxed very indignant when made clean breast of whole matter with usual frankness quite admitted that might have pilfered shilling that sort of thing remarked be quite in line in keeping with character generally hoped to live to see hung a to caving in to crofter a cost of shelter drew line at that have right to impose new rule take away immemorial privilege of sharper besides if gave in on point must immediately have to go ask leave to practise for sport in callow meadow be just out of bound where in strict seclusion diligent practice have be going on for week with most promising result be thereupon ordered to write laconic rejoinder to tempting offer philosopher promising to back up in matter of shilling see through with heavy heart therefore sat down penned following brief epistle be approved by faggery ordered to be laid on crofter table before bed time dear crofter think be not good enough be lie about shilling yours sincerely tj iv of philosopher demurred to sentence about shilling appeared to commit to opinion did not hold have way for once retired to bed when be done wondering whenever peace must come friend must rejoice to see one again a of old know how soon fell asleep must have be pretty soon for can remember seeing crofter come into dormitory turn out gas can remember in general stillness hearing voice noise of poking fire in mr sharpe room downstairs after forgot everything until suddenly discovered awake again thing seemed strange a slowly turned head on pillow blinked up with half opened eye dormitory seemed hot stuffy somebody something be making noise wished must stop must see nothing except hazy outline of shirt hanging on back of chair even seemed to come go a watched be indisposed to move mind be half asleep still one thing did long for be for noise to stop one to open window be simply choking must hardly breathe suddenly shirt seemed to turn red by lurid light emitted must see smoke coming over top of door then side of room grew red too seemed to close in on getting redder redder a did so till finally by frantic effort raised in bed yelled fire answer be great volume of smoke leapt out at like savage beast sent back on to pillow deafening roar outside sudden blaze half blinded stifled cry be on lip be can remember distinctly be vaguely conscious of hearing name called of seeing door move of everything whirling round round finally of falling getting being dragged out of bed next thing be aware of be be lying in strange bed with headache otherwise tolerably comfortable though awfully thirsty a weak a mouse water please remarked at large instantly face bent over strangely familiar face after moment reflection told be mother be such surprise forgot about water took nap instead in due time must have woke again time by candlelight mother be there yes darling what be shirt caught fire hush dear try to talk did quite see why be really curious about several thing in fact thirsted for information why may talk mother because have be ill did get doctor leave yes dear mother well sonny darling how did get here sent told did believe about shilling really there be only

score for said be so glad mother evidently did not quite understand point of view concluded have be talking more than be good for once more implored to be silent have notion of giving up inquiry at stage did get hurt doing asked only hand little how did get at one thought be safe out of burning room with others when be found be not tempest rushed back before one must stop carried out have not got outside with more than second two when roof staircase fell in here shuddered a once more bent over kissed be wanted to hear at present closed eye in order to think over better chief sensation be one of exultation that tempest must risk life for meant that have won back in spite of then when recalled frightful blaze noise of night began to realise what rescue must have meant to one one fellow utterly scornful of danger utterly determined to save life in peril at cost must have ventured into place must have done for one knew to come deliberately after who have ruined chance last term whom despised a pilferer sneak be act of heroism baffled to contemplate in contemplation of consequently succumbed once more to sleep forgot everything a slowly got better after be not much damaged a soon a have got over effect of suffocation terror of awful night heard more about fire permission be given to see one friend day for ten minute at time reader may imagine wild excitement of ten minute

closely in footstep of saviour to whom have so often taught to look for help guidance at same time urged to pray for guidance of holy spirit goodness only made sorrow at parting greater more than time since have entered low heath pang of home sickness fell upon a saw into carriage just before train started felt heart beat suddenly blood rush to cheek a saw figure with one hand in sling running up platform looking into one carriage after mother here tempest next moment saw ran up heard be going by train said thought must like to say good bye good bye dear boy god bless once more youngster right

curious to dropping a did suddenly into first of poor sharper be burnt out faggery be more be hall dormitory be being put up temporarily in town house just outside school gate good deal to wrath of of number who felt be putting down to level of day boy however sight of scaffolding round old quarter cheery clink of trowel reminded that out exile be not for long that in brand new faggery on brand new chair round brand new table must shortly resume pleasant discussion on deepest question with human mind can occupy somehow apart from fire thing be going exactly a have left pridgin be reported to be working hard most alarming symptom be commonly surmised that must not stand playing second third fiddle to crofter a tempest be apparently content to be second pridgin have come to painful conclusion that only comfortable place for in sharpe be number one be extremely inconvenient round for made necessary for crofter to bestir while of course seemed to threaten tempest chance of recovering place few of shrewdest held that pridgin be merely forcing pace in order to punish crofter for usurpation may have be so whatever motive quite upset normal flow of thing at sharpe change be marked reaction of public opinion in favour of tempest against crofter be probably due in first place to tempest exploit in rescuing from fire secondly to crofter caution in declining to enter for mile race at coming sport few week have dispelled little glamour latter have derived from apparently public spirited conduct last term attitude of philosopher have effectually deprived of opportunity of exercising authority left to enjoyment of altogether barren honour one other change be that tempest necessity to live very economically in order to repay grandfather for advance made have produced coolness between wale who have now retired from triumvirate attached to cause of crofter lastly mr jarman have suffered shock taken on badly about accidental part in recent fire have knocked vice out of for time being at rate left quite meek limp just now however only topic about one cared be a speedily discovered sport unusual keenness be being displayed everywhere senior be deeply concerned in issue of mile must redwood who have hitherto held own easily save laurel time must tempest with damaged hand be able to run hardest must dark horse at last moment enter to divide interest so on among middle boy considerable excitement be afoot especially in selkirk house where be reported boy of fifteen half be going to beat senior record in jump perhaps run public school record very close chief excitement be among junior have modestly set before task of winning event under fifteen for sharpe house to say nothing of pulling day boy over chalk in tug of war generally bringing philosopher well before public notice secret of intention have be well kept till within week of day have be taunted with shirking sport with being mug crock cripple with exercising better part of valour with being

little anxiety exercise before day be done a strolled down somewhat early charged with pleasing commission of bagging nine seat in middle of front row of stand seeing one collared met redwood fresh a daisy just returning from final inspection of ground hullo youngster be not running hear what pity doe matter said do mind not backing for mile laughed said must have thought poorly of if have not backed own man be hand right now asked say so said be worth six yard to though think so do said by way will do job for two young sister awfully want to be on ground have got leave if one will look

what did people take for why mile must take out of half a much right said where be be going home will send down sharp before crowd come thanks awfully youngster off went leaving pretty full up with care of deceitful world proceeded to bag nine best seat on stand a nobody else have yet put in appearance be easy enough without trying necessity of sitting on at same time when crowd arrived must be time enough to consider how must then have to act have not be long in possession when two dainty little figure in pink bore down hand in hand upon presumably under protection of nurse who however be not in when came to racing there be horrid sarah remarked mamie who tried to drown never mind said gladys be nearly burned to death to punish for being wicked hate because never give sweetie said

before race began to reduce at least to nine seat for be responsible how wished have sweet in order to reduce to only three by good luck dicky brown hove in sight just a be giving way to despair dicky old chap said if love get sixpennyworth of bull eye something 'd be grateful to a long a live dicky looked at anxiously evidently concerned for health jerk of head in direction of two little vixen who be just then trying to pull solemn looking day boy off one of chair by main force satisfied that case be urgent one like brick flew off to rescue solemn day boy stood persecution a long a must then rounded sharply on persecutor bother go away growled whereupon in flood of tear miss redwood made for insisted on being taken up one on knee cosseted because of what big ugly boy have done complied with energy of despair conscious that in so doing be allowing reserved seat one by one to be usurped be at same time rendering spectacle of contempt to at least eight young person whom in gap left between two wet face clung to cheek must see advancing in body clad in running drawer blazer in direction be vain for to try to escape from false position nearer philosopher approached more maudlin effusive unprincipled young female became flinging arm tragically round neck bedaubing face with dewy kiss sarah can go bit when like said langrish with cheerful guffaw standing in conspicuous place calling public attention to in way only added to sorrow rather wondered why went down so early said coxhead bird of feather said sententious trimble play fool together say what about seat though be bagged said getting face clear for moment must keep dare say mean be so busy spooning about with girl never thought of right miss molly said warminster think must squash up bit here said meekly look a if must said langrish squash away then to wrath indignation of whole stand philosopher crowded in in solid phalanx proceeded to accommodate eight person in space usually allotted to two took time for other seat holder to appreciate humour of manoeuvre before then bell have rung for first race dicky have returned with brandy ball deftly smuggled into hand a trotted past be now easy to square miss redwood who for blessed half hour cried truce be in vain that suggested that have better not plaster face frock more than must be helped with sticky substance of succulent pabulum contemptuously ignored right to make suggestion of kind finally abandoned to fate first few event be trial heat in a body be not specially interested when bell rang up for hundred yard under fifteen sport have begun for in earnest leaving two daughter of eve with bag of brandy ball between clambered out of place to perform last rite for warminster who be to carry colour of sharpe against dicky brown of day boy muskett of selkirk outsider went little to heart to be rubbing down somebody else calf dicky on occasion like such be life patriotism go before friendship time do come when one must wish confusion to one dearest brother so rubbed down one of warminster calf while trimble rubbed other langrish gave word of advice about start coxhead arranged to call on for spurt twenty yard from finish with exception of other evening when arrived at mother party have never seen warminster so meek nervous behaved exactly a if be taking last farewell must think have embraced have encouraged to do so now then said langrish give blazer bend well over toe for start do in breath run straight on track try to take other chap water said trimble look round at when yell bucket can said coxhead pull up till after pistol have gone said then left to work well enough did dicky went off at start a if 'd be shot out of double barrelled gun dicky with head down man with head up be what saved half way over dicky have to get chin up lost sixteenth of second meant six inch selkirk man made ugly rush thirty yard from home began too soon warminster wisely waited till heard coxhead shrill gee up in ear then laid on made six inch eight eight ten landed so much in front of dicky amid cheer if cloud have be little lower must have assuredly brought on shower one score to be sorry for dicky must be helped be

caught in nail suspended between heaven earth while gladys in uncertainty whether to scream assist have toppled to ground of heap solved difficulty way screech almost put loyal cheer to blush when rushed up to extricate one pick up other be in centre of hullaballoo almost threatened to wreck sport how quieted down know not believe be announced determination to walk straight home did at rate be clear to there be more rubbing down of sharpe calf for day must remain like casabianca on deck even though cost event of day be thankless task first of there be usual ceremony of cosseting drying tear then with pin have to mend rent in mamie frock then have to kiss of gladys elbow to make well finally have to stand fusillade of chaff jeer from philosopher made life heavier burden that be already at last to joy bell rang up for high jump under fifteen public attention be diverted from lamentable case a everybody who knew anything have anticipated langrish won metaphorically speaking on head knocked out second man selkirker at foot inch went on gamely inch higher clearing bar a prettily daintily a wale might have done in open event be not at certain must not have gone higher against opponent having such spur grew careless after barely shaking down bar twice at foot inch kicked off awkwardly third time so retired easy victor quite overcome by applause of now crowded field then came event of day open mile for tempest redwood be only combatant felt growing a nervous a if be running for instinct told that welfare of sharpe more le hung on issue must tempest win there must be doubt that must return to headship of house with eclat even crofter must have to yield to if not crofter might still hang on to rein claim doubtful right complication of unexpected kind arose now miss redwood be quite sufficiently au fait with etiquette of race course to know that if brother ran must win that everybody else must wish to win in unguarded moment joined in cheer greeted tempest a appeared stripped for action on way to starting post be taken up a grievous personal affront young lady repudiated flung from with energy disgust quite astonished loudly clamoured for removal failing made concerted retreat from detested vicinity nasty horrid sarah go away shouted then spying dicky brown in distance shrieked on to deliver want to go to dicky dear dicky get away from sarah suiting action to word swarmed over back of bench started in full cry for enviable dicky richard however be old bird for year did not pretended not to hear siren voice sheered off into open just in nick of time whereupon miss redwood redoubled clamour must only be allured back to shelter of fatigued wing by going to audibly bawling in face bravo redwood go redwood on term surrendered difficulty at cost indeed of reputation a loyal sharper be temporarily tided over be noticed that tempest though cool a ever be pale carried left hand while stood waiting in opening of waistcoat saw redwood go to say something pointing a did so to hand tempest reply be flush laugh a removed hand from resting place waved about at side did not like be too late now mr jarman stood ready with pistol up noise of field suddenly changed to silence two athlete with arm out stood straining on line off be good start pace be startling for mile tempest have inside track seemed to have advantage in lightness of step while redwood strength be more in length of stride first of four lap be run almost inch for inch perhaps tempest thanks to berth have foot to good a entered on second here man forged ahead slowly gradually drew to clear lead trembled a saw must stay apparently ran a lightly a before redwood a lay on at heel seemed to be going even easier however half mile saw tempest three yard ahead still going then to concern saw redwood stride lengthen little watched inch after inch of interval shrink until at end of third lap there be scarcely more difference than there have be at end of first yet man be still to front now be almost difficult for onlooker to breathe for tug be at hand fourth lap have scarcely begun when wild yell called attention to fact that tempest be once more putting on what be still more satisfactory be that be going a well a ever although in respect so be redwood gap opened again foot grew to yard yard to dozen half dozen to at last be two hundred yard from home when redwood stride once more lengthened out new shout told that chasm be once more being filled up inch by inch foot by foot tempest shout knew what meant too lengthened stride seemed a if be going to answer rush for rush heart stood still tongue clave to roof of mouth a perceived that must not come off must barely keep up present pace must see through perhaps distance be passed redwood have only recovered third of lead then yell broke out one wished must lend man inch hundredth part of inch redwood rush increased vanishing inch struck panic into philosophic breast must tempest hold out few yard be safe must no yes be level six yard then suddenly saw tempest fling hand behind reel forward with blind stagger over tape a simultaneous report proclaimed dead heat fall sprawling helpless on ground cheer died on lip for be surely something more than exhaustion broken wind redwood be beside in moment drew head on knee be dead faint not from fatigue from pain burned blistered hand have so carefully concealed from everybody of have made so little betrayed secret plainly enough for once pride determination have overrated physical strength have calculated on just being able to win race all have done be just to save at price a turned out be to cost week of illness even threaten loss of hand news of calamity spread like wildfire put end a far a at least be concerned to sport for day heard later in day that

warminster to be beaten after by day boy called dicky brown who amid change distraction of term have stuck doggedly to work be reported hot man for head place in junior division be exciting enough be a nothing to tussle at head of school pridgin alarming burst of work in easter term have contrary to expectation not died out one prophesied must sicken of wale laughed at crofter smiled sweetly tempest inquired frequently after health even redwood knocked off of extra cricket to keep pace with be trying to do asked tempest one day a friend looked in nothing dear fellow only amusing assure have queer idea of fun do know have hardly be out on river term owing to let prevent old chap exercise will do good tempest laughed hope yours will do good two can play at game two dozen have not got knife into though who crofter rather see other way of taking out of shirks sport take pound of flesh out of captaincy although know be right to one not even rowdy in faggery respect be why be going steady said just to rile only way to take out of be to make sit up harry said amiable pridgin only hope though wo land head of house be depending on to beat be not going to play second fiddle to crofter will serve right if doe land head responded tempest if doe will have to keep up to mark see shirk say that old chap will jack up said pridgin putting foot upon window ledge besides doe occur to that redwood leaving that second man up if be one of be left not only captain of sharpe captain of low heath know said tempest quietly say leslie of selkirk be in running for stuff nonsense

philosopher sobered perspiring have be spread out at two desk interval on three fatal day in large hall with day boy to right of selkirkers to left writing for life groaning over question only fiend must have devised only double first must have answered how have got on must no more tell than man in moon comrade when compared note afterwards cheerfully assured that out of fifty question on three day have possibly got question right that be doubtful depended on particular crib examiner swore by redwood to whom confided of answer thought rather more hopefully of case told to keep spirit up tempest said that if be to cuff for discreditable blunder have made must have ear ache for month dicky on other hand confessed that wished must believe have done a well a a for other philosopher
