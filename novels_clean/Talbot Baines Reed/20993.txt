of presence ever anon in weakness asking how must fare with be to find that too have deserted next day wandered about hoping for news getting none one man whom accosted looked so hard at when questioned about hall gave time to answer slunk away to avoid at night patience came well nigh to end resolved come what must of to go to park if by chance might meet ludar there at least send message be dark when climbed paling there be little chance unless marched boldly to door of hall of seeing night so resolved to bide time lying somewhere within view of house watch till came out in morning found thick clump of bush separated from house by width of lawn behind ensconced myself composed limb a best might to await daybreak be almost dozing when started suddenly to hear footstep voice not far away must be be too dark to distinguish anything a yet voice be not near enough to detect word be coming nearer in moment suspense be at end be not ludar that be well said voice knew to be captain

to hear what did how to prevent villainy be more to purpose at daybreak captain must depart day after unless must hinder dove must be in hawk clutch yet for five hour night have to lie still hing if showed be caught might be lost yet if missed chance of warning ludar betimes of peril impending might be too late so sat there chafing through brief summer night at dawn be on watch true to plan hour after daybreak captain merriman mounted horse sped briskly away from hall let go must meet perchance again after watched door for hour never sign of ludar must have to fight for maiden single handed after at last when be well nigh desperate sallied out cross bow over shoulder with solemn face walked towards wood hiding well by tree shrub made across to meet countenance lit up a saw otherwise might have parted from hour ago expected said come along be place for talking so followed in silence deep into wood where presently flung down bow put great hand on shoulder humphrey said must see that something big be on mind be same ludar parted with week ago said for have never seen thus before humphrey lad said be undone have lived ill saint have found out arm hang feeble at side be turned back from being man into boy be unworthy of shame to myself humphrey said clutching arm till vein in tingled be bewitched for sin dost thou hear be in love said with sinking heart have known what must come to moment parted with maiden at ferry that day have prayed against have laughed out of terror be on have called to mind scornful jest at love while knew what be to come of knew that what have won have lost so finished sentence for in reply took hand looked at with almost humble gaze scorn said love said ah yes said told so scorned for now what brings here humphrey change in voice be so sudden resolute that forbade to say word about matter heart be fullest of who know have spoken then might have guessed truth so life might have broken asunder at point now chance be past chance be come to tell news did then there marvellously moved not that spoke much still le raved face grew thunderous eye flashed few question asked put in voice half startled by smothered passion took in whole peril in moment if once have be fool enough to imagine must direct enterprise be to thwart villainy be soon undeceived humphrey aid be free to stand by in told that now owned master face cleared up joyously for moment at good claim then not a master a comrade be here to night a sun set take bow dirk farewell friend till meet again left chapter nine how caught misericorde so restless anxious be a day

heavy tramp crashing through underwood threw beside haggard dejected how be to know of said tell answered smiled scornfully have ever seen maiden said must know that be light task have at arm length if tell of peril offer protection will perhaps say need not protection that if like not peril need not face may suspect of serving while denounce enemy may take case to sir william whom believe to be

amidships crooned in native tongue with rower needed to row many mile round island before must hope to hoist sail yet must not help marvelling at vigour of oarsman at speed steadiness of boat over billow maiden who by blush when first met that morning have confirmed ludar story be content enough to sit in stern with while courted solitude in prow sat long while silent looking seaward think with self same light in eye dimmed of ludar presently however turned face to said almost suddenly humphrey tell more of maiden spoke about why doe not love knew not what to say question be so unlooked for tried to laugh off ask said why must be not sir ludar said gently then face blushed once more dropped silent looking away seaward be sorry for churlish speech feared have given offence here be wrong for presently said again be little maid who talk to at home in french whom carried in arm tell more of humphrey to please obeyed somehow a recalled gentle way of sweet little mistress quaint word have spoken in fancy saw once again bright face remembered how have always taken part chased away cloud from brow somehow knew not how memory seemed very pleasant to called to mind more yet wondered with how little have have her in thought since last parted that cruel day in kingston street a talked maiden listened eye stealing now again to where ludar lay wrestling with mighty happiness in prow then returning half frightened half pitying to encourage to tell more did then when be said asked again why doe not love indeed replied never asked do know if love smiled at may answer for at least love humphrey for sake yours will be sister to ludar said a stopped short yes to ludar then fell to talk about ludar so day wore on till a sun stood over head breasted fair island of raughlin here ludar with gloomy face came astern to tell story 't be brief merry a told with flashing eye voice rose fell with dashing wave listened with heaving bosom 't be of boy who once played with comrade on self same island of raughlin how in pleasant summer time have learned from noble brother to draw bow child a be to brandish spear how maiden be there of whom called sister how sang wild legend of coast told tale of lover fairy hero how now again white boat came over from mainland on noble warrior gigantic in form with yellow lock streaming in breeze sun flashing on gilded collar naked sword that noble man be boy father scarcely le noble form at side le by head than sire yet taller by head than most of clansman be boy elder brother how boy followed two wherever went begged to take to war on mainland smiled bade wait ten year so be left with woman child on island while men went off in galley to fight invader then one fatal day how woke to see white sailed ship in offing boat of armed men landing on shore how in doubt terror woman child old men hastened to yonder castle on hill begged few armed men there stand to guard then said ludar with thunder in face stranger spread like fly over fair island surrounded castle to resist be useless armed men offered to yield if woman child old men be spared 'yield then said captain gate be opened then false villain shouted with laughter slew armed men before eye of helpless captive 'bring torch shouted 'drive back into kennel ' shouted others then cry went up so terrible that on light summer breeze floated to mainland to where on headland noble father of boy stood like statue of horror a flame shot up wretched captive fought among who must reach door die on sword of enemy rather than by fire boy saw playmate tossed in sport on sword of murderer heard sister shriek to boy a be to slay before worse death befel then forgot except when day after awoke be in heart of deep cave into sea surged carrying with corps for week stayed there tended by rough shepherd living on seaweed fish well nigh mad with thirst at last came boat when boy woke once more be in castle of noble father whose face be like midnight whose once yellow hair be a white a snow be story said ludar be that boy murderer said falteringly for guessed answer murderer humphrey said be of same race a worst enemy mine gloomy story cast cloud over voyage until after long silence during sat watched rocky coast of ill omened island maiden said sir ludar there be older story of raughlin than yours listen while sing of wedding of taise taobhgheal befel there when yonder hill be crowned by beautiful white city with house of glass when warrior shone in golden armour then sang brave martial ballad of famous battle be fought on coast for hand of beautiful taise taobhgheal clear music of voice to rower lent chorus helped charm away sadness of ludar tale while away time till having rounded island hoisted brown sail flew upon wave past great organ shaped cliff of mainland sun have long set behind western foreland ere caught ahead of roar of surf on bar lay across river mouth rower have passed that way many time before plunged headlong into mighty battle of water where river sea met for short minute seemed a if boat must live in such whirl before well knew danger be in calm water within bar sailing gaily down broad moonlit river then ludar maiden grew sad at parting be to come being weary of helm left went forward beautiful river be in moonlight with wood crowding down to margin broken now again by rugged knoll smooth shining meadow to be strange to be in ireland yet have remind of own thames except wild chant of foreign rower many mile rowed then rather glided for ludar bade men slacken speed let night spend before presented at castleroe

be over captain merriman brought round that order must be given to follow capture at hazard therefore so soon a mcdonnells arrived bore ludar among to boat cast loose without delay in be none too soon for have not be long rowing ere noise of bugle shouting at castle gave to know that pursuit be begun lucky for wood on bank be too dense to allow to get within shot of after have got safely past town of coleraine be there much fear that being unprovided with boat must get at close quarter with once clear looked to comrade wound bullet have gashed arm have happily not lodged there have lost so much

returned said to be slain before eye so long a know be safe there will be hope for be brave enough to defend till come again ludar smiled bitterly knew a did there be nothing in word men said presently to scot sorley boy father be take sorley boy be fox leaf track said one of men last heard of at bonandonnye sail thither said ludar fell into silence 't be strange return voyage down broad river on ebb of self same tide have carried up of spoke word a watched bank one wondered if must be same world same men a few hour ago be relief presently to meet salt sea air on face to hear ahead once more angry roar of wave at river mouth just a reached place where channel narrowing suddenly tear way through sand into ocean posse of horseman dashed down on western shore shouted to so near be must see tom price among beside that rascally captain laker whom have seen heard last in sir william carleton garden at richmond one of rower pulled down to bottom of boat just a volley of shot whizzed over head up now row like fiend cried men when have passed give pistol said ludar have at least one arm so tore through water letting fly at a best must while stood reloading ludar aim missed for have only left hand mine be more lucky since knocked over villain laker just a raised gun for second shot saved for gave time to pull further beyond reach so that when next volley came pattered harmlessly in wave around time must not duck head for boat be already in hurly burly of surf needed skill strength to get over angry bar more than once be glad to fall back right side uppermost more than once looked to see timber have fly asunder at last between two lesser wave slipped over taking in boat of water a did so winning clear of peril leaving pursuer who have waited to see perish to turn back sullenly to report ill success to master 't be far cry to bonandonnye lay behind eastern headland four league beyond benmore durst approach shortest way because men have heard that coast be closely guarded by english who made short work of suspected craft so be fain to hoist sail stand out to sea rounding raughlin on far side running back on cantire there for week more ludar lay in fever shouting to be taken to father yet too weak to turn in bed tenderly clansman nursed for matter of for have wound too until at least be in better trim meanwhile one of men have rowed across to mainland come back with news that sorley boy be deep in wood of glenshesk behind great mountain of knocklayd where be rapidly bringing force to head for swoop on dunluce news decided ludar to tarry not day longer very night a sun set embarked on boat be time of autumn gale hard enough be put to to get safely across for very reason perhaps be able to land unobserved by careless watchman on coast who never dreamed to look for boat on night have known more of mcdonnell oarsman must have doubled guard instead of going asleep be glad to find that ludar having resolved on journey have strength enough to go through with indeed step grew firmer pace took although brow remained black must think have felled to ground have mentioned maiden name in ear yet on other matter spirit revived 't be difficult journey from little bay where landed to glenshesk dare make in broad daylight took care to clad ourselves like herdsman yet even so must have be risk to accost stranger enter hut for shelter for o'neill english among have overawed peasant although be commonly believed turlogh must hold aloof in quarrel yet have own grudge against mcdonnells be not lightly to be run against so lay hid day in thick heather at night crossed rapidly at back of benmore plunged into wood on slope of dome like knocklayd ludar seemed to know way by instinct mcdonnell have told where must meet with friendly clansman who must take to chief have warned what path specially to avoid in crossing mountain instruction served well at daybreak came upon friendly hut just where have expected little below summit on seaward side of hill man must by mean let lie in hut for fear of being seen showed deep cave in hill side where score of men beside have be needful might hide a lay there waiting for night ludar for first time referred to what have befallen at castleroe humphrey said be torn in two how can go out to take castle while lie in wolf clutch yonder yet how may loyal man pursue private quarrel while brave father demand service for clan in great enterprise maybe said in doing latter will achieve end for assuredly so soon a alarm be raised for safety of dunluce merriman trooper have must come thither so maiden will be left free of besides said if what old nurse say be true lady cantire be not woman lightly to abandon right in maiden be more likely to hold a bait to trap captain into benefit to herself to end will at least keep safe out of clutch for while ludar groaned humphrey said be glib comforter tell added from height must surely be able to see castleroe yes said remember seeing round hill a stood parleying with sentinel ludar said more sat at mouth of cave looking westward till sunset then new resolve seemed to have taken hold of led to cairn on mountain top where be piled great heap of wood briar ready for beacon fire when will be asked guide when sorley boy be ready 't be last signal agreed upon when knocklayd be fired friend foe country round will march then said ludar pile up more fuel fetch torch man stared at in amazement do hear thundered be mcdonnell be then when man scared terrified went off to obey ludar said to can not help humphrey signal must go out to night will be too late something tell be looking way even now praying for deliverance something tell too that day more delay dunluce be lost to for ever will bring to head for better worse father said if be not ready sorley boy mcdonnell be always ready said ludar proudly so stood silent waited till shepherd brought torch can see dunluce from here asked presently took arm pointed to where away in west gleam of moonlight struck sea there said then a strained eye there arose a seemed from very spot strange wild sound like rise fall of wailing music moaned in air died away what be asked hush said listen came again rising almost to shriek sinking again into sigh once more looked at ludar once more with pale face motioned to hold peace listen third time sound came like snatch of mad song ending in sob after must almost feel silence stood rooted to spot until presently footstep of herdsman broke spell then ludar said be banshee mean that in business mcdonnell of will fall heaven help then scornfully throwing off fear for moment have seemed to overtake resolutely snatched torch from man hand plunged into pile stood watched fire a first crackled amidst under layer of twig dry heather then caught branch above finally shot up in grand tall column of flame skyward showering high spark casting fierce glow far wide over land sea 't be strange wondrous sight yet a looked midnight fire be not so strange a sight of ludar standing there noble huge motionless illumined by strong light gazing out with shaded eye into far distance to seemed like scene in weird play of forgot be actor a soon a flame bursting forth with great roar reddened sky overhead ludar drew to little distance pointed seaward then perceived suddenly on right twinkle of light presently increased to lurid flame at same instant on left appeared like fire in turn be taken up one by one from headland to headland till whole coast from cushindun to ramore be ablaze even on far distant donegal headland there glimmered responsive signal wondrous sight indeed with atlantic almost at foot reflecting angrily back glare of fire traversed by path of light seeming le fierce a distance increased until from remotest there travelled tiny streak above sky still more fiercely carried red signal while from rock swooped up great army of sea bird flew cry out to sea thither two comrade still eagerly gazed though scarce five minute have passed since first flame shot aloft impatience of herdsman became extreme muttered angrily through clenched teeth a strained eye into irresponsive darkness altacarry exclaimed at length when presently on point of raughlin light shot up cantire added when later eagerly looked for light on scottish mainland broke aloft mingled glare with of antrim fire then at last ludar relaxed motionless posture taking arm plunged hastily from summit with herdsman before for guide half way down guide halted pointed out two new signal inland one to right other straight before yonder said pointing to right come from o'cahan country beyond bann above castleroe where be english troop that in front show sorley boy be afoot already 't be wily fox added man talking a did in irish tongue among score of light who will say be foregathers know presently dropped into marshland at base of hill lost save red glare in sky above by many cunning path man led between bog through wood over piled up rock till stood on new hill side caught sight again of distant beacon on knocklayd behind be already burning low have done work for a mounted higher dozen new fire inland met view standing for moment to look ear caught distant sound of shouting clattering of horse foot be now guide told looking down into deep vale of glenshesk at head of chieftain lay wild impassable valley looked crowded with forest flanked with rugged mountain must scarcely wonder a looked down at tale man have told of how in time of war country people must drive cattle together with woman child far into depth of glen for safety while went out to meet enemy on seaboard of how tempting to follow booty up one of have caught many time in trap between two fire cut to piece descent into valley be perilous enough even for for greater part of way have to swing down by tree many of threatened to break under weight hurl headlong to bottom when at last reached stony land below be easier walking reached stream in safety here halted impatiently till morning humphrey said ludar by time unless have ventured for alarm have gone out will send merriman out of castleroe bring back turlogh into so far have done well unless sorley boy reach dunluce quickly enemy will be in place before will have done harm why do not come if have fifty men like humphrey need not be sitting thus sit did till sun looked at over hill then ludar must wait no longer summoned to foot stalked up valley have gone about hour when loud tramp shouting ahead together with vision of wild figure on hill on hand told that long expected meeting have come at last next turn of valley brought full in view of mcdonnell host stretched in wild irregular line far up glen men marching four five abreast armed with spear with sword buckler others with bow very few with firearm sang loud wailing song a marched mingled with cry of defiance now then of laughter what moved most be aspect of two men who marched dozen pace in front of elder be giant huge of limb towering above clan like saul in bible among israelite white hair hung wildly on shoulder tossed defiantly with step took may have be seventy year of age yet face be knit a hard a warrior of thirty stepped out a lissom quick a youngest gallowglass yet be a nothing to noble sadness of face blaze of deep blue eye have not known already must have betrayed to anywhere a ludar father younger warrior at side man of thirty five joyous of mien yellow hair glistening in sunlight massive form only le massive than father moving with careless ease be not hard to guess be alexander darling of clan pride of father life seeing in path suddenly halted while musketeer behind levelled piece ludar stepped solemnly forward father be ludar said old man uttered quick exclamation stepped back pace to look at stalwart man whom have seen last young boy ten year ago then with face a solemn a of son laid great hand on lad shoulder said thou art come in good time ludar son be greeting passed betwixt two for immediately march began again old man stalking first alone two brother who have kissed at meeting following arm in arm 't be noble sight three great men old chief first last born son to mind much a loved master sorley boy be grandest of three while be by man must look at one else gesture toss of head swing of arm have force in to seemed wonder man must need army at back to carry anywhere willed halted again presently wheeled round on son why did fire beacon asked of ludar because time have come said ludar to day dunluce be slenderly guarded to morrow will be full of enemy then coloured up with flush a added father demand favour first for ten year be granted lad know what be will take castle then ludar grew radiant a clutched father hand thanked for mighty honour alexander seemed scarcely le happy for young brother sake be thousand armed man said old chief spoke in own tongue to even be growing somewhat familiar by now take three hundred with ludar son turn westward alexander with three hundred more will march to sea northward a go now with rest will strike eastward to bonandonnye to morrow boy if dunluce be not yours alexander will come to take for day after if fail will be there with clansman from isle who be already upon sea here part company lad when meet again one of will not see other two last night heard banshee said alexander said ludar farewell then said sorley boy do ludar choose three hundred begone after alexander do same will take rest piper will come with to draw enemy eastward division be soon made ludar chose clansman who knew best part about dunluce country must have to cross to reach in hour be ready to start farewell said old chief meet at dunluce two day hence dead alive said alexander then order be given to march turned suddenly up westward slope of glen men behind shouting dunluce froach eilan ludar till several party lost sight of one then ludar ordered silence speed so day long tramped over rugged hill across deep valley till near sundown ludar having halted men in deep wooded hollow took forward brought to summit of little green hill here took arm pointed ahead dunluce said chapter fifteen how ludar took dunluce at first saw nothing jagged line of cliff top lower than where stood with sea beyond then perceived that where ludar pointed line broke suddenly disclosed great naked rock standing alone sheer out of water leapt wildly round thundered into cave at base looked further saw narrow bridge across chasm while what have first thought to be rugged pile of rock took form of grim battlement tower rising so straight from edge of rock have thought part of across bridge frowned angry portcullis a place stood looked a if one man must hold against thousand so unapproachable did seem on side bridge on mainland be large courtyard barrack with outer wall moat round of easy place to carry when beyond hung angry castle perched like eagle over sea marvelled not so much that mcdonnells must hope to take a that must ever have lost must understand ludar excitement a stood there gazed at old fortress of father with standard of foreign invader floating above top mast tower said nothing yet must tell by heaving of chest what thought be passing in mind what hatred of usurper what impatience to stand once more on battlement fling open gate to noble father light faded from sky a stood there until turret rock flag melted away into common blackness left only thunder of wave in hollow below to tell where dunluce stood then ludar led quickly back to men found little stir afoot for mcdonnells scout have come in with man of english garrison whom have found foraging for meat while almost at same moment herdsman from ramore be district westward of have come to tell news of enemy ludar heard soldier first be thirty men in yonder hold said for so soon a alarm spread that castleroe town of coleraine be to be attacked fifty of guard three cannon be drawn away thither very morning know for stood sentinel when captain merriman be there demanded ludar in truth said soldier 't be rode over from castleroe took away half men leaving in place parcel of puling woman to mind whom might have kept with better grace at castleroe who be woman asked ludar with heightened colour say fair one be sweetheart of own straight enough lass not of sort must willingly undertake say be kinswoman to o'neill lady whom captain be sent to guard hither to thinking be on own business more than turlogh when fighting be over will see come back for ladybird pray gentles continued man who be of careless sort distressed by mischance permit to return to castle with brace of bird be in fact for same young lady to whom coarse fare hath little to recommend who being sickly need dainty stand fair chance to be shot for truant when get back yet may a well be that a hanged here by worship only difference will be that maiden will get supper in one case miss in other go back said ludar if be liar be rare one if be not be honest fellow can be trusted to report nothing of what have seen here will not said man when see thee on drawbridge will let fly at thee by leave a at enemy of queen will said ludar must scorn if did not hearken take maiden flower pulled poppy flower from grass tell before droop who sent will be in dunluce marry will said soldier laughing thou wilt need to hasten master for poppy fade fast if a expect thou get further than bridge over edge of may trust to look to lady for honour sake so man departed amidst not few murmuring from men who understood not letting enemy go scot free unless be to betray party into hand other fellow one of men of route who served ever party must confirmed what englishman have said respecting movement of enemy sorley boy have for week past let be hinted that when came to strike must be at castle on bann on one hand at knockfergus far to south on other therefore while turlogh luinech o'neill tarried at toome to watch what passed in latter region captain merriman strengthened coleraine fort on bann in order to hold former meanwhile sorley boy having thus made enemy busy elsewhere be coming down a have said betwixt two at dunluce doubt english suspected scheme for withdrew only part of garrison along coast depending on natural strength of dunluce other castle to hold off attack till succour must arrive since old fox never showed front till be ready to spring one knew exactly where to expect sorley boy whereby enemy be forced to remain scattered in little company along coast from larne to bann mouth at rate said man after signal with cantire last night one must expect blow to fall till scottish clansman be landed might be time to morrow ludar bade man remain in company then called two others of chief men aside 't be plain said chance be now never give men time to sup then take forward gun have at in front two said addressing two scot with main body be to carry outwork pounding at enemy gate keep busy to landward humphrey twenty more must try sea front a soon a hear shout from within let drive bolt have place be ours said said that on seaward side place be unassailable be except to mcdonnells did not play on rock for naught when boy only pick out twenty resolute men bring round secretly to first break in cliff eastward will be there 't be easy to find twenty men ready for venture nay hard thing be to take more than twenty for hundred be eager to come sooner be started than main body a agreed leapt from hiding place marched rapidly on dunluce guide took mile eastward of castle where at head of narrow gully led from cliff to shore stood ludar pistol in hand waiting for turned silently a came up motioning to to follow began at once steep descent cleft be so narrow that one man must only lower at time swinging a often a not by elbow hand for be harder work than for active redshank a for ludar stood at bottom while with troop growling at back be stuck midway yet reached bottom in time a did so boom of gun from rock above told that men be already before castle knocking for entrance then waded scrambled in darkness at water edge till came to base of great black rock on fortress stood often be wading waist deep in pool often on hand knee drawing over surf swept ledge ludar seemed to know step of way despite year have passed since a boy hunted there for sea bird be in humour now to slacken speed for who knew not when put out one foot where must land with other above noise of gun be already lost in thunder of wave a echoed in cave under castle rock seemed a stood there looked up that not foot further must go great angry cliff beetled over head on very edge far above might discern against gloomy sky dim corner of buttress be not here that ludar meant to ascend now men said put powder in bonnet follow whereupon took step up to neck in deep water started to swim one by one followed armed clad a be into angry surf 't be perilous voyage have not tide be full high above rock must not have come out of of sound in limb wind once twice a be flung upwards with swirl almost upon jagged cliff thought last hour be come wondered whose eye must be dim at news of end then when with like swirl be heaved back into safety of deep water thought what big venture be who must not follow when ludar led so scarce know how rounded mouth of resounding cave stood panting on narrow ledge on far side say stood yet not of twenty two men who have plunged only nineteen foregathered at far side 't be bravely swum said ludar though have cost mcdonnell three brave son have won dunluce promise will go back by land asked where next pointed up to what seemed rock a sheer threatening a ever have met on other side nay on side castle seemed to hang clean over edge there be path remember said by in old day mcquillans came down to cave went up a boy see here led few step round a if back towards cave where be iron spike driven into smooth rock little above edge of water reached forward at swung out over water till foot rested on narrow ledge beyond scarce width of boot at water edge above be jutting nose of rock by raised on to peg from by long stride on to safer ledge above follow cried look not back painfully clumsily achieved perilous stride found at entrance of crack in rock into wave below dashed thundered then beaten back shot up in angry column high over head descending with whirl that swept headlong from perch up rift watched ludar clamber losing now again in shooting foam now again a spray cleared off seeing safe ever foot higher than before how followed 'twould be hard to say yet rock seemed riven into crack gave tolerable foothold better a got higher up have not be for constant dash of water darkness might have be accounted passable enough a be for ludar strong arm above must have lost foot twice in fall perchance might have carried away one more of who followed when reached top of rift still worse peril awaited for now have to crawl painfully for distance along narrow edge on face of naked rock with little hold for hand since ledge slanted downward be wet slippery with spray still le for foot even ludar must see be at loss to halt now be useless to turn back impossible so gripping a best might at rugged rock stepped boldly on to ledge must follow yet at first step foot slid from under that hand held firm must have be headlong inch by inch hugging cliff with back to sea crawled over that treacherous ledge sometimes slipping to knee sometimes hanging sheer by hand once in moment of weakness looked back to see how men be faring a did so youth next after tall brave youth who have be foremost in peril suddenly staggered slipped for moment hung by hand knee to ledge next with loud groan fell backwards into darkness heard crash of body on rock below in horror own grip for instant relaxed felt following strong hand caught held up ludar said humphrey be fool lookup man be lost after have eye for naught cliff before although before terrible passage be ended heard five more groan a many more crash on rock below managed to keep own footing till at last with head in whirl stood beside ludar on broader straighter ledge within dozen foot of cliff top ludar be pale breath came went hard a made room for beside too have heard terrible crash path said be easier passed by boy than man have known what must cost yet come on now there be indeed time to tarry for men behind be left of came up must perforce move forward to make room now once more heard gun above mighty shouting on far side of castle towards frowned black solitary short distance yet to climb compared with what have passed be easy for steep a be often overhanging sea rock here be rough dry foot held fast just a came to top ludar turned follow close men shout discharge piece if can called once entered make for drawbridge almost a spoke heard shout above report of musket discharged into darkness sentinel have heard voice be greeting next moment saw ludar on top struggling with man be too dark to discern be moment later one of two staggered step backwards to edge there be yell shower of loose earth then a stood below clinging to rock dark mass fell betwixt sky brushing a passed bounding from ledge below with hideous crash out into deepness stood there instant a cold pulse le a stone against leaned what if be ludar who have fallen voice from above restored to life quick there come up place be ours in moment stood beside on narrow edge of grass between castle wall brink must hear shout firing away at gate not soul be left here to bar passage even sentinel shot have passed unheeded there be low window leading to one of office of castle through clambered next moment found standing within wall of dunluce froach eilan shouted ludar drawing dirk waving on men froach eilan ludar shouted of discharging piece to add to uproar while one man exploded swivel gun stood on seaward battlement effect be magical there be sudden pause in fighting at bridge then rose mighty answering cry from mcdonnells outside while garrison caught thus between two fire looked way that not knowing against foe to turn though be thirteen nay only twelve for english sentinel in fall have swept yet of brave fellow from ledge be hard for one to say in darkness how many be how many be yet behind thirty defender to place when once panic have spread be in mood for waiting to see many of laid down arm at once still more terrified attempted to descend rock so perished others plunged boldly into gulf there be end of ludar meanwhile rushed to bridge many brave fellow to night have met fate on narrow way for so far assault from men without have be able to shake strong portcullis make opening on grim face of fortress indeed seemed to single child in place might have defied army so unassailable did appear men have carried easily outer courtyard across moat driving slender garrison back with only time to lower gate shut within before assault began though thundered with shot rock be of avail gun of besieged swept narrow bridge on side scarce man who ventured across returned alive now be suddenly changed ludar with wild shout fell on keeper of gate within drove from post so sudden be onslaught that none have time to ask whence came how many followed only handful of soldier withstood among be gay english fellow whom have let go hour so back who now true to word rushed sword in hand at ludar wondered to see what ludar must do for kill fellow knew must not met englishman sword with tremendous blow from own sheathed weapon shivered then with fist felled to ground thus stunned lifted laid high on parapet of wall till must come to ere be done rest of men be at hand to hand with few fighting men of garrison remained did not take long for there be dozen of valiantly a fought be too many strong for one by one fell yielded except one stout man constable of place peter gary by name who fought a long a must stand then before eye flung first sword then headlong from cliff ended matter next moment english flag ala must say tumbled from battlement with shout of ludar froach eilan portcullis swung open dunluce belonged once more to mcdonnells leaving to guard tower where most of enemy have shut ludar stalked off to remote corner of castle whence in short time returned called humphrey said maiden be safe thank god go to see what old nurse may need have other work to do friend added be dream be indeed castle of father when sorley boy come will be who will

even so while spoke must see on cliff eastward mcdonnell standard hear shout of alexander company a bore down upon english who for moment ceased assault on castle turned doubtfully to face ludar laughed if alexander be there said mind may be easy call in men keep within wall for who yielded glory of taking dunluce will not be robbed by of glory of sending knave packing need not two mcdonnells

be a said taken aback by new danger threatened to draw off when saw party retire into castle understood that battle be between alexander only stood ground again wheeled round to meet be five hundred men against mcdonnells three hundred contained not few of o'neill men in number from where stood must see little of fight except within few yard of enemy alexander halted men then stepping forward

have lain once before about midnight must hear grinding of anchor chain at bow be music to ear a be heavy trampling on deck shouting dabbling of water at port amidst too fell asleep when woke stood next day on deck must see on right sullen fort on medway behind long low green line of essex mud bank ludar be there before pacing restlessly with troubled brow joy of freedom have vanished before sad memory crowded ship humphrey said presently when where be to end how doe bring nearer to heart desire indeed said with sigh 't be long way round yet patience farther east nearer west looked at a much a to say knew be not such fool a word showed after rochelle said what then time enough when be there said time enough indeed chapter twenty four how invincible armada came into british water have scarce got head round south foreland when there met gale of wind such a boded ill enough for quick voyage to rochelle june a be be a cold a march along with rain came sleet hail tempted to wonder if winter be not suddenly come instead of summer feared good man petrie captain must run for shelter into dover english port where who know ludar might be seen taken instead of that stood out stoutly for french coast after week battle with wave put in battered leaking at dieppe there waited two week mending crack hoping for change of weather gale roared on defying to get nose out of port sending in on wreck castaway promised hot welcome from open channel after about two week wind slackened shifted point from seaward so although wave still ran high put out with short sail laboured towards cherbourg storm suited ludar humour while of whistled for fair weather spirit rose a turned face to windward watched good ship stagger through wave of own accord volunteered to help among seaman ordered to do same captain be very glad of aid for be crew must do to keep misericorde taut straight in course when came off cherbourg resolved to lose more time by putting in finding timber sound canvas well in wind stood out for ushant master petrie repented day out that have be so hardy for nearer struggled to open ocean greater grew sea presently broke across bow with force made timber creak laid over almost on beam end be soon more than must do to carry reefed foresail day long of be hard at work at pump how long laboured thus can hardly say must have be three week more before breasted ushant by time water be gaining on in hold victual have fallen short whether liked not must try to make brest heaven must need to work miracle on behalf if be to do captain brave man a be lost courage when found water coming higher in hold saw misericorde labour harder with new wave ship more water time than last a for men gave up labour at pump in despair took to what liquor must find to drown terror ludar alone never lost heart head took charge of deserted helm bade seaman cut away spar throw over cargo obeyed a must captain plucked up little spirit at sight of courage humphrey said on night when although gale be slackening fast be plain even to end of voyage be near master will need to wait for type come stand by here for there be nothing else to be done for brave ship now must have liked to save for sake of one who once stood at very helm seems to be near last plunge perhaps said god have not done with yet who pray for pray not in vain here misericorde reeled upwards on huge wave for moment hung quivering on top then plunged into trough felt ludar hand on arm caught sight of face steady stern with flash in eye a looked ahead be right be misericorde last plunge for instead of righting seemed entangled in water like one who writhes to get free heeled half over on side then before must recover up came next wave towering high over head fell like mountain upon next thing be aware of be be clinging to spar in water with strong arm around voice in ear hold on hold on then when opened eye saw ludar floating timber nothing more towards one of timber be striking out desperately proved to be small boat bottom uppermost have lain on deck having be wrenched from cord have floated free of wreck between reached with much labour turned over have oar sail yet a clung to must see be sound of bottom must at least hold two of how got in know not yet think between two wave ludar steadied while got in then between next two hauled in at first seemed in cockleshell be little better off than clinging to spar for wave threatened to swamp yet by god mercy carried somehow not sign must see of of late shipmate only once body clutching at board even in death crossed when reached out hauled to be one of sailor not drowned with skull broken presently a said wave grew le drifted knew not whither save that be far from where have gone down with land sun in view nothing howling waste of wave two at mercy ludar looked at one grimly be time for talking wondering what next for nearly two day have not tasted food moistened lip here be perhaps week month from land in bare boat on hungry sea might not a well have gone down with misericorde daylight went presently be too dark even to see comrade across little boat last saw of have closed eye seemed to be composing for sleep guessed be sleep not of weariness of hunger night went on presently must hear mutter in sleep fancied still in tower with warder whom charged with message to maiden sometimes be in presence of scotch queen sometimes in dunluce with father be fevered jumble of talk made night seem weird horrible to full of dread for day be to come when dawned did early sea be tumbling wearily shrouded in thick mist chilled where sat blotted out everything beyond little space around boat ludar by time be awake still wandering in mind with hunger fever while after sleepless night felt eyelid grow heavy how long slept know not know dreamt be at foot of great rock of dunluce looking up must just spy light on battlement hear gun shout of battle on top when suddenly woke found be more than dream high above head in mist there loomed light from beyond there sounded tolling of bell a thought clash of arm looked across at ludar saw too looking up too weak to speak move then light seemed to plunge downwards towards showing huge black outline of ship within few yard of where drifted instantly sprang to foot shouted called to ludar to do same for moment seemed be unheeded light swung once more upwards after great ship carrying swirl of water with throwing off whirlpool of little eddy in boat spun shook like leaf in torrent again shouted frantically then seemed bell ceased tolling instead there came call after something sharp struck on cheek flinging up hand caught cord felt boat keel grind sharply against side of great ship what next remember be standing bewildered on deck amidst crowd of soldier many of whom wore bright steel armour who exercised on heaving plank well nigh a steadily a on dry ground deck be ablaze with pennon scutcheon somewhere near noise of trumpet rose above roar of wave sun a struggled through mist flashed on brass of gun jewel of sword hilt poop behind rose like stately house illumined with swinging lanthorns now again there flitted past long robed priest to whom bowed after boy with swaying censer there be neighing of horse amidships tolling of bell in forecastle great bellying sail glittered with painted dragon eagle sun burst men who lined crosstrees crowded top shouted answered in tongue be new to above higher than helmsman house standard on poop shone out gilded cross looked over ship little wonder if a slowly looked round rubbed eye knew not where be ludar standing near steadying with cordage called to myself must be spaniard said faintly spaniard gasped enemy to queen look yonder said stopping pointing seaward where mist be lifting apace there must discern a far a eye must reach great curved line of vessel many of like that on stood larger grander smaller propelled by oar with flag flying signal waving course pointed one way not even landsman a be must mistake what saw must be naught else great fleet of spanish king of whose coming have heard rumour for year past in for one have not really believed till thus suddenly found standing on deck of one of greatest galleon in horror of discovery first impulse be to fling back into wave from have be saved second be to seize sword fly at first man saw so die for country then there ala be too weak to do when took step be to fall in heap on deck faint with hunger wrath shame when came to lay in dark cabin ludar scarcely le pallid than sat beside come on deck said place be stifling if don mean to make end of may a well do at once so bracing up to lend arm made for deck sentinel stood at gangway whom ludar brushing past bade in round english give food lead to captain man stared in surprise muttered something in spanish a luck must have ludar mindful of smattering of spanish learned at oxford understood to mean be to remain below whereupon pulled forward defied fellow to put back might possibly have be run through then there have not soldier who have overheard parley come up be english said in own tongue comrade be english be irish said ludar unless have food forthwith be not even that be irishman said soldier who by trapping be officer therefore come have food know felt then hard put to whether despite famine must eat food in place from such hand persuaded if be to die so soon might a well meet death with full stomach a empty while ate irishman questioned ludar a to name part of ireland lived in be son of southern chief one desmond after living year in spain be now attached to enemy force be close enough a to movement of fleet so soon a have seen fed bade come with to don deck be a crowded a fleet street a passed to poop very few of gay spaniard took trouble to look after wonder how came there only when ludar a reached commander door suddenly took sword flung out to sea did few of stare followed comrade example sea have a

honour of restoring to london shortly said meanwhile sir ludar will not be deprived of service of squire then turning to officer occupied again with chart left captain desmond to conduct from cabin ludar be much elated by interview relieved at least of immediate prospect of execution unless don be jesting consigned to very intolerable service on board ship from captain desmond who be not little impressed by commander reception of ludar learned rather more of expedition prospect than before if go well said will be in english water to morrow week later must have dealt with enemy fleet be landed at dover don alonzo be said will be appointed governor of london till king arrive be prime favourite at spanish court in proof whereof rata carry crew of noblest youth of spain committed to

over if choose while last to keep forecastle deck clean none will interfere with perchance when get into action may find honourable even perilous post so be installed in ignoble office on board rata since captain desmond duty never brought before foremast since don alonzo whenever went round never looked at since not man on forecastle comprehended word of english must speak spanish ludar be able to follow be left pretty much to ourselves except that sentry kept close eye on movement day long soldier paraded trumpet played pennon waved blazoned sail swelled with favouring breeze so towards afternoon ushant be far behind eye be strained forward for first glimpse of english shore other vessel of fleet have spread out somewhat in mist now gradually closed in at nearer distance passed signal must not understand be so near must hear trumpet bell see glitter of sun on muzzle of gun then about sundown with great ceremony priest came forward recited what took to be mass after at sound of three bell whole company trooped to middle deck where at main mast purser read aloud long proclamation in spanish at end of huzzahs be given for king lanthorns lit for night confess turned in to berth night uneasy in mind for never saw ship such a not even in medway what must small craft do against floating tower what sort of hole must gun make in four foot wall when came to grappling what must slender crew do against army of picked men who even if half of fell must yet be match for force english ship must hold so turned in with many foreboding night long must hear laugh song of coming victory mingled now again with fanfare of trumpet distant boom of admiral signal gun next morning when looked out there be land in sight ahead chapter twenty five how don sailed up channel for long while must discern only blue haze on horizon then towards noon when sun stood higher wind behind freshened there appeared grey line through mist above that gleam of green sight be hailed by gay young spaniard who crowded deck with mighty shout defiant blare of trumpet ere noise died away caught faint answering echo from vessel nearest then acting on arranged signal whole fleet seemed to gather together closing into great crescent at about cable distance advanced with sail full of wind majestic sight to who gazed with dismay from end to end of magnificent line fraught with doom to poor country rata held post near to left of line be thus league thereabouts nearer to coast than ship of other flank already out of mist black headland be rising grim frowning to front already betwixt keen eye might detect gleam of afternoon sun on little white sail here there except for fishing boat two cruised along line taking good eyeful of then darting ahead before gallia must give chase saw sign of queen ship anywhere towards dusk opened great break in coast knew presently to be plymouth sound don a stood fully armed on deck gangway laughed at sight eye turned to duke admiral vessel ahead to see if must sail straight in on unprotected sound so take possession of coveted land before supper night looked at first a if be purpose when suddenly there be stir among onlooker ludar taking arm pointed down coast to rear where from behind high headland peeped out small cluster of sail there be ship said lying in wait with wind of don too heart leapt up at word for till now have supposed poor fellow cooped up by wind in plymouth water unable to get out waiting like sheep for slaughter be tempted to cheer in spaniard face when saw thus clear on right side of wind ready to show fight for queen country sail be seen by other eye than ours presently up flung light from duke ship with hove to dropped anchor where lay for night great be discontent of grandee on rata to be thus put about by sight of parcel of herring boat a chose to call came a little comfort to when message went round for men to be under arm ready for battle at daybreak with proud laugh went off to quarter for night a for ludar sat on forecastle with eye straining westward full of strange excitement humphrey said ludar if be comfort to like not don thank god to hear said if come to fight said have a soon see pirate yonder sweep sea a milord did little enough for queen while lived can not bring back now be dead think will come to blow in morning asked anxious to hurry off sore subject 't be said so replied must not surprise if yonder sea dog did not wait till then after that sat watched beacon fire ashore blaze up one after spread news of coming far wide presently too moon came up by light looking westward must discern sail to windward fluttered nearer nearer till seemed shot from one of piece must reach news brought many of rata men on deck of whom doubted what to make of others cursed impudence of english drake low born salt at daybreak when looked out there hovered threescore more english craft drawn up in irregular line from south to north looking at foremost sailed great flagship called ark raleigh so near must plainly discern royal cross of saint george at poop compared with mighty rata be small craft yet beside light low ship followed towered aloft like castle looked only ship of fleet must stand quarter of hour of ordnance while looked there came dull boom from spaniard who lay nearest must see shot pitched high plough up water twenty yard short then a thought rather foolishly sat glaring across at one in still air waiting for breeze came at last freshly from westward must see english catch come along with before ever filled out great sail nay when did reach there be not enough to give way marvelled to see how like log rata lay while lively englishman slipped through water then followed strangest beginning to great sea fight for ark one two others having run in towards end of line lay a near a possible west east looking into plymouth suddenly put into wind ran jauntily down rear putting broadside into of don a went by included be that when reached end of line everyone looked to see sheer off out of reach gaily wore round came back way have gone giving spaniard other broadside on road consort behind following suit think never saw men so taken aback a be spaniard by performance for rata rest of lay almost helpless in light wind while light timbered englishman darted hither thither at pleasure almost a fast in eye of wind a down surprise at first be so great that ark be half way down line before attempt be made to close with stop waited on man even when one great galleon with mighty effort swung round to face swerved not fathom out of course let off two broadside instead of one to help presuming don back again into post loud bitter be wrath among noble youth on rata a saw invincible armada of spain thus flouted by handful of englishman bitterer still be rage of sailor when by manner of luffing trimming of sail must stand out to chastise impudent cruiser when after a have said careering down line english admiral put about came back wind freshened lent little life to great hull one two got round far enough to let fly with culverin great piece shot if reached englishman at whizzed over head never stopped course don alonzo however having rather better wind than unlucky comrade decided on bolder stroke to punish enemy ludar a stood watched must see troop paraded on deck grappling iron chain laid in readiness small arm be loaded man stood with naked knife in belt mean to come to close quarter board said ludar laughed sportsman blood be up for first time for many day care have vanished from face left there glow of sheer enjoyment cow might a well try to board cat said be right for a ark bore down way blazing out at galleon passed don alonzo dropping clear of line put nose in course so to say bade stand answer then for first time day ark swerved on tack put out nose too so that presently two lay well astern of line closing in on one course then there be great joy on board rata noble youth shook lovelocks gripped sword gunner lay with eye on captain waiting signal to fire men on top in rigging got ready grappling tackle held cutlass betwixt teeth ready for spring ludar on forecastle watched ark a half in wind bore down way deck like ours be cleared for action above gunwale must spy many bare head peeping over at marvelled that have not long since given shot like spaniard seemed bent on close quarter be saving up for hand to hand fight so at least who watched thought when suddenly scarce cable length away put about full in wind letting fly at with shot in broadside slipped gaily under helm on way to regain course have left finish career down line of don don alonzo be so taken by surprise unready for sudden move that have not word to say broadside when went off fell wide of mark in open sea at very moment when english shot rang about stern riddling sail knocking gilded cross in shiver by board did give shot only for cloud of cloth yard arrow whistled through rigging picking off dozen so of men perched there grazing polished breastplate of not few of bewildered grandee on quarter deck never will forget howl of spanish curse greeted misadventure grandee swore at sailor bade put about give chase sailor swore at grandee bade come try to turn ship quicker than if knew how gunner blamed captain for holding back captain blamed men crew alike for behaving like spoiled child forgetting honour dignity a for ludar be so tickled by whole business that laughed outright have much ado to sober in presence of angry foreigner presently message came for hand to go aft look to damage done to stern partly from curiosity partly from duty went with 't be sad to see how stately poop be battered about window be knocked in flag tumbled gun unmounted a said great cross shot in piece while around lay body of men dead wounded think troubled don almost a much a better sailing of english be to find that thick wooden wall of theirs be proof against enemy shot crashed through stout timber sometimes letting daylight in here there leaving plenty of work to do to make good against inroad of water by time rata have put back into line ark consort have ended merry jaunt by tumbling over mizzen mast of vice admiral ship other english ship having by time come up showing teeth duke sent up signal to give plymouth go by sail up channel be done in very chapfallen manner great armada huddled together standing not on order of going turned head into wind struggled eastward rata being near rear of procession englishman hung doggedly on heel now then coming up within shot then having let off broadside dropping away before must put round to engage never once did come to close quarter much a spaniard longed for never once did give time to try conclusion on equal term rest of day ludar be so busy at carpenter work abaft that have clear view of what passed heard dropping shot now then now again bolt thundered on to own hull buried deep in timber while once terrible blaze ahead followed by rumbling set rata shivering in plank told of disaster explosion somewhere near among spaniard what meant must only guess for night came on roughly a darkness closed be helmsman must do with sharp look out to give fellow ship wide berth without going out of course to look after a soon a ever be dark ludar dozen others be ordered over stern in basket to patch up hole made by english shot repair insulted gilding of majesty of spain light work be suspended betwixt wind water groping with lanthorns at work rearing plunging with wave now then hearing boom of gun behind made wince wonder whose head be wanted next once thought be mine for great crashing shot came past out of darkness spinning basket round like top lodging fair in hole be mending scarce have time to thank god for escape when man next uttered cry flung up arm there hung moment pinned to stern by cloth yard arrow pierced back before tumbled over dead man into sea one after of comrade dropped till at last seemed to ludar alone be left humphrey said when at last stood on deck reckon be almost quits with king of spain by now ay indeed said think further that who dream of far away need not despair for assuredly heaven want something more of before go under else have not be standing here whatever heaven wanted of ship master angrily ordered off to forecastle to look to tackle of bowsprit for plunging of vessel be safe work compared with labour on poop for here be clear of enemy shot ludar be clumsy with tackle not being seaman born on account trouble arose for fellow who overlooked work chose not only to swear at by saint in spaniard calendar to be welcome pulled out whip from under coat gave ludar crack with laid open cheek bone well nigh sent backwards by board whereupon ludar seizing whip with one hand fellow with other gave lashing a wretch may be wished must give to man when have done that threw whip overboard fellow howl yell for have great voice soon brought parcel of mate around who seeing wallowing on ground pointing at ludar asked question set on with oath spanish cry of english cur so too have pretty time of that got back against bulk head have splicing tackle in hand might have seen more of great sea battle fought for life for five minute so then so great became uproar up came of soldier officer who seeing two men set upon by twenty ordered man to stand officer a fortune must have be old acquaintance captain desmond who demanded what noise be about whereupon fellow whom ludar have flogged hobbled up in white heat proclaimed wrong to heaven earth accusing of being on rata for treasonable purpose vowing even have heard plot to get at powder blow up ship before must say word up came messenger from don who on hearing story ordered to accompany forthwith to excellency must not help observing a marched abaft gloom seemed to have fallen on ship not that gay young lordlings did not still swagger laugh seemed to mirth be more hollow than have be when now again sullen shot out of darkness behind whizzed through rigging rattled on hull ground teeth angrily swore in grand spanish style at fate kept beyond arm length of foe don alonzo stood on quarter deck gazing earnestly in direction of admiral lanthorns between while discussing grave matter with lieutenant stood long time before have leisure to attend to then beckoned to officer to bring forward when saw who be knitted brow demanded to know cause of uproar in forecastle whereupon ludar face still streaming with blood saluted said master don yonder be one of lad pointing to smarting spaniard who have mistaken guest of majesty king for one of own galley slave struck have chastised a deserves thrown whip overboard if be crime in country pray hang at once for will not promise not to do same thing again to morrow if touch a for comrade here have done naught help defend from score of brave fellow who thought not unworthy of honour to set on two so offended broke in rather foolishly be fault of being englishman not spaniard sir don then fellow whom ludar have flogged suddenly found word broke out in torrent of rage with accusation grew a went on bade fair have have breath to make end of to picture a very fiend 't be fine sight by glare of swinging lanthorns to see don alonzo stand there calm grave with admirable curl of lip deepening a fellow raved out when story be done turned shortly on said something in spanish sent wretch slinking off with tail between leg pitiful object to behold for scowl of hate bestowed on ludar in passing a for senor printer said don alonzo turning contemptuously to will not make believe englishman be boor commend top of main mast to senor a spot of spanish territory where may learn better manner sir ludar turned to ludar before must say word bearing changing to of gentleman who speaks to gentleman desire letter of import to reach duke admiral by honourable hand will take cock boat deliver sudden compliment for be nothing short staggered ludar for moment looked quickly up to see if don be not trifling with don alonzo be grave serious so ludar said shortly will interview ended went sorely against stomach then to have to mount to perch in main top felt little hurt that ludar have put in never word on behalf remember reflecting a slowly scrambled to penance how strange be that for so small difference of demeanour must be sent aloft while ludar be appointed to task of honour understood not spaniard thank heaven did know much about gentleman at foot of mast ludar came up be sorry for humphrey said yet be like to get better view of fight than most will see soon again if wave be kind to englishman shot fall wide think not mean to escape get clear said must be with humphrey be ever fool said gravely expect back soon if come not 'twill not be fault yours get aloft comrade keep good look out so went up very sadly presently from high perch heard running of cord splash of oar saw on pale water below black shadow glide out from ship side lose in darkness chapter twenty six how ludar brought back duke letter may have be near midnight on sunday night when went aloft to main top sea be still running high be must do in drizzling rain wild wind to hold on to perch now then wild gull terrified by invasion of peace whirled past shrieked away seaward once with swish dull boom behind shot passed below once twice quiver up tall mast told rata gun be at work must detect nothing in darkness save twinkling of many dim light ahead glare of ship lanthorns on deck below amid howling of squall heard thunder of battle somewhere near with now then loud shout rattling of chain knew that king philip of spain have not yet muzzled english sea dog so night passed when morning dawned cold grey be stupid with sleep hunger loneliness storm have died away water lay sullen still while sail below flapped heavily in wind rata have dropped to rear of armada spread eastward in long irregular line very different from grand curve with have swept on plymouth behind three mile away cruised englishman looking at while betwixt far distant portland headland must see vast hull of one of own galleon same have blown up in night surrounded by swarm of little craft that picked bone like crow on carcase nearer still lay great disabled spaniard with bowsprit top mast gone flag struck being towed by capturer into port a for rata 't be sad to see how dingy gay gilding have become in one day how sail be riddled tackle flying scutcheon toppled over yet have passing glance for where be ludar be returned be in englishman hand be little cock boat perchance floating somewhere bottom uppermost beneath scanned water till eye ached far ahead mile away fancied must see towering among other galleon duke royal standard amidst huddled ship water littered with many spar little boat with galley gliding here there signal going with movings in out way that who be to find solitary man in cock boat yet think love have keener eye than most so looking again towards where few stout english craft returning to line after cruise up channel cracked out broadside on nearest spaniard within reach seemed to see between something in water made look twice may have be mile away speck on water like floating barrel spar yet for stillness of water moved a thought more than idle log once a sun flashed out for moment along surface thought to be head shoulder presently lost for glare of rising sun blotted out like speck on shining mirror began to think be fancy even if be swimmer must never be ludar who must come from other quarter where duke ship be when once again saw figure time near enough to know be assuredly man who between few stroke took waved hand above head be down mast in twinkling caring nought if be to swing at yard arm within hour ran wildly to quarter deck sir don shouted breaking in upon lieutenant by leave yonder come sir ludar swimming for life don rounded on with knitted brow cared not put out boat to save be lost cried have night aloft sirrah taught better manner said go back here looking over towards swimmer saw throw up arm heard shout set vein in tingling waited not for don ship anyone beside flung headlong over tall side into sea struck out with might for place spanish sentinel on deck seeing sudden plunge smelling treachery desertion in let fly at with musket grazing elbow sending ducking dozen yard more before durst show head again above water have somewhat better to think of than spanish bullet for few minute must see nothing of swimmer be beginning to fear be too late after when suddenly wave brought close beside sure enough be ludar well nigh spent keeping up with short breathless stroke unable to do more be alive enough to know to lay hand on arm for support hard pressed a be held betwixt teeth paper guessed to be duke despatch to give better use for mouth took from stuck in own collar after that revived together paddled towards rata lay with sail flapping almost motionless in rapidly calming sea spaniard on board seemed to have changed mind a to myself for instead of sentinel with gun sailor with rope stood waiting at gunwale to receive think have gone down where be must hardly have troubled to come after since held up drifted within reach of line honoured by casting way so with hauling got aboard ludar have partly recovered from fatigue when stepped once more on deck took letter from neck have done good turn said with glow in face prized a much a gold piece in hold of rata have made possible for to keep parole with don thank humphrey then bidding follow led way to quarter deck without word handed missive to don senor have returned by strange way said commander have returned only way open to majesty king have lost cock boat have found what will compensate gallant servant pardon said ludar shortly be servant of king of spain be debtor a be friend be quits up to now what more accept from will be bound to repay more don frowned then smiled then with quiet gesture raised hand to helmet accepting salute a dismissal ludar took arm walked away more be said about just then think after what passed don however much disliked deemed not worth while to separate from comrade ludar told what never told don that have be captured a returned in cock boat by boat of enemy belonging to ship revenge men of boat perceiving to be of speech suspecting carried news though have hidden letter in shoe resolved to carry to captain drake to seemed to submit waiting till came somewhere near where suspected rata to lie have slipped overboard hanging quietly under stern sheet till be tired of looking for have got off after beating about hour more have sighted in dawn a confessed for sight of might not have be there to tell story well after for two day weather remained calm a said spaniard though now again have better of breeze must do little with enemy hung doggedly on skirt sometimes coming near enough for broadside never a impatient gallant on rata prayed might do running in to close quarter be pitiful to hear grinding of noble teeth on board ship a day by day english admiral plucked majesty feather one by one yet never gave chance of battle even don alonzo grave mild countenance grew heavy a for sailor forward where be friend of whip have busy time with to keep from breaking into open mutiny so there be much comfort round when on thursday wind got up gave chance at last of serious business for when looked out at daybreak there scarce two gun shot off cruised handful of english craft gaily hauling after two great spaniard so heard be full of store for fleet rata have kept eye on for many day how in night have got separate from main line so fallen into hand of sleepless englishman know not know that when daylight discovered being towed at tail of captor towards english port cry of rage fury went up from rata hand be called gun be manned arm be served out although by so doing left armada without rear guard don luffed out into wind gave chase then followed merry sport for sooner be back turned than main body of english who wished nothing better slipped into place blazed away at spanish line right left till whole sea be white with smoke might fancy thunder of gun must be heard in fleet street a for have better have stayed where be for while fight went merrily on ahead pretty wild goose chase be led for never got near enough for so much a broadside store ship lay between english who cunningly used a shield so that from whichever quarter approached there be don own vessel betwixt besides that must see boat busily taking over chief of treasure under very eye while hour stayed dropped further further astern of main armada so have pleased englishman to spare ship two to look after verily believe might have be cut off for good towed into english port like same ill starred store ship professed to be rescuing two gallia joined in errand made gallant attempt by parting company coming suddenly upon enemy one from quarter to compel action englishman be ready for keeping store ship a shield on one side have royal salute ready for galley on other so smartly dealt with such deadly aim that wretched slave at oar tumbled off bench rolled over like so many ninepin before others must take place second broadside third swept craft from stem to stem spaniard shot flew high harmless for broadside let go english gave back two three thus that morning well into afternoon rata hung miserably in wind watching sport englishman made of king of spain galleon never once able to get within speaking distance at length amid many bitter curse many angry taunt don gave order to put about leaving store ship to fate rejoin fleet where at rate now that seemed general fight have at last come about there be certain consolation in store for fluttered grandee ala must live to pity majesty enemy did so that afternoon for when came upon scene battle be well nigh at end duke admiral ship sorely battered in bow be hanging out signal to fleet to draw off sea be strewn with helpless galleon amidst active english craft slipped in out giving broadside here shot there flight of arrow there yet never getting within grappling distance offering don chance of boarding not single one of ship must see in distress while many spanish top mast bowsprit draggled shamefully many spanish corpse must mark being slipped overboard don alonzo wrathful baffled affected not to see admiral signal made one brave attempt to close with ship nearest so retrieve honour of day got more than gave for englishman suddenly slipped to wind of despite effort lying snugly on flank a yawed over with breeze pounded merrily betwixt wind water while own shot aimed at sky flew yard above english topsail young noble shouted in vain to enemy to come alongside if dare try conclusion englishman laughed back out of port in broadside bid catch if must meanwhile to pas time slid round by stern new blacked gilding there even hovered few minute to leeward to pick off score so of crew on deck with arrow before running back to quarter on other port how long went on know not for cry suddenly came of hand below down went to patch up with might hole english shot have made on water line here worked night amongst swearing savage gang who threatened aloud to blow up ship rather than fight more wished safe back in drinking shop of lisbon when about midnight half stifled with heat came on deck rata be running before wind at rear of armada heading for french coast lanthorns of english have dropped league behind never saw company so changed a be gallant of spain by day fight still cursed laughed shouted when shook fist be at light ahead when dropped silent downcast face be turned to light astern humphrey said ludar to a stood moment looking round before turned to go to quarter like not business why said spaniard be being beaten know english sea dog be too many for ay said with curl of lip english be brave enough when there be helpless woman head to be taken be because don be pack of cur like business le le content well enough to see shuffled routed said yes how be to end little more instead of sailing up channel will be sailing down instead of finding in london may arrive in lisbon what then have never occurred to have calculated so surely on finding back in england have forgotten be prisoner on rata must even go wherever took how can get away asked if swim to english will mistake for spy spaniard be too far from shore in day two said ludar unless english stop must be near french coast wait till then perchance master have better chance for type after than think for plan of escape be fated to be thwarted then there even a laid for a passed black corner turning below towards bunk there came sudden gleam spanish curse out of darkness ludar next moment with blood rushing from side staggered forward fell to ground in instant before villain must slink away have by neck needed cudgelling of brain to guess who might be for once again day while worked have marked fellow evil eye on ludar ludar have laughed when have told of have not deigned so much a to turn head to see if spoke true in bustle have followed too have forgot enemy of whip have not forgotten although caught in dark be too quick for have blade still though struck wildly only scratched arm blow loosed grip for moment in moment dashed past up ladder followed madly a reached deck saw before running forward casting glance behind to see if followed then tripping on rope lost foot sprawled forward a supposed easy prey heaven have taken punishment out of hand for at very spot where fell gunwale of ship stood open at place where refuse of late battle be being let out from deck into water here before hand must be stirred cry raised wretch plunged shrieking to fate deserved there be end of when returned below found ludar gasping wound bad a be be not so bad a villain intended blade have aimed at heart have turned aside on rib leaving indeed hideous flesh wound in side not threatening life be faint with loss of blood think with pain when spoke to turned white face to said nothing therefore in little panic lifted gently to bunk went in search of help by good fortune met captain desmond to whom told fellow irishman plight presently came forward with leech learned grandee seeing wound not to be desperate having plenty of business suppose elsewhere among sea sick lordlings bade bandage up wound a best must find better place to lay sufferer in than foul hole saying dawdled away then captain desmond questioned a to how happened when told shrugged shoulder said help carry abaft heaven know there be plenty of empty cabin on ship to night don have enough to think of without coming to ear therefore when have safely bestowed do attend to duty here a before will see to come now be sad blow to to be parted from master friend in hour of danger seemed better for to get to gentleman quarter for in hole where be must scarce have lived so be fain to submit captain desmond promised that once day might come to enquire further that if man spanish clown who shook in shoe whenever heard gun must by chance be killed might take place whereupon grieve to say prayed devoutly that night that heaven must speedily relieve poor fellow of fear for good next day be too miserable toiling alone at rent in hold to see care much what passed know that towards evening when looked out low cliff of france be in sight that english sail be league in rear standing out a seemed to for white wall of own land chapter twenty seven how ludar sailed north south next day be saturday be hovering near captain desmond quarter on excuse to enquire after comrade when there came summons for hand forward general stir a of something untoward afoot so far a must judge be bowling along before smart westerly breeze with canvas set just about where channel straitens betwixt dover on english side calais on french though be towards french side must clearly see white cliff of england to left betwixt scarcely mile to rear of hovered certain number of english craft have not followed greater ship into dover to right tower steeple of calais town rose up clear bright while straight ahead of long line of armada of closed in rear swept forward a though must dart clean past strait make for dutchman land beyond a went forward marked rapid passing of signal along line crowding on ship at forecastle great anchor of rata be swung in readiness over prow score of men stood by to pay out cable then a strained eye eagerly ahead must see tall mast of duke ship of ship betwixt suddenly swing round into wind eye there be great flapping of canvas rattle of chain plunging of anchor then a if by magic great armada stood still at bay be easy to guess object of strange movement a looked away towards english fleet felt uneasy for so suddenly be spanish fleet halted so near upon heel be pursuer unless must halt a suddenly must assuredly slip past so give spaniard what so greatly desired longed for wind of already young noble on rata be laughing at smart policy of admiral rejoicing in near prospect of turning of table for must once get englishman betwixt duke of parma fleet be waiting on dutch coast must crumple up like chaff between two mill stone already say be counting on seeing enemy run past down wind when lo with derisive shot two into air englishman put about quietly after hovering little running little in teeth of wind to get nice distance from dropped anchor too turned one broad stern upon so that might have eye full of queen ensign floated there confess lifted hat in joy loyalty to see how cunningly don have be out reached spanish oath hissed out from hundred lip a saw same thing sounded to heaven forgive like music so overjoyed be that without leave went off laughing to tell news alack at very entrance to officer quarter whom must run against don alonzo so smartly did come against have not caught roughly by arm might have fallen backwards when saw who be brow darkened little wonder said something in spanish be glad did not know meaning of recovered however drew up coldly moment after eternal printer said way to main mast know already sirrah take with time to top three day ration if be found lower than top mast yard before then swing at bowsprit be sorely tempted to retort then so put about be that there be le chance of countryman seeing if swung at bowsprit than if swung at stern prudently forebore sire said permit first turned on with look ventured more parley sad at heart wondering what ludar must think of for not coming to wishing cursed sea fight be at end went to hold for biscuit bottle of water with better armour than crawled miserably aloft little guessed what revenge be to have on don before three day be over for while not little of pleasure in seeing majesty ship on right side of wind be lost by untoward accident since wind freshened increasingly during day channel in strait be wickedly rough be soon too ill out of humour to think of anything at have more than one mind to venture escape perhaps swim to french coast yet so long a ludar be on ship must not do in grandee quarter be a close prisoner from a if have still be in tower be growing tired of invincible armada thought with longing of snug parlour in printing house without temple bar where have sat of old listening to music of certain sweet voice now seemed lost to in howling of wind booming of gun grinding of spanish teeth where now be that fair maiden whom ludar loved what hope be there of ever meeting hearing of one fate night passed a sunday dawned must see english ship still hovering not far to rearward while across toward english coast shone many white sail a of greater queen ship returning to join fleet wind slackened so that anchorage of armada have be sore strained in night held good with french town so close on flank thought despite loss of wind rode safely enough where be must have leisure to say mass celebrate popish rite without fear of disturbance that sunday so fell out day long bell sounded instead of cannon instead of powder smoke of incense rose to where perched moreover must guess by merry laughter now then came same way that don ship be in better heart than yesterday perchance duke of parma be already on way a for english lay quietly in mooring sparing powder shot too a seemed ready to wait on spaniard for next move towards nightfall seemed to detect stir in quarter presently seven eight moderate sized craft fell out of line with sail set bore down way marvelled very much that if attack be to be made must be left to ill armed craft like to make while greater ship hung idle at distance supposed be device to take off spaniard notice from something else waited curiously to see result came leisurely towards eight ugly craft about cable length apart steering towards very centre of line a approached night fell rapidly still held on must see light hoisted one by one strained ear to catch

be only creaking of tree time seemed to hear calling from within sprang wildly to door be only hoot owl when leaf tapped on window above looked up expecting face to appear there when horse in stable whinnied imagined mocking laughter of troop of traitor left behind to rob of trust at length grew so restless weary of waiting determined to delay no longer enter house a stood moment at door hesitating wind suddenly dropped there fell silence on place made shudder tempted after to await dawn with mighty effort gathered up courage laughing at qualm pushed door be not even shut to so that giving way unexpectedly under hand stumbled heavily into hall a did so struck face against something icy cold in darkness must see nothing felt thing swing away from touch before must step back put

hard to guess never played straight even in villainy doubtless have given captain reason to desire shortest way to be rid of a for thanks to peter villain have known through disguise god know have have revenge on night while speculated thus wandered to fro in house like man distraught till presently footstep brought back to little chamber at end of long passage into have scarce dared peep before dawn have already begun to chase night away be flooding room with flush of light suited sacredness better than flaring torch so left that without entered in twilight be in sweet confusion of chamber whose owner expects to return to anon bed have not be disturbed since be last settled raiment lay scattered here there on table lay book open beside jewel what moved most be little scarf lay

fire within if be sin to hate one enemy will assuredly stand to hurt in day of reckoning how must mortal man stand thus not be stirred passed on softly into tiny chamber beyond there air be fragrant with scent of sprig of honeysuckle that lay yet unwithered in window on floor lay scattered few paper written in notable poetic hand addressed a must not read to one who bade poet give o'er singing to

without more word came springing at side over heather along mountain path at pace put nag to shame 't be easy to follow track of soldier on wet ground once towards evening a mounted tall ridge fancied must descry on crest opposite figure moved at first halting place where paused to give horse hasty meal heard that about mid day certain english soldier have passed place at full gallop two day back a night fell traveller amongst whom rode two woman have likewise hurried by westward with news such a must scarce afford weary horse rest needed before set forth again guide led down steep track into valley then striking straight across toiled up mountain path ascended high ridge opposite checked pace a neared top advising to await daylight for descent when at length at back rose glorious sun over eastern hill flashing light past into valley below saw stretched out great plain like map through winding of river sparkled while beyond rose ridge of hill higher still than on stood guide beckoned to place whence must look out without being exposed to view of one in valley for awhile searched plain in vain only few herd drove cattle afield now then sharp bark of dog broke stillness at length on slope of hill opposite saw flock of sheep break suddenly into panic flight there appeared crawling up ascent body of horseman who by occasional glancing of sun upon steel knew to be soldier whether be troop sought whether amongst carried captive maiden be too far to determine at sight of plunged with new hope towards valley half way down in wood found wounded trooper prone on ground gasping for breath while beside grazed horse be bleeding from side too faint to turn head a came up guide started a saw whispered be one of merriman men knelt beside tried in clumsy way to bind wound help back to life 't be plain be too late for that lay gasping in arm eye already glazed looking vacantly skyward arm feebly tossing in battle for breath twas time for question ventured one where be be daughter asked in ear turned head stopped panting for moment must not save gasped merrim here fell back in arm dead man covered hastily with fallen leaf taking horse for guide use spurred grimly on there be

fellow seemed to speak true yet story agreed not with of dying man there be naught to spur on by mean come level with villain wherever be a commenced steep ascent must discern moving figure of horseman on skyline above a seemed to in two band one of suddenly disappeared on other side while other numbering half dozen men made southward along ridge a came higher saw last still there moving hurriedly to fro a though seeking what found not must hardly be looked for for face be set southward be till came within mile of where stood that turned suddenly perceived then too vanished below skyline lost by time reached ridge top first party be clattering far down plain raising cloud of dust at heel a seemed pushing on with speed to journey end of other party for while saw nothing till presently guide pointed to a stole from out wood below suddenly broke into canter in southward direction seemed to desire be by doubling on track to regain once more ridge on have first discovered whereupon smelling mischief called to men turning after gave chase 't be fool errand for purpose have be abandoned hour later spied striking westward once more a in haste to overtake fellow so near

through rigging with presage of tempest be to come what be of worse omen still long streamer on main mast hitherto have spread due eastward now suddenly flapped to south east showing that gale be coming upon from one quarter have most cause to dread namely north west for a ludar well knew by time unless must keep gerona head out so a to clear far antrim headland of bengore benmore ran peril of

will honour company by taking helm if be possible clearing of peril foul wind threatens will do best said doubt ship power to keep course across wind need more than one man at tiller by leave appoint comrade here to assist so be said don alonzo befall thank sir ludar for service thus honourably did ludar mcdonnell step where deserved to post of command on board ship a for 't be glory enough to stand second so soon a saw hand on helm doubt of safe passage round headland on to scotland be at end not so have undertaken more than can perform said don know if wind hold nothing can persuade lob

north of malin head for a drove down before must hear thunder of breaker on right ludar pronounced to be tor rock off island of instrahull 't be mercy to be past anyhow said see for turning of helm be driving down wind so indeed be to dismay gerona sailed almost a far sideways a did forward have not be well out to seaward to start with might have be hard put to even to clear headland of innishowen about midnight there be nothing for to order sail to be let go depend only on oar for course after for while went better men worn out dispirited pulled with heart hour by hour vessel drifted in until be clear that nothing shifting of wind standing to at anchor must keep off opposite rock off innishowen a crossed mouth of foyle river fell on shoal of terrible willow spun gerona round like top washed in raging foam from stem to stern go tell don must either let go anchor double men at oar said ludar when presently have staggered out again into blacker water word be given immediately to try

at gunwale knew have only lost time water in attempt instantly don called upon noble to volunteer for oar gallantly responded occupied after bench while slave rowed forward then for hour gerona seemed to hold own reeled across bay on eastward course presently even lordlings of spain flagged once again drove in amid thunder of surf on ever nearing shore must be near bann mouth said to think of last

rower helped a ludar foretold round rough little head of ramore sooner have passed than wind current together got hold of again swept in betwixt island of skerries mainland not even twice number of rower must have saved then listen said ludar presently listened must hear ahead of thunder deeper more awful than have yet passed what be asked father castle said be going home with vengeance now scarce man remained at oar must hear shout of praying cursing intermingled a hand crowded to deck gazed forward in direction of warning sound lanthorn on quarter deck showed don standing there alone bare headed in steel breastplate sword in hand quietly waiting end beyond be troubled crowd of doomed men counting moment straining eye into darkness beside on poop ludar stood erect noble with half defiant half triumphant gleam on face a with hand still on tiller listened to fatal music of old home ahead in darkness must see nothing white waste of breaker on to be driving presently a be almost upon ludar grasped arm pointed high overhead there be momentary gleam of light with glimpse of rugged battlement at rock edge dunluce dunluce shouted let swing now useless tiller scarce minute later gerona be in death agony among lashing breaker for moment two held up bravely then with mighty swirl reared upward hung quivering instant in suspense ludar hand mine sought one a waited thus must see
