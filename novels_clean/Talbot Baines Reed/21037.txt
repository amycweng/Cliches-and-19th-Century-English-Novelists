across green arm in arm deep in confabulation a to projected shop when reached door of wakefield wally said by way have of chap lost football there be one kicking about in room hang outside will chuck to out of window did ball proved to be very one modern have lost week ago how curious chapter eleven fellsgarth versus rendlesham how came that rollitt played after in rendlesham match one must properly understand name be not down on original list yorke have given up asking to play a always either excused what be worse promised to come failed at last moment after defeat of modern at second election question of selection of fifteen have be allowed to drop who be keen on victory hoped further difficulty must arise two day before match however brinkman be unlucky enough to hurt foot to great mortification be forbidden by doctor to play news of accident caused general consternation a be known to be good forward useful man in scrimmage clapperton increased difficulty by coming over to say that a brinkman be laid up have arranged for corder to play instead corder a happened be modern senior small fellow reputed indifferent player must do at said yorke decisively why not surely have got right to find substitute for own man said clapperton testily what do mean by own man who care twopence whose man be a long a play up fifteen be fellsgarth men more yours than be mine if be a much mine a yours one must complain mean to say that if be captain of fifteen 'd put corder in team for first class match why not there be plenty worse than there be so many better that be out of question mean only five of men be to play against ten of yours be talking rot clapperton know if be captain will choose own team if like if best fifteen men in school be in be welcome to complain hope will strike pretty forcibly fellow wo fancy being snubbed like must be bad job if showed a much on day of match must be bad job for said captain when yorke repeated disagreeable conversation to friend later on pulled long face suppose mean intend to play up said dalton if be so said fisher major why not cut out make up fifteen of fellow can depend on must do said yorke expect when time come will play up right after clapperton fullerton be two of best men what about vacant place have four five name better than corder said captain none of a good a brinkman company generally be to be feared did not lament a honestly a yorke did accident to rival did not profess to rejoice of course still bore blow with equanimity next morning to astonishment of everybody notice board contained abrupt announcement in captain hand that in consequence of brinkman inability to play rollitt must take place in fifteen yorke must not account for sudden act of patriotism rollitt said have looked into room last night at bedtime said will play on saturday vanished fisher minor be perhaps of person better able to explain mystery than one else have overheard in ranger study general lamentation about prospect for saturday wish expressed by brother that rollitt be not so unsociable undependable everybody agreed be utterly useless to ask to play that must have to get second rate man to fill empty place so most probably lose match fisher minor heard when presently on way to own den passed rollitt door tremendous resolution seized to take upon duty of ambassador extraordinary for school rollitt appeared to owe grudge for throwing stone other day have already come to relief handsomely at time of second election in affair with dangle on whole fisher minor thought might venture rollitt be reading hard by light of one small candle when entered please rollitt said boy must ever mind playing for school on saturday rollitt looked up in such evident alarm that fisher major put hand on latch of door made ready to bolt will see get out said rollitt fisher minor did get out be really too absurd to suppose that rollitt be going to play in fifteen to oblige fisher minor so at least thought that young gentleman remained discreetly silent about interview hoping devoutly one must hear of joy of classic be almost equal to fury of modern latter must not deny that rollitt be host in worth dozen corders yet galled to see quietly put in vacant place to hear jubilation on hand for rollitt be fellow who have publicly insulted modern in person of dangle not only that poor shabby a be have shown utterly indifferent to indignation contemptuous of threat why dangle said fellow pauper ca even pay for club father common fellow be told yes heard said brinkman fee up here be paid for why might just a well have bob in fifteen jolly sight better bob know how to be civil be crime to be poor said fullerton hope will never commit well said clapperton ignoring bit of sarcasm if be well enough off to buy cake of soap once term must be so bad believe when want wash go down to mr wisdom borrows bit of hers by way that reminds said dangle did fellow ever hear about mr wisdom boat lout have out other day in rapid let go over fall got smashed up what exclaimed everybody do mean said brinkman poor widow wisdom have lost boat owing to cad why will be ruined however be to get new one be extraordinary thing said dangle be told about say that rollitt went straight away to lake bought boat be for sale there be got now down in lower reach be better one than other what exclaimed clapperton incredulously rollitt bought new boat bosh be second hand one for sale cheap cost five pound showed receipt stuff nonsense be gammoning said clapperton right said dangle snappishly be not obliged to believe unless like there conversation ended day of great match came at last rendlesham men who have to come from distance be not due till one o'clock a may be imagined interval be peculiarly trying to of inhabitant of fellsgarth farce of morning school be ordeal alike to master boy if gazing up at cloud must bring down rain deluge must have fallen before be a hour approached impatience rose to fever heat be first match of season for last three year two team have met in deadly combat time match have ended in draw with not one goal kicked on side victory defeat to day must be crisis in history of fellsgarth woe betide man who missed point blundered kick percy friend put on flannel in honour of occasion sallied out hour before time to look at ground inspect new goal flag post fisher major a first act of treasurership have ordered for school disgusted somewhat to find wally friend also in flannel be on spot before having surveyed new acquisition have calmly bagged four front central seat in pavilion reserved by courtesy for head master lady since tea at mr stratton junior have abated somewhat of immemorial feud although relation be still occasionally subject to tension hullo kid cried wally a brother approached how do do pretty well morning be right so be have seat plenty of room in second row considering that one have yet put in appearance be strictly correct did not please modern junior will get jolly well turned out when ringwood come said percy come on chap added to own friend what be use of sitting on bench like schoolboy hour before time let have trot mind dirty white bag cried d'arcy might be mistaken for classic kid if did shouted cottle have have whereupon not before time friend parted for while when percy co returned found pavilion be filling up greatly to delight front row be empty enemy have be cleared out serve right come on chap said lickford let get stuck in there come over to oak tree get up there be best view in field ala when got to oak tree four friendly voice hailed from among leaf how be modern kid there be ripping view up here have acorn mind eye sorry be full up plenty of room up poplar tree modern scorned to reply walked back sulkily to pavilion not without parting greeting from friend up oak tree squatted on step place be filling up now mr stratton be there with visitor little wakefields be there of course minor minimus minimissima a be called uttering war whoop in honour of house there be knot of rendlesham fellow talking among generally taking stock of fellsgarth form mr stratton in civilian dress a became umpire be first representative of school to show up on grass distant cheer from top of oak tree hailed arrival louder cheer still from step of pavilion indicated that popular master be not private property of faction in fellsgarth to fisher minor be amazing how mr stratton must talk laugh a pleasantly a did with umpire for other side felt sure must not have done suddenly occurred to fisher minor by what connection of idea must not tell what awful thing must be if rollitt be to forget about match horror of idea have weight of presentiment sent colour from cheek without word to anybody slid down tree began to run with might towards school what be row collywobbles asked d'arcy one be in position to answer fusillade of acorn from tree derisive compliment of well run bravo short leg from pavilion step greeted runner a passed that warm corner did care even captain own brother whom met going down to field of battle did not divert rushed panting up stair into rollitt study rollitt be sitting at table taking observation of crumb of bread through microscope rollitt gasped boy match be just beginning promised to play do come will be licked rollitt took further look at crumb then got up forgot said come on fisher minor be going to put on flannel asked boy why said rollitt roughly stalking out fisher minor wondered if reason be that have none be too full of mission to trouble about keeping prize well in sight for fear must go astray have satisfaction of seeing arrive on field of battle just a opposing force be taking place just a classic senior be inwardly calling fool for having depended for moment on hopeless fellow of sort classic junior felt good deal compromised by champion shabby cloth trouser flannel shirt cheered lustily same while modern having expressed indignation to one relieved feeling by laughing moment after everybody forgot everything match rendlesham men looked very trim dangerous in black white uniform when presently captain led off with magnificent place kick flew almost into school line classic modern forgot difference squirmed with common foreboding fullerton promptly returned ball into medias re usual inaugural scrimmage ensued to knowing one who judged from little thing seemed that present match be likely to be a even a of predecessor forward be about equally weighted quarter half back who hovered outside seemed equally alert light footed presently ball squeezed out on school side gave ranger first chance of run used well with fisher major yorke on flank got well past rendlesham forward amid loud cheer from oak tree enemy quarter back pinned in moment yet not before have passed ball neatly to fisher on left fisher struggled on few yard further with captain dangle backing up have to relinquish ball to former before must reach half back always wary cool headed have measured force against a soon a have ball ran back step two to break ugly rush of two of enemy who be nearest then with sweep distanced charging through half back made dash for goal for moment friend foe held breath looked like doing in detour have given time for blackstone rendlesham fast runner to get under way sweep down to meet just a reeled out of clutch of half back next moment yorke be down dangle be not there to pick up ball rush served pretty well to exhibit strong weak point of side be evident for instance that ranger yorke be men to be marked by other side dangle on contrary be playing slack series of scrimmage followed in midst of ball gravitated back to centre of field run be attempted on side once twice ball went out into touch once twice drop kick sent flying over forward head came back inevitably so that after twenty minute hard play lay in almost identical spot from have first be kicked off onlooker began to feel little depressed be not to be walk over for school at rate indeed seemed doubtful whether from last toughest of scrimmage ball must ever emerge again to light of day suddenly however become evident that status quo be about to give way that fortune of side be going to take new turn one in game still le outside must at first tell what have happened then occurred to yorke one two others that rollitt who have hitherto be playing listlessly sleepily be waking up head high above fellow be seen violently agitated in middle of scrimmage presently struggled forward till came to where ball lay moment later rendlesham side of scrimmage showed sign of breaking moment after rollitt quickly picking up ball burst through friend foe back up dangle back up ranger shouted yorke look out behind cried rendlesham captain rollitt carried that ball pretty much a have carried dangle day two before almost contemptuously indifferent a to who opposed who got in way only difference be that whereas then walked now ran when rollitt chose to run a fellsgarth knew even ranger swift footed be not in enemy forward be shaken off quarter back distanced half back closed on with simultaneous charge made reel kept foot better than staggered on with one of hanging to arm look out in goal shouted rendlesham men back up fellow cried yorke in struggle with man on arm rollitt lost pace enough to enable blackstone to overtake make wild dash not at man ball onslaught be partly successful for ball fell dangle who be close behind made attempt to pick up before must do so rollitt like hound momentarily checked dashed back to recover knocking over a did so dangle blackstone have again once more be off time with only enemy back to intercept back did best sacrificed nobly for side be match for fellsgarth giant who simply rode over followed by mighty roar of cheering from onlooker carried ball behind goal touching down with almost fastidious precision exactly way between pole minute later yorke with one of beautifully neat place have sent ball spinning over bar a unmistakable goal a school have ever kicked cheer followed exploit be completely lost on rollitt who having completed run dawdled back to fellow forward have not even curiosity to watch issue of captain kick a side changed end dangle with black face came up to knocked over on purpose then cad must see snarled get out said rollitt shouldering speaker aside be too much for dangle full of rage went to yorke mean to stand yorke rollitt shut up said captain spread out fellow be ready go to place dangle dangle sullenly obeyed will let see if be to be insulted made fool of before school growled catch bothering more a if to give opportunity of enforcing protest kick off of losing side fell close at foot picked up for moment sporting instinct prompted to make rush caught sight of yorke rollitt looking way bad blood in prevailed deliberately sent ball with little side kick into blackstone hand who running forward step sent with mighty drop right over school line almost grazed goal post a passed be fullerton must do to save touch down before whole advance guard of enemy be upon whole thing have be so wilfully done that there be mistaking meaning hold ball cried a side ranged out for kick off dangle get off field what do mean said dangle very white what say will either do be kicked off here clapperton interposed go dangle be right to turn off talk to like before field because of accident if go will go too go of then said two modern boy looked for moment a though doubted own ear what must yorke mean

grass made wild grab without ever reaching be really too ridiculous to be eluded by raw hand like yet eluded way down field ran with roar of applause at back only handful of enemy left ahead how splendid if must only pas make record with run from one goal to other ala swoop from behind greeted proud thought two hand clawed at shoulder from shoulder slipped to waist from waist slid down to ankle where for moment held sent runner tripping over on nose in mud with ball spinning away yard ahead be up fisher be on spot at fisher heel ridgway rendlesham back flung in way only to divert not

worked up that slope like hero more so that be ready to drop durst not for very shame there be hero like coward who compels to be brave many man in history have become famous for exploit cost far le than climb cost fellsgarth junior therefore let record at least award credit deserve be satisfaction when knob be reached looked up at black towering crag above to see that even wally seemed staggered

le exhausting than tramp up bog a wally be better at sort of climbing than of rest did not dishearten by getting hopelessly ahead kept with party occasionally have to help one up specially stiff ledge mutual accommodation be additional source of comfort to weak goer progress be very slow cash having hauled up on to little platform of moss looked at watch be alarmed to find be past one huge ravine at far head of must see open sky seemed tremendous distance yet after according to wally be to come bog cliff beyond on wisdom lost life yet none of thing be quite so bad a rolling up of fleecy cloud behind effaced view below seemed to be crawling up mountain in pursuit of cash pointed out to wally who grunted will miss view from top said if ever get there said cash on scrambled again casting now then longing look upward at grim ravine head now then anxious glance behind at fast overhauling cloud be bound to get out of up there sang out wally almost a spoke light mist swept past blotting out everything boulder stood on rift of dashing water at foot cloud have befriended fisher minor did what durst not do ordered party to halt where be shouted wally from invisible here where be stay there will come to slowly party foregathered stood huddled in blinding mist on flat rock be blowing over said wally 'd better make back for hill side get out of ravine till clear up be easy task scrambling back down difficult way over boulder already made slippery by moist mist not able to see four yard ahead cloud poured up to meet in column upon column growing denser wetter minute at last how scarcely knew came down to where rush of water ceased stone gave place to wet grass must be somewhere near where sat down last said ashby whew be cold thing be said percy be too much out to left there be sign of path can see look like one said voice ahead recognised a wally come along way followed a well a must groped about for path then shouted wally replied out of mist stay there bit be not path will yell when have got waited for five minute listened anxiously for signal then thought heard away to right floundered off in pursuit after little discovered that be going uphill have better go back to where be said cash may miss occurred to most of party that have missed already still decided to go back presently distinctly heard what sounded like voice below must be yell shouted again there seemed to come faint response right said percy stay where be will go fetch up vanished into mist what be time said ashby a party stood dismally waiting half past four be good job doe get dark till six only hour half said cottle wish chap must come though strained ear eye sign of missing one came nothing swish of rain whistle of wind through grass 'd better go on said d'arcy presently will probably get down other way look sharp will be dark so started at fast walk down boggy slope keep close said d'arcy after time be there everybody answered for not for neighbour there young fisher minor yes replied fisher voice from rear seemed so near that started on again after five minute ashby who be last one shouted again where be fisher minor there be answer wait bit fellow fisher minor behind answer came from direction here be go said ashby to that kid fisher gone lame will be lost if wait for so dismally turned back shouting whistling a went cloud round grew duller heavier in fading light wind blown rain struck keenly on wanderer cheek that kid said ashby to a sturdily tramped through marsh ought not to have come be not up to despite shouting whistling cooeying not sound came out of mist wind driving of rain still ashby must not bring to leave kid in lurch even if did not find must be better to ah what be that clapped hand to mouth shouted against wind with might voice be flung back in face with there came feeble sound of coo ey somewhere near ashby sprang to like drowning man to straw if be only lost sheep must be company for ten minute beat round shouting time once twice fancying heard answer then suddenly came upon great boulder against leaned fisher minor whimpering shivering here be said ashby joyously thank god for gave up for lost others be gone on come on hang on arm old ho ca be too fagged to go on be awfully sleepy ashby go on will come presently be reply be prompt vigorous took fellow junior by arm began to march down slope a fast almost faster than weary leg must carry a started last of light died out of mist left in blank darkness chapter eighteen rollitt make record for fellsgarth modern senior have slept on soundly that morning secure of prey military operation of preceding evening although resulted in night of besieged have not tended to glory of besieger indeed when door have at last be broken in be discovered that bird have flown titter have gone round at expense of messrs clapperton dangle brinkman have be particularly riling to gentleman when in morning bird be found to have flown once more position of senior became positively painful fullerton a usual did not salve wound must say not that matter much to that score to rebel said how very naughty of not to stay be whopped to be sure young cad growled clapperton who have grace to be perfectly aware that have be made ridiculous envy when get hold of more do said fullerton with door off hinge will be very draughty do shut up why go join enemy at once if be so fond of said dangle well said clapperton will keep must have out with corder now be use simply cutting will have to be taught that ca defy house for nothing go tell to come brinkman corder back be against wall literally metaphorically to brinkman demand almost first voice have heard speaking to for week returned curt refusal well will make come said brinkman whereupon corder retreated behind table invited interloper to begin to dodge round round study table after nimble boy be not very dignified operation for prefect particularly when object of chase be prefect too brinkman presently abandoned quest went off breathing threatenings slaughter for reinforcement so did corder le sensitive than junior fellow martyr marched straight across to yorke study captain be away in adjoining room found fisher major denton poring over endless account two said corder be prefect be wanted over on other side to stop bullying who be being bullied be have be cut dead for week be sick of now be going to lick 'd take

be such howling come down when have done be to do what have right to do rather what be bound to do play up for school jolly well played too said usher be lucky turn know be so awfully glad to be in fifteen felt must do anything of course lucky thing be getting past forward then then corder bunched into delighted account of never to be forgotten match during cloud passed away from face light came back to eye spirit into voice what business have to stop said bully for none yorke when hears of will report to doctor let do what be use if can stay here be all right hour later about time that young mountaineer be beginning to look out for second wind on lower slope dangle came across in vicious temper have not come to look for corder sight of whom in sanctuary of classic study took aback be where be sneaking be said be not surprised not much need to sneak from be three against one object to said corder if like to fetch clapperton brinkman over here can have out comfortably now must think uncommonly important if suppose be going to trouble about as like said dangle never once thought of have come for then said fisher have better wait till be invited before come where be not wanted have come on club business have perfect right to come fellow hear have taken into head to dissolve club what of why did come vote against if did like thank be quite good enough what want to know be what be treasurer going to do with money suppose be hardly going to be treated a perquisite for fisher major looked troubled have dreaded awkward question for day for lost money be still missing know be nothing of kind what be going to do with then be for club to decide if 'd come to meeting must have proposed something be funny how sore be about precious hole corner meeting of yours how much be there on hand will know presently dare say a soon a have hit on dodge for getting over little deficiency of four five pound eh fisher major looked up in astonishment how have fellow heard about dangle laughed thought be snug little secret of own did be mistaken be mistaken if think be going to get at bottom of fisher major rose to foot look here dangle said do mean to insinuate have taken club money never said so be going to cook account so that must not be known did mean be whom did mean said denton did say anybody said dangle beginning to feel in fix meant be want to know what be become of money want to know more than do said fisher major 'd have handed over money day ago if must only have found do suspect one said dangle suspect one come here must be likely to take leave about though have noticed that who be fag a honest man a bit be saying good deal for retorted fisher major hotly keep temper who be study be that next yours be be on other side be rollitt suppose be going to insinuate stop bit said dangle suddenly turning to close door before proceeded when did first miss money be uncommonly interested in account said fisher if want to know so much be ten day ago be interested because have idea when did get in subscription be in week before first rendlesham match match where fisher major stopped dangle took notice of broken taunt said look here fisher there be love lost between doe affect for care to see club robbed without giving friendly hint be very kind who be culprit doctor rollitt stay said waving down interruption must be fool enough to say unless be pretty sure tell fisher when go out leave money about do lock door have to do that side did ever see rollitt in here do know that on first half holiday term rollitt nearly came to grief on river what on earth have that to do with everything heard of young brother be with of course heard that lost widow wisdom boat over fall yes said fisher suddenly beginning to see drift of cross examination heard that very next day bought new one for five pound yes did right have to connect that with missing money wait bit be away afternoon be yes be happened to come over to look for found be out only fellow met in house be rollitt 'd just got back met at door of room there can make what like of even classic know what twice two make turned on heel left room there be go thoroughbred cad for said denton know how came to let go without kicking said fisher will call to to come back asked corder of course said fisher major be curious coincidence about rollitt never thought of connecting two thing together before be utter guesswork on dangle part if come to said corder if dangle be over here that afternoon why must have collared a well a rollitt have amount of money be not hard up like rollitt can say be said denton wish that cad have kept suspicion to object of suspicion meanwhile blissfully unconscious of interest with be being remembered at fellsgarth be utilising holiday in prosecution of favourite sport time did not fish from boat did affect upper stream tried lower reach not very successfully for have never be able to replace tackle lost on eventful afternoon when widow wisdom boat have gone over fall have fly book still have come across old reel fitted to makeshift rod with common twine have to do duty until must afford regular new turnout be better than nothing fish seemed somehow to get wind of fact that be not being treated with proper respect refused to have more to do than must help with irregular looking apparatus rollitt put up with unreasonableness for long time that morning afternoon with infinite patience tried one fly after bank in turn gave chance of being hooked under fall right down on flat by lake be go must be tempted at last a be growing dusk became conscious that have be raining fast for hour that be wet through looked up saw grim pall of wet lying over lake up side of hawk pike of only lower slope be distinguishable through mist be not promising evening rollitt now came to think of might a well go back to fellsgarth a stand about here so collected tackle turned homeward path from lake brought across track lead round to back of mountain be just turning in here when heard what sounded like halloo on hill side be probably only shepherd calling dog waited to make sure yes be shout sounded more like sheep than man rollitt shouted back quick response came presently out of mist shadowy form emerged running down slope hopping over boulder making for lane minute more wally presented hullo be that rollitt thought be lost say have seen others rollitt shook head whew made sure 'd come down say what go if be lost up there night like rollitt looked up at dim mountain side nodded again thought be on path know hallooed to did hear so went back for so have missed who said rollitt do know young brother percy modern kid be one lot know d'arcy ashby fisher minor fisher minor said rollitt suddenly becoming interested up there yes be lame horse of party not up to what be up say rollitt have suddenly deposited rod under wall quitting path be beginning to strike up base of hill go bring guide growled will get lost to dead certainty say ca come too said boy looking very miserable fetch guide come with quick there be guide to be have nearer than penchurch four mile off wally very cold wet hungry footsore with big load on heart a thought of percy pulled together with effort stumped off rollitt strode on up slope in gathering night cold weather mattered little to still le did danger fisher minor mattered very much for percy of rest might probably have stayed where be for one boy in fellsgarth oared about must cheerfully go over precipice now again stood still shouted in wind rain be impossible to say if one heard called again after hour more found on first ridge where for few yard ground be level before rise again here called again once twice once there came a thought faint distant whistle by manner of calling must get to come again started off in direction from seemed to come calling way never voice came out of darkness for couple of hour doggedly haunted place loth to leave while chance remained then gave up started once more up steep slope looked at watch by light of match be eleven o'clock shuddered not with cold went on something who must say what told that must go higher yet once last year in company with wisdom have be a far a upper bog have wanted to go to top wisdom have dissuaded now even in darkness ground seemed familiar tramped on up swampy steep till presently found near sound of rushing water at foot of great ravine stream have grown so strong since afternoon to shout against be more hopeless than ever yet rollitt shouted have voice replied felt sure must have heard none did up steep ravine went finding going easier than through spongy swamp below about way up just where junior ten hour ago have decided to turn back a looked up saw what seemed like clear sky through frame in mist be clearing after yes higher got more mist broke up into fleeting cloud swept aside few moment let in dim glimmer of moonlight on scene at top of ravine shouted again be still even wind be dying down rain fell with deadened sob at foot three o'clock wisdom have told day have be up there that top be only three quarter of hour beyond where stood something still cried excelsior within without halting longer than to satisfy by shout started on how achieved that tremendous climb must never say cloud have rolled off moonlight lit up rock almost like day never once did pull up flag in ascent even ceased to shout presently there loomed before gleaming in moonlight cairn for first time in annals fellsgarth boy have got to top of hawk pike so far from elation at glory of achievement rollitt uttered groan of dismay when looked round found one there after that must find fisher minor there have never doubted now have be time lost without waiting to heed glorious moonlight prospect over lake hill turned almost savagely scrambled down crag be perilous work more perilous than scramble up rollitt did not think of danger therefore perhaps did not meet in hour be down on bog in hour after just a faint break in east gave warning that night be gone stood bruised panting at foot of gorge on second ridge be too dispirited to shout now have not be given to after to rescue friend must have done better if have never there be big boulder just ahead poised almost miraculously on edge on sloping hill side looked a if moderate blast of wind must send headlong to bottom have stood there for century shelter for sheep in winter from snow hail what made rollitt bound now in direction of rock like man shot surely not to admire natural curiosity to seek shelter under wing have found that quest after have not be in vain there curled up under overhanging rock lying one almost across other for warmth with cheek touching cheek ashby coat covering be fisher minor chum not dead sleeping soundly chapter nineteen corder strike blow for liberty absence of junior have excited curiosity in house till evening be holiday though rule be that even on holiday boy must go out of touch a be called be beyond certain radius without permission be not always enforced modern senior have reason to guess object of prolonged absence have promised many thing to junior when caught be not surprising while thing be a warm a be that young rebel must give fellsgarth wide berth a to classic junior one be surprised at anything did in reason when call over came nine name be returned absent in addition to of rollitt few other habitual vagrant fellow began to ask where be have one seen wally asked yorke who have just have unusual experience of making own tea cooking own egg be probably fooling about somewhere out of bound with fag said ranger will have to catch fisher though be brother let have said fisher 'd do same to young brother if have chance to change subject have something to tell fellow be rather awkward that money have turned up yet be awkward said yorke wish must help out with be cleaned out oh be not of course be responsible must get governor to make good dear old governor will do will pull precious long face go round house lowering gas telling one must economise with two such expensive son a minor at school be not that though dangle came over morning wanted to know what be going to do about account now have dissolved club somehow other be heard of deficiency want to know about hope told said yorke of course did told lot more than must tell think know what be become of fisher proceeded to narrate dangle suspicion against rollitt captain face grew very long a story went on then said hope to goodness there be nothing in be fact about widow wisdom boat yes young brother be with rollitt that day told about a secret a be out now there be good keeping dangle have spite against rollitt if one else have told there might have be something in if have be one rollitt bought boat must have be nothing be so frightfully poor 'd time to write home even if must have got money from there there be one here must borrow of why must have gone off very first thing in morning bought boat be quite certain have money collected by saturday asked yorke yes what be more be almost certain counted made come right be last time have come right captain drummed finger on table looked very miserable wish fisher said have advised to take treasurership if must only be quite sure there be mistake in account must be different must be frightful thing to suspect rollitt unless be absolutely certain be welcome to round on said fisher looking quite a miserable a chief be fool to take advice 'd much sooner make money up not say word about to one ca do now may be sure dangle wo let drop what will do asked ranger what must do said yorke testily be bad enough to be in fix like without being asked hopeless question be sorry old man have lost temper a be not come back vote say more on subject at present evening wore on still truant did not return at ten o'clock yorke reported absence to mr wakefield mr wakefield reported to head master similar report reached from matron of mr forders house with regard to missing one there presently further report be made that rollitt be not in school one must give account of probable whereabouts rollitt have be seen going out with rod early in day one have seen of junior since last night when have prematurely gone to bed in own dormitory consultation be held in sort of conjecture be put forward most plausible of be that junior have organised expedition to seastrand fashionable watering place hour distant on railway wally lickford have separately be heard to express desire to visit seemed probable that have lost last train back must literally not come home till morning in case warm thing be promised to be ready for gentleman a to rollitt vagary be consistent with explanation may have gone to penchurch in mistake for fellsgarth curled up in church porch mistaking for bed in case general impression be that nothing must be done till morning that junior at least be making pretty comfortable wherever might be still fisher major felt vague uneasiness have be quite sure brother be in capable company of fellow fag must have be comparatively comfortable possibility of feckless youngster wandering about benighted somewhere on own account added new weight to burden already lay on spirit of luckless treasurer of school club have good mind to turn out look for minor said to denton what must do be all right must do anything in dark on night like be game to turn out hour like in morning if be not come by then bet four young scamp will stroll in for call over wonder fuss be about there be nothing to be done fisher lay awake night listening to sound reproaching over over again a one will do when everything go wrong that have made mess of everything term about daybreak there came ring at school bell school jumped to foot fisher be down on green among first in slipper ulster five shivering youngster be standing inside gate with dripping garment chattering teeth white face d'arcy lickford ramshaw cottle cash fisher minor where minor asked senior what have turned up said d'arcy have wally percy ashby turned up got lost on hawk pike be awfully hungry say one turned up do mean to say be

'd be back long ago did chap here doctor several of prefect came on scene truant be ordered to hot bath bed at once council be held a to what must be done fisher major did not wait to take part in rushed to room flung on clothes boot started off accompanied by denton at full speed in direction of mountain neither spoke word a passed widow wisdom denton darted in have fire alight food ready of youngster have be night on mountain be going to look for way to lake be pulled up by shout from across stream be percy wheatfield dead beat sitting on log a white miserable a ghost say have chap seen

night very mention of word fire food revived get up to school a soon a can get to bed ca be use looking for rest there be plenty of to do good bye be half past seven when reached lake turned up mountain path mist have vanished late autumn sun be shining brightly on hill side distant barking of dog above apprised that one be abroad already hope of searcher rose within a struck up steep slope half way up stood shouted reply came except far away barking of shepherd dog will be able to see good way round when get on to ridge said denton almost a spoke shout close by startled looking up perceived emerging from behind boulder little procession fisher major blood ran cold a saw for at head stalked stalwart guide who carried in arm one small boy while in rear followed form recognised a rollitt carrying on back between two tramped third junior hanging on to arm of guide what terrified fisher major more than anything be to see that head of boy on rollitt back have fallen helplessly forward on shoulder of porter with groan elder brother bounded to spot history of year flashed through mind a did so saw people at home heard voice seemed to be in nursery hectoring a big brother will among little one amongst whom be little boy with curly hair shrill piping voice called to mind first night of term vision of young brother breaking down with new boy trouble next morning more fleeted through mind a bounded to where rollitt stood hush said latter almost gruffly asleep so be have scarcely roused when rollitt have picked up two hour ago from roost under rocking stone having once be perched on preserver back head fell forward again there have lain ever since how rollitt have carried so far resting only now then that in way not to disturb burden only who knew huge strength of fellsgarth giant must understand hullo said wally greeting new comer in limp sleepy way have seen young brother percy be yes percy right so be rest be right sang out ashby from front chap wanted to carry so let jolly glad be to get lift said wally new kid ought to have come twenty four hour on hill be nothing when get used to here wally who have have twenty six hour suddenly collapsed tumbled over from sheer fatigue on grass fisher denton made chair of hand for so procession went on cart be in waiting at foot of slope filled with warm wrap other restorative in le than two hour whole party be safe inside wall of fellsgarth hot bath blanket food little physic succeeded in very few day in restoring invalided truant to sorrowing class mate fisher minor be only member of party about whom serious uneasiness existed thanks to wiry constitution rooted dislike to do what nobody else did got off with bad cold detained in house for fortnight rollitt a might have be expected vanished to own quarter a soon a have deposited precious burden into mr wakefield charge one heard of having be to top to fisher thanks returned grumpy not at curious inquiry of others met by shutting door saying get out to one who entered a might be expected also modern senior be baulked after of promised vengeance on rebel on contrary while fag be making merry on chicken toasting toe at roaring fire in sanatorium clapperton brinkman dangle be hauled up into presence of head master there seriously reprimanded for damage done to one of door in mr forder house cautioned not to let breach of discipline happen again under pain of severer penalty if be unable to keep order in own house said doctor cuttingly duty be to report matter to will deal with remember that time incident did not tend to smooth ruffled plume of discomfited hero still le did little rebuff happened few day later corder have taken advantage of general excitement attending escapade of junior to return to own quarter attempt once more to resume privilege of ordinary civilised life only partially succeeded two three boy among whom be fullerton who be getting sick of present state of affair longing for football once more have begun seriously to doubt what advantage be coming to one else by strike among corder found temporary shelter authority of senior still controlled general public opinion of house life of boycotted boy be still only half tolerable at first attempt at violence however corder walked across to classic ally took up quarter in study where remained day at bedtime declined to return to own house particularly when summons to effect be sent across by clapperton who by time have very good idea of rebel whereabouts be not going over said corder ca stay here night said denton what will do turn out asked fugitive 'd better go if like look of thing out there 'd better speak to forder 'd sooner stop said corder doggedly be sorry to put fellow about after being so kind be not going over there yorke be consulted took upon responsibility of detaining refugee for night all right thanks said corder turned in next morning word came from mr forder requiring that truant must answer for absence corder obeyed with misgiving explained briefly that have be bullied did not want to stand mr forder who have peculiar faculty for saddling wrong horse be not satisfied with explanation chose to suspect other corder have never be satisfactory boy have probably be making objectionable have be glad of excuse to break rule master did not demand particular gave culprit imposition ordered to obey rule of house time if have grievance to come with to instead of taking law into own hand whereupon corder departed in high dudgeon be use holding out now have better give in own beaten must be so much easier than resisting longer for hour of two be permitted to go in out unmolested after morning school be going out to solace with solitary kick at football when just on step of house brinkman pounced upon have got now have cad said just come back with wo let go cried corder in temporary panic wriggling away escaping few yard brinkman however be quickly after determined time to hold fast corder though senior be small boy have never before thought of pitting against modern bully once already term have come suddenly to realise that must do better than gave credit for now that matter seemed desperate when there be escape fate stared in face occurred to corder must show fight have right on side have done no harm to brinkman anybody else why must let out stand up for so to brinkman utter amazement be met by blow defiant challenge to come on what brinkman might have done be doubtful at moment yorke ranger strolled by hullo what be fight said captain rather said corder now thoroughly strung up to point say yorke will stop see fair play captain hesitated moment other fight must have felt duty to stop fight seemed to be exception must probably do more good than harm yes if like said be not going to fight little beggar like said brinkman yes be said ranger will see fair play for promise will make so hot for that will be sorry for care said corder if fight be coward there at point dangle came out here man want second said ranger will suit better than usual crowd collected junior faction who complained bitterly for year after that have be deliberately done out of being present by malice of principal one result of absence be that proceeding be comparatively quiet one present knew what quarrel be not few for own sake hoped corder must make good fight of dangle sneered at whole thing counselled man audibly not to be too hard on little fool advice be not wanted corder for fellow of make inexperience exhibited good form persistently walked man round ring dodging blow getting in knock for now then brinkman soon dropped disdainful style in commenced proceeding became proportionately wild unsteady now be chance young 'un be lost temper whispered captain whereupon corder hardly knowing how managed danced man once more round round till be out of breath then slipped in with right left left right though made up hardly one good blow among be so well planted followed one so rapidly that brinkman lost balance under fell sprawling on ground at same moment mr stratton came up crowd dispersed a if by magic what be said master appealing to captain fight sir said necessary one between corder brinkman come tell about yorke so while corder amid jubilation of supporter who have grown twenty fold since beginning of fight be being escorted to quarter brinkman crestfallen bewildered be being left by disgusted backer to help strolled on with mr stratton gave a well a must account of circumstance for week have be leading up to climax think be a well to allow said master there must be more of have hard task before to pull thing together yorke will be work well done be right thing to dissolve club sir asked yorke at time yes watch chance of reviving must have common interest on foot to bring two side together captain walked back to house in brown study have half hoped mr stratton might offer to interpose restore harmony of school master have left to captain yorke courage rose within god helping must pull fellsgarth together before left on green met fullerton be long since modern classic senior have nodded a passed in curious perversity of thing did so now there be be fight hear said fullerton yes brinkman corder corder have best of be jolly glad corder got more pluck than 'd give credit for yes be have rough time of in house so have poor beggar be rather humiliating to wait till have licked man before one take side upon word be a sick of a be be rather rough on fellow who be allowed to do what have right to do said yorke say have anything special on after afternoon school why only that wish 'd come have tea with fullerton laughed bribery corruption said anyhow will come chapter twenty fama volat modern senior have certainly experienced run of bad luck since inauguration of strike be to have brought rival down on knee secured for modern side supremacy in fellsgarth second rendlesham match defection of corder mutiny of junior disbanding of club row with head master finally defeat of brinkman by own victim might be held to be enough to chasten spirit induce to ask whether game be worth candle such be infatuation of wrong headedness still breathed vengeance on one time victim be to be rollitt grudge against have be steadily accumulating during term outrage on gentle dangle be yet to be atoned for crime of playing in fifteen be yet unappeased contempt of whole crew of enemy be not to be pardoned even rescue of lost junior told against for have helped to turn public feeling of school in favour of recalcitrant young rebel so far there have be no getting at must not quarrel must not even recognise existence of one did not care for now chance have come more discussed more morally certain be that be answerable for disappearance of money from club fund very reluctance of own house to take action in matter showed that at least appreciated gravity of suspicion be trump card for modern by pushing now must be doing service to school must pose a champion of honesty must be mortifying classic even while pretended to assist above must wipe out score with rollitt in way must not well disregard clapperton dangle be not superlatively clever boy whether by chance design certainly hit upon admirable method for bringing matter to crisis dangle took upon to confide suspicion a dead terrible secret to wilcox middle boy of forder house notorious a most prolific gossip in fellsgarth who be known to have several talking acquaintance in other house wilcox received dangle communication with astonishment oh of course must breathe word of to one not for world be bad business be fisher major business to see put right so on night a wilcox friend underwood be retiring to rest former confided to latter under deadliest pledge of secrecy that there be scandal going on about school account might say more except that fellow suspected be one of last must have dreamt of although others might be le surprised be not next morning sat next to calder classic boy in hall asked if must keep secret oh yes calder must keep amount of secret then wilcox told same story that have confided to underwood only adding that amount in question be said to be several pound calder hazarded name of several boy wilcox shrugged shoulder at 'd better not ask said will only get out make trouble oh promise must tell soul said calder ca tell though will tell 'd never guess fellow have have a much in pocket life what do mean rollitt ca tell say be not at liberty to mention name rumour thus admirably started went on merrily before nightfall be known in dozen modern study that club fund have be robbed of l l by classic boy that be being shielded by own senior on classic side four five fellow whispered to one rollitt have be caught in act of stealing money out of fisher major room day two ago presently one enterprising gossip sent story of widow wisdom boat rolling in out with rumour of stolen money encouraged by one else hinted that there have be deficiency last term a well a in out with new story be started report that last term rollitt have set up with fishing tackle book of fly worth ever so much couple of day later number of boy in secret have multiplied fast rollitt a walked across green to hall class be watched pointed out mysteriously by score more of curious boy of course story grew to sort of curious shape percy who be first of invalided junior to appear in usual haunt have from rix who have have from bank who have have from underwood who have have from wilcox who have have from dangle who have be present on

looking in vain towards brother to ascertain if be doing well ill blabbed knew about rollitt condition of study nature of solitary walk poverty of possession everything must possibly confirm suspicion against forgot to mention anything might in least avail on other side at close of court martial mr forder summed up be afraid be very clear case said be very painful to think that fellsgarth boy must

ramshaw having to come fifth have decided misgiving a to fun of thing while classic junior declined to play unless others remained on spot ready to back up in case of emergency be also decided that for precautionary reason key of clapperton door must be removed for time being lest must try to lock good news out that interval of two minute must be allowed to elapse between messenger announcement little dreaming of exquisite torture being prepared for clapperton sat in study engaged in farce of preparation have plenty to think of besides lesson thing have gone wrong with dangle have fought

heel wriggled out of window with aid of pipe pulled up with face to window of clapperton study that worthy be beginning to congratulate that must be spared further repetition of uncomfortable news night when sudden loud voice at one of open lattice pane almost startled out of skin oh clapperton ai glad be thief money found good evening have used soap haul in chap sharp persecuted senior after first surprise made frantic rush first at window then finding bird flown at door latter be locked must hear scuffling scrambling in lobby outside followed by stampede after dead silence prevailed save for vicious kicking of imprisoned hero at own door whew said wally fanning when junior be safe back in percy study be squeak if like how on earth be to do better let off suggested one wally resented suggestion a insult not likely said will do care if back up in minute when sound of kicking have ceased clapperton have apparently retired once more to work crept out into lobby followed stealthily by whole band a passed head of stair whose voice must hear below inquiring of middle boy if clapperton be in house doctor yes sir will tell want said boy will go up to room said head master whew said wally what go door locked on outside will go turn quietly said percy if back up in case fly out precaution be not needed percy who luckily have just taken off boot slipped up silently to door others from lurking place saw quietly turn key then walk back evidently unheard by prisoner within passed stair head just before doctor came up to great relief ran into arm of friend unchallenged doctor indeed be too pre occupied to dream that a went to clapperton study nine small head be craning out of door at end of passage watching step say whispered ashby in tone of horror suppose clap think be one of go for eye what go ejaculated cash saw stately figure stand moment at door turn handle next moment reeled back with exclamation of amazement nearly felled to ground by bulky dictionary hurled at head nine lurker fairly embraced one in horror at sight of awful outrage when moment after saw doctor gather together return to charge time closing door behind did not envy unlucky clapperton awkward five minute in store for how two arranged matter one must say a sound of violence issued doctor did not summon one to fetch cane concluded clapperton have offered sufficiently humble apology for mistake hold on now said wally after three minute have passed will try now be only chance classic kid be ready to cut home with a soon a come back so starting at run like one who have come long distance expected to find senior alone dashed unceremoniously into clapperton study of course not appearing to notice distinguished company present cry say clapperton hooray money found rollitt thief ai glad oh doctor beg pardon sir next moment d'arcy ashby fisher minor be descending stair three step at time on way back to mr wakefield a fast a leg must carry with righteous satisfaction of men who have done duty at cost reckon said wally pretty well know about now if doctor will rub in unfortunate clapperton indeed required one to rub in fact that have made mess of thing doctor did not attempt to do merely carried news of finding of money desired clapperton a head of house to make known a widely a possible say nothing now of cruel wrong have be inflicted by hasty suspicion on rollitt that shadow be still on school worst shadow that fellsgarth boy be thief be happily removed wish boy in house to hear of at earliest possible moment doctor went leaving clapperton to gulp down bitter pill a best must why must have job to do have not be first to start suspicion dangle have done that dangle with whom have fought why must not dangle be called upon to put right unluckily dangle be not captain of forder be not a responsible in starting rumour a clapperton in position have be in adopting be more than must bring to to summon house announce news publicly if dangle brinkman have be with still three of together might have brazened out colleague be sulking in own quarter have to be done must be done singlehanded therefore sat down in very happy frame of mind wrote out following curt notice for house board notice head master wish to be known that club money supposed to be missing have be found by treasurer geo clapperton ungracious document copied out three time taking advantage of one being in study for preparation affixed with own hand on notice board at house door on landing there said with sneer of disgust a returned to own room let make most of hour later dormitory bell sounded must hear scuffling of foot on lobby outside clamour of voice a boy hustled one in front of board evidently majority regarded announcement in jocular manner when distant shout of laughter came up from passage below down from landing above be clear that forders did not take matter very much to heart be ridiculous when come to think of soliloquised clapperton that blundering as like fisher major must have brought school into precious mess noise gradually died away a fellow one by one dropped of to bed clapperton waited till be gone before followed a passed notice board glanced at document have lately cost so much pain be still there not a left sentence have be squeezed in between own word signature at bottom of sheet a be fair imitation of back sloped handwriting have appearance of forming part of manifesto clapperton gasped with fury a read amended notice notice head master wish to be known that club money supposed to be missing have be found by treasurer that be beast sneak to have accused rollitt of stealing geo clapperton tore paper from board stamped on in rage then went downstairs to look at notice on school door read precisely like other imitation being perhaps better stayed only to tear down proceeded to other landing where same insult confronted who author might be be free to guess a lay awake that night tossing turning racked brain to devise retribution yet more sensible self told have be leading up to term what have done to make fellow respect much more like have bullied swaggered set against good of school fellow who followed only did so in hope of getting something fun advantage out of agitation did care twopence about clapperton be ready enough to drop a soon a ever suited turn one two thing must do well for anybody respected a for instance football have deliberately shut off from leaving authority to depend only on very quality have least cause to be proud of be easy enough to say that brinkman dangle cut even poorer figure over wretched business than who troubled head about brinkman dangle former have already be snuffed out hopelessly dared not show face dangle a everybody knew have personal grudge against rollitt be unhampered by scruple a to how scored clapperton have always tried to pose a decent sort of fellow with kind of interest in good of school sort of notion about common honour decency ugh be what have come of a lay awake that night sound of laughter round notice board ai glad of junior dinned in ear sometimes infuriating sometimes humiliating in case mockingly reminding that clapperton greatest enemy in fellsgarth be captain of modern side next morning brought news of missing boy vague feeling of anxiety spread through school boy remembered how proud sensitive rollitt have be how dreadful be accusation against suppose have done something desperate have cared little enough for danger when went well must be likely to care more now that school be in league against pointing to a thief hounding out of society sort of dreadful possibility occurred to master boy while feeling of fierce resentment be growing against fellow whose accusation have be cause of mischief dangle a crossed green to class be hooted way brinkman be followed about with derisive cheer cry of look out corder coming clapperton when appeared be silently cut fellow went out of way to avoid chair on side of be left vacant in hall did hear said ramshaw to neighbour at prefect table at dinner time that have begun to drag lake to day grim silence greeted question fellow tried to go on with meal somehow ramshaw have destroyed one appetite nonsense said yorke took food with forget that look a if 'd gone off beaten track somewhere said fullerton doe hawk pike be a likely place a other said yorke whew there be frost on other night one said wish doctor must let go out look for have much better chance of finding than police guide here signal be given to rise one dispersed yorke stayed one of last a went out caught sight of solitary figure walking moodily ahead with hand dug in pocket head down picture of dejection yorke must hardly recognise in back view old rival enemy clapperton yet be few week ago always marched to from house in boisterous company of friend admirer now be left alone flush of something like shame mounted to captain cheek have love for fellow owed little gratitude yet sight of thus solitary cut off from stream stirred did not try in humble way to follow in footstep of one who said love enemy do good to that hate be not opportunity for putting faith of to test of practice quickened pace overtook clapperton modern senior wheeled round half savagely clapperton said captain have be enemy term have thought harshly of have thought harshly of why must be friend what almost growled clapperton be making fool of have tried hating one long enough let try being friend for change stood facing one one serene honest inviting other dejected doubting a eye met fire kindled again in clapperton face cloud swept off brow pulled hand from pocket held out done with yorke be last fellow in fellsgarth expected to call friend just now chapter twenty three voyage of cock house yorke be roused before daybreak next morning by voice at bedside be that yorke voice be mr stratton captain bounded to foot at once what be sir have be found said master news place have be searched where must be likely to be except mountain seems very off chance that have gone up there still be possible have be on once twice before be going there now must care to come too captain gratefully acquiesced for week have be chafing at doctor order that boy must go beyond bound request to be allowed to undertake very expedition have be twice refused already doctor have given exeat if wish to go said mr stratton be to take guide be quite understood may be late in getting back will be glad of company yorke be ready in ten minute thankful at last to be allowed to do something yet secretly doubting if anything must come of forlorn quest apart from rollitt however good did come of to fellsgarth for during long walk master boy got to understand one better than ever before with common ambition for welfare of school common trouble at dissension have split up during present term also discovered common hope for better time ahead discussed sort of plan exchanged confidence about sort of difficulty while felt drawn close to one exchanging ordinary relation of master boy for of friend friend of reader may say that mr stratton must have be very foolish master to give away to boy that yorke must have be very presuming boy to talk so familiarly to master who care what be if fellsgarth be better for morning walk in many way said mr stratton head boy have a much responsibility for good of school a head master always more than assistant master must wreck school in week if chose be in hand to pull together more than of master however much must like to do will do old fellow so turned up lane led round to back of mountain news that mr stratton captain have gone up hawk pike to look for rollitt soon spread through fellsgarth that morning soul of friend junior be seriously stirred by promise will say threat to organise search party up mountain on own account have be lost sight of somewhat in exciting distraction of last twenty four hour now that found ground cut from under foot be very indignant secretly doubt be little relieved to find that have be forestalled in perilous venture of winter ascent of formidable pike have such good cause to remember be mean trick of yorke to chowse out of credit protested now must get glory must get none tell said percy be notion rollitt not gone up mountain at be just dodge of two to get jolly good spree for pooh will get lost will have to go look for most likely then said lickford somebody will have to come look for rollitt be not here to do said fisher minor cast company back on to original subject be notion said wally be got on island in middle of lake like robinson crusoe rather lark said ashby to get up search party go look for there idea took wonderfully to day be founder day whole holiday must certainly go look for rollitt on island preparation disclosed odd conception on part of explorer of serious nature of quest stated object be to rescue lost schoolfellow why therefore did decide to take nine pennyworth of brandy ball

compelled to put up with very small sample of former lickford have be bequeathed bone by senior yesterday to adhered few fragment of once small ham possibly might with careful carving furnish nine small slice be better than nothing must make up for deficiency by double lot of abernethys so trooped off to shop according to own rule establishment be only open between in morning not at on holiday

thing there be water on mountain said ashby plenty not good to drink as argued wally there be that old broken boat house to live in lot of wood to make fire duck to bag fish to catch say expect be having rather lark prospect of sharing in wild sport urged on still faster at lake side new problem arose if rollitt be on island how have got there still more important how be to get there widow wisdom boat have already be laid up for winter few others in summer be generally kept at river mouth for use of boy have be taken back to penchurch only craft available be flat bottomed punt used by fisherman at present moored to stake at river bank be capacious certainly not exactly sort of boat in to get up much pace particularly a sole apparent mode of propulsion be by mean of two very long boat hook one on side detail however presented few obstacle to mind of enterprising explorer punt be in many way adapted for voyage such a proposed to take there be room to walk about in nay who must say boxing glove football might not have scope for within ample line one question be whether boat hook be long enough to touch bottom way from shore to island wally paced one found measured eighteen foot ought to do said be bound not to be deeper than so punt be christened cock house for occasion be loosed from mooring abernethys knuckle bone other store be put on board boat hook by combined effort be got into position party embarked for rescue of rollitt thanks to stream progress at first be satisfactory be delighted to find how easily went wally with one boat book on one side percy with other on other side have comparatively little to do except to prevent hook getting stuck in mud at bottom refusing to come out one watching must have said boy have be born in barge carried long pole to prow plunged in there with mighty splash then shoved away till end of pole came within reach of hand then in perfect step time started to march down own side of boat calling on friend admirer to get out of way then a neared stern prospect of pulling up hook returning forum 'd for punt loomed ahead face grew anxious concerned began to hold on hard yard from end of walk tug frantically to get free sometimes hook came out easily in case fell backwards into arm of friend at other time stuck have to detain progress of boat minute more to get out sometimes escaped continued sticking up out of water while barge floated on happily last tragedy never quite came off although be periodically imminent when however stream opened into lake progress became much le exciting water be little lumpy

hauled out of boat by refractory pole in due time d'arcy lickford unselfishly gave up pole to cottle ashby after reasonable season of struggle peril nobly ceded to ramshaw cash fisher minor waiving claim electing to sit odd man out steer a at end of hour half manful shoving net progress made be yard back into stream of river talent of helmsman be not put to very severe test say be rather slow said wally let have of rollitt particular so while percy with small pair of scissors none of party marvellous to relate have brought knife be carving remnant of ham ashby be counting out nine brandy ball from bag member of party produced one of abernethys fell to with appetite wait on hard honest toil not much of pace yet remarked d'arcy why be going better now have stopped rowing than be before be because wind changed said wally if 'd only got sail must make go why not stick up two pole fasten coat something between for sail suggested percy good idea pole be long enough for nine one of can go through right sleeve other through left will make ripping sail so despite season of year nine voyager divested of coat be industriously threaded by sleeve on pole top coat be spiked by hook below
