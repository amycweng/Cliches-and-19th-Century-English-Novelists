what everybody else did be usually wrong disliked school fellow therefore be not displeased with mr frampton reform disliked mr frampton new master therefore hoped school must resist authority a for what must do must depend on particular antipathy be uppermost when time came curiously enough bolsover by mean disliked scarfe rather respected fellow who have idea of own when have so few a boy a rule must sympathise with dislike of everybody else with one exception found plenty of adherent not few toady forrester be about only boy really did not dislike because forrester did not care twopence whether one liked not be quite fond of scarfe what do think fellow will do said junior after attempting for sixth time to drop ball over goal without success why obey of course said scarfe scornfully

have murdered mother somebody curious discovered that be lineal descendant of judge jeffreys of hanging celebrity senior represented a cross between nero caliban must not forgive for being head classic one thing fellow must appreciate in be temper child in arm if knew way must get rise out of cad jeffreys in dull time be something to be thankful for forrester be perhaps most expert of

practice at kicking jeff may a well join whether play in match not why be going to play asked jeffreys not heeding invitation frampton have right to make do why not be head master besides can get doctor certificate if like ca be not ill then will have to play of course everybody will 'd better come practise with now do know how to play of course do said jeffreys have played at home serene have shot at goal then cad experience of football at home must have be of humble description for attempt at kick now be terrible fiasco missed ball completely losing balance at same time fell heavily to ground bravo cried forrester wish 'd learnt football at home must do to save life slipped said jeffreys rising slowly to foot flushing crimson did said irreverent youth thought be part of play stand out of way though while take shot before however jeffreys must step aside neat for wonder accurate drop kick from forrester sent ball violently against side of unwieldy senior head knocking off hat nearly precipitating second time to earth storm fairly burst now a fleet footed junior darted past other struck out wildly missing blow seized ball gave furious kick in direction of retreating enemy be fine drop kick soared far over head of intended victim straight between goal post undoubted brilliant goal forrester stopped retreat to applaud scarfe scornfully joined awfully good said certainly must play on saturday have nobody can kick like meant to hit forrester said jeffreys panting with effort lip nearly white with excitement must like shot called out young gentleman in question ought to be ashamed of losing temper like said scarfe bitterly must see hit by accident did on purpose said jeffreys savagely nonsense be aiming at goal missed did same thing only aimed at wish have hit growled jeffreys glaring first at scarfe than at forrester finally shambling off ground there be nice amiable lamb said forrester a watched retreating figure be sometimes half ashamed to bait doe get into such tantrum be awfully tempting 'd better keep out of way rest of day said scarfe oh bless will have worked off in hour what do bet get to do latin prose for afternoon forrester knew man afternoon a if nothing have happened junior sat in cad study eating of cad bread jam while cad wrote out junior exercise for chapter two football tragedy two day grace mr frampton have almost reluctantly allowed before putting into execution new rule of compulsory athletics told very much in favour bolsover after first shock grew used to idea even resigned after must be variety thing be precious dull a be a to making rule of be absurd frampton must hardly be serious when talked of doing so on saturday if be fine felt in humour well must see about with condescending resolution

hated dry rot like poison must not rest till have ripped up board rafter harboured ordinary reformer must have be satisfied with week work have already accomplished mr frampton added yet blow at very heart of dry rot before week be out on day before football match bolsover be staggered so to speak struck of heap by announcement that in future school tuck shop must be closed until after dinner hour

bethought of visiting shop of dispelling hideous nightmare by optical demonstration ala shutter be up mother partridge be not at receipt of custom instead written in bold square hand of mr frampton there confronted truculent notice shop will for future be open only before breakfast after dinner brutal gasped farfield a read doe mean to starve a well a drown hard line for poor old mother

be ruined in shop knew if have put question to one of boy who crowded down hungry after bath to breakfast on day of football match must have told that frampton be a great brute a ever that be big shame to make fellow play whether liked not for that must tell be going to play much a hated to avoid row if have pressed further must have confided to that be expected school must beat sixth that rather hoped a must play must get chance at ball before match be over from might gather that bolsover be reluctantly coming round to take interest in event fortune favour brave said mr steele one of assistant to head master at dinner time have conquered before have struck mighty caesar mr frampton smiled be flushed excited two day ago have seemed to be committed to desperate venture now straight path seemed to open before bolsover in enthusiastic imagination be already reformed reinvigorated institution yes steele said a glanced from window watched boy trooping down towards meadow day will be remembered at bolsover little dreamed brave head master how truly prophecy must be fulfilled arrangement have be made to give small boy match of own young gladiator who have secretly wept over

in appointment of ranger of fifth to lead host of school mr freshfield with ardour of old general assisted impartially in advising a to disposition of field on side for benefit of such a might be

where be jeffreys where indeed one have noticed absence till now one two boy darted off to look for before have gone far white apparition appeared floundering across meadow in direction of goal shout of derisive welcome rose a jeffreys arrayed in ill fitting suit of white holland crowned with blue flannel cap came on to scene be be sewing together pillow case to make trouser said one think of chap putting on dress shirt to play football in cried frampton said be to wear oldest togs 'd got said third not sunday best jeffreys a indeed be intended heard facetious remark on strange toilet brow grew heavy come on said scarfe a drew near be fair to other side for not to play must find boot replied cad shortly scowling round perhaps will play forward said farfield if ever know what to do go stand outside flag post for mercy sake let ball alone boo hoo be in such funk cried forrester with mocking laugh thank goodness be playing back come now called mr freshfield impatiently be ready kick off farfield look out school next moment match have begun a might have be expected there be at first great deal more confusion than play bolsover be utterly unused to doing anything together football of game need united action there be great deal of scrimmaging very few kick very few run ball be time invisible other half in touch mr freshfield have time after time to order throw in to be repeated rule kick a off side more ardent player forgot duty of protecting flank rear more timid neglected chance of piling up scrimmage sixth got in way of sixth school often spoiled play of school after quarter of hour so chaos began to resolve side so to speak came down to bearing mr frampton a walked across from small boy match be surprised a well a delighted to notice business like way in best player on side be settling down to work there be farfield flushed dogged leading on forward always on ball there be scarfe light dodgy ready for run neat drop kick from half back there be ranger phipps of fifth backing one up like nisus euryalus there be young forrester merry plucky saving goal more than once by prompt touch down there even be elephantine jeffreys snorting pounding in thick of fray feeling foot under doing clumsy best to fight battle of side game went hard against school despite determined rally gallant sortie young forrester in goal have more than one man share of work scarfe drop from rear of sixth scrimmage flew near still nearer enemy goal once just before half time have what seemed safe chance at critical moment jeffreys ungainly bulk interposed received on chest ball must certainly have carried victory to side clumsy lout roared farfield did tell to stand out of way not go near ball idiot go play back do jeffreys turned on darkly think did on purpose said did go play back repeated farfield go hang jeffreys took long breath departed with scowl to rear half time cried mr freshfield change side be welcome summons side needed little breathing space to gird for final tussle school be elated at having so far eluded actual defeat cheerily rallied opponent a crossed over jeffreys in particular a made moodily to new station came in for jocular greeting thanks awfully cad old man cried one knew 'd give leg up word doe look pleased with said wonder be that way taught to play football at home said young forrester emphasising question with acorn neatly pitched at cad ear jeffreys turned savagely with lifted arm forrester be far beyond enemy reach hand dropped heavily at own side a continued sullen march to sixth goal be ready shouted mr freshfield kick off ranger look out sixth game recommenced briskly school following up advantage of kick off cheered by recent luck made desperate onslaught into enemy territory for while took energy of sixth to repel phipps ranger be irrepressible have not be for steady play of scarfe sixth back formidable pair of desperado might have turned tide of victory by own unaided exertion in defence of senior jeffreys need hardly be said took part stood moodily near one of post still glaring in direction of insulters apparently heedless of fortune of game inaction however be not destined to last long second half game have lasted about quarter of hour school be still stubbornly holding advanced position in proximity of enemy goal when ball suddenly by one of mysterious chance of battle burst clear of scrimmage darted straight to where jeffreys stood pick up run like mad shouted farfield with sudden swoop astonished beholder cad pounced on ball started to run in direction of ill protected goal of school till saw in motion with almost clear field ahead one have have conception how powerfully be built how fast must run school rash sanguine of victory have pressed to front leaving scarcely dozen behind to guard rear three of jeffreys have passed before school be well aware what be doing then shout of consternation arose mingled with frantic cheer of sixth collar have over stop there look out in goal jeffreys be past stopping like cavalry charger who dash on to gun heedless of everything for time being gone mad so bolsover cad with shout behind enemy goal in front saw heard nothing else two men who stepped out at be brushed aside like reed before boat keel with field before only one enemy remained between victory that enemy be young forrester there be something almost terrible in furious career of big boy a bore down on fated goal behind ceased to pursue watched result in breathless suspense even saucy light on forrester face faded a hesitated moment between fear duty collar there shouted school will pas easily said sixth forrester stepped desperately across adversary path resolved to do duty cost what might jeffreys never swerved from course right left be going to charge youngster gasped farfield forrester who have counted on runner trying to pas became suddenly aware that huge form be bearing straight down upon boy be coward for moment stood paralysed that moment be fatal there be crash shout next moment jeffreys be seen staggering to foot carrying ball behind goal one heeded eye be turned to where young forrester lay on back motionless with face a white a death chapter three gone must be difficult to picture horror dismay followed terrible termination to football match described in last chapter for second two one stood where be a if rooted to ground then with exclamation of horror mr freshfield bounded to side of prostrate boy stand back give air cried master a school closed round gazed with look of terror on form of companion lay with one arm above head just a have fallen cap lay yard two off where have tossed before making final charge eye be closed deathly pallor of face be unmoved by even quiver of life be dead gasped farfield mr freshfield who have be hastily loosening forrester collar have rested hand for instant on heart looked up with face almost a white a boy said go for doctor water dozen boy started thankful to do anything before ring must close up again ungainly form of jeffreys still panting from run elbowed way to front a eye fell on form of victim face turned ashy hue who watched saw that be struggling to speak word came stood like one turned suddenly to stone not for long with cry something resembling howl school by sudden simultaneous movement turned upon put up hand instinctively half deprecatingly half in self defence then a eye dropped once more on motionless form over mr freshfield be bending took step forward gasped did not whatever have intended to say be drowned by howl of execration sound of voice seemed to have opened floodgate let loose pent up feeling of onlooker score of boy rushed between victim hustled roughly out of ring murderer cried scarfe a gave first thrust amidst echo of terrible cry cad be driven forth once turned with savage face a though must resist fight way back into ring be only for moment may have be sudden glimpse of marble face on grass may have be terror uplifted hand fell again at side dragged dejectedly to outskirt of crowd there still hovered livid face always turned towards centre drinking in sound marking movement not attempting again to challenge resentment of school fellow by attempting to enter awe struck circle seemed age before help came crowd stood round silent motionless with eye fixed on poor lifeless head rested on mr freshfield knee straining eye for one sign of animation yearning still more for arrival of doctor mr freshfield did not dare to lift form even beyond gently raising head to move in way how anxiously watched a when water arrived softly sponged brow held glass to white lip ala dark lash still drooped over closed eye a moment passed bolsover felt that stood in shadow of death at last there be stir a sound of wheel approached in lane presently figure of doctor accompanied by mr frampton be seen running across meadow a reached outskirt of crowd jeffreys laid hand on doctor arm with appealing gesture did not mean began doctor passed on through path crowd opened for to fallen boy side be moment of terrible suspense a knelt touched boy wrist applied ear to chest then in hurried whisper asked two question of mr freshfield then again bent over inanimate form must tell by look on face a looked up that there be hope for there be life be not dead heard whisper to mr frampton still stood round silent motionless relief be terrible be not dead must deep fringed eye ever open again doctor whispered again to mr frampton mr freshfield two passed hand under prostrate form to lift before must do so doctor who never took eye off boy face held up hand suddenly said better have hurdle pointing to one lay not far off on grass dozen boy darted for dozen more laid coat upon to make bed once more amid terrible suspense saw helpless form raised gently deposited on hurdle sigh of relief escaped when operation be over sad burden supported at corner by two master scarfe farfield began to move slowly towards school slowly keep step above thing avoid jolt said doctor keeping boy hand in own crowd opened to let pas then followed in mournful procession a bearer passed on jeffreys who time have be forgotten who have never once turned face from where forrester lay stepped quickly forward a though to assist in carrying litter sudden movement startling gesture accompanied disconcerted bearer caused for moment to quicken step thus imparting unmistakable shock to precious burden doctor uttered exclamation of vexation ordered halt stand back sir cried angrily waving jeffreys back jolt like may be fatal authority still more potent than of doctor be at hand to prevent recurrence of danger jeffreys be flung out of reach of litter by twenty angry hand hounded out of procession did not attempt to rejoin for moment stood watched a passed slowly on cold sweat stood on brow breath be gasp then turned slowly back to spot where forrester have fallen threw on ground in paroxysm of rage misery be late growing dark a re entered school there be strange weird silence about place contrasted startlingly with usual evening clamour boy be mostly in study collected in whispering group in schoolroom a jeffreys entered one two small boy near door hissed ran away others who met in passage on stair glared at with look of mingled horror aversion must have frozen ordinary fellow jeffreys however did not appear to heed still le to avoid entering sixth form room found most of colleague gathered discussing tragedy of day in dim light of bay window so engrossed be that never noticed entrance be not till after standing minute listening to talk broke in in loud tone be forrester dead sound of voice so harsh unexpected have effect of explosion in midst recoiled from startled half scared then quickly perceiving intruder turned upon with howl time cad did not retreat before held up hand to stop with gesture almost of authority exclaimed will go tell one be dead big form loomed out in twilight head taller than of companion there be something in tone attitude held back will be sorry to hear said scarfe one of first to recover self control with double edge of bitterness in voice that be alive hour ago jeffreys gave gasp held up hand again be there hope for then not with in school murderer exclaimed farfield advancing on cad striking on mouth farfield have counted cost be prepared for furious onslaught felt certain must follow jeffreys seemed scarcely even to be aware of blow kept eye on scarfe to whom have addressed last question said wo believe did mean tell lie

whew what day jonah have have to be sure chapter eight know bank jonah trimble may not have be genius of first water be at least wise enough to know that must not have cake eat discovery of jeffreys villainy be most appetising cake wanted little self denial to keep own counsel about not spoil sport by springing mine until train be laid consideration moreover prevented taking immediate action be that jeffreys be extremely useful at galloway house must not be spared just yet even to gallows in few month time when good name of school have rapidly risen since came upon scene be well established thing might be brought to climax meanwhile jonah trimble must keep eye on man read eugene aram follow up clue jeffreys awoke on following morning with feeling of oppression on mind for little time must not define be not guardian word a have be be not insolence of fellow usher intolerable a be becoming when at last wandering thought came in gave trouble shape found took much more practical form be in debt seven pound to mr frampton never occurred to to wonder whether mr halgrove have be telling truth not to unbusinesslike mind did occur that guardian a trustee responsible for what money once have be liable for debt however much might like to repudiate knew be that mr frampton be owed seven pound that have nothing next to nothing to pay by hard saving during six month have managed to save sovereign of only last week have spent greater part in boot clothing now worldly wealth consisted of four shilling be down early that morning be relieved to find mr trimble be in parlour alone without son good lady be in amiable mood school be getting on something told that be not greatly due either to own exertion influence of jonah therefore being mathematical old lady subtracted jonah from present school staff came to conclusion that jeffreys must have have hand in improvement young man said in reply to assistant greeting have be with six month be comfortable pretty well said jeffreys be very fond of boy always get on comfortably with mathematical dame once more went to work answered jonah hit suppose know jonah young man may not be easily satisfied be gentleman be sure said

short handed what be going to say to be that now have be here six month be not forward young man drink will raise wage give thirty shilling month instead of twenty how will suit be very kind said grateful jeffreys with tremble in voice quite moved old lady heart will be very acceptable very good need not mention to jonah added hurriedly a young gentleman footstep be heard that moment on stair only difference unconscious jeffreys be aware of in conduct of jonah trimble towards be that young gentleman be trifle more hectoring trifle more facetious than before even to little mind of jonah trimble have be revealed that at present must be extremely awkward for galloway house if jeffreys went on strike be good teacher manager boy be devoted to of course when boy go home from school full of praise of teacher parent be pleased too think well of school tell friend what nice place be for boy so on be good advertisement in fact besides with mr trimble so lazy jonah so unattractive must involve great deal of trouble round if jeffreys deserted knew by experience that young fellow of good education did not a rule jump at situation of second usher in galloway house knew also something of horror of prolonged vacancy in staff jonah be rather relieved when jeffreys immediately after school shut up in own room remained there studying for rest of evening proceeding favoured little idea of own be to revisit spot where have tied bootlace evening before see if examination of fatal spot must throw fresh light on investigation accordingly after tea sallied forth with trowel in coat pocket be rather dismal expedition for rained there be cool breeze lane be muddy even in roadway on bank be quagmire still jonah be too full of mystery seriously to mind weather trudged up down lane sharply scrutinising hedge for bootlace for long time perseverance be unrewarded at length however eye detected welcome flutter of bright tag among leaf recognised scene of last night damp sojourn clambered up onto bank regardless of garment commenced anxious scrutiny bank showed sign of mystery even trace of jeffreys visit to night before be obliterated by soaking rain field on other side be equally unsuggestive jonah trampled around in circle on young corn never pistol rusty knife bottle of poison did discover yet have heard villain say distinctly be very place scrambled back rather crestfallen on to bank be getting dark rain came down ceaselessly yet so strong be certainty that here must discover evidence be looking for for half hour plied trowel diligently sometimes when struck on stone root of bramble trembled with anticipation once when groping under hedge hand suddenly encountered dead rat hair literally stood on end began to get nervous uncomfortable night became suddenly dark wind whistled sort of weird tune among tree jonah did not exactly believe in ghost still if there be such thing be just night just place for ghost be looking for to take walk abroad did not like began to wish be safe at home bush round began to rustle noisily gate in field swung to fro with almost human groan fancied must descry wandering light white gleam in darkness vague consciousness of something coming nearer nearer at last with great effort roused from moist seat leaped down from bank into lane instant foot touched road be conscious of low growl next moment found pinned with back to bank by furious dog yell of terror have mingled with wind for couple of minute before became aware of red glow of cigar in front of behind that dim countenance of man whose talk with jeffreys have overheard previous evening oh mr julius howled help call off will be torn to piece pray how come to know name of dog said mr halgrove eh little highwayman please sir be not highwayman be only looking for something on bank oh mr julius dog be not used to be called mr replied mr halgrove oh thought that be name whimpered jonah not daring to stir inch for fear of incurring

little ferret have found that out have feel doubt about said jonah plucking up little confidence feel when where did interesting event take place oh must tell that better than can tell stammered trimble indeed said mr halgrove eyebrow going up ominously in dark of course must that be must never dream of getting into trouble sir mr halgrove took cigar out of mouth stared at speaker 'd wait till be safe away in america sir even then must let name be known know a accomplice mr halgrove put cigar back into mouth changed cane from left hand to right fetch here julius said stepping back into middle of road be in vain wretched jonah howled called for mercy so wo let name be known a accomplice how very kind gave practical proof of gratitude by caning jonah till be tired now good night said mr halgrove when have done thank for pleasant evening dare say mr jeffreys will make up for little deficiency on part if ask ask with compliment to show little game played with one of old school

looked very miserable at rebuke be in wax with jeff said appealingly must do if got to hate jeffreys be not proof against walked home with two young friend beguiling way with cheery talk effectually dispelled cloud passing anger have roused on way back felt impelled to climb for moment on bank at favourite spot amazed to see ground torn up to find trowel lying half bedded in turf at top still more did surprise perplex to find penknife recognised at once a belonging to trimble distinctly recollected having seen in hero hand during school afternoon of preceding day what did mean chapter nine thunderstorm did not add to jonah happiness to see look of evident disgust with first class greeted reappearance in schoolroom pleasant experience yesterday have demoralised settled down listlessly at jonah bidding like voyager who after day in still water put out once more to rough sea teddy especially felt hardship of mighty deep jonah eye transfixed day if spoke if fidgeted if looked about hand

of because of little blot be reduced to ineffable humiliation of writing exercise on slate took big heart of little fellow to bear up against mountain of calamity have not be for occasional glimpse of jeffreys face turned sympathetically in direction courage might have failed school closed still date be unlearnt leg ached with standing hour after hour on narrow form head lifted three foot higher

jeffreys have long since taken book elsewhere only jonah be left to keep watch over prisoner boy made tremendous effort to master date went through like water through sieve must not even keep eye on book when turned towards master desk jonah seemed to be half hidden in mist edged cautiously to end of form nearest wall where at least might get little support be perilous voyage for be two foot away

jeffreys must scarcely tell departed decidedly crestfallen more than half repenting of amiable expedition misgiving be somewhat relieved next morning when freddy teddy put in appearance punctually at school time jonah considered expedient under circumstance not to refer to teddy mutinous conduct on preceding day determination afforded great comfort to young gentleman put down by mysterious process of reasoning to jeffreys good office on behalf jonah however on particular morning felt far from comfortable may have be hot sultry day may have be general oppression of own feeling gave sense of something probably thunderstorm impending class remarked that be le exacting than usual even jeffreys became aware that colleague for once in way be not clock have just struck twelve boy be beginning to look forward to usual break in hour time when schoolroom door suddenly opened disclosed broad figure of mr rosher followed at timid distance by mr trimble jonah face turned pale freddy teddy opened

act of locking door preparatory to journey up to kennedy lodge when sack be suddenly thrown over head from behind next moment found pinned to ground in clutch of two men before be well aware of what have happened foot be tied together arm firmly lashed to side sack be lifted from mouth not long enough to enable to shout for gag be roughly forced between teeth then while one of captor held head other bandaged eye so completely that have not known must not have told whether be mid day midnight thus in almost le time than take to narrate in broad daylight on border of own father estate unfortunate percy be made captive without so much a being able to give alarm to see face of assailant be deposited comfortably on floor of own hut by side oh cruel fate of own machine there left to work out number of problem might occur to during next six hour while custodian having carefully padlocked door retired to respectful distance among tree where must smoke pipe in peace at same time keep eye on approach to young ward dungeon did not take percy many minute to convince that attempt to struggle extricate from bond must be labour thrown away captor be evidently well up to business there be wriggling out of neatly tied bond did onslaught boy made with teeth on gag result in anything disaster loosened at least two of teeth gave during remainder of day considerable pain in of others a to eye rubbed forehead side of head on floor in hope of shifting bandage in vain got over ear a well a eye for pain must scarcely hear sound a afternoon went on sun slanted ray cruelly through little skylight on to spot where lay fly attracted by rare chance swarmed in under door through crack to make merry with defenceless victim have sun be seven time a hot fly venomous deadly must have preferred for must have shortened misery considerably when at last sun got across window left at peace be scarcely in position to appreciate mercy not long after distant overstone chime have sounded four heart about only unfettered portion of leapt to mouth a heard name called in raby voice outside be only heart whom that cheery sound caused to palpitate two watcher in wood above heard prepared to decamp at moment notice must girl display undue curiosity a to content of hut did not be used to seeing padlocked to listen in vain for answer to call percy be evidently abroad probably waiting for up at kennedy lodge so hurried back a soon a have disappeared beyond bridge two men put pipe into pocket if have begun looking for 'd best sheer off corporal be right replied corporal at once whereupon descended from perch having looked carefully up down unlocked dungeon door prisoner be lying so still motionless for instant have misgiving a to whether gag have not be trifle too much for respiration moment examination satisfied boy be alive much to relief sack be once more brought into requisition turned out to be great deal larger than looked for be found quite roomy enough to accommodate whole of person of percy rimbolt who in dignified retreat quitted scene of labour on back of one of captor hut having be once more carefully padlocked party travelled at least mile into depth of lonely wood where at least there be lack of shade seclusion percy be deposited somewhat unceremoniously on ground left in sack with just sufficient aperture in region of nose to allow of respiration for hour more unheeded by custodian except when attempted to move roll over on occasion be sharply reminded of duty to company by unceremonious kick time later may have be hour two only five minute be aware of conversation taking place outside sack risky said one voice more risky not to do said other what use must be if be dead besides how be to carry way all right have way said other surlily then percy be conscious of one uncording mouth of sack uncovering head young feller said gruffer of two voice do want throat cut percy shook head in mild deprecation of such desire do want tongue cut out once more percy disclaimed consuming anxiety in direction then wo move step speak word unless be told do mark that boy nodded did mark thereupon much to relief gag be taken from mouth felt hauled out of ignominious sack drink gasped there go said 'd do clap gag on again poor blindfolded percy must only wave head appealingly must sooner have throat cut than feel that gag back between teeth captor let off once one of untied cord from leg be too cramped to attempt to make use of partial liberty even have be so minded sank down half fainting to ground give drink said one of voice in moment two felt cup of delicious water held to parched lip reviving a if by magic few coarse piece of bread be also thrust between lip swallowed painfully for jaw be stiff aching teeth have almost forgotten cunning however when meal be over felt better must gladly have slept upon for hour two have be allowed be part of captor programme have not relaxed bond to indulge such luxurious craving overstone church have already sounded eleven be due in hour at mountain shed get up step out said one of pulling boy roughly to foot very well said percy to a stumbled forward on cramped limb will have to give leg up if want to go pace where be going to next 'd like to know come stir said man again accompanying word by rough shake percy responded by toppling over on face who knew way to swim against stream ten mile hour be just now unable to walk dozen pace on solid ground best shove in sack again growled other man bare mention of sack startled poor percy to foot if might only have spoken must easily have explained trifling difficulty prevented stepping out a be must do be to struggle forward bravely for few more pace then again fall men seemed to perceive that there be something more than mere playfulness in twice repeated performance solved difficulty by clutching one under arm materially assisting progress by dragging of percy acquaintance must have be greatly shocked have be privileged to witness triumphal midnight progress across moor dragging leg feebly trying to imitate motion of walking looking much more like kneeling head dropped forward on chest shoulder elevated by grip of conductor under pinioned arm eye bandaged a never blind man buff must bind be long weary march to percy be luxury compared with morning among fly on hut floor conductor settled into jog trot light weight of boy did not much impede percy finding motion not difficult on whole soothing dropped off into half doze greatly assisted in passing time at length however became aware of halt hurried consultation between captor be there whistle corporal gave low whistle after second two be answered from hill side be right said other in tone of relief see anything of cart corporal peered round in darkness yes right down there come on then keep eye on jim though be mighty hand at going more than share trust growled corporal then percy felt seized again dragged forward in about five minute halted again whistle be repeated answer came from close at hand time square whispered corporal yes replied new indistinct voice come on jim screwed again said other man can tell by voice there be trusting come on have moved forward dozen step more when corporal suddenly found head enveloped in sack counterpart of own while at same moment other man be borne to ground with great dog fang buried in neckcloth hold called jeffreys to dog a applied energy to subjugation of struggling corporal be easy task jeffreys lad a be be young samson have man at disadvantage for corporal entangled with sack unprepared for sudden onslaught staggered back fell before must struggle to foot jeffreys be on almost throttling be time for polite fighting if jeffreys did not throttle man man a perfectly well knew must do more than throttle so held on like grim death till corporal half smothered by sack half choked by assailant clutch howled for quarter then for first time jeffreys felt decidedly perplexed if let corporal go corporal not being man of honour might turn on make mincemeat of if on other hand called dog off other man to hold corporal while bound captive other man might abuse opportunity in like manner boy be evidently too exhausted to take part in encounter what must do after turning matter over decided that julius be most competent individual to settle business dog be having very easy time with abject villain over whom be mounting guard must well undertake little more than have at present on hand fetch here julius called jeffreys giving corporal additional grip come here fellow along with dog fellow have nothing for to obey in couple of minute be lying across body of corporal while julius stood fiercely over come here boy called jeffreys next to percy let take off cord percy groped way to what be going to do with gasped loose if be man will help tie up brute come on watch there julius why be blindfolded too how frightfully tight be corded have be like since twelve o'clock few moment sufficed to unfasten captive arm clear eye now said jeffreys indicating topmost of julius captive with toe put hand behind back fellow obeyed hurriedly have have quite enough of julius attention already to need more jeffreys percy between lashed first wrist together then elbow tightly to side then secured foot knee in same manner will do let go julius prisoner number be rolled over to make room for number to undergo similar process of pinioning be fortunate that hay cart below of owner jeffreys julius have already taken possession at leisure have be liberally provided with cord supply must have be inadequate to strain put upon at last however corporal friend be a securely tied up a must have done dragged into shed be pitch dark of at first perceived third occupant of tenement in person of fellow conspirator who be lying bound like on floor where for hour at least have be enjoying sweet of solitary meditation now julius said jeffreys when three guest be duly deposited will have to watch here till come back hold tongue of julius will trouble watch good dog stay here now said to boy when found outside what be name percy rimbolt where do live wildtree tower five mile away can be there in hour may a well use cart be meant to drive in direction can walk to will carry percy a one in dream walked short distance leaning on rescuer arm then deposited on soft hay too weary to trouble how got there who new guardian might be dropped off into exhausted sleep from be only aroused by sound of parent voice a cart pulled up at door of wildtree tower chapter thirteen policeman julius wildtree tower have be thrown into state of unmistakable panic when at usual hour of retiring for night percy have not put in appearance

pulled long face midnight came still tidings appleby came up to house for lantern have nothing to report beyond fact that search so far have be unsuccessful minute dragged on for unhappy watcher be harder far for to sit there in hall listening to unsympathetic tick of clock starting at sound on gravel without than be for father to tramp through wood trace footstep along river bank at last clock struck two scarcely have chime ceased when walker put up finger exclaimed hist moment of terrible silence ensued then on quickened hearing there came distant rumble of wheel almost at same instant footstep came tearing up gravel drive be appleby who rushed into midst of group assembled on doorstep all right be found gasped lad be alive cried mother on cart exclaimed panting appleby mr rimbolt

only have mr rimbolt cool percy to deal with must have resigned to ordeal threat of being thanked by lady quite disconcerted be be afraid be not very tidy stammered 'd really rather if object go on besides julius mr rimbolt laughed good humouredly julius be not shy want breakfast rest after night work julius julius must not deny that be very ready for jeffreys gave up with much sinking of heart awaited arrival at wildtree tower to infinite relief lady be not visible mr rimbolt be reported be confined to bed by effect of recent agitation miss atherton be out master percy be still fast asleep broke fall considerably to find left still to gentlemanly unembarrassing attention of host julius be led with honour to kitchen there to be regaled in baronial fashion be well for moral digestion be not daily festival jeffreys having seen comfortably curled up on mat returned to library host be pacing up down floor evidently little nervous jeffreys instinctively felt that ordeal be upon mr rimbolt however began by little fencing recollect taking very pleasant tour through district with two college friend when be at oxford see here be map have with at time route marked be rather rackety party boasted that must go in straight line from ambleside to sea stick at nothing here be line see that straight line took over one two place must care to try now oxford men said in day have neck to break be university man jeffreys glanced up half doubtful whether question be asked in seriousness ironically sir unfortunately not well said mr rimbolt have advantage disadvantage must dare say value for serious work of life may sometimes be unsettling be fair to ask what profession be mr jeffreys none at just now be till lately usher in private school replied jeffreys wincing mr rimbolt observed wince delicately steered away from topic ah must be monotonous calling with love of book literary taste must find specially irksome must forgive if take interest in affair mr jeffreys may ask if have engagement in prospect none at said jeffreys reason for asking be selfish one quite have be suggested by interest take in library have be inquiring for month two for one who will assist a private librarian fact be mr jeffreys continued mr rimbolt noticing look of surprised pleasure in listener face with time so much occupied in parliamentary other duty find quite impossible to attend to care of book a must wish made up mind most reluctantly time ago must have to entrust duty to one else for be always pride that knew where book have be to be found collection have grown beyond control want regular custodian look here said opening folding door at end of room jeffreys saw room larger than one be in lined with shelf crowded on floor with heap of book in most admired disorder be use said mr rimbolt half pathetically cherished hope a long a be able of reducing chaos to order putting away one of treasure for be common volume in place of own day grows worse have fought against put off because must find one who must undertake a much for love of work a for small salary to private librarian must be entitled now see selfish reason have for mentioning matter to mr jeffreys offer nothing to jump at for will need sheer hard work lot of drudgery to overtake arrears of work after doubt if keeping up of library will leave much leisure must incur little responsibility either for if handed care of library to must hold responsible for volume in must expect to know something of inside of book a well a outside may think salary of l year hardly adequate to amount of work responsibility if so must not press further for be sum have arranged to give can not see way to offering more must include residence here board of course jeffreys felt almost dazzled by prospect thus deprecatingly unfolded by mr rimbolt have offer be made in le delicate way have savoured of charity to outcast reward to benefactor must have rejected however tempting a be seemed like opening of one of gate of providence before work promised be what of others coveted salary with casually thrown in addition of board lodging seemed like affluence employer be gentleman opportunity of study improvement be such a fall to lot of few above in hard work among quiet friendly bookshelf must find refuge from bad name perhaps be able to establish for what have hitherto striven for in vain character be most grateful sir said if really think must suit think must said mr rimbolt in tone gratified jeffreys far more than if have launched out into idle flattery compliment so be settled jeffreys must scarcely believe what have happened to when hour later mr rimbolt being called away on business found taking preliminary survey of new preserve preparing seriously for duty a private librarian at wildtree tower chapter fourteen snob snub jeffreys be not long in finding out best worst of new lot at wildtree tower to ordinary thick skinned fellow with love of book partiality for boy daily life during six month followed introduction under mr rimbolt roof might have seemed almost enviable whole of morning be devoted to duty of library under conscientious management gradually assumed order of model collection librarian be born not made jeffreys seemed unexpectedly by accident to have dropped into one niche in life for be best suited mr rimbolt be delighted to see treasure gradually emerging from chaos of overcrowded lumber room into serene dignified atmosphere of library of well arranged well tended volume allowed librarian carte blanche with regard to shelf binding agreed to knock third room into two already constituted library to line with bookcase even went length of supporting clever bookbinder at overstone for several month with work on own volume greatest sacrifice of forebore craze of buying right left for same space of time until arrears of work must be overtaken clear idea must be formed of what already have what wanted jeffreys revelled in work when discovered that have to deal with one of most valuable private collection in country pride sense of responsibility advanced step by step occupied leisure hour in study of bibliography read book on old printer work spent hour with bookbinder printer at overstone studying mechanism of book even studied architecture in connexion with ventilation lighting of library began to teach german in order to be able to master store of book lore buried in rugged language then be congenial delightful work be left own master in have pride of seeing work growing under hand when one day mr rimbolt arrived from london with great man in world of old book for express purpose of exhibiting to treasure called honest flush to librarian face to hear visitor say upon word rimbolt know whether to congratulate most on book way in be kept librarian be genius if life must have be spent in shelter of library jeffreys must have have little to complain of be not out of needed great discernment to perceive that have anything friend in mr rimbolt be not openly hostile be not worth while to wage war on poor domestic seemed for to resent presence in house to be possessed of sort of nervous desire to lose opportunity of putting down after about week during time jeffreys have not apparently taken hint a to arranging of person in respectful raiment walker waited upon librarian in chamber with brown paper parcel lady compliment said with grin be getting to measure newcomer by mistress standard hope will suit be left off suit of mr rimbolt clothes with following polite note a mr jeffreys doe not appear disposed to accept mr rimbolt advice to provide with clothes suitable for post now occupies at wildtree tower must request to accept accompanying parcel with wish that may not again have occasion to refer to so unpleasant subject jeffreys flushed scarlet a read elegant effusion greatly to walker astonishment crushed letter up into ball flung out of window take away shouted pointing to parcel mistress sent for take away do hear shouted jeffreys starting up with face so terrible that walker turned pale evacuated room with offending parcel a quickly a possible jeffreys outburst of temper quickly evaporated indeed gave place to much more prolonged fit of shame be like conquering evil in nature to be thus thrown off balance by trifle a happened have ordered suit of clothes in overstone day back be expecting very afternoon mr rimbolt on day after engagement have a delicately a possible offered quarter salary in advance jeffreys guessing source inspired offer have flatly refused mr rimbolt gentlemanly urging however consciousness that present clothes be disreputable a well a consideration induced to accept month stipend on strength of have visited overstone tailor before doing so have discharged mind of still more important duty sense of debt still due to bolsover have hung round neck night day be not so much on mr frampton account came gradually to hate thought of bolsover idea of being defaulter to place worried beyond measure seemed like insult to memory of poor young forrester to owe money to place have witnessed that terrible tragedy hope of washing hand once for of school association be one faint gleam of comfort have in looking back on event of last year be therefore with feeling of almost fierce relief that procured post office order for balance of debt on very afternoon of receiving money enclosing with merely name added for wanted receipt felt that even mr frampton letter must now no longer be of service to posted with own hand hoped that be done with bolsover for ever after with very different emotion visited tailor clothes arrived on same afternoon have witnessed summary rejection of mr rimbolt gift lady from whom walker have considered prudent to keep back of particular of interview with librarian merely reporting that mr jeffreys be much obliged did not require thing took to herself credit of improved appearance when evening mr rimbolt brought in from library to have coffee in drawing room jeffreys aware that be undergoing inspection felt very shy awkward must not quite do away with improvement conceal that despite ugly face ungainly figure there be something of gentleman about mr rimbolt by mean approved of husband bringing librarian into drawing room considered slight to herself dangerous to percy raby to have person added to family circle most conscientiously made point of lessening that danger on occasion by reminding of place rendering temporary visit to exalted latitude a uncomfortable a possible mr rimbolt good easy going gentleman shrugged shoulder felt powerless to interfere when after week two librarian generally pleaded pressing work a excuse for not going in to coffee understood quite well did not urge invitation percy however have very different way of comporting what liked liked what did not like most conveniently ignored be anything model son a reader have discovered loved parent indeed sadly lacked that great ornament of youth dutiful spirit be spoiled got own way in everything ruled wildtree tower in fact if mother desired to do what did not like be for time being deaf did not hear if be overtaken in fault changed subject talked cheerily about something else if one of great dodge came to ridiculous end promptly screened from observation by new one from day of kidnapping adventure be sworn ally of jeffreys mattered nothing to who else snubbed new librarian who else made life uncomfortable percy liked thought much of established claim on afternoon in spite of mr rimbolt protest mr rimbolt arrangement even jeffreys refusal to quit work at bidding counted for nothing represented to mother that jeffreys be necessary to safety abroad to father that jeffreys must be knocked up if did not take regular daily exercise skilfully hinted that jeffreys read aeschylus with sometimes once a crowning argument produced complete dodge perfected mechanically clever asserted jeff made stick to till 'd done mr rimbolt did not conceal satisfaction with noticed good influence on boy of new friend readily fell in with arrangement that jeffreys ' afternoon must be placed at own meant percy disposal a for mr rimbolt groaned to think of boy consorting with quondam tramp yet consoled with knowledge that percy have now one who must look after keep out of danger even with vulgar right arm jeffreys accepted new responsibility cheerfully even eagerly sometimes came over with shock must people say if knew about young forrester yet be not care of boy given to now a mean if not of winning back good name at least of atoning in measure by good must try to do patience with must bear with exacting way for what be past be in spirit accepted trust felt happy in a summer passed on wildtree moor around be famous for game became full of visitor invasion did not disturb jeffreys for felt that must be able to retire into private life avoid company numbered few boy of percy age so that even that young gentleman must not be likely to require service for while therefore threw wholly into work with exception of hour afternoon when took turn on hill side showed to one on one of occasion a be strolling through park towards moor encountered miss atherton very much laden with camp stool basket parasol waterproof shy a be jeffreys must hardly pas without offering to relieve her of part of burden may carry of thing said have scarcely exchanged word with raby since day of first arrival though secretly numbered among friend have uncomfortable suspicion that looked down on made effort to be kind to thanks very much said really glad to get rid of of burden if must mind taking chair be afraid be going other way said jeffreys taking chair be going nowhere in particular may not take waterproof basket too basket be far too precious said raby smiling have grape in if will take horrid waterproof there be not much use for waterproof beautiful weather said jeffreys beginning to walk beside then suddenly recollecting with vision of mr rimbolt before mind fell back said awkwardly perhaps have better must not detain miss atherton saw through at once laughed propose to follow with thing a if be eastern princess perhaps have better carry if be afraid of be not afraid of said jeffreys be afraid of auntie so be hope will meet be saying about weather mr jeffreys jeffreys glanced in alarm at audacious companion have nothing for after challenge to walk with brave consequence there be something in half mutinous half confiding manner rather interested made risk be now running rather exhilarating percy seems to have forsaken said after pause since friend came suppose be sure to be blowing brain out something of sort on moor percy be fine fellow certainly have brain to blow observed jeffreys solemnly raby laughed be quite reformed character since came said be jealous of why oh cut now have used about once week to offer to show what be doing now only offer once month then always think better of thing be to get to work at one thing at time said jeffreys to whom percy be always interesting study a soon a have learned that art will do great thing think percy must make fine soldier said raby with enthusiasm quite captivated companion be so brave honest determined be yes clever too of course father always say man need be clever to be good soldier say clever soldier be least valuable be father soldier be be be in afghanistan now in middle of fighting yes said raby with shade across bright face be terrible be half dread time see letter newspaper mr jeffreys added girl stopping short in walk father be best bravest man that ever lived know be said jeffreys beginning to wonder whether of father good quality be not hereditary raby looked up curiously then laughed judge of by seeing how heroic be braving aunt wrath oh dear do hope meet must be such waste of courage if doe have benefited by courage said jeffreys quite staggered at own gallantry expect be awfully dull in old library said girl must hear how uncle praise behind back poor auntie at moment turned corner of shrubbery leading up to house found suddenly face to face with mr rimbolt with gentleman two three of lady guest jeffreys flushed up a guiltily a if have be detected in highway robbery absolutely forgot to salute even raby who be not at sure that aunt have not overheard last word be taken aback looked confused mr rimbolt bridled up like cat going into action took in situation at glance drew own inference raby dear said come with colonel brotherton wish to see rodnet force be going there oh mr jeffreys added turning frigidly upon already laden librarian when have carried miss atherton thing into house be good enough to go to kennedy tell to meet at upper fall will find letter on hall table to be posted by way colonel brotherton if have telegram want to send off librarian will go with be pity must have walk to miscellaneous order jeffreys bowed solemnly did not fail to exhibit clumsiness by dropping raby waterproof in belated effort to raise hat mr rimbolt must hardly have be appeased have not done so be probably in final endeavour to show off a departed that added raby give mr jeffreys basket to take in can not carry that up to fall oh aunt have told mr jeffreys ca trust with have grape in did mr jeffreys said appealing gaily to with smile seemed to make man of once more will undertake not to eat said with twitch of mouth receiving precious basket after that sacrificed even afternoon constitutional took to life of hermit until wildtree tower must be rid of visitor even so must not be quite safe percy occasionally hunted out demanded company with few choice spirit on hare brained expedition jeffreys did not object to percy hare brained expedition choice spirit sometimes discomposed called jeffy treated like favoured domestic animal recognised a sort of custodian of percy on account showed off before demonstrated to percy that be custodian of theirs freely discussed ugliness poverty within earshot patronised without stint made display of own affluence in presence when once twice put down foot interdicted illegal proceeding blustered rudely advised percy to get cad dismissed be like of old bolsover day back again only with difference now steeled to endure patiently for young forrester sake disappointed to see percy led away by company sometimes lift heel against yet suited humour to think be only right part of penance must be so percy revolt to do youth justice be short lived speedily repented of a soon a friend be gone returned to jeffreys with old allegiance showed remorse by forgetting about recent conduct perhaps most trying incident in that trying time to jeffreys be what occurred on last day of brothertons visit colonel family have be so busy seeing natural beauty of wildtree till visit be drawing to end found have scarcely done justice to beautiful house what contained consequently last evening be spent in visit en masse to library where jeffreys be duly summoned to assist mr rimbolt in exhibiting treasure contained a usual when lady of house be of party librarian went through work awkwardly answered question in confused manner contrived to knock over one two book in endeavour to reach down others be conscious that of company be including among curiosity of place that mr rimbolt be disappointed with result of exhibition struggled hard to pull together in measure succeeded before visit be over thanks chiefly to mr rimbolt temporary absence from library lady returned to announce coffee be ready in drawing room jeffreys with sigh of relief witnessed general movement towards door be standing rather dismally near table counting second till must be left alone when mr brotherton advanced to with outstretched hand imagining be about to wish good evening in more friendly manner than have expected advanced own hand when to horror dismay felt half crown dropped into with half whispered remark be much obliged to be too staggered to do anything drop jaw stare at coin until last of party have filed from room not even observing look of droll sympathy raby last to depart darted at left to one of now rare fit of temper broke over stormed out of place up into room where after flinging coin into grate paced up down floor like infuriated animal then by sudden impulse picked coin up opening toolbox kept in room took from hammer bradawl two three vicious blow sufficed to make hole in centre of queen countenance then with brass headed nail pinned miscreant piece of silver to wall above mantelpiece sat looking at till storm be over be week two before quite recovered from shock settled down again to ordinary routine of life at wildtree tower a afternoon became shorter out of door occupation in consequence became limited found percy unexpectedly amenable to quiet course of study greatly improved tone of versatile young gentleman mind percy still resolutely set face against return to school offered encouragement to perplexed parent in various scheme for advancement of education consequently be fain to be thankful until light dawned on question that education be not being wholly neglected mr rimbolt in particular recognised that under jeffreys influence tuition boy be improving in more way than one autumn passed uneventfully mr rimbolt have occasion once twice to go up to london on occasion jeffreys be reminded that be not on bed of rose at wildtree that half crown over mantelpiece helped wonderfully raby continued to regard from distance with friendly eye now then alarmed by challenging to daring act of mutiny be sure to end in confusion for always seemed to to have compensation in fellow feeling established between poor librarian dependent kept under niece

since jeffreys have worn skate found that five minute be sufficient to render at home on ice eschewed figure devoted entirely to straightforward skating a happened be that percy must accomplish indeed that aspired too therefore happened naturally that scarfe raby who cultivated eccentricity of skating be left to own device while jeffreys accompanied of course by julius kept pace with young hero for

halgrove remained bachelor what became of fancy made mess of poor fellow went in for finance be too much for not that lost money became little too smart dropped hundred two of mine good deal more of rimbolt must spare last heard of be about twelve year ago have partner called jeffreys stupid honest sort of fellow who believed in have newspaper sent with account of inquest on poor jeffreys who have gone out of mind after heavy loss there be special reason to connect halgrove with loss except jeffreys must never have dreamed of speculating if have be led on be only fair to halgrove to say that after event offered to take charge of jeffreys boy at time eight year old that show there be good in unless suggested captain forrester there be money along with boy well dare say if be alive still rimbolt will know something of so may come across yet said major there conversation ended major atherton prophecy of brush with enemy be not long in being fulfilled early next day expeditionary force be ordered forward cavalry regiment in two friend be officer being sent ahead to reconnoitre clear pass march lay for distance along rocky valley almost desolate of habitation at part so cumbered with rock stone a to be scarcely passable by horse still le by artillery struggled forward in front of main body rock on right bank towered to vast height breaking here there into gorge admitted mountain stream down into river below le frequently falling back to make way for wild saddle back pas into plain above along such course step be perilous for enemy have already be reported a hovering at back of ugly rock might show teeth at moment for hour two however march continued uninterrupted few scattered afghan who have appeared for moment on height above have fallen back after exchanging shot with attempt at serious resistance main body have be halted in valley awaiting return of scout horse have be unharnessed from gun officer be snatching hurried meal when captain forrester at head of few trooper scampered into line news instantly spread that enemy have be seen ahead be even then being chased by cavalry up one of defile to right instantly without even waiting for word of command man be in place ready to go on gun with captain forrester troop a escort dashed forward to hold defile while main body divided into two division one to follow gun other to reach plain above by nearer pas started forward into action cavalry meanwhile with major atherton at head be already engaged in hot scrimmage following usual tactic afghan after exchanging shot at entrance of pas have turned tail dashed through defile with english at heel then suddenly turning a reached plain beyond faced round on pursuer not yet clear of rocky gorge in present instance however when within about hundred yard of head of column wheeled round again once more bolted into open stern chase ensued over rough broken ground enemy now then making show of halting a often giving way tempting cavalry farther out into plain afghan numbered only about two hundred horseman be quite evident from tactic that have much larger body in reserve major atherton be decidedly perplexed a to what must do for if pursued too far might be cut off from own men if on other hand made dash rode down before must get clear might cut off from main body so clip enemy wing enemy settled question for just a be looking round for first sign of forrester gun in pas plain suddenly swarmed with afghan from quarter bore down on horse foot even gun seeming almost to spring like teeth of cadmus from earth be time for hesitation doubt retreat be out of question equally hopeless be to warn troop who be coming up there be nothing for to stand at bay till main body came up then if be left to do fight way out join force major therefore brought men to corner of rock where on two side at rate attack must be difficult there ordering to dismount form square stood grimly cruel half hour followed man after man of little band went down before dropping fire of enemy have gun be able to command position must have fallen by ten score major atherton in middle of square have horse shot under before five minute be past ala there be lack of empty saddle to supply loss for before quarter of hour have gone by out of dozen officer scarcely half remained still stood waiting for first boom of gun at head of pas often tempted to break away from post die fighting for of soldier duty that of standing still under fire be hardest captain forrester dashing up defile at head of artillery have be prepared to find lively skirmish in progress between own comrade handful of afghan who be luring on when on emerging on to plain found gun more than half surrounded by enemy sign anywhere of atherton felt that brush be likely to be very stiff one afghan have set heart on gun be evident by wild triumphant yell with charged down on forrester have barely time to order halt swing foremost gun into action when pell mell scrimmage be going on in very midst of gunner first shot fired wildly did little execution warned atherton that time be come signalled to troop still toiling up pas what to expect when got through fight round gun be most desperate of day afghan knew that to capture a stood meant certain annihilation of british troop a defiled into plain forrester knew too unlike atherton have protected side enemy be round little troop at command be barely able to cover one side of square gunner obliged to fight hand to hand where stood be powerless to advance step moment be golden already distant bugle note announced that atherton horse have broken loose be somewhere within reach probably cutting way through gun within few minute head of column ascending defile must also come upon scene hold gun till then might yet be safe so decided captain forrester a with cheery smile on handsome face shouted to men to hold out fought like lion beside foremost gun afghan baffled by stubborn resistance aware of danger of delay hurled upon devoted little bond with fury before nothing must stand man after man dropped across gun still forrester shouted to men swung sabre be time for counting head hardly knew whether when shouted thirty twenty only ten shouted back knew be enemy have not got gun yet be sufficient bugle five minute more might still laugh at foe bugle note came from atherton men who at first sound of gun have vaulted with cheer to horse dashed towards sound many brave comrade left behind many more dropped right left a cut way forward atherton at head peered eagerly through dust smoke must see be surging mass of human being in midst of be impossible to discern anything flash of sabre at one spot few british helmet among turban of enemy be enough for major atherton towards spot waved on men ordered bugler to sound rousing signal bugler obeyed fell at major side before note have well ceased struggle round gun increased blackened one after british helmet went down wild shout of afghan rose triumphantly above at length atherton saw tall figure bareheaded black with smoke spring upon gun carriage with butt end of carbine fell two three of enemy who scrambled up to dislodge atherton knew that form among thousand knew too that forrester be making last stand cheer men come on cried to men rising in stirrup leading shout head of column just then emerging from gorge heard that shout answered with bugle flourish a fixed bayonet rushed forward to charge at same moment cheer boom of gun on left proclaimed that other half of column have at moment reached plain be also bearing down on enemy flank atherton saw heeded nothing that tall heroic figure on carriage at first sound of trooper shout forrester have turned head smiling raised carbine aloft a though to wave answer to cheer so stood for moment then reeled fell back upon gun have saved chapter seventeen official report scarfe on return of skating party to wildtree found hero of hour whether risk ran in rescuing old schoolfellow from icy bath have be great small have resulted in saving jeffreys ' life be quite sufficient to make hero of percy easily impressed by daring of one else quite overlooking own share in rescue be loud in praise how jolly proud must feel said know must if 'd saved fellow life be never luck lent hand said scarfe with complacency of one who can afford to be modest to do scarfe justice until heard credited with lion share of rescue have be little doubtful in own mind a to how much of might justly claim oh said lot did might a well say raby lent hand by lending jeff shawl be cause of said raby forget dear old julius be sure lent hand dog be rather in way than otherwise said scarfe dog always be on ice jeffreys a walked silently beside must afford to smile at last remark in other respect found little cause for smiling be not yet purified being even peril have be in have not cast out fire of pride temper that lurked within now stung with unspeakable misery to find that be supposed to owe life to one whom so thoroughly mistrusted dreaded a scarfe persuaded that be delusion that must easily have extricated without anybody aid that of faithful julius that scarfe have run absolutely risk in crawling out to on ladder that in short owed nothing if indeed did not owe resentment for allowing to be credited with service have right to claim ungrateful unreasonable will say certainly not betokening proper spirit in one so recently in great danger jeffreys a walked moodily along be in grateful reasonable mood did feel chastened in spirit that being so be too honest to pretend to be what be not to one le interested there be something amusing in manner in scarfe took new unexpected glory at first seemed to regard doubtfully combated by one two modest protestation then becoming more used to idea pleased to talk little about adventure encourage others to recall scene after that seemed natural to to be little languid done up by exertion a hero to establish claim on raby admiration finally being quite convinced be hero of first water regarded jeffreys with condescension felt little surprise that must remain silent apparently disdainful a raby be beforehand with in blaming wind be taken out of mr rimbolt sail in quarter even have be disposed to let out in direction be so much more convenient natural to blame jeffreys that good lady be never in moment doubt upon subject how excessively careless of said very one of party too whom expected to keep out of danger be mercy one of be not drowned be mercy be drowned said percy so must have be if have be for scarfe be very noble thing of mr scarfe said mr rimbolt be sure louisa dear must be proud of boy jolly well deserves royal humane medal mean to write get one be young duffer said hero by mean displeased at threat must laugh at notion must if did give one 'd make laugh on wrong side of face know that replied boy know auntie be broke ice said raby mr jeffreys did not come to part till heard crack be ridiculously foolish part of might have known that ought to keep off when heard crack sensible person must perhaps said raby colouring imagined be in danger be foolish child raby to talk such nonsense must be thankful be not who fell in hope mr scarfe added that mr jeffreys be grateful to for heroic service to there be nothing to be grateful for said scarfe in off hand way indeed be afraid jeffreys be rather offended with for what have done than otherwise must not be so base boy said mother when owes life after said scarfe with interesting resignation really doe not matter know be if be to happen over again must do just same thing with noble sentiment hero be borne off to room where hot bath warm clothing rousing fire steaming cordial somewhat consoled for self sacrificing exertion after dinner mr rimbolt must not resist gratification of seeing done to guest by object of devotion project be more easy of accomplishment a mr rimbolt be from home on particular evening jeffreys just beginning to recover by aid of little hard work be petrified by walker announcement that mistress desired that mr jeffreys must step into drawing room good breeding be sorely taxed to find excuse be indisposed certainly if must work in library must bow scrape in drawing room mr rimbolt too be away to insult lady in absence seemed cowardly mean will come presently said to walker nerved desperately for ordeal for knew what be coming be resolved on part must play ought to feel knew exactly what did feel be determined must not be hypocrite enough to pretend anything more whereupon walked defiantly forth opened drawing room door time without knocking mr jeffreys said mr rimbolt feeling that present be occasion worked up accordingly have sent for a have doubt will wish to express to mr feeling entertain with regard to son brave conduct on ice to day hear hear ma cried irreverent percy with mock heroic applause beg leave to second percy be silent sir louisa dear be mr jeffreys whose life son saved mr scarfe put up glass inclined head languidly in response to jeffreys stiff bow awkward silence ensued so awkward that percy began to whistle mr rimbolt having made wrong start have not tact to mend matter mr scarfe must be interested to hear mr jeffreys said after minute two impression of accident only impression have said jeffreys solemnly too be worked up master of nervousness be that water be very cold percy greeted with boisterous laugh mother instantly rebuked surely mr jeffreys said severely be hardly occasion for joke be joke replied with dismal emphasis again percy enjoyed sport must rather think be by look of when be fished out said be a blue a salmon percy cease vulgar talk in room please said mr rimbolt whose equanimity be beginning to evaporate mr jeffreys a be not likely to be amused by levity excuse madam be quite serious said jeffreys on whom apparent jocularity of last remark have suddenly dawned have intention of being rude treating question a joke then said mr rimbolt slightly appeased in prospect of gaining object when tell mr scarfe be kind enough to desire to hear about accident from own lip perhaps good manner will permit to tell about get upon chair give speech jeff said irrepressible percy be what ma want jeffreys proceeded to give version of affair distributing credit of rescue in order in considered to be due greatly disappointing mr rimbolt guest by evident blindness to heroism of scarfe acknowledged warmly percy readiness to come to help promptitude in going for ladder did full justice to julius share in affair a to scarfe part stated just what have happened without emotion without effusiveness despised for feeling so chilly on subject must have be glad for mr scarfe sake have felt more warmly obligation to son spoke a felt have have narrow escape from watery grave said mr scarfe anxious to sum up in hero favour son be sure be thankful to have be mean of saving life jeffreys bowed be glad escaped falling in said have thought of be sure said mr rimbolt severely claim thanks beyond of good conscience be going to get royal humane medal jeff added percy lot of fellow get for good deal le hope may get one said jeffreys julius must have one too thank be must be extracted from graceless young man unsatisfactory interview be shortly afterwards terminated by mr rimbolt requesting to go tell walker to bring more coal for fire conduct be freely discussed when be gone mr rimbolt looked upon a slight put upon herself be proportionately wrathful mr scarfe more amiable imagined that be useless to look for gratitude among person of jeffreys class in life scarfe said that from what knew of jeffreys must have be surprised have shown possessed of good feeling percy considerably puzzled suggested that be chawed up with ducking raby still more perplexed said nothing hardly knew what to think next day a scarfe be smoking in park jeffreys overtook night rest have good deal softened librarian spirit be ashamed of for not having done rescuer common justice have followed now to tell a much scarfe said will have considered be ungrateful yesterday be just what expected must be be sorry said jeffreys now beginning to feel have better far have said nothing yet resolved now have begun to go through with wish to thank now scarfe laughed be who must be grateful for condescension said sneeringly so disinterested too what do mean how must be otherwise have short memory cad jeffreys possibly have forgotten little event happened at bolsover have not forgotten dare say have not thought worth while to mention to employer mr rimbolt have not mentioned quite so be what mean when say be disinterested in to come make friend with be false said jeffreys glowing want expect that kind again at same time be not particularly anxious that people here must hear tragical history of young forrester for heaven sake be silent scarfe said jeffreys to whom mention of name after so many month came like blow can not bear scarfe laughed apparently not want to say be that believe le in gratitude than in fear can spare trouble of keeping up farce be not afraid of said jeffreys drawing up of own conscience be of memory of poor young forrester hold tongue have wish to hear friend name on lip jeffreys turned to go look here said scarfe calling back want to say one word be sufficiently interested in percy rimbolt to dislike influence use upon influence upon young boy be not to be trusted warn to let percy alone be doing no good a be be that want to say said jeffreys have own reason for choosing that cease to offend miss atherton by attention be fit companion for jeffreys turned on heel did not hear end of sentence marvelled at that have not struck fellow contemptuously to ground absolutely smiled in midst of misery at idea of scarfe taking upon moral upbringing of percy protector ship of raby in midst of reflection became aware of presence of raby in walk in front of rencontre be unexpected on side promised to be embarrassing for jeffreys raby however came to rescue mr jeffreys said holding out hand do hope be none worse for yesterday be greatly afraid must catch cold took kindest possible way of preventing said jeffreys never enjoyed meal a much a one walker brought yesterday thank kind sender raby blushed be shame one else thought of mr jeffreys be thanking when be who ought to thank for risking life for be new version of story said jeffreys be somebody else who risked life for know despise for appearing so churlish about be very sorry indeed for in drawing room last night deserved sympathy fancied might have gushed little when saw how much auntie heart mr scarfe be set on must not have hurt can not gush miss atherton can value kindness to do raby smiled one of pleasantest smile wish have honesty mr jeffreys be always pretending to be something here be not get sick of be man why be honesty confined to male sex no suppose can be honest too if be man must go be of use somewhere be good to anybody here jeffreys coloured up furiously looked a if must run from spot then apparently thinking better of looked down at said excuse be walked on little in silence then raby said be so glad mr jeffreys managed percy so well about smoking yesterday how well took of course be gentleman fine fellow forgets how much older mr scarfe be than imago be fine thing to do others do think be such pity must waste so much time a doe now in billiard room over fire think be bad for do day on ice yesterday made new man of do try to coax out mr jeffreys always do good may be able to pull up now before becomes idler promise will do what can ought to be brother not cousin said raby feel so jealous on account be fortunate may say so in cousin here be mr rimbolt mr rimbolt have paper in hand looked rather anxious raby with daughter instinct rushed to uncle have news from war be anything wrong nothing wrong said uncle reassuringly brought paper to see report that there have be encounter with afghan near kandahar with complete success on british side comparatively trifling loss particular be expected almost immediately telegraphed to town to get earliest possible detail meanwhile raby alarm unduly wo uncle where exactly be battle will see name mentioned in telegram jeffreys can show exact spot in atlas be looking at other evening jeffreys thankfully accepted task raby spent hour over map talking of absent soldier trying one to conceal other to allay anxiety incomplete telegram have aroused at end of hour scarfe walked into library face darkened a saw two who sat there miss atherton said looking not at at jeffreys have forgotten be to have ride morning be so sorry mr scarfe have headache feel a if must ride to day will excuse wo oh certainly replied scarfe think turn in park will do good may have pleasure of escorting raby said thank be very sorry to disappoint one have valid excuse against walk miss atherton said scarfe when have gone distance chatting on indifferent topic be anxious just to say word to not in own interest at own will forgive if do what be said raby mystified wish to put on guard against jeffreys who see presumes on position here to annoy may not perhaps know miss atherton that not two year ago excuse mr scarfe said raby quietly stopping in walk hate talking of people behind back mr jeffreys have never annoyed have be kind to will talk of something else certainly said scarfe startled at decided tone have laid plan for little revelation disconcerted to see knocked on head like however just then be not in humour for making obnoxious to miss atherton of whom being susceptible youth be decidedly enamoured be deprivation certainly to find tongue thus unexpectedly tied with regard to jeffreys of whose stay at wildtree have calculated on making very short work one comfort be that there be little enough danger of seeing in ill favoured bolsover cad anything need make scarfe jealous doubtless took romantic interest in librarian many girl have whim of sort idea of preferring to smart oxford hero be preposterous jeffreys must still believe in sword of damocles hung above time might come when raby must cease to stand between nemesis chapter eighteen wild pike before breakfast on following morning scarfe in fulfilment of long standing engagement with college friend to spend day with rode off to catch train at overstone consequently be not present when post arrived with telegram from london for mr rimbolt raby who have be on watch must scarcely allow uncle time to examine content before claiming have contained bad news chance of breaking must have be out of question did not contain bad news on contrary a raby devoured few official line became radiant with pride happiness telegram be copy of dispatch received evening before at war office news be to hand of sharp brush with afghan on th inst at two day march from kandahar about mid day hussar commanded by major atherton in advance of main body encountered dislodged from defile on right bank of river considerable body of enemy who fled to plain becoming evident enemy be at hand in force battery of field gun be pushed forward under escort of troop of hussar main body followed in two column cavalry meanwhile having cleared defile chased enemy into plain beyond became involved in desperate scrimmage afghan having descended in full force into plain with evident intention of cutting off from main body major atherton completely hemmed in made desperate stand in upwards of twenty of men perished gallant officer having horse shot under gun meanwhile escorted by captain forrester of hussar gained head of defile where be immediately surrounded by enemy brilliant resistance here ensued in more than half of escort be killed in effort to save gun towards end captain forrester nearly single handed kept enemy at bay until cavalry breaking through joining force with two column of main body a emerged on plain effectually turned position saved gun loss of enemy be very considerable be considered that action clear way to kandahar troop be expected to occupy in two day without further resistance loss considering perilous position of cavalry gunner be comparatively slight captain forrester at last moment fell after resistance a heroic a witnessed in course of campaign major atherton received scratch on wrist however be not likely to disable even temporarily main body never came into action at suffered casualty full list of killed wounded be appended jeffreys who found almost a eager for news a if have be personally interested found difficult to wait patiently until mr rimbolt came after breakfast to library be there news from war asked yes good news miss atherton have telegram father took part in very brilliant engagement day two ago appears to have cleared way to kandahar be scratched not seriously jeffreys received good news with great satisfaction be relief to to hear in first instance not from raby lip for never knew what to do say on such occasion miss atherton must be very proud said returning to work be not however destined to remain long undisturbed raby radiant excited entered library few minute later mr jeffreys said such splendid news have uncle told thought must like to read telegram here be jeffreys looked congratulation a took paper read aloud mr jeffreys said happy girl must like to hear how sound jeffreys smiled began to read raby who knew by heart seeming to check off word suddenly however in middle of narrative reader started changed colour became unaccountably breathless gun meanwhile escorted by have got so far captain forrester of hussar go on said raby needed self command to finish reading when came to end handed back paper raby perceived that hand shook face be deadly pale why what be matter mr jeffreys said suddenly alarmed be good news be have only got scratch yes be good news congratulate look perhaps know one who have be killed never told have friend out there have not think must be not quite well will excuse went out into open air leaving raby very much perplexed concerned be relieved however to see hour later starting off with percy for what to judge by mountain boot luncheon box strapped across jeffreys shoulder promised to be long walk jeffreys first sensation on finding alone have be of stupefaction although that knew of forrester father be that have be in india never occurred to now for moment that gallant officer mentioned in telegram must be other than father whom have so cruelly irreparably wronged now once more seemed suddenly face to face with crime saw before that fatal scene in bolsover meadow heard comrade howl of execration saw boy white face on grass turned up to meet seemed yesterday nay seemed to be there moment must feel keen breeze on cheek eye rested on boy cap where have flung be conscious of mr freshfield look of horror must even see twenty yard away football lying idle between goal strange that doubtful mention of officer name must call up thus so be even seemed half guilty of gallant death in afghanistan have not wronged worse than death now if anywhere friendless boy whose whole hope be in father must read line find orphaned a well a crippled jeffreys in misery groaned aloud hullo said percy in path before in blue too what jolly sell here be a miserable a owl everybody meet miserable too scarfe be gone to sharpfield wo be back till late raby so taken up with precious telegram that wo look at ma mr scarfe have bagged pony trap appleby now be looking a if 'd just be hung what be in blue about said jeffreys brightening up bit oh everything be so slow here nothing to do ca play game day wo let smoke library have single story worth reading be beastly cold upon word said boy who be genuinely miserable 'd a soon go sit on top of wild pike a fool about here best thing must do will go sit with said jeffreys what said boy do mean will come of course will have nothing special to do to day have never be up mountain in winter before will get splendid view sure wo grind said boy who under scarfe influence have come to look upon exertion a thing to be shirked dear fellow will enjoy especially with said jeffreys hurrah bring julius too will get grub to take be only ten now be not dark till after four so have good six hour few minute later started percy leaving word for mother that be going for long tramp must be back for dinner be perfect winter day air be keen frosty promised magnificent view wind be not strong enough to be benumbing sun overhead be cheering now then even warm have better take overcoat in case come on cold at top said jeffreys a be starting oh be frightful grind to carry be sure to be baked before get up think will take mine said jeffreys will be no bother to carry yours percy protested luckily for jeffreys carried point wild pike be one of mountain not uncommon in district be approached from back by long gradual slope on front present scooped out precipitous face a if broken in half on side be steeper side faced wildtree percy must have scorned to approach monster from other quarter from where stood narrow path zigzagged for about one thousand foot onto one of upper shoulder of mountain following track brought to what seemed like basin of old volcano hollowed out under summit be necessary to cross depression by narrow ledge at foot of great cliff gain other side where zigzag ascent brought onto rocky slope leading over quarter of mile of huge boulder to summit passage across face of mountain be most difficult part of ascent lay along narrow ledge hanging so seemed half way down perpendicular cliff rose out of hollow crater like basin sheer up to summit be tolerably level narrowness of track precipitous height above below called for cool head steady foot in frosty weather like present needed special caution step have to be carefully judged on treacherous path however passed safely julius alone seemed to find difficult dog be strangely awkward to day slid about where others walked steadily whimpered at obstacle seemed scarcely to heed now for grub cried percy a landed safely on other side say jeff call that something like mountain be quite sorry be over worst of be have got view to see yet responded jeffreys will be up in hour will take a long to come down a to go up to day said jeffreys so ought not to lose much time off started again after hurried highly appreciated meal in dog took only very moderate share remaining portion of ascent be simple enough zigzag onto top shoulder be if anything le steep than lower one path being rougher underfoot be le treacherous scramble over loose rock at top onto cairn be not altogether plain sailing in summer be easy enough now with surface of great boulder a slippery a glass be hardly to be traversed except on hand knee poor julius floundered about pitifully unable to keep foot disappearing bodily now then among interstice of rocky way even percy jeffreys stumbled once twice awkwardly reached summit with bruised limb finis coronat opus especially on mountain a sprang up cairn view unequalled in grandeur broke upon frosty air be without haze in quarter scotch hill beyond border broad heaving sea lay apparently equally within reach on farthest western horizon even fairy like outline of distant irish hill never visible except in clearest winter weather shone out distinctly be scrumptious exclaimed percy a flung breathless onto cairn if have waited year must have picked out such day why must be snowdon see over there high ground out at sea holyhead thus went on delightedly recognising landmark north south east west forgetting hour rising breeze why be two o'clock cried percy presently looking at watch shivering at same time put on coat said wind getting up bit will have in face going down a started to descend became aware of sudden change in hitherto cloudless day western horizon

freezing under be impossible to crawl percy drawing cautiously to foot attempted to stand a did so wind gathering into furious blast caught hurled against rocky wall recoiled with sharp cry of pain next moment must have fallen into abyss beneath have not jeffreys strong arm caught held leg be actually off ledge for moment seemed a if protector be doomed with tremendous effort prostrate jeffreys swung back onto track be hurt called arm said percy be afraid ca get on will try attempt only called up fresh exclamation of pain must wait said jeffreys try to sit up old fellow will help be evident that boy arm if not broken be so severely damaged a to render powerless must stay here think said if went on jeff nonsense said jeffreys will send julius to fetch help here julius good dog said patting dog head pointing down to valley go fetch here fetch appleby walker mr rimbolt go along good fellow dog who have be crawling behind looked wistfully at master licked hand caressed then stepping carefully across a sat with back to rock foot beyond edge of path departed be out of sight almost yard away heard whine once a wind dashed against cliff julius good dog fetch shouted jeffreys into mist faint answering bark came back next moment through storm came wild howl heard more jeffreys guessed only too well what that howl meant never stirred a with arm round percy cloak screening from wind looked hopelessly out into night waited chapter nineteen scarfe promise to remember jeff said percy after minute two be nonsense staying here to get frozen do go on old fellow prefer company to own jeff may not last out till morning wo give up yet though jeffreys have great faith in caloric of hope especially for boy of percy temperament for saw enough to guess that position be desperate

broken despite makeshift bandage sling adjusted at imminent peril of being swept away in operation increasingly painful mist wrapped like winding sheet froze a fell how long will julius take getting down asked boy not long said jeffreys with shudder not wholly caused by cold hour must bring up in three hour must le perhaps can hold out for three hour jeff old fellow do go what be use of staying harder work for wind to lift two of than one ca last long be certain be chopping already relapsed into silence listened to storm a dashed on cliff above quarter of hour passed then jeffreys felt boy head drop on shoulder percy old man sleeping said raising head be not sleeping only wondering where julius be voice be drowsy word drawled out slowly dreamily perhaps be down lower zigzag now said jeffreys giving companion shake under pretext of readjusting wrap guess will go to raby first said percy wo be scared will probably go to father will get appleby kennedy of men will percy hold up head scarfe must like to get engaged to raby must sooner percy old man be talking rubbish unless sit up keep awake will come to grief will try said boy know how tell something about year at rugby want to hear about so much what form be in then followed desperate half hour of cross examination jeffreys coming down with question at slightest symptom of drowsiness percy with cunning of somno maniac taking time to think before answer even shirking syllable here there in order to snatch wink daylight slowly faded out of mist still wind howled shook on narrow perch at gust jeffreys with dismay found limb growing cramped stiff boding ill unless relief soon came for possibility of moving at surely though wind be abating dash overhead sounded trifle le deafening driving sleet hour ago have struck on face now froze ear yes wind be shifting falling in half minute took jeffreys to make discovery percy have once more fallen asleep required shake more prolonged than ever to arouse what said a slowly raised head be here be father there old boy wind be going down may be able to move soon where did field in cricket match be telling of short leg made two catch bravo be hard one tell so for half hour struggle with sleep went on jeffreys have more to do than keep companion awake accompanied question with change of position of knee arm that might be able when time came to use limb be little enough scope have for movement on narrow ledge lost chance self imposed fidget helped not only percy at last roar on cliff changed into surly soughing gust edged slowly surely round behind great buttress of mountain percy said jeffreys must try move can hold steady while try to get up percy be wide awake in instant can hold on other arm be good for scrambling will see to only hold on while get up be long painful operation joint muscle seemed to be congealed at length however by dint of terrible effort managed to draw up foot even to stand on path kicked up earth so a to make firm foothold then addressed to still more difficult task of raising stiff crippled percy how did how half dragged half carried back along ledge to firmer ground of upper zigzag path never knew always counted a one of miracle of life work of stronger than human arm have already helped along path in act showed that still be with to stand even on steep mountain path be after peril of fearful ledge like standing on broad paved road where next said percy over top down by sharpenholme track do see moon be coming out through mist serene heroism of night adventure be not absorbed by elder traveller boy who with indomitable hopefulness toiled up that steep ascent with broken arm bandaged to side making nothing of pain be type of english boy happily still to be met with giving promise of men of right stuff yet to come to maintain good name of country be not much in humour for admiring wonderful beauty of scene a mist gradually cleared above rose full white moon flooding mountain hill beyond with pure light welcomed light for showed way must have sold view twenty time over for pot of hot coffee at top met tail end of gale spending little remaining force on mountain back seemed like balmy zephyr compared with tempest of few hour ago descent down broad grass track with slight covering of snow towards sharpenholme have little difficulty jolting tried percy arm a steep climb with exertion have not done jeffreys noticed boy step become more unsteady felt lean with increasing heaviness on arm percy old boy be done up suppose rest minute two will be right while spoke staggered faintly must have fallen for jeffreys arm in think if went on said must rest bit follow slowly jeffreys answer be curt decisive took boy up in arm a if have be baby despite protestation carried on level ground under ordinary circumstance must have be simple matter for jeffreys be brawny powerful light weight of slender wiry boy be nothing to on slippery mountain side after fatigue peril of afternoon be a much a must do to stagger forward under burden yet be quite unnatural strange sort of happiness seemed to take possession of a felt helpless boy form in arm head drooped on shoulder poor bruised arm tenderly supported in hand there seemed hope in burden in brotherly service promise of expiation for still more sacred service have be denied tramped down that long gradual slope in contented dream halting often to rest never losing heart percy too exhausted to remonstrate yielded gratefully lay only half conscious in protector arm often fancying at home in bed lolling idly in summer field may have be midnight later still when jeffreys looking beyond shadow projected by moon in front of perceived gleam of light far down in valley probably thought honest shepherd after day work be happily going to rest think of bed pillow blanket light light there be two be moving moving rapidly evenly jeffreys stood still to listen wind have long since dropped into rest clear night air must have carried sound twice distance yes be cart carriage must even detect clatter of horse on hard road possibly benighted wagoner mail cart raised shout scared sleeping rabbit in hole made hill across valley wake with echo light still moved on set percy down tenderly on grass with coat beneath then running with speed halved distance separated road shouted again time clatter of hoof stopped abruptly light stood still once more shouted till night rang with echo then joyful sound there rose from valley answering call knew be safe in few minute be back again where percy once more awake be sitting up bewildered listening to echo repeated shout still kept waking be right old fellow there be carriage have come to look for can walk jeff really be sure yes 'd be so scared if saw being carried so started forward answering shout coming nearer nearer at step be appleby said percy a particularly loud whoop fell on ear be with mr rimbolt scarfe when darkness came sign of pedestrian usual uneasiness have prevailed at wildtree increased considerably by walker raby report a to mountaineering garb in missing one have started terrible tempest have attacked face of wild pike have swept over wildtree too added hundredfold to alarm a hour passed hour absence caused scarfe arriving at home about ten o'clock found whole family in state of panic mr rimbolt have be out on lower slope of mountain reported that storm raged there before nothing must stand only hope be that have be descending back of mountain taken refuge somewhere in valley for night carriage be ordered out mr rimbolt scarfe started on what seemed forlorn hope for hour two passed repassed valley road inquiring at cottage farm without result at last just a be resolving to give up for night appleby pulled up horse suddenly said have heard shout instantly jumped out shouted back now following direction of voice far up great slope met jeffreys with boy leaning on arm safe almost exhausted of retained vivid recollection of drive home jeffreys be vaguely conscious of calling on way for doctor taking along in carriage also heard scarfe say something to mr rimbolt in tone of commiseration in something be added about inconsiderateness untrustworthiness of jeffreys for rest reclined back in seat scarcely conscious of anything rest warmth at wildtree now familiar scene of whole household gathered panic struck threshold drove precipitately to room knew what to expect if stayed there jeffreys dropped asleep with dog howl ringing weirdly in ear in dream seemed to change into still more terrible howl have stunned long ago on bolsover meadow followed a carried young forrester in arm across fatal ledge be pitch dark on ledge scarfe stood to drive back then suddenly new bright path seemed to open at side into stepped with precious burden a did so saw far off raby standing at end of way be ten o'clock when awoke house be still asleep only few servant be stirring even walker have taken advantage of occasion to sleep in jeffreys be tough hardy night rest have done more for than twenty doctor got up shook behold limb be strong under head be clear cool dressed quietly descended to kitchen where begged early breakfast of servant then sallied forth with stick towards wild pike grand pile on bright winter morning looked almost hypocritically serene benignant sunlight bathed stern cliff yesterday have buffeted back wind with roar a fierce a in quiet spring like air peaceful bleating of sheep be only sound to be heard on steep mountain side jeffreys did not turn step upward on contrary kept to lowest track in valley took path led nearest to base of terrible wall of rock hard scramble over fallen stone brought to spot where looking up top of wall frowned down on from sheer height of five hundred foot while way down like narrow scratch along face of cliff must just detect ledge on last night have sat out storm there among stone shattered cold lay remained of brave julius fate must have overtaken before have gone twenty yard on desperate errand almost before final howl reached master ear must have be over jeffreys a tenderly lifted lost friend in arm thought bitterly reproachfully of dog strange conduct yesterday evident depression foreboding of evil result doubt of illness making that last act of self devotion more heroic made grave there at base of grand cliff piled up little cairn to mark last resting place of friend then truly mourner returned slowly to wildtree at door encountered mr rimbolt who glared at swept past how be percy morning inquired thanks to mr jeffreys said lady with double venom in tone be alive arm be go to work sir said lady have wish to speak to jeffreys bowed retreated have expected reception just now dismayed concerned on staircase met raby looked pale anxious brightened up a saw mr jeffreys said be really up none worse be well thank said very anxious to hear about percy have have bad night with arm doctor say be going on right what terrible adventure have percy told little of oh mr jeffreys be fault jeffreys must not help smiling by what stretch of ingenuity do make out be suggested coaxing percy out know might have be death of did not send wind did mist if did of course be quite entitled to credit laugh about please percy be telling how if have not be for must never have be in danger perhaps be right by way miss atherton be there chance of seeing have asked for already auntie believe must have fit if went near seems to consider be evil genius instead of being just opposite tell how julius be went with did not have be out morning to bury julius at place where fell raby already unduly excited by event of past few day broke into tear at same moment scarfe descending stair stood before looked first at jeffreys next at girl then taking arm said what be matter may take downstairs oh cried pushing away hand dashing tear from eye mr jeffreys be so sorry do forgive ran upstairs to own room jeffreys scarfe stood facing one be meaning of said latter wrathfully must not interest be telling miss atherton about dog hang dog did not tell did not choose for to obtrude on raby did must be sorry to obtrude on one whether choose not appear to forget cad jeffreys forget nothing not even that be keeping from breakfast quitted scene later in morning a be working in library mr rimbolt entered greeted cordially jeffreys dear fellow be constantly adding new claim on gratitude what can say to now to thank for heroism yesterday about percy have just told pray say nothing discount percy story heavily for be hero with broken arm in danger never lost heart for moment yes be brave boy too came now to tell be asking for will come see jeffreys followed father gratefully to sick chamber at door encountered mr rimbolt who having evidently be present at boy narrative be pleased to regard almost graciously delightfully ignoring previous encounter to wish good morning percy looked hot feverish brightened up at once a caught sight of protector hullo old jeff said be nonsense say be in for mild congestion will have to stick in bed for fortnight just sit down do mind stay with have pulled through so far may a well finish job thus informally without consulting anybody jeffreys be constituted nurse in chief in sick chamber boy must tolerate discussion protest on part of authority must have old jeff bother hospital nurse bother doctor bother scarfe bother everybody wanted jeff if jeff must come did mean to take medicine do anything ought to do walker have better put up chair bed in dressing room for jeff jeff percy must have grub together of course others must come see especially raby meant to have jeff there for good be flat thus selfish young invalid arranged for own pleasure upset sober arrangement of friend jeffreys delightedly accepted new duty faced jealousy of mr rimbolt scarfe unflinchingly be certainly unfortunate position for fond mother little wonder if in mind jeffreys brave service must be blotted out in offence of being preferred before in sick chamber readily lent ear to insinuation scarfe also bitterly hurt freely let out persuaded miserably that boy be in hand of adventurer who have cajoled not only boy father in short personated proverbial viper at fireside so fortnight passed percy turned corner time for departure of mr scarfe son drew near percy on evening before went have be le bright than usual have alarmed jeffreys by slight return of feverishness have just dropped off to sleep seemed about to settle quietly for night when door opened scarfe came in jeffreys be there in instant with hand raised in warning hush please said have just gone over whom be telling to hush canting brute said scarfe raising voice in passion unusual for let come in do hear moved forward a if to force way into room jeffreys caught by two elbow lifted bodily out into landing then stood with back to door scarfe livid with rage made attempt to get back into room turning on adversary said between teeth will remember departed chapter twenty polite letter writer scarfe descended to drawing room where found mr rimbolt alone be so sorry be going said visit have be greatly spoiled fear must come to at easter when will be in london know thank will be glad to come hope to find percy well again went to wish good bye just now be pretty abruptly denied admission so must ask to say good bye for dear be very annoying can not understand craze boy have taken for companion of be so sorry must have be annoyed assure be far more annoyed on percy account than own happen to know something of jeffreys before came to wildtree to tell truth mr rimbolt think be safe companion for percy at have long felt same what be to be done mr scarfe mr rimbolt have almost same craze a percy for librarian of have really voice in matter contrives to leave nothing definite to lay hold of must be thankful if did be most uncomfortable to feel that one own son be perhaps being ruined under roof must be be business of mine of course except be fond of percy must be sorry to see harm come to knowing what do at moment mr rimbolt with mr scarfe entered room what secret be two talking said latter son be just telling how fond be of percy be sure will be great loss to percy when be gone have promised to come to see in town at easter be satisfaction that can leave with assurance that percy be virtually well again said mr rimbolt really know how must have got on without mr jeffreys to nurse never knew such devotion have never wanted for thing time jeffreys influence be of highest manliest sort percy will be able to reckon illness among blessing of life mr rimbolt spoke feelingly warmly scarfe mr rimbolt exchanged glance conversation shortly afterwards turned to journey before traveller scarfe have come down to drawing room resolved cost what must to settle score with jeffreys there then by denouncing to family on whose favour be dependent have mr rimbolt entrance be delayed few minute mr rimbolt must have known about young forrester once again however be stopped in time few moment reflection convinced be a well raby knew might think of jeffreys must never forgive informant who must be mean of turning out of wildtree still le must percy be mr rimbolt likely to esteem guest more highly in capacity of tale bearer decidedly wished to keep in with three there be reason still scarfe be at bottom of heart not quite villain much a detested jeffreys longed to be revenged for what injury do certain mind feel half so much a one man commits in being better than have uncomfortable suspicion in mind that after jeffreys be not quite miscreant tried to imagine that be guilty in matter of young forrester there be doubt much a must have liked to believe must not be quite sure that accident at bolsover be result of deliberate murderous design indeed of anything more than accidental catastrophe of blundering fit of temper criminal if like cowardly not fiendish conscience made coward enough of just now to cause to hesitate before plunging into ruin one who hateful a be to be after poor wretch miserable enough for one not having done what intended to do scarfe felt decidedly virtuous considered entitled to amount of credit for forbearance seemed pity raby must not know of noble effort of self denial miss atherton said just a be about to separate for night be afraid will have forgotten about when see next be very uncomplimentary mr scarfe mean to be be sure will not forget thank have be very eventful visit have will never regret day on ice although fear made one enemy by what did understand mr jeffreys be very shy proud understand quite well wish for percy sake one here did too be not going to disobey talk of people behind back miss atherton be sure will approve of do never like unless be something nice of then certainly have better not talk to about mr jeffreys said scarfe with sneer did more damage in raby eye than torrent of abuse from lip do know have never yet shown telegram have about father last battle came morning be away know yes fancied perhaps did not care to see a never asked said raby producing precious paper from dress where kept like sort of talisman how must think that said scarfe reproachfully who have quite forgotten to ask to see took paper glanced down hullo said starting a jeffreys have done captain forrester wonder if be poor young forrester father who be poor young forrester inquired raby scarfe read paper to end then looked up in well simulated confusion poor young forrester oh well dare say jeffreys must tell about fact be miss atherton if be not allowed to talk of people behind back be impossible for to tell story of poor young forrester then said raby flushing a folded up paper have desire to hear scarfe must see have gone too far have offended said really came upon name so unexpectedly that do expect to be working hard term at oxford said raby doing kindest thing in turning conversation be hardly to be wondered at if retired that night considerably perplexed disturbed there be mystery attaching to jeffreys if be to set store by scarfe insinuation be of disgraceful kind agitation scarfe jeffreys have shown on reading telegram seemed to connect captain forrester rather son whom scarfe spoke of a poor young forrester with same mystery raby be young lady with usual allowance of feminine curiosity though be charity did not like to be baulked by mystery therefore opened letter have just finished to father to add following postscript be brave captain forrester who saved gun friend of yours tell about have wife child surely something will be done for poor thing early next morning mr scarfe son left wildtree jeffreys from percy window watched drive away very glad must be to see back of said percy be glad responded jeffreys honestly be not so frightfully sorry said percy scarfe jolly enough chap be up to too many dodge know be dead

liking everybody be dead on a call even walker percy enjoyed allowed to be led off dangerous topic be allowed to sit up for first time day held small levee in room jeffreys took opportunity to escape for short time to library have scarcely be in since day on mountain knew mr rimbolt must enjoy visit to sick chamber better without decidedly preferred beloved book to majestic society percy however be by mean satisfied with arrangement where old jeff said presently when mother raby be left alone raby go tell jeff there be brick can bet be in library tell if mean to cut dead might break gently raby said mr rimbolt a niece with smile started on majesty errand choose for to go looking about for mr jeffreys there be bell in room walker can do if required be unseemly in young lady one must think old jeff be wild beast nigger by way talk said percy complainingly know be if have be for 'd have be in deep mourning now instead of having tea up here with be quite possible percy said mother for person person interrupted boy jeff be not person be gentleman a good a of only have got so much money fear percy illness have not improved good manner wish to say that mr jeffreys may have done service must think have interrupted irrepressible one by mean follows that be proper companion for good innocent boy like percy laughed hilariously really ma be coming strong do see blush raby must make up mind to see great deal le of mr jeffreys for future be not sort of person look here ma said percy terrifying parent by energy with sprang to foot be jolly ill 'd be awfully sorry if have fit of coughing brought up blood must well will if call jeff person again where be jeff say want jeff why tell raby after for season at rate percy be allowed to have own way jeopardised moral welfare by unrestricted intercourse with person jeffreys spent time not wholly unprofitably for besides good deal of reading of history classic for percy be rapidly developing considerable taste good deal of discussion on sort of topic be deep in constructing model of new kind of bookcase designed by percy with ingenious contrivance for keeping out dust for marking by mean of automatic signal place of book must be taken from shelf wonderful work of art promised to eclipse bookcase ever invented only drawback to be that be too good percy insisted on introducing into dodge of be capable poor model more than once threatened to collapse under burden of own ingenuity however stuck to by dint of sacrificing dodge here dodge there succeeded in producing highly curious not unworthy model percy be most urgent that father must forthwith adopt for library existing bookcase being sacrificed for firewood to make way for new one mr rimbolt diplomatically promised to give matter consideration consult authority on subject when next in london meanwhile be not unsparing in compliment to inventor coadjutor so time passed happily enough for jeffreys until about three week after scarfes departure when following amiable letter reached with oxford post mark on envelope christ church february th jeffreys may have supposed that because left wildtree without showing up in proper character a murderer hypocrite have changed opinion a to what be duty to mr rimbolt family in matter be not necessary for to explain to why did not do at once especially after blackguardly manner in acted on last evening of stay there being mr rimbolt servant have to consider convenience now write to say that can spare unpleasant duty of informing wildtree household of what miscreant have in midst by doing if after know choose to keep on there be nothing more to be said be welcome to chance will have of lying in order to whitewash must tell what know meanwhile envy feeling with dare say read of death of poor young forrester father in afghanistan how cowardly crime must have brightened last hour yours e scarfe jeffreys pitched elegant specimen of polite billingsgate contemptuously into grate be not much man of world must read through line of poor performance like scarfe for reason other did not like to tell rimbolts be most anxious must know desired jeffreys to do dirty work there be something almost amusing in artlessness of suggestion have subject be le personally grievous jeffreys must have afforded to scoff at whole business sat down on impulse of moment dashed off following reply dear scarfe must not be pity that sense of duty must not have satisfaction of doing own work instead of begging to do for may be say be not mean enough to rob of so priceless jewel a good conscience of man who have done duty so respectfully decline invitation be yours j jeffreys having relieved by writing tore note up tried to forget about be not quite so easy scarfe part in drama must not forget question faced not for first time have right to be here trusted by of family even respected be not sailing under false colour pretending to be something be not true have be originally engaged a librarian post in character be accounted of le importance than scholarship general proficiency be more than librarian now circumstance have made mentor companion of high spirited honest boy be fair to percy to keep secret must certainly shut door of wildtree against for ever be fair to mr rimbolt to accept new responsibility without word be fair to raby who must shrink from with detestation did know whole story scarfe must have be amply satisfied have be present to note disquietude ensued for day after arrival of letter jeffreys felt uncomfortable in intercourse with mr rimbolt avoided raby even with percy be often unaccountably reserved pensive what be in blue about demanded that quick sighted young gentleman on first day out of door after illness be sorry be serene again rather said jeffreys be not be bad time more have must say mind feeling leg under will soon be ready for top of wild pike again say be well expect have be knocking up over not bit of be a well a anything percy however be not satisfied have vague idea that young gentleman in love be a rule sickly by simple process of reasoning guessed that jeffreys raby have have row therefore took early opportunity of mentioning matter to cousin greatly to young lady confusion raby say look here began day two afterwards a cousin be walking together what make so jolly down on jeff down on mr jeffreys what do mean well be so dismal be certain be eating heart out about why back up be good enough chap end of brick say what will meant to fish out day on ice went off like shot directly after ice cracked percy ridiculous boy said raby biting lip how can talk such nonsense oh did persisted boy be not talking about ice said mr jeffreys be very good friend chiefly on account too added with vague idea of qualifying admission oh ah wo wash know said percy anyhow be nonsense being so precious stiff with be sure be a good a scarfe percy if can not talk sense said raby nearly cry with vexation will not listen to oh serene responded percy of course be bound to make out be humbug know better come be in rage raby forget be invalid so made up on spot percy flattered have done great deal to make thing right for jeffreys jeffreys however be still harassed by perplexity be gradually veering round to conclusion that must at cost relieve mind of secret to mr rimbolt put task off day after day shrinking from wrench of tie made life happy one day however finding alone with mr rimbolt in library suddenly resolved then there to speak out oh jeffreys began mr rimbolt be very anxious to get book from wanley abbey sale looked through catalogued within next few day if can manage go up to london know next week must be glad to have square before start have doubt can be gone through before then must like to come to town too

expect here to morrow dare say will be glad to meet perhaps know be here think so said jeffreys ah then dare say will be glad to see one again jeffreys be considerably staggered by unexpected announcement relieved of present perplexity a to speaking to mr rimbolt of young forrester must at least wait till mr frampton came put in hand mr frampton came a young fresh a ever be taking three day run in lake country during term holiday determined to do see must have decided to visit old college friend look over now famous wildtree library surprise at meeting jeffreys be very considerable at first seemed to quondam pupil that old master be shy of however be explained a soon a be alone have to do with seven pound have burned hole in mr frampton pocket ever since received not knowing jeffreys address have never be able to return be never more pained than when received money said guardian be written to by clerk in ordinary course never imagined bill must be passed on to jeffreys have nothing for to take money back much a disliked until did so mr frampton be too fidgety to be approachable on other subject morning after arrival went up wild pike together first time jeffreys have be on mountain since death of julius have fine day difficulty long talk beguiled way amply made up to jeffreys for lack of adventure mr frampton told much about bolsover of how be at last beginning to thrive recover from dry rot how winter football team have got up name for how school discussion society be crowded with member how cricket prospect be decidedly hopeful how two fellow have lately gained scholarship at oxford then began to ask jeffreys about got from full account of have befallen since left school mr frampton be most sympathetic listener poor dog with bad name who have almost forgotten art of speaking mind fully to one insensibly to friend a talked reproached for pride shortsightedness have induced to shut out so long from friendship then talked of young forrester mr frampton made attempt to gloss over wickedness of unhappy act of passion showed how fully made allowance for poor blundering offender how at least saw more to pity than to upbraid in knew nothing of young forrester fate have seen in paper notice of captain forrester death from whom month before have have letter of inquiry a to son whereabouts to whom have written telling knew be little then jeffreys unfolded present uncomfortable dilemma intention of speaking to mr rimbolt talked over very seriously anxiously at last mr frampton said let speak to mr rimbolt most thankfully will so mr frampton spoke to mr rimbolt told frankly there be to tell mr rimbolt like gentleman who knew something of christian charity joined informant in pitying offender jeffreys said day after mr frampton

to quit did not come mr rimbolt knew to be in wrong husband knew if laid case before must judicially inquire into merit come to same conclusion in case dominion must be at end even mr rimbolts have eye to better half of valour sometimes so jeffreys be left sitting for ultimatum did not come raby have still worse ordeal before at first indignation have reigned supreme effaced other emotion gradually however feeling of vague misery ensued longed to be away in india with dear soldier father wished jeffreys have never come under wildtree roof to bring insult on wretchedness to dreaded

family party with mr scarfe added for other three visitor have not yet returned from windsor raby sought protection from aunt by devoting to mr scarfe quite delighted that good lady by brightness spirit mr scarfe took occasion in drawing room afterwards to go into rhapsody to young friend regarding son when about ten o'clock holiday maker arrived home in high spirit full of day sport achieved grand stroke of generalship by leaving two young people together in conservatory having previously by significant pressure of son arm given to understand now be time for striking while iron be hot scarfe be in unusually gay mood still little elevated by festivity of day be sure missed said did house be certainly much quieter said raby do know said be rather pleasant to feel that one be missed raby said nothing began to feel desire to be safely back in drawing room do know drank toast to day like old knight to lady love continued scarfe indeed replied raby a unconcernedly a must yes will

gain by telling if have mr scarfe be quite mistaken do please let go scarfe yielded bitterly mortified perplexed vanity have along only supposed one possible obstacle to success with raby be rival that must decline to have for other reason have be quite beyond calculation must not believe now jeffreys may not have actually gone a far a to propose to so seemed there be understanding between barred scarfe own chance worst of be that to do one thing must have liked to do must be to spoil own chance altogether for raby whether cared for jeffreys not must have nothing to say to scarfe if be mean of ruin air during next few day seemed charged with thunder mr rimbolt be in state of war with one mr scarfe be poorly two oxford visitor began to vote visit slow scarfe be moody raby be unhappy jeffreys felt continually half choked percy alone kept up spirit while mr rimbolt happiest of went up north to look at old book one be particularly sorry when visit came to end even sport boat race have failed to revive drooping spirit of oxonian on monday following be with considerable stretch of politeness that thanked mr rimbolt for very pleasant visit scarfe taking farewell of raby begged that time later on might come to see again be quite unable to gather from reply whether desired not jeffreys wisely kept out of way while departure be taking place despite mr rimbolt suggestion that must be sent for to help cabman carry out box first evening after be gone house seemed place even jeffreys felt must breathe despite mr rimbolt absence hostile proximity of lady a to raby percy made concealment of relief felt went off for row on river to celebrate occasion jeffreys judiciously excused from accompanying went long walk by two day later after lunch just a percy raby have departed for ride in park jeffreys have shut up in mr rimbolt study to write letter be delivered by post addressed to mr rimbolt bearing oxford post mark be from scarfe mr rimbolt opened eye a perused christchurch april dear mr rimbolt reached here from home morning hasten to send line to thank for very pleasant visit spent in london last week must have written sooner be anxious to write on le pleasant subject felt must not be done hurriedly will dare say blame for not having told earlier what now feel duty to tell trust will understand feeling have prevented doing so john jeffreys who be in mr rimbolt employment be a know old schoolfellow of mine be surprised to see at wildtree last christmas took trouble to inquire whether have come to with character whether have knowledge of antecedent imagined have not supposed that a be only engaged a librarian inquiry a to character be not considered necessary when saw that be being admitted a member of household specially allowed to exercise influence on percy assure felt uncomfortable have be on mind ever since to tell what feel ought to know jeffreys ran away from school after committing cruel act to intent purpose be murder victim be small boy whom loved who never did harm detail of whole affair be too horrible to dwell upon here have said enough to show what sort of person be who be at present entrusted with care of own son allowed to associate on footing of equality with niece miss atherton can assure be very painful to to write for know how will shock feel conscience must not give peace till told may now ask one special favour from be well known probably have noticed that jeffreys naturally dislike one want to believe that write not because dislike jeffreys because like feel that percy particularly be in peril what ask be that if think right to take action in matter name may not be mentioned must be considered act of spite on part be not perhaps may mention to have special reason for wishing miss atherton at least must not think worse of than deserve must certainly misunderstand if name be mentioned feel have only done duty assure will be great relief to to know that be rid of one who can not fail to exercise fatal influence on pure honest mind of friend percy believe dear mr rimbolt most sincerely yours e shock astounding communication gave to mr rimbolt can be more easily imagined than described explained everything instinctive dislike of man from first moroseness insolence cunning with have insinuated first into husband then into percy confidence how blind have be not to see before might have known that be villain now however duty be clear must be wicked if delayed to act upon moment if mr rimbolt have be at home must have fallen on to discharge be not must do for whereupon worthy matron girded for fray stalked off to study jeffreys be busy transcribing bibliographical note have brought away with from exeter work be not very engrossing have leisure now then to let mind wander direction thought took be towards mr rimbolt little plan of run on continent for percy summer jeffreys have be afraid to acknowledge to how much plan delighted longed to see everlasting snow lake grand old mediaeval city prospect of seeing with percy away from must annoy jar have got so far when door opened mr rimbolt stood before lady be pale evidently agitated beyond wont stood for moment facing jeffreys apparently waiting for word librarian back went up in anticipation if be more about raby must leave room before forgot mr jeffreys said lady word came slowly hoarsely request to leave house in hour be jeffreys turn to start grow pale may ask why said know why sir said lady have known why ever since have meanness to enter wildtree on false pretence really mr rimbolt began jeffreys with cold shudder passing through be at loss speak to sir knew have right to enter house of honest respectable people knew have right to take advantage of accident to insinuate into family impose upon unsuspecting good nature of husband one asked for character for one imagined must be quite so hypocritical a have be self constituted friend protector of precious boy with stain of blood on hand mark of cain on forehead leave house at once desire word talked grandly about claiming to be protected from insult in house be who claim to be protected from hypocrite murderer begone consider fortunate that instead of walking out free man be not taken out to punishment deserve when jeffreys stunned stupefied looked up room be empty mechanically finished sentence have be writing then letting pen drop from hand sat where be numbed body soul mr rimbolt word dinned in ear with came old haunting sound yell on bolsover meadow midnight shriek of terrified boy cold sneer of guardian brutal laugh of jonah trimble came back in one confused hideous chorus yelling to that bad name be alive still dogging down down mocking foolish dream of deliverance hope hounding out into night to hide head indeed never to hide from how long sat there knew not when rose be at least calm resolved went up to own room looked through little stock of possession old suit in have come to wildtree be there impulse seized to put on in exchange for trim garment be wearing of other good chattel took few special favourite homer julius collar cricket cap pocket compass percy have given envelope raby have once directed to for uncle money last quarter salary took too old stick have cut in lane near ash cottage be then quietly descending deserted stair looking to right hand left crossed hall opened

seen in plight before what have not seen before if at only in passing moment be bitter hard look on face changing miserably stranger passing that afternoon must have said there sits man who hate world who know better must have said there sits poor dog with bad name deserted even by hope so be jeffreys have left clarges street smarting under sense of injury still resolved to keep up fight for good

men who see see nothing else in scar so thought poor jeffreys a slowly turned back on be dear to in life went out into night of unsympathetic city at first a said tried to hold up head inquired in one two quarter for work question always came up what be character have none must say doggedly why did leave last place be turned away what for because be supposed to have killed boy once once indeed did get temporary job at warehouse a porter for week happy week used broad back brawny arm in carrying heavy load lifting weight hope sprang again within a laboured might yet by beginning at lowest step

struck accuser be impeached before head of firm be discovered that have come without character be enough be bundled out of place at five minute notice with threat of policeman if made six even when week later shilling be found in warehouseman blotting paper one doubted that cashiered rogue be a cunning a be nefarious after that have given up what seemed farce of holding up head what be use said when a sure a night follows day that bad name of dogged wherever went so jeffreys began to go down in after year spoke very little of six month in london when did be about people have met not about

after must say to jeffreys a two lay at night almost on bare board what be odds may be miserable one day be jolly next now seem to prefer to be uniformly miserable hardly case of preference said jeffreys be not sure that must be more miserable to be jolly try 'd give lot to forget about everything for hour must must be pleasant can do by dropping asleep sleep be time be most miserable remember old day then mother say jeffreys be once nearly drowned at eton just a be going down for last time put up hand fellow saw came in fished out what born fool be to do be grateful to fellow at

be suddenly altered set bottle down neither heeding hearing expostulation of companion left house never to return night slept in part of town poor bewildered prodigal deserted by only friend cried night through cursed again eton boy who have once saved life jeffreys hidden in part of great city sunk to lower depth of misery than ever to seemed now that bad name have taken form in face of young

keeper boldly parade path in waterproof a if have braved element since daybreak nursemaid draw out perambulator from under tree hastens with wailing occupant nursery ward there coming to meet sheltered under one umbrella be two who perhaps have grudge against storm for detaining in walk that afternoon be long since jeffreys have seen anything to remind of world have left there be something about two a advance towards face hidden by umbrella attracts youth be slim well dressed hold well companion figure reminds of form knew can be only six month ago light gentle courageous beside have walked in wildtree park on london pavement ah how changed now where wonder be now what be thinking of if think of at meet tramp young couple never heed how must turn of umbrella give momentary glimpse of in glimpse poor hapless jeffreys recognises raby scarfe surely blow be not needed to crush completely scarfe how long stood statue like looking down path by have gone neither one else must tell be dark when be roused by harsh voice in front of come sheer off young fellow be time be out of park yes will go said walked slowly to gate be ridiculous of of course to writhe a did under chance meeting what else must have expected hundred time already have told have forgotten about worse still remembered only to despise hundred time too have seen in fancy beside enemy who have stabbed for scarfe might have spared precaution in begging mr rimbolt not to name a jeffreys ' accuser jeffreys needed telling to whom owed ruin needed telling reason why reason have made clear afternoon at rate a wretched outcast wandered out into night seemed a if one ray of light yesterday have glimmered for even across darkness be now quenched for ever that there be nothing left to hope dread must not quit park wandered round round outside inhospitable paling covering mile after mile of wet pavement heedless of now drenching rain heedless of hunger heedless of failing noisy street have grown silent clock near at hand have struck two when found on little bridge cross canal be too dark to see water below heard hard rain hissing on surface have stood there before in happier day wondered how men woman must choose a sometimes did to end misery in narrow streak of sluggish water wondered le now not that felt tempted to follow in lowest depth of misery that door of escape have never allured yet a stood felt fascinated even soothed by ceaseless noise of rain on invisible water beneath seemed almost like voice of friend far away have be listening for time crouched in dark corner of parapet when became aware of footstep approaching imagining at first be of policeman coming to dislodge tramp from lurking place prepared to get up move on listening again remained where be footstep be not of policeman approached fitfully now quickly now slowly now stopping still for moment two yet be too agitated for of drunkard too uncertain for of fugitive from justice a drew near to bridge stopped once more jeffreys peering through darkness saw form clutching railing looking down in direction of water then voice groaned oh god footstep hurried on jeffreys have seen misery in many form go past before something impelled now to rise follow footstep of wanderer plashing rain drowned sound be with difficulty jeffreys weak weary a be must keep pace with figure flitting before for after glance over bridge fugitive longer halted in pace went on rapidly across bridge turned followed high bank of canal then halted apparently looking for way down be long impatient search at last jeffreys saw descend along railing sloped down steep grass slope almost to towing path jeffreys followed with difficulty when at last stood on towing path fugitive be not to be seen be possible to say whether have turned right left jeffreys turned to right anxiously scanning bank water tramped along muddy path few yard down came upon heap of stone piled up across path one clambering across must have made noise enough to be heard twenty yard away a far a must judge in darkness one have stepped upon therefore turned back hurriedly retraced step sullen water hissing still under heavy rain gave sign a ran along edge scanned with anxious eye high bank on left beyond paling became inaccessible from below wanderer must therefore be before on path for five minute ran on straining eye ear when suddenly stumbled be hat upon path in moment jeffreys dived into cold water a came to surface looked round there be nothing spreading circle of own plunge to be seen moment afterwards close to bank have glimpse of something black rising for instant then disappearing three stroke brought to spot just a object rose again to seize strike out for bank be work of moment man for be be alive a jeffreys slowly drew from water
