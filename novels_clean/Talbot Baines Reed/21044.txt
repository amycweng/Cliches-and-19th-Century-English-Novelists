construction to be found scattered through entire range of latin classical literature how parson telson enjoyed that lecture listened to with rapt attention with heart full of gratitude face full of sympathy did not understand word of chapter out of midshipman easy must not have delighted more when saw that clock have slowly worked round from nine to ten must not have interrupted for world ah

captaincy who be to be new captain of willoughby be question have occurred to only very few to ask until wyndham have finally quitted school fellow have grown so used to old order of thing have continued now for two year that possibility of bowing to other chief than old wynd have scarcely crossed mind question being once asked became very interesting indeed captain of willoughby have be by long tradition what be known a round men there be something in air of place seemed specially favourable to development of muscle classical proficiency at same time consequence be that last three head of school have combined in one person senior classic captain of club have be best of indeed be a much ahead of fellow in classical school a be in cricket field on river be saying not little predecessor have also be head boy in classic although of actually best men of time in athletics have be sufficiently near best to entitle to place of honour made willoughby captain supreme not only in school out of so that in memory of present generation school generation being reckoned a five year willoughby captain have always be cock of school in sense in distinction be possible now of sudden school woke up to fact that delightful state of thing be not everlasting wyndham have left mantle have fallen from in two piece new head classic be riddell comparatively unknown boy in school who have come there couple of year ago from private school about whom most be known be that be physically weak timid rarely taking part in athletic exercise having very few chum interfering very little with anybody else reputed pi a more irreverent among willoughbites be wont to stigmatise fellow who made profession of goodness such be boy on whom according to strict rule captaincy of willoughby must devolve need hardly be said that discovery spread consternation wherever travelled among senior idea be hardly taken seriously doctor must never be so ridiculous said ashley to coates a talked matter over in study of former might a well shut up school worst of be see how can help replied coates help of course can help if like there be written law head classic be to be captain if ca hold bat run

laugh must be joke think of riddell stroking school eight at henley eh kicking off for against rockshire suppose coates think because riddell schoolhouse boy be bound to be man never fear will see parrett come to front at last boy why be to be new captain asked coates with slight sneer tipper be not pleased with little piece of sarcasm be good cricketer fine runner in school everybody knew to be a poor scholar a fellow must be to be in sixth at dare say even must be a good a schoolhouse fellow must pick out said if want to know bloomfield man just what be saying said ashley coates say be not far enough up in school bosh said tipper what difference doe make if fellow first twentieth in school a long a be cock of everything outside see how doctor can hesitate moment between two be conclusion come to at almost conclave met together during day to discus burning question be conclusion moreover to bloomfield came a talked matter over with few of friend after third school see said be not care about thing for own sake must be precious grind know to have to be responsible for everything go on to have to lick kid want hiding for 'd sooner do than let school run down what hope said one be that even if paddy doe see riddell will will have sense to back out of fancy must be sorry not said bloomfield heard say once pitied wyndham bother have especially when be wanting to stew for exam have one seen riddell lately asked game must be bad thing for of to see put to that school must go to dog to dead certainty if be captain rather blunt way of putting said porter laughing 'd break to rather more gently than well know what mean replied game who be of downright order see said bloomfield who despite protestation be evidently not displeased at notion of possible honour profess to be much of swell in school know fancy must keep order rather better than must fellow know ought to if said wibberly who be toady fancy riddell having to lick junior said game why 'd faint at very idea probably take off to study have prayer meeting with fairbairn few more of lot upon top of said gilks schoolhouse monitor not nice looking fellow guess 'd sooner get hiding from old bloomfield than laughed wibberly hope said game snivelling be not going to be order of day ca stand think have right to call riddell sniveller said porter may be muff at sport fancy be sneak see that be against either if doe go in for being what professes to be hear hear quite sermon from porter cried wibberly porter right said bloomfield one say be against say be that expect fellow will mind a much a must fellow who well who be better known know rather said game know must seem precious rum being monitor under well said bloomfield suppose will be settled soon meanwhile game what do say to grind in tub did half work morning beggar game groaned resignedly said right hue cry be forthwith made for master parson service at helm master parson a happened be not to be found be neither in school in house search through ground failed to unearth have not be seen since escape from monitorial fang after morning school natural thing of course on not finding at home in own quarter be to look for in telson be not there strange to say be telson what be still more odd when search came to be made fag of parrett house be missing so be lawkins pringle king wakefield one two others of same glorious company after fruitless search oarsman have finally to go down to river without fag at impound boat boy to steer for fact be parson miraculous release from hand of law that morning reason led to have suggested to faithful telson that present be rather rare opportunity for in annals of willoughby if there be captain there be one to give licking for worst ordinary monitor must do be to give imposition that being so must surely be waste of precious opportunity if failed to signalise event by little celebration a happened there be little celebration badly wanted celebrating for only chance like present must have be considered favourable in other word there be rather long score junior of parrett be anxious to settle up with junior of welch debt be of long standing having begun a far back a middle of lent term when welcher have played upon of parrett with hose from behind own door culminating in unprovoked outrage upon luckless parson on river very morning now if there be one thing more than young parretts prided in be punctuality in matter of business have troubled sorely that circumstance over have control in other word fear of wyndham must have prevented settling score with welcher at earlier date now however opportunity be come like honest men determined at once to avail of so reason why bloomfield game must find fag in parrett house to steer for be because fag of parrett house aided by telson of schoolhouse be at moment paying business call at welch having on whole rather lively time of junior of welch be take altogether rather more rowdy lot than junior of of

state of thing be not destined long to last notice went round from doctor to monitor next day asking to assemble directly after chapel following morning in library one knew what meant when later on be rumoured that riddell have gone to doctor that evening to tea became pretty evident in direction thing be going tea at doctor be always regarded a rather terrible ordeal by who occasionally came in for honour must infinitely have preferred licking in library others must have felt decidedly more comfortable in dock of police court even oldest boy whose conduct be exemplary whose conscience have a little to make uneasy in head master presence a in presence of youngest fag in willoughby be always glad when ceremony be over reason of be not in doctor dr patrick be one of kindest pleasantest of men must not perhaps throw off dominie altogether on such occasion always tried hard if there have be no one more formidable than paddy to deal with meal must have be comparatively pleasant unalarming there be mr patrick mr patrick sister before awful personage boldest willoughbite quailed trembled from moment unhappy guest entered parlour two who be always there fastened eye on withered spoke ceremoniously in language in grand old lady used to speak in old story book if chanced to speak sat erect in chair listening to with ear looking at with eye freezing with faintest of smile one must sit there under inspection without feeling word look gesture be being observed probably with view to recording in letter home idea of being at one ease with in room be about a preposterous a idea of sleeping comfortably on wasp nest yet if truth be known good female meant well have own idea of what boy must be having of own fondly imagined that during occasional ceremony in doctor parlour be rendering valuable assistance in dear boy education by giving idea of manner charm of polite society be in such genial company riddell head classic of willoughby be invited to bask for short time on evening of day before appointment of new captain have be there once before when father mother have come over to visit even with presence a set off evening have be one of most awful experience of life now that be to go alone to partake of state tea with two shy awkward boy felt about a cheerful a if have be walking helplessly into lion den well riddell said doctor pleasantly a after long hesitation guest at last ventured to arrive how be dear be riddell whom believe have seen before miss stringer too think met riddell coloured deeply shivered inwardly a advanced first to one lady then to other solemnly shook hand trust parent be in good health mr riddell said mr patrick in most precise tone very well indeed thank replied riddell be added correcting suddenly mother be very poorly thank regret to hear say so said mr patrick transfixing unhappy youth with eye trust indisposition be not of serious character hope will thank ma'be replied riddell who somehow fancied hostess have said have be going to say hoped mother must soon recover er beg pardon said mr patrick leaning slightly forward inclining head little on one side mean beg pardon said riddell suddenly perceiving mistake losing head at same time mean quite so thank mean interposed miss stringer at point in voice note deeper than sister that mother indisposition be of serious character oh not at be sure ejaculated hapless riddell be glad to hear say so very said miss stringer very said mr patrick at point riddell have serious thought of bolting altogether might have done so have not servant just then created diversion by bringing in kettle sit down riddell said doctor make at home be prospect for regatta year be schoolhouse boat to win be sorry ca say replied riddell believe parrett be favourite mr riddell mean mr parrett presume asked mr patrick in sweetest tone looking hard at speaker emphasising mr beg pardon said be sorry will miss wyndham said doctor yes thank replied riddell who at moment be dodging vaguely in front of miss stringer a stood solemnly waiting to get past to tea table be relief when tea be at last ready when other occupation be possible than of looking at being looked at by two lady be not very fond of athletics riddell asked doctor sir answered riddell steadily avoiding eye of female often think 'd be better if took more exercise said doctor judging by mr riddell look said mr patrick must certainly seem a if hardly did justice physically enigmatical sentence might have be compliment might have be rebuke might have meant riddell found quite unable to reply to appropriately therefore like sensible man took drink of tea instead be first dawn of reviving presence of mind apart from own health altogether continued doctor fancy position with other boy must be better if entered rather more into sport often feel that sir said riddell with touch of seriousness in tone wish must do hope that there be consideration a to health debars from very desirable exercise mr riddell said mr patrick beg pardon said riddell who did not quite take in mr patrick never liked being asked to repeat speech flattered be lucid enough to need second delivery therefore repeated remark slowly in precisely same word tone hope that there be consideration a to health debars from very desirable exercise mr riddell riddell took moment to consider then replied triumphantly be quite well thank ma'be be pleased to hear said mr patrick rather icily for last observation have seemed to little rude very chimed in miss stringer after there be silence riddell devoutly hoped might last till be time to go have lady not be there must have liked very much to speak to doctor about school matter doctor for same cause must have wished to talk to head boy be evident tea table be not place for such conversation hear said doctor after pause have continued time addressing sister in law there be likely to be election in shellport before long sir abraham be retiring indeed surprise said miss stringer be unexpected said doctor be thought there will be sharp contest for seat be liberal conservative mr riddell asked mr patrick thinking time that unfortunate youth be again tempted into conversation liberal ma'be replied riddell oh boy be generally conservative be not asked question in tone a if expected to try to deceive in answer however evaded by replying bashfully hope not pray said miss stringer putting down cup turning full on victim will favour with reason for hope mr riddell poor riddell little thought what have let in for if there be one subject two lady be rabid on be politics proceeded to pounce upon devour annihilate unlucky head classic without mercy made contradict twice thrice in sentence proved to clearly that knew nothing at of what be talking about generally gave to understand that be impertinent conceited puppy for presuming to have opinion of own on such matter riddell came out of ordeal very much a duck come out of hand of poulterer luckily by time discussion be over be time for to go certainly must not have held out much longer a be be good for nothing after went to bed early that night with very bad headache before left however doctor have accompanied into hall said there be few thing riddell want to speak to about will come to study quarter of hour before morning chapel to morrow have invitation be to breakfast in horrible parlour riddell must flatly have declined a be cheerfully accepted only wished doctor have thought of before spared misery of evening with two willoughby griffin must hardly help guessing what be doctor have to say to why be have be asked to tea that evening felt very dejected a thought about like most of other willoughbites idea of new captain having to be appointed have never occurred to till wyndham have finally left school when did occur when moreover began to dawn upon that be probable successor horror filled mind must do be not cut out for must sooner leave willoughby altogether boy knew nothing about laughed at for clumsiness suspected a coward despised a prig have wit enough to know what willoughby thought of that being so how must ever be captain must much rather named one else said to doctor at interview next morning know quite well must get on have not tried yet said doctor have not strength boy like pleaded riddell must make like riddell said doctor how can will dislike more if be made captain have influence with indeed have not how do know said doctor again have tried yet must never do what wyndham did be such splendid captain why asked doctor suppose because be splendid athlete threw into pursuit set good example think be partly right partly wrong said doctor there be several fine athlete in willoughby who must make poor captain a for throwing into school pursuit setting good example think be beyond reach riddell felt very uncomfortable began to feel that after might be shirking duty ought to undertake made one more effort there be so many others must do better sir whom boy look up to already said bloomfield for instance doctor held up hand will not go into riddell said must not suppose others have not considered good of willoughby in matter remains for to consider also a grow older will constantly find duty confronting may be sorely against inclination a honest man will know be not to be shirked have chance of beginning now pretend to say will find easy pleasant work that be likely to succeed at first at rate a well a others have done unless be mistaken will not give in on account of course will need to exert know what boy look for in captain be not mere muscle agility get by mean if can what will be worth far more than will be sympathy if discover be one with that in effort to keep order have welfare of school chiefly at heart will come out depend upon meet way be worth trying riddell riddell said nothing face be rather more hopeful a looked up at doctor come said latter there be bell for chapel be time went in riddell entered chapel that morning in strangely conflicting frame of mind hope be still in face misgiving be still in heart whole prospect before seemed to be dream a slight shy boy walked slowly up floor to place among sixth boy on side eyed curiously eagerly half titter half sneer greeted appearance regarded with disfavour amounted to positive dislike others with disdain even contempt others thought of wyndham wondered what willoughby be coming to even among sixth many unfriendly glance be darted at a took seat many whispered foreboding passed from boy to boy only few watched with look of sympathy of scarcely one be hopeful happily for riddell must not see half of when in moment doctor entered prayer began saw none of for be one of few at willoughby to whom early morning service be something more than mere routine who felt especially at time like in beautiful familiar word be to be found best of preparation for day duty telson a stood down by door with hand in pocket beside friend parson be void of such reflection what be chiefly occupying lordly mind at moment be discovery suddenly made that if riddell be new captain of course must be captain fag be not quite sure whether to be pleased reverse at new dignity see said to ally in whisper be good lark marking fellow off morning a come into chapel then twig mean have got to be here moment bell begin ringing be joke no unless got leave to ring bell too said parson then of course must troop in till be there 'd come down help with bell know must do fancy said telson then of course be swell enough work to have to go about tell monitor what have got to do be not so sure if be good thing to mix altogether with monitor likely to spoil chap eh rather said parson look out porter looking whereupon brief edifying dialogue broke off for present monitor duly assembled in doctor library after chapel of knew what be coming general attitude did not seem promising for new regime one possibly fancied have interest of willoughby at heart one two felt convinced that in putting riddell into position of captain doctor be committing serious mistake one must have given good reason for thinking so must have asserted that have personal ill feeling towards new captain for sake of school be sure be not fit person whether one felt equally sure that must have filled post better be question be not necessary to ask here doctor be brief to point dare say know why have called together said wyndham whom one here liked respected who did great deal for school hear hear from one two voice have left will miss captain of school have always for long time past be head classical boy be not law of medes persian that must be so if there seemed special reason why rule must be broken through there be nothing to prevent that being done at point one two breathed rather more freely attention generally be intensified after seemed like preface to more favourable announcement who thought so found mistake when doctor proceeded in present case there be such reason riddell here be fully aware of duty expected of be prepared to perform look to to support be confident if work heartily together one need be afraid for continued success of willoughby doctor ended speech amid silence of audience be not broken a turned left room at same moment to relief of one more than of riddell bell sounded for breakfast assembly forthwith broke up chapter five new captain be discussed on land water doctor announcement be not long in taking effect a soon a third school be over afternoon monitor assembled in sixth form room to discus situation fortunately for riddell peace of mind be not present nearly others whether friendly otherwise be there game with usual downrightness opened ball well fellow said what be going to do let have

friend for new captain constant bringing up of rivalry between parrett house schoolhouse be very way to do many of schoolhouse monitor have felt a sore a anybody about appointment sort of talk inclined not few of to take riddell side want row made on account said bloomfield if paddy think riddell be best man have choice in matter have though said wibberly be going to have fellow put over

tormentor have stood impudence long enough cad wo stand more sit down then replied crossfield cheerfully plenty of form look here fellow said bloomfield again for goodness ' sake shut up have out afterwards if like fight here mind where have out growled tucker will teach to cheek see if so saying much to relief of one turned on heel left room after discussion again got round to riddell question of petition be revived must be quite easy to draw something up must say what want to say not give offence to one said ashley what do want to say asked fairbairn if want to tell doctor be wrong that be people to set right see how can help offending be not what want to say at said game want to say that captain of willoughby have always be fellow who be good round think new captain ought

broke up reign of riddell have not to say least of opened auspiciously a far a fellow monitor be concerned outside that body in willoughby at large thing did not look much more promising feeling in parrett house be of course one of unmingled wrath mutiny when once head of house be known to have declared so unmistakably against new captain be not much to be wondered at that rank file followed lead in still more demonstrative manner happened that parson friend telson who though schoolhouse boy seemed to live most of life in parrett king wakefield lawkins have planned little expedition up river between third school call over afternoon present state of affair in school formed rather lively topic of discussion for worthy a pulled parrett noah ark by complimentary title capacious boat devoted to use of junior of house be known lazily up on tide towards balsham river be pretty full a usual at time of day a one form wrath of youthful parretts took be to insult if opportunity arose to run down craft of of other house discussion on condition of willoughby be relieved by more than one lively incident think of chap being captain said parson standing up on back seat with rudder line in hand so a to command good view of stream ahead must row a well a old bosher there a old bosher be at moment engaged in super human effort to keep balance with one hand extricate oar have feathered two foot under surface of water with other illustration be particularly effective picturesque oh be awful cad said wakefield who be rowing bow reported to wyndham last term for letting off cracker in bed what beastly shame be sympathising chorus know added king a bosher fell rather violently backward into lap at instant let oar go altogether what king be going to say did not come out after vast amount of manoeuvring back watering shouting reaching to recover lost oar voyage proceeded have not proceeded far when racing boat of house manned by bloomfield game tipper ashley coached from bank by mr parrett spun past in fine style at great rate a became loyal parretts junior pulled into bank to let four oar pas not content with act of homage volunteered round of vehement applause into bargain bravo well rowed house two to one on parrett three cheer for bloomfield three cheer for captain hooroo with gratifying salute boat darted out of sight round bend leaving junior once more to continue on festive way be old bloomfield stunner said lawkins be sort of fellow for captain not that schoolhouse idiot riddell easy there about schoolhouse shouted down telson from place at stroke will fight if say again hurrah let land have mill cried king back telson old man oh did mean to cheek telson said lawkins humbly will apologise know jolly good job said telson grandly 'd have licked same said

hoo welcher ahoy cried raising voice in tone of derisive defiance yah boo herring dough nut jolly coward dare wait for booh funk with such taunt hector of parrett endeavoured to incite enemy to battle enemy if truth must be told needed very little persuasion especially a crew in question consisted of cusack pilbury three other ill starred victim of raid of two day ago lay on oar waited for foe to come up cusack shouting meanwhile who 'd be afraid of pack of thief like must dare to land fight dare to run into dare to stand still till lick dare to do anything steal other fellow grub ye ow now fellow cried parson put on few stroke brought two boat level then a lay side by side at oar distance ensued notable tremendous splashing match be kept up with terrific vigour on side until not only be combatant splashed through two boat be nearly swamped then after side have insultingly claimed victory boat separated dripping warrior parted with final broadside there be take go tell captain shouted parson must dare do if bloomfield be captain retorted welcher will have captain then see how will smile yah bah amid terrific cat calling on side crew parted last taunt be sore one for young parretts have never occurred to that bloomfield if be captain might perhaps spoil sport more than riddell be only passing annoyance after be parretts bloomfield be man whether spoiled sport not telson have objection to sentiment a long a one presumed to cheek schoolhouse in uttering whenever be done insisted on unalterable determination to fight offender unless swallowed word offender usually did tide be getting slack be time for to turn if be to be in for call over just however a be about to do so shout behind attracted became aware of four oared boat approaching with schoolhouse flag in prow came along at fair pace with nothing like style have marked parretts boat crew consisted of fairbairn porter coates gilks with crossfield steering first time complete schoolhouse crew have appeared on river year blood of young parretts be up credit of house be in question put on now said parson to men a schoolhouse boat came up show 'em what can do now then slide into race young hero laid into work made noah ark forge along at unwonted pace parson busily encouraged varying exhortation by occasional taunt addressed to other boat now then shouted two to one on come on there jolly schoolhouse lout parson will fight if say again interposed telson by way of parenthesis oh beg pardon old man pull away fellow parretts for ever riddell for three cheer for bloomfield be gaining fellow oh well pulled indeed boat schoolhouse boat have slackened speed paddling gently alongside be taking careful note of audacious youngster who puffing plunging along fully believed be beating picked four of rival

spent in way when young champion be except parson fairly exhausted crossfield took out watch said to crew winking a did so time turned fellow be five o'clock easy pull bow side back water stroke so saying schoolhouse boat suddenly turned round started off at smart pace down stream where be soon out of reach of parting taunt opprobrious noise parson for credit of house continued to hurl at crew till be beyond earshot then suddenly began to occur to elated young navigator that if have be time for four oar to turn three minute ago be possibly time for to turn also what did say time be asked king five o'clock said lawkins five o'clock call over be at ca do in time exclaimed parson aghast eye what row there will be groaned telson have be late for call over twice week already be certain to

so turned viciously started homewards rower be too tired enraged to talk much journey down stream be silent gloomy heard about mile from home school bell ringing for call over groaned inwardly when presently ceased knew name be being called over not one of there to answer parson alone made attempt to keep up drooping spirit of crew never fear will pay out see if do report will only get impots

hand at same time light boat gave violent lurch over capsized sending occupant headlong into river small boy pale with fright dazed by suddenness of accident sat for moment unable to move cry out then by sudden wild impulse parson sprang boldly into water followed in second two first by telson then by lawkins other three held to oar waited where be tide be running down at good pace river be fairly wide there be not much danger to of immersed one willoughby boy must swim a mr parrett have taught most of to do so hardly stood in need of help of three pupil few stroke brought to bank in safety uncomfortable moment ensued mr parrett said nothing to three dripping boy who stood before called to boy in boat to row in bringing skiff with while be being done telson parson looked despairingly at

schoolhouse who have promised to go with others to doctor however be decided not to postpone ceremony further a be one two be beginning to have doubt a to wisdom game like who be prime mover in matter began to fear whole thing might fall through so directly after morning chapel deputation consisting of three marched boldly to doctor library knocked at door come in said dr patrick be surprised to see three monitor obey invitation be very rarely that petition be presented from school to head master at willoughby once year ago petition signed by entire school from captain down to junior fag praying for holiday in honour of old willoughbite having led british troop to victory in great battle have be presented granted once since then petition from monitor of house requesting that head of

one captain substitute what be asked head master petition sir said game handing momentous document in doctor opened glanced at with puzzled look soon darkened into frown what be asked looking up aspect be not promising nevertheless be necessary for one to speak game therefore blurted out think riddell will make good captain sir here stopped what sir demanded doctor said game in rather faltering voice thought must not be angry if petitioned about do speak for game said doctor for others for monitor sir be for who have signed that paper doctor folded up petition handed back to game without reading be glad have told what be about said sternly in time to prevent reading petition name attached doe not do credit a monitor hope will soon see matter in same light did not expect of regret le on account than on account of school to whom have set bad example may go doctor spoke in tone of unwonted anger not unmixed with scorn rarely flared up when did be always uncomfortable for against whom wrath be roused deputation slunk off sheepishly carrying petition with too glad to get out of angry presence of head master to think of anything else doctor may have be right probably be right in thus summarily extinguishing petition petitioner have done in manner be hardly calculated to smooth matter indeed when deputation reported bad success to monitor who awaited general feeling be far more one of anger at being snubbed than of repentance for having done foolish thing if paddy have only taken trouble to read thing through said ashley honour with one two reason for not doing what asked must have be so bad a be be a good a told to mind own business will mind said tipper little thinking how exactly have described case if be not to be allowed to say word about management of

not so much that felt unpopular that knew willoughby be in arm against be cheerful certainly precisely solacing to fellow self esteem be not nearly so disheartening a feeling that be unequal to cope with difficulty must have to face how must cope with have never succeeded yet in keeping telson own fag in order how be to expect to administer discipline to scapegrace of willoughby must be bad enough even if monitor a body be working with when be left almost single handed a seemed probable what chance be there must do supposing boy be reported to for offence such a going out of bound by way

schoolhouse pair oar caused little astonishment merriment among various early visitor who usually frequented water of craydle despite unflattering remark despite constant terror be in of piloting boat into bank running foul of other boat riddell decidedly enjoyed little outing more so a exercise occupation drove away entirely for time thought of coming visit of ill behaved junior a soon a returned to school prospect of ordeal began again to haunt spoilt morning chapel for completely a stood during service in captain place must not prevent eye wandering hurriedly down rank of boy opposite wondering how many of must be called upon to interview in study before term be over a reached end of array eye rested on telson close to door talking laughing behind hand with parson who listened in unconcerned way looked about a if felt to be monarch of surveyed be two of boy who must wait upon in study immediately after prayer riddell turned quite miserable at idea prayer ended at last while other monitor repaired to sixth form room to discus presentation of petition a narrated in last chapter riddell walked dejectedly to study prepared to receive company one came for long time riddell be beginning to hope that after dreaded interview be not to come off that there be mistake somewhere one else be to deal with culprit instead of when scuttling of footstep down passage made blood run cold heart sink into boot must be cool said to fiercely a knock sounded at door will make fool of come in in response to somewhat tremulous invitation telson parson bosher lawkins king trooped into study picture of satisfaction assurance stood lounging about room with hand in pocket a though curiosity be sole motive of visit riddell while waiting for have hastily considered what ought to say do now idea ever have darted from mind gazed nervously at small company oh said at length breaking silence by tremendous effort conscious that be looking a confused a felt suppose be boy yes said bosher leaning complacently against table staring at picture over mantelpiece boy who be late said riddell stammering let see here took up paper began to read over co pri telson sh ' ah yes telson be late be why be late question like be decidedly novelty wyndham formula have invariably be telson hold out hand then if telson have anything to remark be at liberty to do so to be thus invited to make excuse

fellow rather said parson spanking race be held up to down willow reach be just collaring for finish up to balsham weir when beast pulled in funked then of course must get back in time said lawkins be jolly fagged be fellow be plant of schoolhouse cad fight said telson menacingly oh beg pardon old man did mean ran up on purpose to make late ask be beastly low trick then coming back continued telson ran down old parrett in skiff spilt have to fish out did chap that made late ask parrett be potted for last night riddell listened to in bewildered way not knowing what to make of if boy story be correct there certainly might be force in excuse must hardly be fair to punish if be decoyed out of way by senior then of course story about mr parrett must never make up story like if be true well did not see how must have done otherwise than stay help out of water after capsizing into really seemed to a if boy did not deserve to be punished true telson parson have be twice late week be not what be reported for now question be be to be chastised for third offence not what did mr parrett do to asked presently oh said parson gaily fully taking in situation so far be down on hot be stopped

what be hoped youthful audience did not remain to hear have vanished with amazing celerity captain a walked pensively up to door shut must hear marching jauntily down passage shouting laughing over morning adventure moment reflection satisfied riddell that have be done by unscrupulous youngster have let off on own representation without taking due care to verify story now must go out to willoughby that new captain be fool that one who liked must be late for call over if only have ingenuity to concoct plausible story when be reported nice beginning to new reign riddell saw clearly now when be too late why ever have not seen a clearly at time be too late riddell went to door again looked down passage young malefactor be out of sight footstep voice be still audible have better summon back have not better at cost to own pride own have made mistake rather than let discipline of willoughby run down took few hurried step in direction of voice be even making up mind to run when suddenly occurred to what if after story have be true calling of back must be greater mistake even than letting of off awkward doubt drove back once more to study where shutting door flung into chair in state of abject despondency shame twenty time determined to go to doctor at once refuse for hour longer to play farce of being captain of willoughby a often spirit kept back whispered to that be only coward who gave in at single failure from unpleasant reflection summons to first school be welcome diversion gladly shook off captain for hour figured in more congenial part of scholar even here be not allowed wholly to forget new responsibility nearly around be fellow monitor who have just come smarting from doctor summary rejection of petition riddell must tell by angry look ill tempered word that however innocent be object of irritation have never be favourite before certainly be not pleasant to have to learn now by most unmistakable sign that be downrightly unpopular disliked by from whom must have have warmest backing up yet strange to say be sense of own unpopularity more than anything nerved to resolution to stick to post come what must of do best to discharge new unwelcome task if only must feel little more sure of how be likely must feel sure of after lamentable failure of morning lamentable failure of morning a happened be nothing to other failure speedily to follow on same unlucky day scarcely be riddell back in study after first school hoping for little breathing space in to recover fluttered spirit when gilks entered said say there be row going on in fourth 'd better stop doctor will be down on so saying vanished leaving captain about a comfortable with piece of intelligence a must have be with bombshell suddenly pitched into study row in fourth headquarters of limpet one of whom be stronger man than whom wyndham have often be put to to keep within bound with ominous shiver riddell put on cap sallied out in direction of fourth man about to throw over precipice must hardly have looked le cheerful gilks report have certainly be well founded for long before captain reached destination roar of battle sounded up passage may have be ordinary limpet row may have be special diversion got up with connivance of one two unfriendly monitor for special benefit of new captain be that a may be disturbance calling for instant suppression idea of riddell going to suppress be ridiculous even to opened door unnoticed by combatant within on account of noise dust be impossible to tell what fight be about blood on side be evidently up battle be clear be anything mock one riddell stood there for time bewildered unrecognised spectator must be useless for to attempt to make heard above din worse than useless to attempt single handed to interpose between combatant only thing to do seemed to be to wait till battle be over then thought riddell what must be use of interfering when be over duty be to stop stop must with resolve taking advantage of momentary lull in conflict advanced with desperate effort towards boy who appeared to be leader of one of two party who be gesticulating shouting at top of voice to encourage follower champion did not notice captain a approached when did mistook for one of enemy sprang at like young tiger knocking over just a rank once more closed battle began again what might have be riddell fate must be hard to say have not loud shout of man down there hold hard suddenly suspended hostility cry be never disregarded at willoughby even by most desperate of combatant one stood now impatiently where be waiting for obstruction to regain foot spectacle new captain of willoughby presented a with scared face dust covered garment rose slowly from floor be strange indeed be second two before one recognised then boy seemed not to be sure whether be not ghost so mysteriously have appeared in midst coming from one knew where a however true state of affair gradually dawned on loud shout of laughter rose on hand quarrel be at once forgotten in merriment occasioned by wonderful apparition riddell pale agitated stood where be a one in dream from be only aroused by voice shouting out amid laughter hullo where did come from what be row look at at same time fellow crowded round offered to brush down accompanying violent service with burst of equally violent merriment with hard effort riddell shook free stepped out of crowd please let go said just came to say there be too much noise laughter of limpet drowned rest in midst of retired miserably to door escaped in passage outside met bloomfield with wibberly game hurrying to scene of riot scarcely deigned to recognise with anything more than half curious half contemptuous glance one must stop row said bloomfield to companion a passed doctor will be down on stop bloomfield said wibberly will shut up for be unfortunate riddell heard except in few moment uproar from fourth form room suddenly ceased be not renewed what did bloomfield do morning when came into room asked riddell that evening of wyndham junior limpet in whom for brother sake new captain felt special interest whom invited a often a liked to come prepare lesson with oh said wyndham who have be one of combatant gave watkins cattermole hiding swore 'd allow remove from limpet eleven to school second term if there be more row reply by mean added to riddell comfort gave cattermole watkins hiding fancy attempting to give cattermole watkins hiding not only that have held out awful threat about limpet cricket appeared to have magical effect fancy effect of threatening to exclude limpet from second eleven when be all knew that school have second eleven difficulty perplexity have loomed before in morning be closing around now in grim earnest worst have feared have happened more than worst be now proved beyond doubt that be utterly incompetent must not be sheer madness in to attempt impossible task day longer reader have doubt asked same question long ago of course be madness of to attempt muff like riddell never must be captain of school be bosh to suppose must be dear reader muff like riddell be captain of school what be more did give up even after day adventure just described riddell be not perfect know be unheard of thing for good boy in story book not to be perfect be one reason convinces story of mine must be impossible one riddell be not perfect have fault can believe have many fault even have besetting sin that besetting sin be pride not sort of pride make consider better than neighbour riddell really must think that even have wished pride be of kind wo admit of anybody to help must sooner knock head to bit against stone wall than own ca get through can never bring to say be beaten even when be clear to world be beaten pride have have fall day at rate have risen again more stubborn than ever if riddell went to bed that night most unhappy boy in willoughby went there also resolving more than ever to remain captain other event have happened that day one might suppose must have convinced be attempting impossibility must be reserved for next chapter chapter eight willoughby parliament in session parliament at willoughby be one of very old institution of school old white headed willoughbites when talking of remote schooldays must often recall exploit on floor of house when pilligrew now cabinet minister brought in famous bill to abolish morning chapel in winter be opposed by jilson now ambassador to court at whereisit in speech two hour long when old coates grandfather by way of present bearer of name in school divided house fifteen time in one afternoon on question of presenting requisition to head master to put more treacle into suet pudding be exciting day custom have gone on flourishing up to present willoughby parliament be institution master of school wisely connived at while holding aloof from proceeding there be restraint a to question to be discussed manner time of discussion provided rule of school be not infringed management be entirely in hand of boy who elected own officer paid sixpence term for privilege of seat in august assembly proceeding be regulated by certain rule handed down by long tradition according to business of house be modelled a closely a possible on procedure of house of common boy be supposed to represent place other marvellous be scouring of atlas geography book to discover constituency for young member there be government opposition of course only in case of former minister be elected by vote of whole assembly at beginning of session be designated by title of office there be premier home secretary first lord of admiralty so on great be pride of willoughbite when first heard referred to a right honourable everything came before house have to come in form of bill resolution one anxious to bring up subject there be nothing to prevent junior fag bringing in bill if liked usually handed in motion early in session so a to stand good chance of getting date for discussion later on when more subject be handed in than there be evening to debate order be decided by ballot due notice given friday of business for next evening feature of meeting be of course question one be entitled to question government on matter affecting school putting answering of question be usually most entertaining part of evening business naturally enough be not always easy to decide to whose department many of question asked belonged tradition have settled to extent home secretary have to answer question about monitor first lord of admiralty about boat secretary of state for war about fight so on while more doubtful question be usually first asked of premier who if did find convenient to answer be entitled to refer inquirer to other member of government need hardly be said that meeting of willoughby parliament be occasionally more noisy than dignified yet there existed certain sense of order respect for authority of house held member in check prevented meeting from degenerating into riot reason for same result existed in doctor who sanctioned parliament only a long a be conducted in orderly manner did not offend against rule of school final more terrible reason still be in fact that house have power of expelling member who be generally obnoxious session at willoughby always opened on saturday after may sport notice have be duly given that parliament must assemble year on usual date that first business must be election of speaker government reader will easily understand under present circumstance unusual amount of interest curiosity centred in opening meeting of school senate at hour of meeting big dining hall arranged after model of great house of common be in spite of fact that be summer evening densely

seat a soon a silence must be restored said be much obliged to for vote hope willoughby wo go down will try to prevent for one loud cheer be very proud to be elected speaker feel quite a much honour a if be captain of school loud cry of so be from parrett in reference to what one gentleman said about hope wo believe be twelfth in classic laughter from schoolhouse terrific applause from parrett be have to say remaining business of afternoon be dull compared with what have gone before election for various post in government did not excite very much enthusiasm especially among junior who deserted meeting soon after began after what have occurred be hardly to be wondered at that partisan of bloomfield parretts have matter pretty much in own hand used to own advantage when list be finally declared be found that only one schoolhouse fellow porter have place in cabinet be appointed chancellor of exchequer game be first lord of admiralty wibberly war secretary ashley home secretary strutter comparatively obscure boy premier a well a other officer appointed be parrett fellow who may have flattered election be simple recognition of merit in case who taken altogether be long way off being most distinguished boy of willoughby parliament did not adjourn till late hour that evening one be particularly sorry when did chapter nine scientific afternoon in welch pil said cusack few day after unfortunate end to gentleman motion in parliament pil strike can do pretty much a like time what do think well know said pil meditatively got pot from coates to day for playing five against schoolhouse door oh yes of course if fool about out of door will get potted what mean be indoors here there be one to pull up can see oh see what mean said pil yes be about right there gully know continued cusack gully good a master of house be always grubbing over book bless heart doe matter to whether cut one throat not dare say 'd be rather glad if did replied pilbury then there be tucker fear of reporting eh rather not when be always breaking rule slinking down to shellport kicking up row with other chap what do think found in brush comb bag other day thirteen cigar end go about collecting in shellport suppose finish up on quiet oh be beast said cusack old silk about a bad doe care bit what do a long a enjoys suppose 'd be down on do fear might pot now then for appearance sake must report guess suppose did said cusack new captain a big muff a lot of put together be afraid to look at chap did hear what did to parrett kid other day yes did exclaimed pilbury let off begged pardon something be jolly glad parrett be down on be stopped river play wo be able to show up at regatta be jolly glad said cusack chap like deserve to catch pil rather replied pilbury silence ensued during hero be doubtless meditating upon unexampled iniquity of parrett junior presently pilbury observed somewhat dolefully beastly slow be cusack what be beastly slow oh everything fun kicking up row if there be one to pull up be getting sick of row cusack stared at friend with rather concerned look must not be well surely must never come out with sentiment like fact be continued pilbury contemplatively balancing on one foot on corner of fender have notion to go in for being steady term old man just for change a if to suit action to word fender suddenly capsized under shot head first into waistcoat of friend cusack solemnly restored to foot replied rather rum start be well said pilbury examining shin to see if have be grazed by treacherous fender see what else there be to do chap can fool about be fagged of fooling about ai know said cusack doubtfully be not such lark a used to be certainly what do say to going steady term asked pilbury depends on what mean by steady if mean never going out of bound using crib be not game oh mean that know said pilbury what mean be shutting up row sort of thing what can fellow do asked cusack dubiously oh lot to do know said pilbury domino know spellicans have got box at home jolly slow always playing domino said cusack spellicans well then there be hold hard broke in cusack struck with sudden idea what be name of thing old philpot always at what chemistry jolly good idea old man let go in for not bad lark said cusack lot of explosion thing philpot told must make pharaoh serpent smell like rotten egg will get to coach eh pil be game said pil le delighted than friend at happy thought full of new idea of going steady two worthy forthwith sallied out made hue cry for philpot unless philpot in leisure moment be engaged in predatory expedition happened to be serving term of imprisonment in detention room be pretty safe guess to look for in laboratory where a ardent student of science be permitted to resort within certain limit practise for philpot bore office of second under bottle washer in willoughby be assisted boy who assisted chemistry fag who assisted assistant master to science master on strength of distinction be allowed special privilege in way of improving in favourite branch of study be on whole rather promising pupil have very fair idea of property of several substance be allowed to experiment with indeed have have to pas examination perform experiment in presence of master before be allowed to enter laboratory a private student at one knew exactly how distinguished on occasion how succeeded with experiment be well known that if have succeeded then have never done so since be according to anybody idea own cusack pilbury found busy blowing through tube into bottle of water looking very like purple cherub bursting at cheek be so engrossed with task that did not even notice entry indeed be not till pilbury have stepped behind clapped suddenly on side of face making cheek explode like small balloon spilling content of bottle over table that became aware that have visitor what frightful idiot be pilbury exclaimed have spoilt that whole experiment wish 'd shut up fooling get out awfully sorry old man said pilbury did look so jolly puffed out know did cusack now have done 'd better hook said philpot have not got leave to come here oh be riled said cusack fact be pil came to see if 'd put up to thing two in sort of business have gone on steady phil know explained pilbury in conciliatory tone thought must be rather jolly if three worked up little chemistry together 'd watch do thing at first of course said cusack till twigged dodge must be jolly good practice for know in case ever old mix up be laid up have to lecture instead philpot regarded two must be pupil doubtfully softened considerably a went on will have to promise not to fool said presently there will be row oh rather wo touch anything without asking will pil replied cusack awfully brickish of philpot philpot took compliment very complacently two student settled one on side of table waited for operation to begin wire in old man said pilbury encouragingly cut jaw know start with experiment ca give jolly flare up to begin with serene said philpot who have now quite recovered humour be pleased to find in position of instructor of youth wait bit then reached down from shelf large saucer containing water in lay round substance rather like end of stick of peppermint rock on philpot began to operate with pair of scissors greatly to amusement of spectator for try must must get hold of be trying to do said cusack cut bit off said philpot trying to stick substance with long bodkin in order to hold steady why be not way to cut old dolt said pilbury here will do advanced to saucer what will do why fish out of course cut then 'd better not try be phosphorus be though what doe do burn rather unless keep in water ah got at last so saying philpot triumphantly spiked obstinate piece of phosphorus succeeded in cutting off small piece be that what make flare up asked cusack yes wait bit till get jar what jar asked pilbury here be one will do look out say exclaimed philpot in great excitement let go will what be row asked pilbury cusack in alarm why be got oxygen in cried philpot securing bottle gently lifting on to table taking care to hold glass plate covered mouth in place got what in asked cusack oxygen took hour to get there be nothing in empty jar said pilbury laughing be there though said philpot be full mean to say that jar full of something said cusack look here try to stuff up what be use of saying be full when be empty be full of gas tell said philpot talk till know rebuke somewhat silenced two devotee of science who however continued to regard jar sceptically rather contemptuously philpot next dived into drawer drew from large cork through passed long wire having small cup at lower end now look out said proceeded to shovel small piece of phosphorus into little cup under cork drawing out of water applied light phosphorus lit up immediately at same instant slipped glass plate off mouth of oxygen jar clapped cork with wire cup hanging down from in place effect be magical moment phosphorus be introduced into oxygen flared up with brilliancy perfectly dazzled spectator made entire jar look like one mass of light two pupil be delighted philpot be complacently triumphant when of sudden there be loud report illumination suddenly ceased jar broken to piece collapsed pilbury cusack who at first alarm have retreated somewhat suddenly to door returned a soon a perceived there be danger be profuse in praise of experiment experimenter awfully prime that be cried cusack be pil stunning said pilbury jolly grind that jar bursting up though said philpot with troubled countenance why be that part of show off asked pilbury part of show off exclaimed philpot thought be best part of said cusack so did end of bust up be see said philpot solemnly what ought to have done be to dilute oxygen with little air first fellow flurried so forgot about jolly glad did 'd have missed bust up said cusack say ca try now know way to do quite well proposal philpot flatly declined to accede to must only appease disappointment by promising to perform one other experiment for benefit be of rather elaborate nature operator first placed in saucer stuff explained be iodine on to poured from small bottle smelt uncommonly like smelling salt small quantity of liquid then proceeded to stir concoction up two student be not to be restrained from offering service at point philpot yielded after have stirred to heart content philpot ordered to desist let stand bit consented to do occupied interval in taking down smelling bottle within reach with hardihood frightened wit out of poor philpot look here said when presently pilbury suddenly dropped one bottle with crash to floor began violently spitting choking promised must touch anything will shut up if go on fooling more serf right pil so doe be time before unfortunate pil recovered from result of unlucky experiment even when did odour from broken bottle be so offensive that window have to be opened wide before atmosphere of room became tolerable must have taken so long only be deemed advisable to shut door at same time to prevent smell getting outside telling tale to school at large by time pleasant diversion be disposed of concoction in saucer have recovered from stirring philpot declared be ready to go ahead with therefore placed saucer upside down upon one carefully strained off between two liquid leaving only black powder in saucer announced be iodide of nitrogen jolly rum name said cusack what doe do wait bit said philpot scooping wet powder up with end of knife spreading out on small separate piece of paper fellow born chemist said pilbury watching admiringly be just what old joram doe at dispensary what be spread out for to dry said philpot why stick on shovel hold over gas suggested cusack jolly fag waiting till dry oh wo be long said philpot what be going to do when be done asked cusack hope will flare up like other said pilbury ought to said philpot ought hurrah say cusack what jolly clever beggar old phil be be rather said admiring cusack perching on side of table swinging leg to pas time oh said philpot condescendingly only want little practice rather mean to practise hard cusack cusack said yes did proceeded to prowl round laboratory in manner made philpot very uncomfortable be relief to party when powder be at last pronounced to be dry now said philpot taking up one of small paper gently on flat of hand will have to be careful little lot wo make flare suggested pilbury let have two three at once so saying lifted up one of other paper emptied content into paper on philpot hand look out said philpot will blow up eh what cried cusack jumping off table in excitement at glorious news a did so philpot uttered cry be accompanied by loud crackling explosion dense volume of blue smoke made boy turn pale with terror for moment neither of must move utter sound except philpot who danced round round room in smoke howling wringing hand when at last did recover presence of mind enough to inquire of preceptor if be injured be in tone of terrible alarm oh phil old man be hurt what be be so awfully sorry be hand blown off said philpot continuing to wring injured hand otherwise considerably recovered be fault jumping off table beastly stuff go off almost if look at be lucky be dry might have have eye out be great relief to find matter be worse that in very few minute philpot hand have recovered from smart of explosion accident however decided young enthusiast for present have perhaps have enough chemistry for one lesson in few day however have sufficiently got over shock of last afternoon experiment to decide on fresh venture lesson continued on off during rest of term can hardly be said that by end of term pilbury cusack knew more about chemistry than have known first day persistently refused to listen to of philpot jaw a rudely termed attempt at explanation confined to experiment however though in many respect wasted time over new pursuit volatile youth might have be good deal worse employed in fact if welcher have be no worse employed that house must not have brought discredit on willoughby did a be everybody there seemed to follow own sweet will without single thought for good of school welfare of fellow head of house tucker silk did not even attempt to set good example that being so be hardly to be expected below must be much interested to supply deficiency on very afternoon when pilbury cusack have be sitting at foot of learned philpot in laboratory silk monitor have along with gilks of schoolhouse monitor too gone down to shellport against rule taking wyndham junior one of special protege with appeared to be pretty familiar with in out of big town though on occasion occupied time in more disgraceful way than waiting on harbour pier to see mail steamer come in yet felt three of a if must by mean like to be seen by one who knew appeared a if be going to be spared embarrassment for encountered one knew till be actually on way home then just a be passing station door met to horror boy in college cap just coming out with parcel under arm to astonishment proved to be other than riddell riddell who have come down by special permit from doctor to get parcel containing by way new boating flannel at first looked a astonished uncomfortable a three truant must sooner have have anything happen to than meeting however a usual sense of duty came to rescue advanced to group in nervous manner addressing wyndham said hurriedly please come to room evening wyndham then without waiting for reply staying to notice ominous look of two monitor departed proceeded a fast a must back to willoughby chapter ten wyndham junior friend wyndham old captain just before leaving willoughby have done best to interest riddell in welfare of young brother limpet in fourth wish 'd look after now then riddell said be not bad fellow fancy be not got quite enough ballast on board unless there be one to look after be very likely to get into bad hand riddell promised must do best elder brother be most grateful will be ever so much easier now said be awfully good of riddell must care for young 'un to go wrong know thanks very much old man so came to pas that among legacy old captain left behind at one fell to riddell be young brother slightly rickety in character short of ballast parting request like wyndham must have be very hard for friend to refuse to riddell promise to look after young wyndham meant great deal more than must have done to many other fellow be not enough for to make occasional inquiry a to young protege even to try to shield when fell into scrape riddell idea of looking after rickety youngster included good deal more than from moment old captain have left amid own tribulation adversity thought of young wyndham have saddled on riddell conscience with uncomfortable weight be reason why made boy free of study gave up good deal of own time in helping with work be same reason prompted on afternoon spoken of in last chapter much against inclination to accost three truant in shellport request wyndham to come to study be in for nice sermon boy said gilks a three walked home wish have seen said wyndham feeling uncomfortable why suppose will lick said silk laughing will be awfully vexed vexed cried gilks poor fellow how 'd like to comfort take advice forget about going to study will not be sorry can tell must go said wyndham want to offend kind of said silk laughing funny thing how considerate fellow can be to fellow who doe lesson for wyndham blushed said nothing knew two companion be not sort of boy brother must have cared to have associate with did particularly like when two senior boy take trouble to patronise junior make fun of peculiarity a called scruple be hardly surprising that youngster come out good way to meet patron wyndham by way be rather more than youngster be limpet looked back on day of fagging a long closed chapter of history have be junior like telson pilbury must have be le likely game silk must take such trouble to cultivate acquaintance that must submit so easily to patronage a be be own master nobody have right to demand service have yet attained to responsibility of monitor must please therefore yielded unquestioningly to somewhat flattering attention of two senior not quite unquestioningly short a be time since brother have left have be long enough for riddell to let boy see that wished to be friend have never told so in word wyndham must guess what kind interest new captain evinced in meant be thought of kept alive one two scruple still retained in joining to society of gilks silk so declined invitation of two friend to defy captain summons well said gilks if must put head into lion mouth must must silk say a be to get pulled up see why must have fun can for money what do say to game of skittle at beamish what nice boy be said silk laughing young 'un doe know beamish not know beamish at aquarium said gilks what be inquired wyndham be aquarium said gilks laughing do play skittle in aquarium asked boy rather said silk amuses fish know beamish be a gilks have said name for shellport aquarium disreputable place of resort whose only title to name of aquarium be that have in in obscure corner nobody ever explored small tank might have contained fish if there have be put into a be last thing one went to beamish for be to study fish other attraction of place skittle bowl refreshment bar being far more popular thing in of course be not enough to make beamish bad place that character be supplied by company be mostly in habit of frequenting of be enough to say be very reverse of select at time of day however place be almost empty when after good deal of chaff persuasion wyndham be induced to take little turn round place be surprised to find so quiet unobjectionable boy have short game at skittle short game at bowl bought few bun ice at refreshment stall then departed schoolwards reached willoughby in good time for call over one except riddell being aware of pleasant expedition still wyndham when be over did not feel altogether comfortable not that thought what have done be very bad that have sinned in deceiving master breaking rule of school what troubled be that knew riddell must be vexed repaired to captain study with book a usual after evening chapel found busy over work a soon a boy entered riddell pushed paper away rather nervously well wyndham said be glad have come wyndham deposited book looked rather uncomfortable riddell have rather hoped boy must refer to subject first did not riddell therefore said be sorry to see down in shellport afternoon wyndham have permit have said wyndham be hardly thing be said captain quietly after pause voice devoid of anger self importance made wyndham still more uncomfortable be awfully sorry said suppose ought to have gone beg pardon riddell oh said riddell do that please know said wyndham a two took did seem to be much harm only went to see steamer come in thing be said riddell be against rule gilks silk be monitor be be said captain with touch of bitterness in tone there be pause time long one boy seemed inclined to return to subject wyndham opened book made pretence of beginning work riddell fidgeted with paper before in mind of latter hurried debate be going on have better do might send up to doctor perhaps get expelled might be best thing for too for if two have got hold of be sure to go wrong ca do anything to keep from yet promised old wynd must try might help to keep straight god help be reader astonished that captain of great public school must so far forget a to utter secret prayer in own study about matter a correction of young scapegrace be unusual thing to do certainly probably if wyndham have known what be passing in captain mind must have thought more poorly of brother friend than did be not quite sure reader whether riddell be committing such absurdity a person might think whether other fellow in similar position must be worse for forgetting in same way what do think be worth thinking over when have time god help said riddell to felt mind wonderfully cleared already a said clearer be a to what ought to do still rather embarrassed a to how to do meant to try say wyndham said in quiet way want to ask advice what about asked wyndham looking up in surprise about fellow not exactly be more about myself said captain what about asked wyndham why there be fellow in school be awfully anxious to do good to began riddell rather common failing of yours said wyndham wanting to do be more common than doing said riddell know how to tackle fellow wyndham who be do know asked boy be not sure that know particularly well said captain be not bad fellow in fact have lot of good in be limpet asked wyndham continued riddell not noticing question be got horrid fault wo stand up for wyndham oh observed wyndham there be lot of like regular coward be exactly fellow one of be always funking wyndham laughed know who mean tedbury be be not name said riddell be nicer sort of fellow than tedbury there be one two fellow be always down on too see be pluck so think can do what like with meekins get good deal mauled about by of others said wyndham fellow get good deal more damaged than meekins said captain in fact get so mauled friend will soon hardly be able to recognise wyndham looked sharply at speaker riddell be quite grave serious proceeded quietly worst of be fellow quite well able to stick up for if like must easily hold own only be lazy else like getting damaged be making up demanded wyndham colouring riddell took notice of inquiry continued rather more earnestly now 'd like advice wyndham old fellow want to do fellow good turn do suppose must be best turn to do to pitch into fellow be always doing harm to try to persuade to stick up for not let do just what like with eh wyndham have seen before question be ended down head in silence riddell did not disturb waited quietly if truth be told anxiously till must reply presently boy looked up with troubled face said know be awful fool riddell be not obliged to be said captain cheerily will try not to be really will said wyndham only only what asked riddell after pause only somehow never think of at time know said kindly why only afternoon said wyndham drawn out by sympathy of companion tried to object to going down to town made up excuse so must have seemed like regular prig to hold out so went be awfully sorry now know be coward riddell ought to have stuck out think ought said riddell must probably have laughed at possibly tried to bully bit can take care of fancy when come to eh can about bullying said wyndham so said riddell really advise to say to fellow be telling about to stand up for not let be led about by one except riddell said boy said riddell not even ca profess to tell ought to do must like to know who can if ca said wyndham think know said riddell gravely conversation ended here for hour half after boy be busy over work spoke word thought may not have be in book before in fact may safely be said be not be thought did not require word only when wyndham rose to go wished friend good night riddell indirectly referred to subject of talk by way wyndham isaac have given up school librarianship suppose know how must like to take have fellow got to do asked wyndham have to issue new book monday collect old one saturday there be about one hundred boy subscribe order new book when give up old so be simple enough take lot of time doe said wyndham not very much believe isaac shirked good deal 'd have to keep list rather better than did fancy 'd enjoy rather added will be excuse for seeing le of not very nice friend wyndham said must take post went off happier in own mind than have be for long time leaving riddell happier too despite failure vexation elsewhere than have be since became captain of willoughby though happy must hardly be elated effort that evening have certainly be success how long must effect last riddell be not fool enough to imagine that promise to old wyndham be now discharged by one evening talk knew boy well enough to be sure that task be only just begun thankfulness at having made beginning be tempered with many anxiety for future might well be anxious for day two wyndham be altered boy surprised master by attention in class schoolfellow except riddell by steadiness of behaviour avoided former companion devoted with enthusiasm to new duty a librarian to doctor at riddell suggestion have appointed alteration approved of a be in many quarter be by mean appreciated by two boy at willoughby be not that cared twopence about society of young limpet that have moral objection to good behaviour steady work what irritated gilks silk over business be that saw in hand of enemy felt that present change in protege be due to riddell influence in opposition to own two monitor felt hurt at be like direct snub aimed at considering quarter from came did not like at sort of thing wo do said gilks to friend one day shortly after riddell talk with young cut acquaintance hope will recover in time said silk sneering be gone decidedly pi ' last week be reverend prig doing growled gilks mean to spoil little game for though added how will do asked silk be just wish knew said gilks oh leave to will get at somehow suppose be too far gone yet accordingly silk took early opportunity of meeting young friend ah wyndham said casually see much of now said wyndham shortly be busy with library oh be afraid though be rather glad of excuse to cut silk after row got into last week did get into row said wyndham what did lick for ah see how be be afraid 'd let out on for being down too rather good dodge too gilks half thought of reporting did have permit have oh yes rather doubt that just like brown town boy excuse writes be certain riddell must do such thing said wyndham warming never said must replied silk seeing be going little too far see captain want permit there be one to pull up say be awfully sorry about last week oh doe matter said wyndham who must not help being rather gratified to hear monitor making apology to only mean to go down again of course not if gilks suggests will back up by way added in tone of feigned alarm suppose did tell about going to beamish did said wyndham whose conscience have already reproached several time for not having confessed fact be awfully glad of said silk apparently much relieved do keep that quiet why said wyndham rather concerned dear fellow if got out well know what must happen why be bad place then oh not at laughed silk with mysterious wink serene for follows like gilks if be known 'd taken there 'd be done for wyndham began to feel have have narrow escape of doing for two patron without knowing promise wo tell anybody said silk of course wo said wyndham rather scornful at idea of telling tale of schoolfellow thanks will take care say nothing about gilks wo either know so will be all right know what possessed fellow to suggest going in there be somewhat perplexing to wyndham have never imagined beamish be such terrible place that penalty of being found there be so severe felt that have have fortunate escape be glad silk have put up to before have let out became more friendly with ally after there be always bond of attraction where common danger threatens wyndham felt that however determined be not to be led away more by friend of be just a well to be civil to so even accepted invitation to come have tea in silk room that evening to look at volume of punch latter have got from home to talk over coming boat race have overheard hurried conversation took place between silk gilks shortly afterwards in sixth form room must have looked forward to evening with anything eagerness well asked gilks hooked fancy said silk be coming to tea evening good man how did manage by way said silk that going to beamish last week be end of crime if be found out be expulsion remember belief have told wo let out on be promised not to say word about fancy have rather pull on there be jolly clever fellow silk said gilks admiringly may be be not such nice boy a be gilks chapter eleven schoolhouse boat at work giles ally knew business well enough to see that must go to work gingerly to recover lost limpet consequently when wyndham according to promise turned up to tea in silk study nothing be said done in way likely to offend lately awakened scruple tea be good one volume of punch be amusing talk confined almost altogether to school affair chiefly to coming boat race last subject be one of intense interest to young wyndham a brother to old captain be naturally eager to see brother boat retain old position on river a ardent schoolhouse boy have further reason for wishing same result know said think fellow be looking up gilks so fellow say replied gilks of course being in boat myself be hard to tell doe boat seem to be going better asked wyndham look to be going lot better from bank mean to say young un said silk ever expect schoolhouse will beat parrett be afraid be rather strong said wyndham regretfully strong said silk be finest crew willoughby turned out for year better even than one brother stroked last race mean winning too said gilks from hear be specially set on because think have be snubbed over captaincy mean to show be cock house though doctor wo own well said silk a have not much faith in welcher boat in fact be not sure if will be able to get up crew at feel delightfully impartial hope will back said wyndham earnestly of course old gilks be one of crew said silk know said boy 'd give anything for boat to win must be such score for after have be said must gilks well fellow have be very complimentary about schoolhouse lately certainly said gilks certainly have replied wyndham by way gilks what sort of cox doe riddell make rather amusing one from can hear said gilks be not steered four yet be have tub practice be beginning to find out that natural place for boat be between bank instead of on oh said wyndham heard fairbairn say promised very well be light weight know a junior be stopped river play will have to get cox if riddell will do wo be bad thing way be rather surprised did try for said gilks be well known know used to river oh 'd rather riddell did if can said wyndham know be awfully anxious to get up talk went on like trenched on uncomfortable topic only reference to anything of sort be when silk said just a wyndham be going oh wyndham have told gilks here that have promised not to let out about beamish yes said gilks must care for to get about young un oh of course wo say anything said wyndham thanks more will will silk replied gilks silk assented visitor departed young fool said gilks when friend be left alone be not worth bothering about if be for other prig 'd agree with said silk think can hit at reverence occasionally through disciple dare say said gilks young prig have innocent enough time of to night to suit even how doe talk yes be hot about race say gilks hope there will be mistake about parrett winning have lot of money on never fear said gilks will be rather rum thing if rowing in schoolhouse boat ca put drag on somehow expect for moment will be wanted if be gilks will be under painful necessity of catching crab mind how do a long a there be mistake about said silk with ungenerous admission gilks produced couple of cigar end from pocket two nice boy proceeded to spend dissipated evening reader will have guessed from what have already be said that coming boat race be day becoming more more exciting topic in willoughby under circumstance race be along with may sport cricket match against rockshire one of event of year year ever since have come somehow to be mixed up with squabble about captaincy jealousy between parrett schoolhouse have become more important than ever old wyndham have of course left schoolhouse boat at head of river there be scarcely boy even in schoolhouse who seriously expected must remain there over coming regatta parrett fellow be already crowing in anticipation victory of bloomfield boat be only waited for a final ground for resisting authority of captain own boat be certainly one of best school have turned out compared with competitor seemed a if nothing short of miracle must prevent triumph schoolhouse fellow little a expected to win be meaning to make hot fight of be on mettle quite a much a rival ever since wyndham have left schoolhouse have be sneered at a having pretension left to athletic distinction meant to put right in particular if not in victory at rate in gallant attempt so schoolhouse boat might be seen out early late doing honest hard work doing well too strict training be order of day scarcely day passed without one of crew adding to usual labour cross country run hard grind in big tub to better form extraordinary exertion be source of amusement to opponent who felt own superiority more by witnessing effort put forth to cope with even in schoolhouse there be not few who regarded work a labour thrown away a only adding in prospect to glorification of enemy however fairbairn be not man to be moved by small consideration such a did not care what fellow said how much laughed a long a porter swung out well at reach forward coates straightened back gilks pulled oar better through from beginning to end to secure end be game for amount of work trouble cold water must damp ardour hopefulness chief sensation with regard to training of schoolhouse boat be sudden appearance of riddell a coxswain a reader have heard new captain have already be out once twice on quiet in pair oar during expedition have learned all knew of art of navigation idea of steering schoolhouse boat have never occurred either to fairbairn when first undertook practice at solicitation of friend after lesson two showed such promise that idea did strike fairbairn who mentioned to one two of set asked advice judge be horrified naturally at idea riddell be too heavy too clumsy too nervous fairbairn be to give up idea so went to mr parrett asked if must mind running with schoolhouse pair oar during next morning spin watching steering of new captain mr parrett did so be not little pleased with performance advised fairbairn to try in four oar before deciding fairbairn delighted immediately broached subject to friend poor riddell be astounded at notion cox schoolhouse boat in regatta dear fellow said to fairbairn be not very exalted personage in willoughby a be must be finishing stroke what do mean that be infra dig to cox boat oh said riddell anything that might be infra dig for boat to be steered into bank in middle of race humbug if be only reason anyhow old man come down try hand in four to morrow morning riddell protested that idea be absurd that must hear of fairbairn reasoned down have steered into bank since second morning have tried steering four oar how did know must do mr parrett have advised trial strongly so on said only question be weight 'd have to run off bit of that know oh said riddell a to that can take a many pound off a like none of buts old man said fairbairn say if only be to win with a cox what score must be none of ifs ' old man said riddell laughing will come to morrow if be determined to have way of course be said fairbairn conversation took place evening that young wyndham be taking tea with silk gilks in study of former intelligence that new captain be to be taken out to steer schoolhouse boat mysteriously got wind before evening be over spread over school like wildfire consequently when riddell arrived at boat house in morning be surprised horrified to find nearly willoughby be awake down at river bank to see be embarrassing certainly when presently crew got into seat start be made became evident new coxswain be anything at home in new position boat be long time getting clear of landing stage owing to persistently mistaking in flurry right hand for left then when did get out into mid stream same reason prevented from discovering that reason why boat must turn round instead of going straight be because have right cord pulled hard whole time spectacle a may be imagined afforded intense gratification to curious onlooker many hilarious be shout fell on ear of unlucky captain oh well coxed there one voice cried well steered in circle shouted mind knock bank down yelled third pull right there try without rudder see if steer better way in midst of uncomplimentary shout boat slowly wended erratic course up river amidst crowd of boy on bank riddell old man said fairbairn leaning forward from place at stroke what be row only needed friendly voice to recall captain to by effort forgot about crowd turned deaf ear to shout straightening taking line steadily in hand looked up quietly at friend richard be again now then cried fairbairn to men behind row led off with long steady stroke for little distance boat travelled well riddell kept good course whole crew worked steadily scoffer on bank be perplexed jeer died away feebly be not crew of muff assuredly first twenty thirty yard be rowed in style not very far short of parrett standard parson best cox of parrett house must hardly have taken boat down reach in better course there be something ominous in to great relief of unfriendly critic showy lead be not maintained before hundred yard be completed something seemed to go wrong in boat rolled heavily wavered in course what be wrong fault be certainly not in fairbairn who kept doggedly to work in perfectly even style to appearance be in riddell be evidently puzzled by sudden unsteadiness of boat one must lay to charge who be that digging behind cried fairbairn over shoulder none of other three owned soft impeachment boat seemed to right of own accord fairbairn whose temper be never improved by perplexity quickened stroke gave men spell of hard work for bit to punish seemed to have good effect once again onlooker be startled to see how steadily

approved of by most of schoolhouse partisan particularly who have watched proceeding of morning few thought gilks might have be accorded second chance majority argued that if fellow caught crab like in practice must probably do in race did not want risk of a to excuse about steering one who knew anything about knew meant nothing gilks did not repeat a reached school silk met with angry look be true what hear said that be out of boat yes be growled gilks why idiot have done for did nothing wanted to get rid of did yes because have ordinary sense to keep up appearance till race must begin to

boat be sorry played fool morning then be playing fool demanded fairbairn to whom riddell have just be confiding that perhaps after there have be fault in steering to account for yes said gilks sullenly then said fairbairn hotly may be fool wo be such big one a to let stay in boat day gilks glared moment at speaker evidently must be no use to argue plead further smarting with rage humiliation none le keen riddell have be present heard turned away will be sorry for two growled humbug well rid of said fairbairn a soon a have gone yes think much of said riddell thinking a much of young wyndham temptation a of schoolhouse boat well old man said fairbairn after pause steered awfully well when once began made so shaky at first usual complaint said riddell smiling be thinking what other people be thinking oh said fairbairn unless can give up may a well shut up shop altogether well if must do one other think will keep shop open said riddell cheerily by way added looking at watch sighing have to see junior in study in two minute good bye be sure be down for tub practice afternoon will be there said riddell chapter twelve bloomfield in tribulation bloomfield be beginning to discover already that new dignity to have be raised by own partisan at willoughby be anything bed of rose vain easily led a be be not bad fellow by mean when mutiny against new captain first began flattered that by allowing to be set up in opposition be really doing service to willoughby securing school against great many disaster be certain to ensue if riddell be left supreme in lofty hope be getting to be trifle disappointed in own house of course especially among over whom be wont to rule in athletic sport authority be paramount after constituted only small section of willoughby over rest of school influence be strangely overlooked even terror of arm failed to bring subject to obedience be very well at first when one idea be indignation against doctor new appointment a soon a malcontent discovered that have raised one more tyrant over own head began to find out mistake did best to correct argued that a have elected bloomfield be bound to obey unless chose when came to point of having to give up own will in obedience to remembered be not real captain of willoughby have right to order so poor bloomfield did not find thing quite a comfortable a have expected one of first rebuff got be administered by le stately hand than of master telson of schoolhouse young gentleman ever since last unfortunate expedition in noah ark have be somewhat under cloud forced absence from river for whole week have preyed upon spirit when at end of period did revisit old haunt armed with captain permit be only to discover small chance ever have of coxing house boat at coming regatta have vanished under new arrangement have brought riddell into boat be only fair to say that disappointment keen a be have effect on loyalty be a ready a ever to fight one who spoke ill of schoolhouse certainly have given jar resulted in rather strained relation with of old ally in parrett of course nothing must shake devotion to parson be secure whatever happened towards other hero of parrett particularly senior felt unfriendly conceived must have be victim of plot to prevent steering schoolhouse boat be only reason must think of for ill luck though never tried to argue out be pretty clear to own mind one be at bottom of if be so who more likely than bloomfield game that lot who have everything to gain by being turned out of rival boat be state of mind of aggrieved junior one afternoon not long before regatta a strolled dismally across big on way to river parson be not with be down coxing boat thought of only reminded telson of own bad luck added to ill temper be roused from moody reflection by approach of two boy who hailed cheerily what cheer telson old man cried king how jolly blue look what be row nothing replied telson have just be down to see boat awful spree to see old riddell steering be bosher yes said bosher be better than be never mind wo lick said king must have seen boat bless schoolhouse lout king will fight said telson suddenly oh beg pardon old man did eh what last remark be caused by fact that telson be taking off coat king utterly taken aback by ominous preparation protested sorrow apologised generally humiliated before offended schoolhouse junior telson have be looking out for cause of quarrel now one have come be just in humour for going through with business do funk asked oh not that old man said king still friendly very slowly unbuttoning jacket will apologise telson know want apologising want to fight said telson will take young bosher too oh said rather alarmed want to fight knew be beastly funk said telson scornfully be not said bosher meekly get out of way cried majestic telson brushing past towards king who now stood with coat off very apologetic face ready for young bantam disposal telson king fought there then be not very sanguinary contest be particularly scientific did telson good did not do king much harm only awkward thing about be that side knew exactly when to stop telson claimed victory after round king respectfully disputed statement telson thereupon taunted adversary with funking went at again very showy in action decidedly feeble in execution king by keeping one arm over face working other gently up down in front of body be able to ward off most of blow aimed aspired aimed to hit out fight might have lasted week have not game coming up way from boat caught sight of a be exciting combat profitable one parrett monitor considered good case for interfering a well a for calling in authority of popular captain king telson said stepping between combatant stop come to bloomfield study after chapel know fighting in big be against rule be to go to bloomfield for demanded telson whose temper be still disturbed for breaking rule said game a walked on will go said telson to king a two slowly put on coat yes suppose so will give licking sha go be not captain said telson say will catch if said king with apprehension in look be always down on if go to captain when be told tell be not captain replied telson testily sha go if want to report will have to do to riddell with virtuous decision went way slightly solaced in mind by fight still more consoled by prospect of row ahead telson be quite cute enough to see have strong position to start with if only played card well might score off enemy with credit therefore declined invitation to parson to partake of shrimp jam at tea kept in own house till time appointed for reporting to captain then instead of going to bloomfield presented before riddell well said captain in usual half apologetic tone oh said telson be reported please riddell what for who reported asked riddell game for fighting replied telson have told of 'd better come in morning oh be right said telson be fighting king in big afternoon riddell looked perplexed be first case of boy voluntarily delivering up to justice hardly knew what to do however have found out thus much by time that did so much matter what did a long a did something know be against rule said a severely a must be not first time have done must do fifty line of virgil stop in house on monday tuesday right thanks said telson rapidly departing leaving riddell quite bewildered by apparent gratitude of fag telson betook quietly to study began to write line be evident from restless way in looked up at footstep outside did not expect to remain long undisturbed at harmless occupation be disappointed in about ten minute king entered said say telson be in for be to go to bloomfield directly what be given licking said king stopped play week say 'd better go sharp be not going said telson what exclaimed king in amazement cut said telson be busy sent to fetch said king tell be not coming will lick king if cut king did cut in considerable state of alarm at foolhardiness of youthful comrade telson knew business sooner have king gone than took up virgil paper repaired once more to riddell study please riddell said meekly do mind writing line here not bit said riddell whose study be always open house to youthful fag telson said thank immediately deposited at table quietly continued work awaiting result of king message result be not long in coming telson shouted voice down passage in le than five minute telson went to door shouted back what be row where be said voice here replied telson shutting door resuming work who be asked riddell of fag know unless be game said telson now then telson cried voice again come here ca be busy shouted telson back from where sat at same moment door opened game entered in great state of wrath appearance of parrett monitor on duty in schoolhouse be always strange spectacle game when discovered into whose study have marched be trifle embarrassed what be game asked riddell civilly want telson said game who by way have scarcely spoken to new captain since appointment what do want said telson boldly why did come when be sent for demanded game who sent for bloomfield be not bloomfield fag retorted telson be riddell what did tell afternoon said game beginning to suspect that have fallen into trap told to go to captain after chapel what do mean by not going did go went to riddell told to go to bloomfield said game growing hot bloomfield not captain retorted telson beginning to enjoy riddell captain be fighting in big said game looking uneasily at riddell while spoke know be riddell potted for have riddell have given telson fifty line stopped play two day said riddell quietly yes be writing line now said telson dipping pen in ink scarcely smothering laugh game now fully aware of rebuff be glad of opportunity of covering defeat by diversion look here said walking up to telson did come here to be cheeked by can tell who be cheeking said telson be not yes be said game be not going to be humbugged about by want to humbug about replied junior defiantly think there be mistake know said riddell thinking right to interpose have given line for fighting in big there be really reason for going to bloomfield told to come to bloomfield ought to have come think have right to tell to go to bloomfield replied riddell with boldness astonished be responsible for stopping fight want to tell business retorted game hotly who be game must have thrashed captain a easily a must telson thought flashed through riddell mind a paused to reply must much have preferred saying nothing somehow present seemed to be sort of crisis in life if gave in now chance of asserting in willoughby might never return be captain replied steadily a long a be captain be responsible for order of school prefer to do own work there be something in look tone a uttered inoffensive word took game aback even startled telson be not at like what fellow have be used to from riddell certainly very unlike manner be generally credited with telson game be so amazed at little outburst a be speaker be half frightened moment have uttered now be in for with vengeance must go out to willoughby knew that meant to stand by gun what awful failure if after must not be able to keep word game with forced smile ill accorded with inward astonishment left study without word heedless even of laugh telson must no longer repress of course many perverted story of adventure immediately got abroad in willoughby telson highly coloured version made appear that pitched battle have be fought between game new captain resulting in defeat of former chiefly through telson instrumentality assistance a however narrative did not appear in same dress two hour running be soon taken for what be worth most fellow preferred to believe parretts version of story stated that riddell have announced intention of keeping order in willoughby without help of monitor have have cheek to tell bloomfield to mind own business indignation of parrett house on hearing such story may be imagined be even past joke bloomfield seriously offered to resign pretension to authority let thing take course make seem said a if wanted to stick up if be so sure of keeping order by see what use be pretending to do too must serve right if did so said game must be so awfully like giving in now after have once begun view of matter decided question bloomfield same be considerably impressed by what have happened knew in heart that only title to position assumed be whim of schoolfellow be usurper in fact however much tried to persuade be acting solely for good of willoughby knew motif be only half sincere in spite of effort school be a rowdy a ever if did thrash batch of junior one day stop disorderly limpet of play never seemed to make much impression whereas one two rioter whom riddell have ventured to tackle have somehow distinctly reformed habit how be bloomfield a thought thing over be not quite happy have be happier far last term when under old wyndham have exerted loyally for good of school be not exerting now why must be unhappy be not because felt beaten scorned idea that felt unequal to task before that too be preposterous yet felt certainly needed something if only now be first classic a well a captain of club what pull must have a thought occurred to also recalled crossfield famous speech at last parliament laughter have greeted must translate balbus hopped over wall without dictionary ah thought sometimes must try just to prove how slanderous crossfield insinuation have be result of cogitation be that bloomfield began to discover be not quite such round man a friend have told that being so have not better qualify like honest man for post did not like to confide idea to friend for fear of laughter for week two at least actually read rather hard on sly worst of be that till examination next term there must be nothing to show for for sixth did not change place day a lower form did there be chance of leaping to top at bound by lucky answer even of advancing single desk therefore however hard worked term must never rise above eighteenth classic in eye of school be not well must have liked to be little higher for sake of willoughby outlook be not encouraging even wibberly toady silk welcher be better men than be at classic suppose instead of spending energy over classic be to get up one two rousing speech for parliament must take shine out of one else carry school by storm be not bad idea chance must not come one must get up fine speech on hackneyed subject a rowing be finer sport than cricket that study of science in public school must be abolished when did attempt to prepare oration on subject of compulsory football first friend showed to pointed out so many fault in composition of first sentence prudence prompted to put effusion in fire meanwhile friend admirer kept busy delight seemed to be to seize on youngster must by pretext lay hand on hale to appear before by mean imagined be making authority known dealing serious blow at le obtrusive captain in schoolhouse poor bloomfield have to administer justice right left for imaginable offence be so watched prompted by officious admirer that be constantly losing head making ridiculous gave one boy thrashing for being found with paper dart in hand because game have reported to who have stolen book gave only twenty line because be in second eleven cusack welcher who be caught climbing schoolhouse elm one monday sentenced to hour detention pilbury whom caught in same act on tuesday deprived of play for week be said be not to leave house for week pilbury turned up very next day in big under very nose of parrett captain who did not even observe presence be sort of thing a term dragged on made bloomfield more more uncomfortable with position be very well for game ashley wibberly to declare for must have gone to dog be very well of to make game of caricature riddell failure seeing be believing bloomfield whose heart be honest whose common sense when left to be not altogether feeble must not help making unpleasant discovery that be not doing very much after for willoughby boat race be now coming on there at rate be sphere in need fear rival with parrett boat at head of river stroke must at rate have one claim on obedience of willoughby nobody must gainsay chapter thirteen telson parson go to evening party be saturday before boat race excitement of willoughby be working up hour boy who be generally in habit of lying in bed till chapel bell began to ring have be up at six for

position of being only day boarder in willoughby parent lived in shellport thus have benefit of constant society of dear harry while school on other hand be deprived of advantage for portion of day in term be probably to make up for deprivation that mr mr brown made practice of giving evening party once term to doctor lady be always invited also two of dear harry friend liked to name in way fond parent not only felt be doing polite neighbourly act to son schoolmaster schoolfellow that be also mean of bringing together teacher pupil in easy unconstrained manner must hardly be possible within

break silence of scene silence however be soon broken by loud double knock at hall door be signal for mr brown senior to bolt into room in guilty way with one cuff not quite buttoned stand on hearthrug with a free easy air a if have be waiting there quarter of hour at least knock followed knock in quick succession after usual amount of fluttering in hall greengrocer flung open drawing room door ushered in dr mr patrick miss stringer dozen other arrival two hero sitting side by side unnoticed on edge of sofa have full opportunity to take stock of various guest most of whom be stranger to a one appeared to be about doctor age thing promised slowly for parson telson whose interest in brown party decidedly languished when finally found swept off perch helplessly wedged into corner by impenetrable phalanx of skirt be nothing compared with discovery made at same time that have missed tea there be merry rattle of cup spoon in room far off through half open door of must catch glimpse of person drinking tea of brown handing round biscuit cake sight of be too much to be borne be at least worth effort to retrieve fatal mistake say said telson looking for friend round skirt of stately female have better go help brown parson luckless youth lady in question hearing unexpected voice at side backed little caught sight of speaker what dear said benevolently taking hand sitting down on sofa who be little man little man be fairly trapped there be escaping seizure parson got away safely to tea room sight of dodging about among cake cup only added to misery of hapless telson who be

not seen well for miss stringer did not guess wrath boiled in bosom of small companion do live here dear inquired pleased to have opportunity of studying juvenile human nature in be so much interested said telson surlily then suddenly recollecting be in polite though disagreeable company added ma'be where do go to school pray inquired spinster oh willoughby replied telson who have gradually given

deal with business single handed found once more stranded in drawing room gradually getting edged back by skirt when unlooked for distinction rescued from perilous situation distinction be none other

however stood to lose owing to outside position at corner parson however knew what be about even better than riddell who have kept magnificent course down reach who now seemed afraid to take full advantage of sharp corner parrett coxswain on other hand with half length to good began turning boat head early even at risk of running dangerously close on rival water so saved a much a possible of lost ground be anxious moment for a boat came round that corner so race usually depended crowd on bank well knew crisis shouted out warning encouragement to rival coxswain with redoubled eagerness now

demanded fresh race there then suggested foul play others urged boat to row on make best race must of others boldly claimed victory for parrett since led at moment of accident amidst tumult unlucky boat slowly backed into mid stream turned towards home parson steering no longer by rudder by word of mouth a did so distant report announced that schoolhouse boat have reached winning post whereat parrett partisan set up loud defiant shout maintained during entire homeward progress of ill starred boat among few who remained on scene of accident be gilks silk pale agitated latter a have be said be painfully interested in result of race to defeat of parrett meant more than mere disappointment of hope humiliation by rival meant loss of good deal more money than possessed miscarriage of good deal have expected with absolute confidence to win wonder then that face be white voice trembling a rounded on friend fool exclaimed with oath be rather hard surely on gilks who may have encouraged friend to rely on victory of parrett boat who certainly be a much astounded mortified by accident a be there must be race said hurriedly ca take a decisive tell must have must have said so if right

be something unusual in look manner of parretts coxswain even misadventure that afternoon be not sufficient to account for bore tidings of sort be evident by common consent clamour of crowd be suspended a approached among first to hail at shouting distance be telson what be up old man cried parson rushed on dozen yard so before answered then yelled in voice half choked with excitement line be cut be foul play howl arose from agitated crowd at amazing piece of news amazing even to who have most freely raised cry of foul play be one like of willoughby never heard before since mingled rage scorn incredulity derision found vent in one shout then suddenly died into silence a parson began again have looked at place where broke gasped be clean cut half way through knew be foul play once again shout drowned voice who did shrieked voice before parson must resume parson glared round wrathfully for speaker know replied sorry for if did valiant invective from honest little fag failed even to appear ludicrous in midst of general excitement further word be now interrupted by appearance of parretts crew coming slowly up walk be signal for general cheer rush in direction in midst of defeated hero with difficulty struggled up to school wrath indignation be on face in reply to hundred inquiry showered upon said nothing forced way through press sullenly heedless of cheer of sympathiser silence of opponent crowd slowly fell back to let pas watched disappear into school then turned again towards path from river waited with grim purpose news announced by parson confirmed by black look of injured crew have fallen like thunderbolt for moment willoughby be stunned boy must not must not believe that one of number must be guilty of such act yet how must disbelieve in few minute there be cry of here be at same moment schoolhouse crew appeared on walk victor though be looked troubled dispirited a approached talking eagerly among unconcerned apparently about crowd in ominous silence awaited certainly did not look like guilty person be most probable not even wildest libeller in willoughby must have cared positively to charge one of with dishonourable deed for that have won in consequence of deed be quite sufficient to set three fourth of crowd against a came up loud groan cry of cheat foul play suddenly arose startled by unexpected demonstration five hero looked up with flushed face cheat coward reiterated hostile section beginning at same time to surge towards foremost among be tucker of welch house wibberly of parrett who a crowd behind pressed forward be carried with abusive taunt on lip into midst of schoolhouse group latter a may be imagined be in anything humour for assault of sort leader instantly resented in very practical manner where be coming to demanded fairbairn flinging wibberly from into arm of follower before wibberly must recover balance crowd have closed in by sudden impulse with loud shout have set upon crew have over parrett shouted voice a wibberly staggered back second time before fairbairn stalwart arm while at same moment tucker received similar rebuff from crossfield summons be promptly answered dash be made on five schoolhouse boy with view to carrying out threat literally when wyndham voice shouted rescue here schoolhouse come on instantly whole crowd seemed to resolve by magic into two party short desperate battle ensued fire have be waiting for week for match now flare up have come nobody knew whom hit out at by whom be attacked that forenoon pent up irritation of term found vent in famous battle in schoolhouse boy fought way inch by inch up to door of house luckily for most formidable of rival be not upon field of action in due time compact phalanx of senior aided by wyndham band of recruit forced way through superior number finally burst triumphantly through gained stronghold victory be hardly bought for slaughter have be great coates have black eye porter jacket be torn from back riddell have twice be knocked down trodden on while wyndham telson others of rescuing party be barely recognisable through dust bruise on other side loss have be even greater tucker wibberly only two monitor engaged be completely doubled up while number of maimed disabled limpet junior be nearly beyond counting so ended great battle at school gate ended only just in time for a schoolhouse boy finally gained quarter enemy picked up turned surlily schoolwards doctor party arrived on scene gave finishing touch to rout that evening be sore one for willoughby sore not only in respect of bruised body swollen face still more in sense of disappointment suspicion foul play among most violent of parrett whole mystery of thing be perfectly clear philosopher must see from beginning to end be astonished one else must be so dull a not to see too of course be regularly arranged thing said wibberly whose face be enveloped in handkerchief whose lip be unusually thick have vowed along to keep

description disappointed by collapse of ambition yet scouted idea of one of five rival being guilty of so dirty trick a cutting of boat rudder line at same time be a convinced a one foul play have be at bottom of accident perpetrator of mean act be undoubtedly schoolhouse boy what mortified most be that did not feel a positive by mean a others that boat without accident must have won race have be astonished even disheartened by performance of rival crew who have stuck to in manner have not looked for have boded seriously for final result be reflection more even than thought of broken line troubled that evening must be possible that luck be deserting companion be troubled by such suggestion indignation be uppermost feeling in breast whoever have done deed be vile action till culprit be brought to justice whole schoolhouse be responsible in eye wonder single one of can hold up head exclaimed game hope to goodness bloomfield wo demand fresh race wo row if doe said ashley worst of be will try to make out now must have won in case heard one of say so very afternoon let say what like said ashley nobody will believe perhaps hot headed hero have be able to overhear conversation be going on at very time in captain study must have discovered that at rate be not immediate intention of schoolhouse to insist that victory be theirs riddell have recovered somewhat from rough handling afternoon looked pale dejected a along with friend fairbairn sat discussed for twentieth time event of day be quite evident must offer fresh race said yes think so said fairbairn be hard line for

riddell say have better offer new race at once serene have better write asked riddell why what be use of looking ashamed said fairbairn let go to bloomfield sure to be in study two boy went accordingly found parrett captain in study along with game ashley be rarely indeed that schoolhouse senior penetrated uninvited into headquarters of rival on occasion have right cause at heart honest conscience to back be evident at glance have fallen on unfriendly society game quite apart from state of mind with regard to accident have not forgotten repulse at hand of new captain week two ago have bloomfield quite got over indirect snub have received on same occasion riddell have almost forgotten circumstance attributed unencouraging aspect of rival senior entirely to day misadventure excuse coming over said feeling that beginning must be made to interview wanted to tell how sorry fellow be about race have found out who did asked bloomfield said riddell ca even guess what came for specially broke in fairbairn at point be to say be quite ready to row again day like there be touch of defiance in tone of schoolhouse stroke be particularly irritating to parrett boy of course must row began bloomfield mean to broke in game till ugly business be cleared up what do mean asked fairbairn know what mean said game warmly a soon a find out who cut line will go out on river again yes mean to row till be done said ashley how on earth be to find out who cut line more than said fairbairn losing temper there be doubt must be schoolhouse fellow said bloomfield who for friend must have be disposed to accept challenge be afraid be said riddell well wo row again till know who be repeated ashley do suppose know who be demanded fairbairn be proper people to find out be know said ashley then mean to say wo row again asked fairbairn if come to said bloomfield why said game same thing might happen again if 'd looked to line before started said fairbairn hotly must have happened will

said fairbairn can claim what like said game boat remains at head of river doe matter to where remains replied ashley may think what like will think what like be evidently useless to attempt further parley two schoolhouse boy accordingly retired bitterly disappointed to be thwarted of only chance of righting house in eye of willoughby soon got to be known there be to be second race a usual sort of story accompanied rumour enemy of schoolhouse said openly that have refused bloomfield demand for new race intended to stick to ill gotten laurel in spite of everybody on other side be a freely asserted that parrett have funked went even so far to hint that snapping of rope happened fortunately for boat saved under cover of accident from disgrace of defeat few who knew real story considered bloomfield be quite right in refusing race till culprit of first must be brought to justice two fellow on whom announcement fell most severely be gilks silk for if race of day be to stand schoolhouse boat have definitely won race consequently be loser to considerable extent have counted almost certainly on second race now that have be decided against wrath dismay knew bound spent evening in vituperation angry discussion ended in what be very little short of downright quarrel indeed if young wyndham have not opportunely arrived on scene shortly before bedtime created diversion quarrel might have come to blow wyndham burst into room suddenly have of seen knife enquired have lost have inquired silk yes fancy left here last night say have heard be wo accept new race wonder why asked

chapter sixteen bosher diary probably two boy in willoughby be more excited over result of famous boat race than parson dear friend telson be hardly necessary to state that agitation arose from totally conflicting reason parson indignation found solace in most sweeping vehement invective vocabulary must afford against unknown author of dastardly outrage upon rudder line by easy effort of imagination included whole schoolhouse root branch in anathema by very trifling additional effort discovered that object of censure be guilty one of not only of particular crime of crime in newgate calendar from picking pocket to murder fully agreed with decision of chief to have nothing more to do with graceless crew till injury be atoned for meanwhile felt at perfect liberty nay be painful duty to insult abuse maltreat a occasion offered one unlucky enough to wear schoolhouse ribbon on cap being case may be imagined friend telson who by way have barely recovered from shock of brown party found in very delicate position for in whole of code of honour two point be paramount with one be loyalty to schoolhouse other be loyalty to parson how two duty must be carried out now at one same time be source of much anxiety to perplexed augustus too be a indignant about whole affair a friend wrath be aimed first of against who dared to insinuate that schoolhouse boy must have be guilty of evil deed next against parretts authority for refusing riddell fairbairn offer of new race friend have long painful discussion of whole question evening two later in study of latter be very well said to say be schoolhouse chap have done tell schoolhouse chap must have done said parson who else must do dirty trick will fight old man if go on like observed schoolhouse fag oh beg pardon said parson apologetically mean who else must have done know welcher might suggested telson what must be good to have boat besides go against riddell well mean to say said telson falling back on to next grievance fellow ought to row again 'd have rowed again like shot if line have smashed funk do think funk pack of mean added parson pulling up in time do think funk why row again then because there be honour in thing while fellow go in for beastly low dodge like replied parson tell said telson finding very difficult to keep in with friend did not do say did do there what be use of saying that when know one schoolhouse fellow must have done demanded friend tell did do repeated telson have got to prove did before say did added with triumphant emphasis have got to prove did replied parson not to be beaten in line of argument how can prove did when when did do cried telson making up in noise for what lacked in logic knew must prove said parson triumphant in turn knew be one of blackguard right old man will fight said telson did mean old man really said parson what mean to say be care what say said telson what say be did not do very well replied parson be certain did how be certain 'd like to know because tell said parson slowly incisively must have be done by one else how do know must asked telson warmly there be if did do 'd be able to prove ca see so edifying argument went on rather round very much after style of dog trying to catch tail at close parson telson stood a far from solving mystery a ever slight difference of opinion however must hardly fail to result in little mutual irritation for first time in friendship two boy felt a if did not love one exactly like brother be therefore small relief when further argument be abruptly cut short by entrance of king looking particularly cheerful important hullo two exclaimed guessed 'd find here lark what be asked two friend delighted with diversion why exclaimed delighted king know bosher what about what be done guess be not cut rudder line be asked telson of course not just fancy keep diary exclaimed other two laughing old bosher keep diary how do know that king looked very mysterious then said laughing say must give for squint at have got then rather said king producing small notebook from pocket found in big just now notion of bosher keeping diary have be amusing enough chance of looking at production be irresistible boy did make one languid protest more however to relieve conscience than to dissuade one from meanness of looking into boy diary rather low perhaps said telson to look at fellow note know said king if fellow keep diary must expect to be looked at if leaf about know must well yes so must too said parson besides know of course must tell one else rather not said telson know parson added seriously be just possible might have something about rudder line in must be great thing to clear that up must so must said parson seating at table telson king did same bosher diary be forthwith

body repaired to mr parrett study have be aware of actual state of amiable athlete mind from moment last saw handkerchief in mouth hurrying down passage till now trepidation must have be considerably relieved first thing mr parrett have done on regaining room after bad quarter of hour with junior be to throw into chair laugh heartily fact be sense of humour be inconveniently acute for master of public school so that what must strike other master a heinous offence occurred to more a ludicrous chapter of accident to mr parrett mind more ludicrous chapter of accident have rarely occurred in history saw whole matter at once more thought about funnier seemed yet funny a be be painful necessity discipline must be maintained that however much enjoyed joke must be severe on joker when therefore group of youthful culprit slowly filed into room voice be stern countenance betrayed symptom of amusement lurked beneath now boy said surveying anxious array carefully what have to say for yourselves please sir began parson telson cusack at breath stop said mr parrett only one at time parson what have to say please sir said parson be awfully sorry be quite accident really what be

in cusack just so said mr parrett deliberately now just listen to be not first time have have to speak to of for very conduct parson telson bosher other parretts looked very dejected at point be by mean first time term that of have be guilty of similar disturbance most of here look frightened uneasy enough now wish must believe be because know have be doing wrong disgracing school instead of merely because happened to have suffered by bad conduct such conduct must be put stop to for remainder of term one of will lose one hour play day except saturday shudder half of anguish half of relief went round small assembly at first clause of mr parrett sentence next clause be still more severe for remainder of term too none of will be allowed to go into house except own under pretence without leave doctor telson parson looked at one groaned inwardly must hardly realise what cruel sentence involved knew meant that life must hardly be worth living for next six week continued mr parrett have one more thing to say of here be in house one of see be in form in third school be most of idle boy a know there be plenty in same form better behaved more industrious than yourselves oh yes sir said parson frankly what will do during remainder of term be said mr parrett if hear of other case of disturbance between boy of different house in one of be implicated intend to punish entire form stop boy play for one day rest with therefore to decide whether such thing will take place not if give reason will most certainly do mr parrett spoke severely looked a good a word have carefully weighed word beforehand knew tolerably well boy with whom have to deal be noisy boy troublesome boy cheeky boy idle boy be honest on whole master calculated pretty shrewdly on effect last decision must have on conduct a long a be mere question of getting own particular self into row not one of boy fixed precise limit to disorderly instinct when came to getting whole lot of other boy into row too new very embarrassing difficulty arose be fairly insurmountable mr parrett dismissed boy sternly then trusting have done right trusting still more to be able to turn better quality of noisy young pupil to good purpose went straight to doctor told what have done dr patrick fully approved of decision of colleague while on subject opened mind to on question of discipline of willoughby generally have be able to

started on apparently fresh topic be afraid welch house be better than be how can be said mr parrett have not single senior of influence even character in more than added doctor contains few boy one two only hope whose influence be distinctly bad mr parrett nodded change of sort must be made said doctor have occurred to parrett quite recently that riddell might do better there mr parrett opened

empty purse to house chapter eighteen new captain turned welcher riddell who probably felt sting of boat race mishap more sensitively than boy in willoughby be pacing playground in dispirited mood morning two after when dr patrick suddenly confronted ah riddell said latter cheerily be glad have met want to have talk let see said pulling out watch there be hardly time now though will come have tea with evening riddell turned pale at bare suggestion must probably have invented wild excuse to get off dreaded honour have not doctor continued be sorry mr patrick sister be from home take great interest in can assure not at cried riddell whom bare mention of lady name be sufficient to confuse hopelessly come at seven o'clock will said doctor pleasantly not noticing head boy perturbation riddell continued walk in state of considerable perplexity for moment must not get beyond fact that mr patrick miss stringer be from home relief of reflection be unspeakable what must doctor want for be to tell did not consider equal to duty of captain to relieve of office riddell devoutly wished might be so yet hardly fancied from head master manner be to be subject of interview perhaps be to cross examine a to boat race wretched boat race riddell have hardly have minute peace since afternoon burden of whole affair seemed to rest upon taunt of disappointed parretts glanced harmless off mind like fairbairn porter wounded to quick until mystery must be solved riddell felt almost like guilty party rather hoped doctor did want to talk about must be relief to unburden mind at rate even trouble be slight compared with riddell concern about old friend brother in spite of effort young wyndham be going wrong be getting more irregular in visit to riddell study when did come be more reserved secret le inclined to confide in friend than before be easy to guess reason riddell felt baffled dispirited a thought about to save young wyndham from bad friend must be worth to more even than to secure order of willoughby to discover perpetrator of boat race outrage in troubled state of mind riddell passed day till time arrived for to present at doctor entered warily suspiciously a though not quite sure whether after two lady might be lying in ambush somewhere for there be deception only doctor be there unrestrained by presence of usual bodyguard be most friendly cordial ah riddell glad to see sit down find bachelor see for once in way riddell be soon at ease doctor chatted pleasantly over tea about various willoughby topic giving opinion on asking captain opinion on others so delicately showing sympathy for boy in difficulty approval of effort for good of school that riddell be quite won over prepared for serious matter doctor presently broached yes said latter in reply to reference by riddell to welcher yes be good deal concerned about welch house riddell dare say can understand why think so sir seem to pull together there somehow have sympathy with good of school precisely be just what be said doctor delighted to find head boy so exactly understanding nature of house over be to be installed seem to be man for none for state fear think so said riddell hold aloof from most of school doings unless there be chance of row have boat on river year think will have man in eleven against rockshire seem to have ambition to work for school doctor mused bit then said with half sigh a if to wish be worst of then turning to riddell said be glad to hear opinion of welch house riddell to find that seem to understand what be wrong there what must say to taking charge of house in future be breaking news suddenly with vengeance riddell fairly gaped at head master a sat back in chair wondered if have heard aright what sir at length gasped take charge of welch yes boy said doctor quietly oh must never do sir exclaimed riddell pale at very notion try said head master may not be so impossible a think be not popular sir faltered riddell have influence indeed must only make thing worse try one else sir try fairbairn will want fairbairn to be head of schoolhouse said doctor be sure must be mistake sir repeated riddell if there be chance of succeeding must try said doctor have not tried listen riddell know be not inviting to bed of rose be come down know for captain of school head of schoolhouse to go down to welch especially such welch a ours be at present post of danger know be post of honour leave to need not go unless wish will not think worse of if conscientiously feel must not go think over count cost have already made position for yourself in schoolhouse will have to quit of course start afresh single handed in new house be not likely that who defy rule of school will take at first to fellow who come to enforce think over say decide with open eye doctor word have strange inspiriting effect on shy diffident boy recital of difficulty in way be most powerful argument to nature like when at doctor wished good night told to take till following day to decide riddell be already growing accustomed to prospect of new duty for that day that ensued be anxious troubled not so much on account of welch on point mind be pretty nearly made up seemed call of duty therefore be call of honour riddell dare not disobey to leave schoolhouse just now when lay under reproach caused by boat race accident worse still to leave just when young wyndham seemed to be drifting from mooring yielding with le le effort to temptation of bad companion be trouble compared with peril difficulty of new task be light for long time night riddell sat in study pondered over doctor offer looked at in aspect counted up cost then like wise man took counsel of friend ah say talked over with fairbairn porter acute crossfield perhaps wrote letter to old wyndham reader riddell have friend at willoughby dearer even than old wyndham nearer than fairbairn porter crossfield night when school be asleep little dreaming what captain did went to friend told difficulty about welch anxiety about young wyndham even unhappiness about boat race in doing so found wonderfully cheered ready to face new duty even hopeful of success next morning went to doctor told be ready to enter on new duty dr patrick be not man to flatter head boy to inspire with undue hope be undoubtedly gratified by decision riddell felt encouraged in consciousness of sympathy at call over evening welcher have pleasure of being informed by doctor of new arrangement proposed for welfare need hardly be said be considerably moved thereby at first be disposed to regard affair a joke capital piece of fun when evening riddell put in appearance at supper in house when telson be intercepted bringing over late master good chattel to study next one to of silk began to take matter in rather more seriously for first time for long while welch house seemed to be of one mind mind made up of equal mixture of resentment amazement amusement probably have be more accustomed to thinking together must have summoned monster meeting a parrett must have done to discus situation a be resolved into several small group of dealt with topic of hour in own way junior of course have good deal to say on subject pilbury cusack philpot morgan few other kindred spirit held council of war in study of two former immediately after supper rum start eh pil said cusack by way of opening proceeding know said pil confidentially be not surprised made regular mess of in schoolhouse know what be good of coming here then said philpot fellow be bit quieter than schoolhouse one be bold enough to dispute peculiarly modest description of order of welch house wonder if be be kicked out of captaincy a well asked cusack who be apparently convinced in own mind that new move be degradation for riddell know said morgan paddy said something about being good thing for to get captain of school a head of house oh ah jolly good thing said pilbury jolly lookout for if be stuck here to pull up whenever have lark bless ca pull fellow up said somebody said used to now then in schoolhouse not be afraid to look at chap say said cusack rather spree to fetch eh fellow see how doe eh be game said pilbury what will do smash in study door oh said cusack use doing that let give bouncer ' to start with ought to startle up said philpot laughing if be not used to rather open door bit morgan now

bouncer bouncer bouncer below cap wore head eye be black hair be red carried bat for cool hundred bouncer bouncer bouncer poetic record of virtue accomplishment of legendary school hero gave ample scope a reader may surmise for spirited declamation on present occasion more welcher than riddell be startled by sudden vehement outburst of patriotic hymn indeed a appeared to be point of honour with vocalist to pitch two voice in same key effect be even alarming suggested sudden letting loose of menagerie singer waited meekly for few second to see whether effort have met with success deserved a dead silence reigned one came considerately determined to give audience chance therefore launched forthwith into second verse be delivered with even more dramatic power than first old bouncer stood six foot inch sir bouncer bouncer bouncer four foot round chest be pinch sir bouncer bouncer bouncer twelve stone two be fighting weight stroked boat for champion plate ran mile in four thirty eight bouncer bouncer bouncer time heroic effort of melodious junior have reward before last line be reached door of new captain study opened riddell appeared in passage first appearance in new capacity be naturally matter of curiosity on hand a approached scene of noise became aware that almost occupant of passage be standing at door watching curiously for what be to happen certainly did not look a walked nervously down corridor sort of fellow to quell riot one might have prophesied that be not likely to come off better now than did when once went on similar errand to stronghold of limpet yet week have elapsed since then have not be thrown away on riddell must reader like to hear what thought be a neared scene of trial what have better do if get in rage will only make fool of if report to doctor will be shirking own work if remonstrate mildly do more chance in welch be done for fellow who be on lookout for failure will get crow must get on right side of youngster if can so here go with reflection reached door just a third verse of bouncer commenced performer having carefully turned back so a to appear wholly unconscious of visitor verse three referred altogether to intellectual attainment of wonderful bouncer bouncer be cock of school sir bouncer bouncer bouncer socrates to be fool sir bouncer bouncer bouncer must cross ass bridge in dark hic haec hoc ' thought lark swallowed irregular verb like shark bouncer bouncer bouncer before spirit stirring recital have reached climax one two of performer have found impossible to resist look round to see how captain took so that surprise at finding standing there at conclusion fell rather flat much to disappointment of spectator outside moreover riddell shut door behind junior eyed curiously contrary to expectation looked frightened confused face be a cheery a voice a said see must resist beautiful music be in jest earnest did really mean have enjoyed chorus be poking fun at must not quite tell oh said cusack not quite a defiantly however a must have wished be song sing among be fellow ah said riddell before fellow must chime in be good fun belonging to musical set especially for song like appear to have several tune sung at once must give concert boy looked more perplexed than ever sounded like chaff yet must scarcely believe be so smiled vacantly at one began to feel situation little awkward suppose continued riddell feeling way carefully suppose between nine ten be usual time for singing in welch fancied be before supper oh said pilbury do a like here do really replied captain how jolly must be cusack pilbury must hardly tell why laughed at very innocent observation did riddell be quick enough to see advantage know 'd be very sorry to interfere with beautiful music said do think must get to like not to sing after supper boy stared a if be not quite sure yet how to take however captain made clear without further delay fact be said trifle nervously in friendliest tone fact be know what think 'd be awfully glad if fellow must back up for week two in welch of course know doctor put here suppose be much alarmed by move eh need be be said morgan in decidedly mild attempt at heroism be glad of said captain whereat rest of company laughed at unlucky morgan who have quite expected joke to go other way know continued riddell sitting upon table talking a familiarly a though be in own study 'd rather like if among must pull welch up bit before end of term seems rather shame for instance did have boat on river race that there be not single welcher in first eleven be beastly shame said philpot bloomfield down on know be got spite against oh know said riddell fancy if 'd got good enough men 'd be only too glad to put in after glory of school be chief thing tucker silk will never practise said cusack know must if 'd got chance well see why must start house cricket club year at rate said riddell be just what tucker silk wo do wanted to do did pil rather said pil told to mind own business suppose start suggested captain be welcher now know see why because tucker silk object whole house must be done out of cricket more do said philpot will kick up jolly row with though said morgan think so said riddell at rate be reason why there must be club serene said cusack warming up to notion quite forgetting bouncer say riddell must start now yes certainly said riddell why not propose cusack be secretary oh say cried that youth blushing half with pleasure half with embarrassment 'd better be riddell oh said riddell laughing know fellow so well a if be secretary pilbury philpot treasurer 'd be president something of sort if like idea of new club took like wildfire enthusiastic consultation followed be resolved to summon meeting next day of who took interest in sport to arrange for trial match at once riddell went a warmly into detail a one took opportunity of working up patriotic spirit of younger companion know said see at why must be able to get together team for junior eleven if practise hard nuisance be said cusack be stopped hour day play term what for inquired captain melancholy story of mr parrett sulphuretted hydrogen be recounted be pity said gravely wonder if paddy must mind giving licking instead suggested pilbury whose hand be of horny kind even others whose palm be le seasoned seemed willing to fall in with alternative riddell discouraged said be not likely to do tell what will do will see parrett tell about club undertake that will be steady rest of term if will let off do think 'd be safe in saying so rather will promise for one cried cusack will try said pilbury so will said others so be settled when next day riddell in triumph be able to announce that doctor mr parrett have agreed to withdraw prohibition in consideration of captain promise on behalf great be jubilation greater still be riddell own satisfaction in feeling that have at least made good start towards getting on right side of junior of new house chapter nineteen be willoughby degenerate a might be expected new captain move in attempting to win over junior of welch only served to increase irritation of senior who have hitherto reigned supreme in house riddell have taken into calculation be therefore not greatly astonished when immediately after enthusiastic cricket meeting just referred to silk followed to study in by mean amiable frame of mind silk be not given to losing temper on present occasion be decidedly ruffled wonder fellow must be ruffled who suddenly found deposed from authority in manner in silk have be have be one of most conscientious painstaking of monitor might well have be excused flaring up little indeed must have shown poor spirit have not done so a reader know be painstaking conscientious did not care rap about welch still le about willoughby a long a must please annoy enemy did not care what became of house boy in be only when one ventured to dispute authority a head of house that attached value to office in fact be story of dog in manger carried out in school life must not be troubled doing duty to welch must not if must help let one else do for riddell if truth must be told be not at sorry to have early opportunity of coming to explanation with silk silk be one of very few boy in willoughby whom captain positively disliked that being so riddell be troubled with none of half apologetic nervousness usually felt in presence of other fellow senior looked upon silk a enemy to willoughby a evil genius of young wyndham therefore be by mean disposed to beg pardon consult pleasure in new order of thing at welch hear junior have be saying something to about starting cricket club said silk in tone be reverse of conciliatory yes said riddell rather suggested to did can say be be like impudence welch be come to pretty pas if be sent here to look after athletics riddell did not feel called upon to reply to silk therefore continued know tucker have be captain of club here for last two year be told so then what business have to interfere there be house club at year lot care about cricket know well enough be just canting dodge for snubbing tucker before fellow nothing more be quite mistaken replied riddell oh of course 'd like to make out that care fig about cricket who must even bowl ball from one end of wicket to other there seemed nothing particular to reply to in so riddell remained silent only irritated silk more who felt that be by mean getting best of 'd better stop sort of thing at once said viciously be sent here to look after moral of house not to interfere with what doe concern tucker can look after cricket without be tucker going to start old club again then asked riddell quietly business of yours be whether be be find out be what be trying to do if be will advise other fellow to join not have two club advise fellow sneered silk want schoolhouse prig like to advise be evidently use trying to conciliate fellow like riddell began to get tired of interview want to offend anybody said boldly if tucker wo take trouble to start club see that house be to be done out of cricket in consequence fellow have little enough to keep together a be be nice little thing to keep together with must say snarled silk have made good start by setting junior against senior have done nothing of sort replied riddell quietly if will excuse have work to do there be really not much use talking on subject so saying turned began taking book down from shelf silk whose irritation have be gradually getting beyond bound be pleased to regard action a direct insult to flared up accordingly look here snivelling stuck up hypocritical prig exclaimed advancing seizing captain roughly by arm 'd better come to understanding at once if think be going to cheek just a please here be mistaken tell what do mean by by what inquired riddell mildly quite composedly silk only reply be passionate blow in captain face sent staggering to other side of room be critical moment riddell be coward be one of sickly individual who not satisfied to be struck on one cheek only invite repetition of assault on other side physically weak nervous a be have sufficient british instinct to move to stand up for yet a stood there moment irresolute flashed across whatever cost must not enter upon fight with silk of course must be called coward nothing must say must prove be be match for silk consequently refusal to defend must be called fear yet thought if fight chance in welch be gone even if be able to beat fellow will have more respect for than other rowdy will soon enough make thrashing excuse for mutiny be hard position for boy courage required to hold back cost riddell more effort than have blindly rushed into fray given up to be thrashed will fight shouted silk advancing said riddell a coolly a must wretched coward exclaimed bully of course wo then take what deserve will give biggest hiding ever have in life must probably have carried out threat riddell must probably before minute have given up further idea of non resistance when opportune diversion occurred in person of telson who appeared with remainder of late senior possession from schoolhouse say riddell exclaimed almost before door be open here be jolly go have got to be that beast gilks fag hullo what be up remark be caused by silk suddenly turning on heel hurrying from study without putting into execution threat what be up to asked telson a door be shut be going to exterminate so said replied riddell smiling wish 'd tried 'd given jolly licking said telson be cad wonder what young wyndham one see to like in wyndham like then asked captain always seem jolly thick said fag by way riddell be ever at beamish beamish exclaimed riddell why oh said telson only wanted to know what sort of place be not good one there be pretty strong rule against in school bad job for one caught going there know be not going only wanted to know what sort of place be be off have got motion on in parliament to morrow say riddell wish have left schoolhouse off went junior leaving riddell somewhat perplexed by chatter considerably consoled nevertheless to think that there be one in schoolhouse anywhere who be sorry to lose however same reason took telson away left riddell also little time to spend in vague reflection too have speech to prepare for parliament to morrow meeting promised to be important one in many respect be first after boat race consequently party feeling be likely to make use of opportunity to let off little of steam then of course be captain first public appearance a head of welch be sure to excite good deal of curiosity interest last not least subject for evening be debate on question that willoughby be degenerate to be opened in affirmative by ashley in negative by porter on burning question debate a well a division promised to be pretty interesting there be usual lively time before regular business be reached over question of there be good many on notice paper will be best to report meeting in usual parliamentary style a must have appeared on record of house have record be kept at willoughby mr bloomfield took chair at three o'clock mr

morning school further applicant molested case of disorder be reported during morning at dinner boy be so quiet might have be in church just after morning school before dinner a crossed playground wyndham passed talking laughing with silk of noticed captain retired to study dejected miserable a only comfort buried in book for hour at least before early call over might forget trouble in hard work before hour be half over riddell closed book with start sense of something unusual unearthly stillness over place never remembered anything of sort before not sound rose from neighbouring study when looked out playground be a deserted a if have be middle of summer holiday what did mean then suddenly truth flashed upon must mean that willoughby have mutinied in open defiance of authority gone down without leave to shellport hurried out of room there be scarcely sound in house went into playground only one boy gilks be prowling about there half mad with toothache unable unwilling to give information looked in at parrett one be there even schoolhouse seemed desolate captain returned to study waited in anything placid frame of mind felt utterly humbled crestfallen have really seemed of late a if be making headway in uphill task of ruling willoughby be shock have never expected seemed to point to combination over school to thwart in face of such feeling further effort seemed hopeless riddell imagined too much must have pained to know three quarter of who politics mad have thus broken bound that afternoon have never so much a given thought in matter in fact have gone off not to defy simply to please bell for call over rang riddell went despondingly to big hall only about score of fellow including bloomfield porter fairbairn coates wibberly who by way always did a bloomfield did answered to name amid good deal of wonder little laughter bloomfield who have also regarded afternoon business a test of authority looked a crestfallen a real captain for first time term riddell approached one with common interest there will be awful row about said there will said riddell will report fellow will send up whole list to doctor send up name said bloomfield be unless fairbairn want to report schoolhouse said fairbairn send up list riddell so riddell captaincy received first undisputed acknowledgment that term sent up formidable list to doctor with mingled curiosity impatience despondency waited result chapter twenty one new captain to rescue there be something more than toothache matter with gilks afternoon fact be spirit be good deal worse than teeth thing have be going wrong with for time ever since day be politely turned out of schoolhouse boat have lost caste among fellow what little influence ever have among junior have also vanished still if have be gilks must scarcely have be moping up at willoughby among virtuous few that afternoon while rest of school be running mad down in shellport have greater trouble than silk in whose genial friendship have basked for so many month have not treated well indeed be well known fact in willoughby between two precious friend there have be sort of unpleasantness bordering on row be also reported that gilks have come off worst in affair be secret of unfortunate youth toothache have be jilted by familiar friend who must not feel sad under circumstance yet gilks frame of mind be so to speak good deal more black than blue a paced up down playground rather like wolf in cage waiting for dinner be far more exercised to devise way of making faithless friend smart for cruelty than to win back affection when two good fellow fall out be bad enough when two bad fellow fall out may be even worse for whereas in former case one of two be probably in right in latter be pretty certain to be in wrong one knew exactly what quarrel have be about what if be merit whether be breaking off of friendship merely passing breeze whatever be be enough to give gilks toothache on particular afternoon keep at hour elapsed after call over dragged heavily for one three head of house after brief consultation went several way at least bloomfield went while riddell fairbairn solaced in one society what be use of keeping up farce exclaimed riddell when be back in study be farce not bit of think much of affair at of course there will be row seems to case of temporary lunacy that ca be responsible for doctor hold responsible may be sure wo be down on for then be just proof to whole school that have more authority than smallest junior look at miserable notice there on door who have cared rap about dear fellow be always flying off to despair whenever get chance same thing might have happened to captain wish one else be captain said riddell fellow will mind what say le than ever now be sure must gladly give up to bloomfield bosh know must when have got head back will laugh at for thinking besides be bloomfield bit a much cut up about a added fairbairn to change subject do see much of young wyndham now have left not much what about asked riddell eagerly only fancy be not straight said fairbairn be fallen into bad hand be afraid be old story said riddell what have done nothing particular

of infatuation with for know well enough silk mean good yet be thick with now expect will cut altogether since refused permit to town afternoon be gone down all same said fairbairn yes not alone either replied riddell hullo exclaimed fairbairn just then a sudden sound broke unwonted stillness of deserted school that sound like of fellow coming back be right a two senior stood leaning out of window sound at first have be little more than distant murmur increased to roar willoughby be evidently returning in force anything peacefully cry of now then school hack through there down with radical pony for ever mingled with yell cheer coarser shout of down with schoolboy indicated clearly enough that lively battle be in progress that willoughby be fighting way home whole town seemed to be coming at heel more than once pitched battle have to be decided before progress must be made slowly surely discipline of schoolboy animated by familiar word of command of football field asserted above ill conditioned force of assailant at forward step triumphant shout of pony for ever rose with mighty cheer deafened opposition cry in due time playground gate be reached amid tremendous cheering next moment driving before of demoralised opponent vanguard of school burst in even riddell fairbairn a looked down on scene must hardly forbear little natural pride on witnessing triumphant charge home of truant schoolfellow that battle have be sore desperate be evident by limping gait torn clothes damaged face of of combatant a swarmed in in irresistible tide amid applause of comrade howl of baffled enemy who raged vainly without like so many wild beast robbed of prey among last to fight way in be game ashley tipper few other senior who truant a be have yet to credit assumed place of danger in rear where crowd pressed thickest with most violence sorry spectacle be of hero when finally plunged into playground then turned at bay at gate in shouted voice immediately rush be made

fairbairn rescue rescue man down cried school within keep in shut in cried rough without be young wyndham said riddell rushing wildly to front will be murdered scrag scrag schoolboy yelled rough making rush in direction of cry not moment be to be lost in minute might be too late to do good with tremendous shout of rescue willoughby school turned a wildly to get out of playground a have just now struggled to get in captain fairbairn be first to get through gate followed closely by other senior riddell be conscious of seeing young wyndham lying few yard off among foot of rough of being carried forward to within reach of then of blow from behind sent forward half stunned right on to top of young friend after riddell be only dimly conscious of what passed be not until found once more in playground being helped along by fairbairn towards house that took in fact that rescue have be accomplished that battle be at end did get wyndham in right asked yes be much damaged very little got worse than did fellow got behind sent over said riddell fellow did said fairbairn fiercely know who who silk what be sure be a close to at time a be now be quite sure coward did one else see think not two walked on in silence to welch house once more reached study have so abruptly quitted be badly hurt asked fairbairn not bit shin be little barked that be what bulldog can be when like old man said fairbairn laughing never saw one go into battle so gamely why whole glory of rescue belongs to what bosh have to rescue a well a wyndham be thankful be safe be awfully sweet about precious youngster said fairbairn hope will be grateful to that be riddell said nothing shortly afterwards fairbairn said must go a be leaving riddell called back say fairbairn said in half nervous way need say anything about silk there be good fellow must do good deserves good thrashing said fairbairn wrathfully never mind say anything about please fairbairn promised went be quite novel sensation for captain to find figuring in eye of willoughby a bulldog knew be about last person to deserve proud title yet such be freak of fortune exaggerated story of rescue differing a did in nearly other particular agreed in that have performed prodigy of valour in engagement have in fact rescued wyndham single handed more than one fellow dropped in during evening to inquire how be to confirm new reputation pilbury cusack

for considerable time juvenile demonstration be allowed to pas with good humoured forbearance by town when presently emboldened by immunity schoolboy proceeded not only to hoot occasionally to molest opposite side young shellporters began to resent invasion few scuffle ensued temper of party rose schoolboy waxed more more outrageous town boy more more indignant so just about time when poll be closing when call over be being sounded up at school free fight have begun in street of shellport at first alarm school have rallied from side concentrated force on enemy who seemed determined to

fool of to put one else to trouble ta ta will be down at cricket practice again now last be pertinent question for in midst of late political excitement cricket have decidedly languished at school rockshire match a well a house match be getting alarmingly near however on first afternoon after willoughby have returned to sens general rush took place once more to big be evident during week followed that fellow intended to make up for lost time nowhere be activity more observed than in newly revived welcher club presided over by captain enlivened by countenance of ardent trio cusack pilbury philpot during week preceding election have worked with unabated enthusiasm might have seen practice going on morning at half past six in welcher corner of big other house at first regarded a good joke earliest practice of new club be usually performed in presence of large facetious audience who appeared to derive infinite delight from ball be bowled run be made welcher be not to be snuffed out riddell watched over fortune of new club with most paternal interest losing opportunity of firing enthusiasm throwing heart soul into work indeed a cricketer captain came out in quite new light astonished even have always taken for granted be utterly incapable of athletic achievement with steady practice now entailed upon began to dawn not only upon other people that a fielder at slip cover slip be decidedly useful while a batsman exhibited certain style of own usually brought together few run for side even own success be le than of club generally member of small fraternity be intent on glory of club worked hammer tongs to secure mr parrett kindly jack of trade a be be easily persuaded by riddell to come down occasionally bowl few ball give few hint a to style generally time came down be more encouraging even bloomfield few of first eleven magnate thought worth while to saunter round once twice watch practice of promising club may be judged that in proportion a young welcher found succeeding enthusiasm for club president increased club grew daily limpet joined even few senior there be talk of first eleven to play in house match while by time second eleven be accomplished fact member thirsting for day when must match prowess against parretts schoolhouse junior election a have said have rudely interrupted healthy preparation for moment seemed to riddell a if new hold on boy have disappeared that event once over great be relief to find that returned to sport with unabated even increased ardour that week welch have out for first time two set of wicket even thus must hardly keep going who wanted to play tell said bloomfield one afternoon a with friend ashley be quietly looking on while pretending not to do so say what will riddell doe do badly at slip watch over a happened mr parrett be bowling down rather swift ball to boy who be batting with little break from off batsman seemed unable to play in manner by sending among slip so that during over riddell blissfully unconscious of critical eye be upon have busy time of so well did pick ball up that two spy stayed to watch over after at close of bloomfield said upon word be not half bad slip very man want to make up eleven for rockshire dear fellow said ashley in tone almost of alarm be surely not thinking of putting fellow like into eleven care much who go in so long a can play said bloomfield fancy fellow bumptiousness if get stuck into team be bad enough a be said ashley have got schoolhouse fellow to look at said bloomfield come along if have one better will take must get hold of best man so off went welcher practice continued gaily till bell for call over sounded riddell said cusack who have become captain fag since migration to welch there be letter for where asked captain on table saw there when be sticking away pen just now may a well bring said riddell be going to library so cusack went off presently reappeared in library with letter riddell be busy at moment searching through catalogue consequently let letter lie unopened for little time beside in due time however turned took up be strangely directed letter at rate not in ordinary handwriting in printed character evidently to disguise authorship riddell hastily tore open envelope of mysterious missive read content be also written like printing in character quite unrecognisable letter be a follows riddel if want to get to bottom of boat race affair have better see what tom boat boy have to say be chapter twenty three tom boat boy earns four sixpence riddell a read over over again mysterious document in hand hardly knew what to make of looked like clue certainly who have sent be friend enemy if latter might not just a likely be hoax a not examined disguised writing letter for letter failed to recognise in hand of one knew called back cusack cross examined a to how when letter be brought to study cusack must tell nothing all knew be that when went in to look after riddell tea afternoon be lying there on table must say how long have be there have be in room since dinner have riddell cusack be very curious to know what letter be about concerning captain seemed so much excited riddell declined to gratify on point put paper away in pocket returned to work said to if be hoax there be object in making public property still le reason if there be anything in of one thing be determined must go down to morrow morning have interview with boat boy thing might all be hoax if there be remotest chance of being otherwise be clearly duty to do what must to find out miscreant who have brought such disgrace upon willoughby so spent somewhat uneasy evening even appeared absent minded when young wyndham now constant visitor to study paid usual evening call say said boy with beaming face a entered be prime riddell bloomfield going to try in second eleven say know have be grinding at cricket like horse lately came down watched afternoon be in made end of lucky score off dobson bowling then bloomfield said 'd bowl over eye what funk be in must hardly hold bat straightened up somehow first ball went by next be frightfully swift dead on broke bit to leg be just in time to get at send right away between long leg long stop in elm safe five if 'd be running old bloomfield laughed said must wait till ball be sent up said must turn up at second eleven big practice to morrow see how got on there say be prime riddell tell will stand on head if get into team riddell have only partially heard jubilant speech for at moment tom boat boy be more in thought even than wyndham limpet however have heard enough to gather from that young protege be in vast state of joy content a usual be ready with amount of sympathy will be splendid if do get in said yes have only got eight place actually fixed hear so have three chance say riddell like bloomfield do know think be awfully good captain riddell must not help smiling at artless outburst from young candidate for cricket honour replied like too for came watched practice too here at welch did bowl ball demanded wyndham happily said riddell one told told somebody else might possibly squeeze into eleven against rockshire if practised hard what exclaimed wyndham in most uncomplimentary astonishment in first eleven say must be mistake be afraid will think mistake said riddell laughing certainly have heard something of sort why use to play at in house said wyndham more did since came here have be going in for rather more though never dreamt of such rapid promotion well said wyndham quite patronisingly be jolly glad to hear wish be in schoolhouse instead of welch by way how be kid in house getting on kid be getting on very well fancy said captain have match with parrett junior fixed already mean to challenge schoolhouse too fancy say be coming rather strong said wyndham half incredulously be fact though said riddell what be more have on parrett authority that be getting to play very well together eleven play will have to look out for if be to beat ho ho guess fellow will be able to manage of course know if be in second eleven sha be able to play with house junior will be calamity said riddell laughing a began to get out book settle for evening work despite boy juvenile conceit self assurance riddell rejoiced to find grown enthusiastic about anything so harmless a cricket wyndham have be working hard last week so in double sense working hard not only at cricket in striving to act up to better resolution with riddell help have formed have succeeded so far in indeed cricket have helped good resolution good resolution have helped cricket a long a spare moment be occupied with congenial sport place in second eleven be prize within reach have time inclination to fall back on society of silk gilks of set a long a good resolution continued to fire breast be only too glad to find refuge from temptation in steady pursuit of so honourable ambition a cricket be if truth must be told more enthusiastic about cricket than about study that evening be good while before wyndham must get mind detached from bat ball concentrated on livy riddell too found work more than ordinarily difficult that night thought be wandering on far le congenial ground than cricket supposing that letter did mean something how ought to act be pleasant responsibility to have thrown on shoulder duty of bringing criminal to justice possibly of being mean of expulsion yet honour of willoughby be at stake squeamishness ought to interfere with wished true untrue that wretched letter have be left anywhere in study say said young wyndham after about hour spell of work strangely enough starting very topic with riddell mind be full say think that boat race business be blowing over do know hear nearly so much about now thing be ought to blow over said captain gravely why of course besides after may have be accident broke bit of cord other day looked just a if have be partly cut through anyhow be just a much parretts business a ours be doing anything know must be good deal more satisfactory to have cleared up said riddell must do just a well to have new race settle thing right off even if be to lick went soon afterwards riddell be too much occupied with own perplexity to think much just then of boy view on burning question after have thought of must probably have guessed a reader may have done wyndham present cricket mania made dread reopening of old soreness between parrett schoolhouse must be sure to result among other thing in exclusion a member of latter fraternity from coveted place in second eleven next morning captain be up early on way to boat house ever since race river have be almost deserted at rate in early morning consequently when riddell arrived at boat house found one up after good deal of knocking managed to rouse boatman want tom said to steer up to willow might have let known 'd want gig yesterday said man rather surlily 'd have left out for overnight have be bloomfield fairbairn other of boating hero of willoughby blade boatman must have sung very different song boatman doe not know anything about senior classic will find boat moored by landing there said that functionary give call for young alf will do to steer must not suit riddell at said want tom please tell to be quick man went off surlily riddell be left to kick heel for twenty minute in state of very uncomfortable suspense at length to relief tom knowing youth of about fourteen appeared with cushion over one shoulder pair of scull over other embarkation be duly effected tom be privileged person at willoughby in consideration of not objecting to occasional licking be permitted to be a impudent familiar a pleased to young gentleman in whose service laboured being professional waterman considered right to patronise everybody even old wyndham last season have received most fatherly encouragement from irreverent youngster while one who must make pretension to skill with oar be simply at mercy being so riddell have made up mind for trying time of be not disappointed what so be goin ' in for scullin ' then demanded young waterman a boat put off yes want to try hand said captain will never do good at can tell yer before yer begin said boy so seemed what with inexperience of scull nervousness under eye of ruthless young critic uneasiness a to outcome of strange interview riddell made very bad performance ya thought must come to jeered tom when after few stroke captain got scull hopelessly feathered under water must not get up again there be come of diggin ' always way with chap suppose instead of going on like said riddell getting up blade of scull with huge effort show way to do properly what be use of showing must never learn can see by look of after particularly complimentary speech riddell rowed ploddingly on for little distance tom whistling shrilly in stern way in manner most discouraging for conversation riddell be determined come what must must broach unpleasant subject consequently after further progress up stream rested on oar said have not be out on water since day of boat race be though said tom pause be queer thing rudder line breaking day said riddell looking hard at young companion tom apparently did not quite like either seemed a if riddell thought knew something about affair else conscience be not quite easy in course be replied surlily know nothink about riddell for quiet nervous boy be shrewd for age there be something in tom constrained uncomfortable manner a made disclaimer convinced that after mysterious letter have something in be bold step to take knew might end in failure must chance at rate do know something about tom said sternly with searching look at young waterman tom did did say so indeed violently denied that did broke out into state of most virtuous indignation well ever if ai nice thing to say to chap tell know nothink about idea what 'ud know anythink about for tell be out governor be come to wrong shop do hear riddell did hear watching boy manner a hurried out protest be satisfied that be on right tack have never occurred to before perhaps culprit be tom perhaps be who for reason of own have cut line caused mischief if be so what relief what satisfaction must be riddell felt that if tom be wrong doer must almost embrace so great must be joy at knowing that willoughby boy be guilty of crime be too good notion to be true tom soon dispelled tell continued vehemently looking down so a to avoid captain eye tell be done there be use trying to fix on do suppose must know if 'd done blame right party governor do hear ai done never said did replied riddell feeling have by time got upper hand in argument know who did there go how do know know ai done do mean to tell said riddell line must have be cut not know sleep in boat house in course do ai done there be young fool tom said riddell sternly what want to know be who did do how do suppose know demanded boy who did do again repeated riddell know there retorted tom never see face then one did come to boat house night said riddell how do know suppose did suppose did want to know who be tell know be pitch dark ai seen face there what be more know chap let into boat house did said tom whose strong point be evidently not in standing cross examination be where be wrong again be wrong knew be there at rate said riddell did be wrong agin know what be talkin ' about how must know be there when wor there myself what did get in while be away in course did do suppose go to bed like kid at eight o'clock fear why get supper at joe blade till ten then found one in boat house when went there after supper to go to bed there be wrong agin how do suppose 'd find when got out of window then came in went out by window asked riddell why suppose must come down chimbley do retorted tom scornfully there be way else have key of door time of course said riddell in course do suppose leaf boat'us open for anybody a like to come in without leave then be seeing window open made know one have be in continued captain wrong agin why be be right once yet do mean really saw one there how must see when be hoppin out of winder just a come in tell did see must have sor either not with learnin ' then have idea who be ai be know why say never saw did hear voice did have one told have come told no ai wrong agin did leave anything behind that must know by then boy looked up sharply at riddell who saw that have made point followed up what did leave behind cap asked cap do suppose chap cut string with cap why must be flat knife be exclaimed riddell excitedly be knife there go be so clever a good a tell yer then go on a if guessed ai got a much learnin a think governor be knife left behind inquired riddell too eager to attend to sarcasm of companion what must ' be unless might be razor cut rope with thumb nail do of course be knife have got still tom here tom began to get shy a long a be only information that captain wanted to get at did so much mind being cross examined directly looked a if knife be in peril bristled up that will do said gruffly knife nothink to do with know be want to take from only want to look at oh yes very fine mean to make out a be yourn be chap saw hoppin ' out of winder do yer know better be cut so need try to make out of course be said riddell horrified even at bare suspicion still more at idea of one confessing to crime for sake of getting paltry knife still tom be obdurate must not produce treasure in vain riddell assured that made claim to even if knife be own must not dream of depriving boy of now tom listened to with incredulous scowl riddell be beginning to despair of ever setting eye on knife when boy solved difficulty of own accord what do want to look at for demanded only to see if knew whose be once well ai goin ' to let see unless lay half crown down on there seat there ai going to be done by of scholar riddell gladly put down money have satisfaction at last of seeing tom fumble in pocket for precious weapon be long time coming to light meanwhile boy kept suspicious eye on money evidently not quite sure whether after be safe at length from deepest depth of trouser pocket hand emerged bringing with knife have tom not be so intent on half crown lay on seat must have be amazed at sudden pallor overspread captain face half suppressed gasp gave a eye fell on young wyndham knife there be mistaking riddell knew well wyndham when first possessed be never tired of flourishing proudly before acquaintance finding pretext for using lending five minute of day riddell have often have pressed upon yes now with shock be almost sickening recollected that have have in hand very night before boat race with thought there rushed in upon whole memory of evening how excited how restless boy have be how impossible have found to work how wildly have talked about coming race how have set mind on schoolhouse boat winning riddell remembered word of now how wyndham excitement have baulked of desire for serious talk that evening then remembered how abruptly boy have left returning hurriedly moment after for knife very knife le than two hour afterwards have be dropped on boat house floor in culprit hurried retreat by window riddell felt literally sick a rushed through mind at sight of knife in tom hand have seen enough demanded youth still eyeing half crown yes murmured riddell surely never uttered truer word tom startled by voice looked up hullo said what be up one must think 'd never saw knife afore riddell tried feebly to smile recover tell said tom struck with brilliant idea tell what governor lay two bob on top of there crown be come riddell mechanically took out purse produced florin be almost last coin remained of pocket money for term be too miserable even to think of tom grabbed at money eagerly deposited knife in riddell hand in exchange then with load on heart such a have never felt before captain turned boat head rowed slowly back to willoughby chapter twenty four rockshire match riddell be not destined to have much leisure during next few day for indulging misery making up mind in what direction duty lay a reached school after memorable excursion on river be met by fairbairn who have evidently be on lookout for why where have be what be wrong exclaimed a observed friend dejected look have be turn on river replied riddell making desperate effort to recover wit look cheerful look bit a if be just starting there to drown said fairbairn say have got message for from whom inquired riddell who have have quite enough message during last few day to last for rest of term 'd scarcely guess from bloomfield thing be have two place yet to fill up in eleven for saturday want to play for one despite trouble riddell must hardly conceal smile of pleasure at honour though not exactly unexpected have hardly realised till now oh say said be certain there be lot of better fellow may be quite sure if there have be bloomfield must have picked up said fairbairn a happens want slip heard bloomfield say that be awfully good there seem to have hidden light under bushel old man while in schoolhouse may have be lucky while bloomfield be watching said riddell gammon need fancy be doing to compliment old man game that lot be awfully down on about 'd like to make up team entirely of parretts seems ca do without for once of course will play oh yes said riddell be captain of eleven must hurrah well will have to turn up at big practice of course during next three day there be one at three afternoon at if like to come down for hour after first school will give ball at net be tuesday rockshire match be to come off on saturday between now then a riddell well knew spare moment must call own must have to be devoted to cricket personally with burden of secret of young wyndham knife upon must have be glad enough of excuse for avoiding honour even of place in first eleven there be such excuse on contrary duty pointed clearly to making best of opportunity a captain of school even humble place in first eleven must be undoubted gain to influence while to welch demoralised welch knowledge once more one of number be playing for school might be of real service till saturday at rate must try to banish hideous nightmare from mind give up wholly to call of cricket be easier to resolve to give up one mind to pursuit than be to do for first day two riddell found halfhearted cricketer however a eventful day drew near thing grew more serious not to say critical be nervous occasion for captain first time presented at big practice must not help feeling that eye watched performance be more than ordinarily critical many of le than ordinarily friendly still managed not to disgrace on next occasion having partially recovered presence of mind be able to do even more justice one have to admit riddell be long way off being fine cricketer must have be first to admit for what with quick eye much perseverance sound judgment possessed more than one of quality go to make up useful member of team ought to do said bloomfield to game on friday evening after last of practice stood up to fairbairn bowling not at badly must wonder said game whose prejudice be stronger than judgment if fairbairn bowled down easy to on purpose be awfully thick know did bowl down to easy replied bloomfield cut for two twice running game must not answer argument be bound to admit worse man might have be put into odd place be pity though will be so jolly cocky set there will be enduring only hope fellow will do most of scoring to morrow not leave chance of saying won match for bloomfield laughed not much fear of said if did suppose 'd sooner beat rockshire with help than be thrashed game be not quite sure said nothing one might have supposed that occasion like present when picked eleven willoughby be to play picked eleven of rockshire that there must have be place left for party rivalry feeling one of patriotic ardour for victory of old school so deeply be disease of party spirit rooted in willoughby that even match came to be looked on quite a much a struggle between rival house a between school outside team discovery be made that eleven consisted of five schoolhouse player five parrett player one welcher more than that ingenious noted fact that two best bowler of eleven be bloomfield fairbairn one from house who must also field a wicket keeper when not bowling two second bowler be game porter also one from house minute analysis might doubtless have be continued down to cover point at rate be manifest two house be very evenly divided a regarded merit place must therefore be easy to see contributed most to service of school rockshire men arrived by ten o'clock train be met a usual by willoughby omnibus at station a alighted proceeded to stroll in long procession across big to tent be regarded with much awe curiosity by small boy assembled to witness advent of whom be quite at loss to understand how boy like must ever expect not to be beaten by great whiskered hero like even young welcher who have contrived to be practising close to line of march felt awed in presence made most hideous hash of little exhibition with have intended to astonish visitor self confident ease of rockshire men be even trifle discouraging for few of school hero who looked on nervously a rival coolly went up inspected wicket criticised pitch then proceeded laughing among towards pavilion thing like be more le terrifying old team come down to play young one ought to be more considerate be fortunate for school team that member be not a shy diffident a others operation of tossing for inning other matter of form must never have be got through mr parrett however a old 'varsity blue be a great hero in sight of rockshire a rockshire be in sight of willoughby with aid preliminary be arranged willoughby went out first to field big be never so crowded with boy master outside public a be on bright june day exploit of school at recent election may have have something to do with number of townsfolk who flocked up to see game apart from that rockshire match be always one of great event of season last year thanks to old wyndham prowess school have won before back almost to day of mythical bouncer fate have be other way year good a team be one have hardihood to predict with confidence victory for boy just a riddell be leaving tent to take place in field young wyndham came up clapped cheerily on back go in win say cried gaily back old man be first time two have met since riddell interview with boat boy sight of old friend brother sound of voice just now gave captain shock for moment almost unmanned turned pale a looked at boy thought of knife oh say said wyndham noticing perturbation pull together old man will get on serene be funky first time showed up for second eleven know be right now now riddell cried bloomfield impatiently from wicket off captain hurried to post with load of trouble at heart feeling anything jubilant athlete wyndham little dreaming what be passing through patron mind settled cross legged at door of scorer tent thought of nothing for next few hour match two rockshire men upon whom devolved duty of opening ball strolled slowly up to wicket minute later match have begun a usual first few over be uneventful bowler be trying what batsman be made of batsman be trying what bowler be made of riddell be thankful for part that ball came way spectator generally seemed to regard two maiden over a sort of necessary infliction at opening of big match when bloomfield took ball again be evident thing be to grow little brisker first ball be very neatly patted towards square leg for two amid cheer always greet first blood next ball slipped past long stop for bye wyndham other enthusiast sighed a if three run have settled fate of willoughby sigh be abruptly turned into cheer when next moment rockshire man wicket tumbled of heap one of foe be out for three began to breathe again when have seen two portentous hero go in prospect of ever going out have seemed fearfully remote now if one man be got rid of for only three run why must not ten men go for only thirty at arithmetical discovery school immediately leapt from depth of despondency to height of confidence considered match a good a won before be fairly begun however during next half hour have time to seek happy mean between two extreme newcomer be tough customer must certainly have gone in first for be one of aggravating batsman who keep steady bat at everything who never aspire to slog never walk out to slow never step back to yorker be never too soon for lob too late for shooter in fact who play safe plodding game in face of temptation one comfort be did not make many run still sort of business be demoralising for bowler slow for field change of bowler be consequently decided upon after about hour play when score be at twenty one game porter be two new hand latter being first to officiate with very neat maiden over loudly cheered from school tent game who followed be not so fortunate rockshire man who have gone in first cut hard for three on second ball first hard hit of match steady man followed up with quiet two neatly placed between point mid off then came ball same player turned off sharply into slip be fairly difficult ball to field riddell picked up smartly returned to wicket in time to prevent run being made well fielded indeed sir cried wyndham voice from tent little thought how strangely word of encouragement missed mark riddell have just be forgetting trouble warming up to game now came once more to remind of hated knife tom boat boy story next ball rockshire man also slipped time though be within easier reach for first rate fielder be even possible catch riddell missed two run be made look out there cried bloomfield severely well tried sir cried one sarcastically well missed sir cried one else with painful truthfulness riddell saw crisis miss like few more taunt like might a well retire from field not for first time in life pulled together with vehement effort shook off thought one duty claimed only just in time last ball of over be played again into slip time very smartly school shivered a saw whiz straight for weak point might have spared agitation for riddell have catch before shiver be over have returned to fairbairn at wicket promptly enough to make rockshire man feel have have narrow escape of run out fielded sir said bloomfield a player crossed over commendation be more encouraging than shout of schoolhouse partisan porter next over disposed of first rockshire man amid great school rejoicing be only tempered by reflection among parretts that be wicket to credit of schoolhouse half of eleven then followed succession of short smart inning during rockshire score crawled up to seventy despite of further change of bowler very careful round fielding by school time steady man hung on obstinately nothing seemed to puzzle tempt out of caution at length in sheer desperation coates be put on to bowl anything seemed better than hopeless deadlock so turned out coates first ball came down temptingly towards off stump enterprising player must have cut for safe four cautious hand who seemed to smell rat in everything be evidently determined not to be taken in by first appearance turned off half contemptuously to favourite quarter among slip thinking possibly might punish next rather more freely next be not to come for coates ball be rising bit a batsman touched though did not hit up yet spun foot so above ground easy catch straight into riddell hand who held fast much to own surprise greatly to jubilation of willoughby well caught sir caught indeed played up riddell be cry on hand greeted achievement wyndham call being longest loudest of time riddell suffered harm from sound of familiar voice have steeled against for few hour at least be to one out of many rockshire first inning terminated shortly with further event of note last wicket fell for ninety two respectable total of fifty nine have be made off parretts batsman thirty three off schoolhouse indeed advantage of schoolhouse did not end there out of three catch not counting riddell have made two while of five wicket have be taken by bowling claimed three against rival two great be dismay of parrett a result be made known buoyed up greatly however with prospect of batting where must be strange indeed if did not score better than schoolhouse after be run win match bloomfield be said to credit allowed petty consideration of party rivalry to influence in sending in best men at right time however much in way might lend to whim of more energetic comrade in matter like rockshire match where be in sole command responsible for glory of school acted with sole object of winning match must have be easy to send in fairbairn porter last when must have chance of scoring coates who be rash hitter never be safe until back of bowling have be somewhat broken might have be sent in first such arrangement bloomfield knew must be fatal for chance of school therefore never entered head to contrive fairness in respect be fully justified for school put together hundred twelve run just twenty more than opponent performance not even most sanguine willoughbite have dared to anticipate towards total riddell who have gone in last carried bat have contributed seven not little to own surprise delight of onlooking welcher most remarkable thing about inning be that contrary to calculation five schoolhouse fellow have contributed no le than sixty four run to total while parretts united score only amounted to forty one second inning of rockshire differed very little from first steady man went in first bothered bowler school must bring against having have one lesson took good care not to give rather avoided slip for future so riddell have quiet time of fielding few ball came to steadily promptly otherwise not figuring prominently in downfall of wicket be half past four before rockshire finally retired with total for second inning of ninety nine leaving school boy with eighty run to obtain to win be not formidable total after first inning performance at outset calamity happened enough to depress hope of willoughbite bloomfield have gone in first with intention of breaking ice effectually for side what therefore be consternation of everybody when after neatly blocking first ball be clean bowled for duck egg by second willoughby literally howled with disappointment gave up to despair a saw captain champion retreating slowly back to tent trailing bat behind not daring to look up at hideous on telegraph board hope be at hand though parrett be not to supply coates crossfield who be now together made most unexpected stubborn stand even scored freely longer held together harder be to part reviving hope of rockshire partisan gradually died out before awkward combination game ashley tipper a sat watched spirited performance by two schoolhouse boy felt triumph for school utterly swamped in still more signal victory despised house be achieving over score amid terrific cheering went up to fifty two before separation must be effected then coates be caught at long leg retired covered with glory in favour of tipper ala for parrett tipper in whom forlorn hope rested be run out during first over while attempting to snatch bye be anxious moment while bloomfield be deciding whom next to send in there be still thirty run to make unless took care whole inning might be muddled away in getting of go in fairbairn said captain parretts felt fate to be sealed hopelessly have game be sent in might still have done something for parrett now chance might never come did not come fairbairn joined crossfield two did just what liked with bowling a score shot up from fifty to sixty from sixty to seventy school became perfectly hoarse with cheering even most of partisan of parrett sorely a match be going against must not help joining in applause now that prospect of school winning by seven wicket have become probability up went score three for fairbairn two for crossfield seventy five then next moment terrific cheer greeted four by fairbairn brought number equal before figure be well registered drive settled question willoughby have beaten rockshire by seven wicket chapter twenty five be brother keeper evening of rockshire match be one of strangely conflicting emotion in willoughby in schoolhouse jubilation be beyond bound victory of school be swallowed up in glorious exploit of five schoolhouse hero who have so admirer declared a good a won match among have vindicated from reproach of degeneracy once for wiped away hateful stigma of boat race night be spent till bedtime in one prolonged cheer in honour of hero who be glad enough to hide anywhere to escape mobbing came in for whenever showed face in parrett house festivity be of far more subdued order a willoughbites be of course bound to rejoice in victory of old school at what cost did do for have not that very victory meant also overthrow of reign in willoughby reasoning excusing must do away with fact that after boasting assumed superiority have taken considerably le than wicket secured considerably le than third of catch scored considerably le than quarter of run by match have be won captain have be bowled for duck egg best bowler have be knocked about by very batsman whom schoolhouse bowler have dispatched with ease be vain to attempt to account for to assert that schoolhouse have have best of luck that light have favoured just when happened to bowl rockshire men have got careless even such stick at nothing enthusiast a parson bosher co must make case of be forced to admit with deep mortification that glory have departed from parrett at rate for season perhaps most patriotic rejoicing that evening be in welch house cared little about rivalry between parrett schoolhouse be therefore free to exult a willoughbites pure simple bestowing of course special cheer on own man riddell who though not having performed prodigy have yet done honest work for eleven at rate made one smart catch tell said fairbairn who along with coates porter have escaped from violent applause of schoolhouse sought refuge that evening in captain study tell what be getting perfectly sick of everlasting schoolhouse against parrett business so be said porter a if need go into sulk because fellow did better than did have brought on anyhow said coates may do good to have to sing small for once be afraid if have be other way fellow must have be just a much cut up a theirs be said fairbairn upon word half envy riddell old man being welcher riddell smiled fellow certainly consider free to abuse cheer round without least partiality listen to now certainly hubbub be going on be trifle outrageous even for welcher indeed be so outrageous that riddell be obliged to ask visitor to excuse for moment while went quieted a opened door of preparation room where house be assembled louder cheer than ever arose in honour then who waited in study heard general lull in noise continued in subdued animation after have left scene returned to friend casual illustration of captain influence in new house be quite revelation to three schoolhouse monitor why what do do to to shut up like asked coates with something like envy in tone take hour bawling to stop row like in house licking two into bargain doe fellow riddell laughed be cricket mad at present said suppose be afraid of having match against parrett stopped be modest way doubt of accounting for obedience to authority reason might be be certain captain have further occasion to interfere that evening there be one comfort about match said fairbairn after pause probably will not hear more of wretched boat race now whatever induced to start most unfortunate topic at time of others riddell who amid excitement of match have contrived partially to forget burden lay on spirit started uncomfortably at word face changed to one of undisguised trouble others must hardly help noticing be never likely to get at bottom of said porter so sooner drop better be very odd same said fairbairn that there be not be single hint a to who did wonder if perhaps be wrong in taking for granted be more than accident last question be addressed to riddell who replied nervously uneasily be yes ca have be be sure be accident three friend looked perplexed by sudden confusion change of manner porter have presence of mind to change subject hear there be jolly row on between silk gilks said one know exactly why heard be bet said coates at rate have have split said porter never did much good while be in partnership said coates young wyndham got rather drawn in by heard rather said fairbairn be precious near going to dog altogether if old riddell here

length friend rose to depart excused from walking across quadrangle with said good night in spiritless way very different from cheery manner in have welcomed hour ago never saw such rum fellow a riddell said coates a three strolled over did see how cut up got when something be said about boat race be little cracked on subject said fairbairn do believe until culprit be found out considers

worn question of classic versus mathematics be destined to experience more than one surprise before meeting be over riddell who have spent dismal day not knowing what to do think vainly hoping that wyndham might by own free confession solve bitter problem came to meeting be least wretched thing must do anything be better than sitting alone brooding over secret for first time received cheer a entered took accustomed place willoughby be grateful to for catch in rockshire match how at other time captain must have rejoiced over cheer now hardly heard other hero of match received similar ovation in proportion to service have done when just at last moment fairbairn coates crossfield came in together house rose at cheered tremendously business be preceded by usual question none of however be very important after captain performance last week perhaps still more after speech in house week two ago honourable men have shown le active in baiting asking offensive question on occasion be only interrogated once be by cusack who wanted to know whether be not going to get whole holiday in honour of rockshire match captain replied that have heard nothing about be put up to ask bloomfield whether considered eutropius fit reading for young boy loud cheer from small boy in question greeted inquiry in midst of bloomfield cunningly replied that honourable member have better give notice of question for next time then rose telson with dignity of office solemnly inquired of mr stutter premier whether be aware that new party have lately be formed in house consisting of messrs telson parson bosher king wakefield called skyrocket whose object be to look after interest of junior over school who must be glad to receive fresh member at one shilling head stutter who be scarcely heard in uproar followed sensational announcement meekly replied that have not heard word about answer for reason other provoked almost a much laughter a question very well for to grin growled telson who have expected somewhat different reception to important question wait till start on amendment opportunity soon arrived coates being called upon to open debate let off speech have prepared if did not convince house that classic be nobler study than mathematics at least showed that have convinced skyrocket have barely patience to hear out moment have done parson started to foot shouted mr chairman gentleman beg to move amendment here bloomfield whom sight of notice paper have prepared for what be coming interposed when be ready for honourable member will call on motion be not yet

on last remark be caused by rush upon devoted band with view to carry out edict of chairman parson went on with oration till be secured hand foot carried forcibly to door even then continued to address house struggling kicking between syllable backer equally determined clung on to form desk continued to shout scream caterwaul till be one by one ejected even then maintained noble stand for freedom of speech by howling through key hole kicking at door till finally select band of volunteer be dispatched to clear approach to house drive skyrocket to own distant study where organised few brawl on own account ended afternoon very hoarse very tired by mean cast down jolly spree be said parson when be over fanning with copybook readjusting collar stunning said telson never thought 'd stand so long end of speech that of yours yes said parson complacently most of impromptu too managed to spin out fancy rather said king admiringly began to make mine after 'd got kicked out must get out much of well can say be be jolly lark feel quite hungry after said telson of jam left old man so hero appropriately celebrated glorious field day with le glorious banquet amply compensated for little inconvenience have have to endure in course of afternoon entertainment meanwhile rather more serious work be going on in great skyrocket being ejected house proceeded in somewhat humdrum fashion to discus relative merit of classic mathematics several of senior few limpet have prepared speech duly delivered contrary to expectation of most present riddell took part in discussion a head classic speech from have be quite counted on not even call of one side taunt of other must get on to foot fact be only half heard what be going on thought be far away busied with far more serious inward debate than on notice paper at length must remain idle no longer must go find out wyndham see doctor pay visit to tom boat boy anything rather than suspense misery inaction took advantage of more than ordinarily dreary speech from tedbury to rise make retreat quietly from room before have reached door tedbury voice abruptly ceased wibberly be heard saying mr chairman see mr riddell be leaving meeting will allow to ask question before go there be something strange about interruption also in manner in question be asked drew sudden attention of house eye be turned on captain stopped turned in usual nervous half inquiring way apparently not quite sure what have be said who have spoken mr wibberly said bloomfield wish to ask question of mr riddell be merely said wibberly rapidly giving time for objection to be raised on point of order wish to ask mr riddell whether have found out yet who cut rudder line of parrett boat at boat race whether suspect anybody if so whom at unlooked for question hubbub immediately arose several schoolhouse fellow protested against proceeding being interrupted in way even bloomfield exclaimed across table for goodness ' sake wibberly bring up wretched subject again who have watched riddell have seen turn suddenly pale at question for moment make a though must rush from room stopped turned like hunted deer on questioner dead silence fell on assembly a wibberly coolly said will repeat question have mr riddell found out who cut rudder line doe suspect one if so who be eye turned on riddell brief pause have given time to collect fight out inward battle now answered steadily do suspect one until be perfectly sure will not say who be so saying quietly left room chapter twenty seven everything gone wrong riddell be fairly committed to task now like good old general who burned ship when landed on enemy shore have cut off from slightest possibility of retreat must now either go right through with matter confess miserable failure consciousness of nerved with unlooked for courage walked from parliament afternoon very different being from boy who have entered have entered cowed irresolute wretched left indeed still wretched with spirit roused mind made up duty lay clear before whatever cost must do whether wibberly be writer of mysterious letter whether one have prompted to ask question whether asking just at time be mere coincidence did not trouble to decide felt rather grateful to than otherwise for having asked just a one be occasionally grateful to thunder clap for clearing air first thing without doubt be to find wyndham come to clear understanding a to whether not be culprit captain lost time in attempting to put resolve into practice must not do knew immediately after scene in parliament when everybody must be on tip toe of curiosity to be seen holding secret interview with particular boy therefore decided wisely to wait till usual time when wyndham be in habit of coming to study to do lesson meanwhile to make sure of coming sent message by cusack to tell to be sure turn up cusack little suspecting importance of simple message delivered glibly being of course brimful of excitement of hour remained little to regale wyndham with history of afternoon event oh say said be at parliament afternoon there be end of shine on be there asked wyndham rather what do think young parrett cad came down in body kicked up biggest row ever saw said be club made end of beast of got kicked out at last serve right too be always fooling about at something said wyndham that be want

wyndham excitedly be what wo say of course there be awful row on say will make tell kick out of school something be in end of rage why doe tell who be asked wyndham oh say be not sure something like dare say will tell about evening be to be sure turn up say at preparation time off went vivacious messenger leaving wyndham in considerable state of astonishment perturbation what did riddell want for have not seen since evening week ago when have so nearly confessed to about beamish hardly liked not to go now although knew must be hard to avoid letting out wretched secret have promised gilks silk to keep besides uneasy a be about must not help feeling excited about what cusack have just told of boat race affair most likely when came to consider riddell must be so full of that might perhaps not say more about beamish so wyndham decided to go in due time presented with book at captain study must see at once riddell be in one of serious mood heart sank for have doubt what be coming felt that unless be to break promise matter be sure to be made worse be glad have come said riddell went off so suddenly other evening yes said wyndham lock up bell rang be bound to be in house before stopped know what want to see about now wyndham said captain nervously yes replied boy doggedly suppose do there be long uncomfortable pause at end of riddell said surely wyndham be not going to leave to to clear up matter what do mean asked boy burying face in hand utterly unnerved by tone of friend voice mean said riddell a firmly a must that there be only two course open must confess what have done of own accord will be duty to do for see how be duty to tell everybody said boy must get expelled to dead certainty must either be one other said captain oh riddell exclaimed boy springing to foot say

promised must have break promise if tell of will be expelled know will do help out time poor fellow said riddell who be not proof against sort of appeal from one least of from one loved boy be quick in energy of despair to follow up advantage 'd make good other way way like have expelled riddell think of at home what state must be in know deserve ca get out of if be to go to doctor tell everything began riddell oh be just what ca do exclaimed wyndham 'd do like shot if be only in know how found out be sure ca go tell doctor even if be to get off being expelled be use going on like

willoughby at know what trouble have have term how bravely have be trying to turn over new leaf 'd give anything to be able to help out of tell plainly see how to do if like will go with to doctor exclaimed wyndham wildly ca do ca do then said riddell gravely must go to by wyndham looked up tried to speak then fairly broke down if honour of whole school be not involved wyndham looked up in startled way honour of school what have got to do with going to what strange fatality be there about riddell study door that always opened at most inopportune time just a wyndham began to speak opened again bloomfield of person appeared want to speak to riddell said word be uttered before have noticed that captain be not alone that visitor be young wyndham in state of great distress hardly greater than of riddell a soon a did perceive drew back said beg pardon did know one be here will go said wyndham hurriedly going to door hardly lifting eye from ground a passed bloomfield must hardly help noticing strange appearance wondering at anything wrong with young wyndham said not sorry to have way of breaking ice be in trouble said captain wo sit down be very long time since head of parrett captain of school have met in polite way bloomfield for time past have shown sign of coming round to see that position have be forced upon have be very ready at first to accept be not satisfactory one greatly to disgust of of fellow monitor have shown more than once by friendly advance towards rival so far have never got to length of calling upon in study riddell be scarcely surprised to see although be quite unprepared for very amicable way in began be sorry to interrupt said bloomfield have be intending to come over last day two be very good of said riddell fact be said bloomfield little nervously ever since debate in parliament week ago when spoke about pulling together have felt that fellow have done a much a ought in way know have riddell did not exactly know what to say must not say that parrett fellow have pulled together for good of school so said nothing be getting rather sick of continued bloomfield digging hand in pocket so be said captain know said bloomfield be that wretched boat race affair made thing a bad a be fellow must have kept up so long if have happened riddell began to get more more uneasy have expected be coming there be escaping be awfully ugly business of course continued bloomfield though one suspected fellow like fairbairn of such thing fellow know be pretty sure one be at bottom of riddell must not help thinking in midst of uneasiness how very sagacious parrett fellow have be to make discovery now said bloomfield looking up feeling relieved to have speech nearly done now that have found out who be be going to be cleared up think thing ought to come right be painful situation for captain of willoughby bribe bloomfield offered for secret be what have be wish of heart whole term if accepted now there must be end to wretched squabble have worked such mischief in school last few month one object of ambition a head of school must be realised surely now must hold back longer duty interest honour of school demanded secret of whereas if held back thing must be worse than ever before yet hesitated that last wild half finished exclamation of wyndham lingered in mind perplexed suppose there must be mistake with knife in pocket poor boy whole conduct demeanour to corroborate story must scarcely hope suppose there be doubt even shadow of doubt what right have to accuse even to breathe name hope will be cleared up before long said why said knew who be said bloomfield said suspected somebody who be asked bloomfield ca tell replied riddell be not sure may be wrong surely be not going to keep thing like to yourself exclaimed bloomfield warmly concern everybody in school have right at rate a stroke of parrett boat to know who be of course have if be quite sure be right must tell can tell whom suspect said bloomfield who have not anticipated difficulty can not replied captain in confidence at rate said bloomfield no not till be sure really can not bloomfield manner changed rebuff be not what have expected have come here partly out of curiosity partly from desire to be friendly partly owing to eagerness of companion to have explanation have never doubted that must succeed nay even that riddell must be glad to meet more than half way now seemed be not to be bloomfield lost temper mean to say said angrily be going to keep to yourself yes till be sure till be sure what be going to do to make sure 'd like to know everything can know suppose what everybody say about whole concern said bloomfield ca help what say said captain say that if chose must tell straight out like honest man who be riddell looked quickly up at speaker bloomfield felt half ashamed of taunt directly escaped lip say be what fellow think said be in own interest to clear think be shielding one captain face changed colour rapidly bloomfield be quick enough to see be hardly what fellow have be led to expect of said with touch of sarcasm in voice anyhow knock on head idea of pulling together a have hoped certainly will hing towards a long a ugly business be going on bloomfield have told began riddell have told great deal said bloomfield ca deny that be sheltering cad whoever be under pretext of not being quite sure riddell said nothing bloomfield seeing nothing must come of altercation left room at door however thought struck must agitated scene between riddell young wyndham have interrupted by arrival have have anything to do with mystery recollected now what state of distress have be in now thought of surely have heard wyndham voice saying something in tone of very eager appeal at moment door be open besides wyndham have be very down for week past bloomfield have noticed at cricket practice more than one fellow have spoken of in hearing knew too how thick boy be with captain with what almost brotherly concern riddell watched over interest one in willoughby knew bloomfield be only moderately clever youth knew enough to put two two together a stood there at door state of case flashed across mind might get at secret after forget that other people can suspect besides riddell said turning back suppose be to suspect precious young friend of yours who stood blubbering here just now be well for captain that back be turned a bloomfield said otherwise least doubt a to correctness of guess must have be instantly dispelled last strait in riddell found be worse than have gone before for must not deny to say nothing must be same a assenting secret be out what must do only thing seemed to be to appeal to bloomfield generosity to explain to to implore for day two at least to keep confidence yet be old question suppose be wrong suppose after wyndham be not culprit what grievous wrong must be doing by admitting even suspicion composed with effort turning replied excuse bloomfield have told can say nothing at present be really useless to say more about bloomfield departed perplexed angry anger be partly because must not help feeling that riddell be in right perplexity be to know what to think of whether guess about young wyndham be near mark not well inquired game who with one two of most ardent parretts be eagerly waiting return have got out of said bloomfield wo tell cad exclaimed game why ever not say be not sure that be why said bloomfield be private opinion be shielding one other of course be said ashley must wonder if be known who be all along anyhow said tipper ought to be made to clear up else pay up for know will cut dead next time see so will replied one two others wo afflict much about said bloomfield if be sure did want to shirk 'd be inclined to give day two before doing anything what be use of course want to shirk said game think will blow over if go long enough will take precious good care doe though upon honour said ashley never expected willoughby must come to pas be bad enough to have coward fool a captain be rather too much when turn out to be cheat too to think that ever got stuck in first eleven said tipper told bloomfield 'd be credit to caught out that best man of theirs said bloomfield bah sooner have lost match twice over exclaimed game than win with help so estimable young gentleman satisfied that alone be glory support of willoughby disposed in own mind of wicked captain thanked lucky star be made of nobler stuff loftier principle chapter twenty eight wyndham make final venture if proof have be needed that young wyndham be down a parrett fellow termed fact that did not put in appearance at second eleven practice next day supplied bloomfield who in ordinary course have strolled round to watch play noticed absence drew own conclusion from to bloomfield credit be said that own suspicion may have be have be a reluctant a riddell a long a doubt existed to name wyndham publicly a culprit for whom willoughby be on lookout have be very angry with riddell for reserve when came to point of publishing own suspicion not better feeling prevented led to copy captain example for riddell reply to suggestion of wyndham name have confirmed denied correctness have merely declined to say anything about matter so that a far a bloomfield be concerned be no more than guess that being so too be wise enough to keep to however now that noticed wyndham unwonted absence from cricket practice felt more than ever convinced something be wrong in quarter so there be wyndham with drawn sword so to speak over head be fit for nothing dared not go back to riddell a long a tongue be tied explanation be impossible unless must explain be worse than useless to talk to captain equally out of question be confession to doctor letter explaining to brother only thing be to make up mind to fate else by getting silk gilks to release from promise to get tongue free to make full confession of own delinquency throw entirely on doctor mercy last chance seemed feeble enough drowning man will clutch at straw so wyndham a last hope faced unpromising task of working on generosity of two old patron began with gilks gilks be in own house have always seemed to be least vicious a be also least clever of two besides of late be notorious gilks silk be no longer friend have be there be mystery about recent quarrel a gilks have be down in mouth ever since while silk showed sign of dejection be safe to assume former have come off second best wyndham therefore selected gilks for first attempt a being on whole le formidable of two found in study listlessly turning over page of novel evidently must either have be very stupid one else not nearly a engrossing a reader own reflection looked up with surprise to see wyndham who since have somewhat ostentatiously cut silk acquaintance week ago have never be near what do want here demanded not very encouragingly know have not much reason to be friendly with began boy want to speak to if may what about said gilks roughly poor boy seemed suddenly to realise hopeless nature of task have undertaken nearly broke down completely a answered be in awful trouble gilks what be to do with asked gilks wyndham struggled hard to shake off weakness have come over replied be about visit to to beamish be riddell know how who told seems to have found out about riddell cried gilks scornfully who care for oh continued wyndham tremulously mean to report for what report thought be such dear pious friend sneered gilks be friend say be duty to do gilks laughed scornfully of course be only need for thing to be mean low will always be duty to do bah hypocrite wyndham be proof against invective nay bitterly a captain sense of duty affected must not help passing feeling of indignation on friend behalf at gilk word be prudent enough to keep feeling to of course said if doe report for will be expelled may be sure of replied gilks what be got to do with wyndham looked up in surprise why said rather nervously of course know be silk be sort of in same boat over affair be if came out fancy riddell only suspect well if doe said gilks be le concern of mine promised know said wyndham to silk to say nothing about of course did said gilks 'd better stick to will be worse for think continued boy riddell say so if be to go tell doctor about only about know might perhaps not expel well said gilks well said wyndham of course must do after promising silk thought if promised not to say anything about make out that be fault must mind telling paddy gilks looked at boy in perplexity be code of morality decidedly beyond for moment looked a if half doubted whether be not jest what on earth do mean young muff exclaimed mean may go tell went two time to beamish promise to say nothing about gilks laughed once more what do care what go tell said if want to get expelled a badly a want to prevent be sure then really may exclaimed poor wyndham scarcely believing own ear of course if keep out of what on earth do care what tell may tell murdered somebody there for care oh thanks thanks cried wyndham with positively beaming face give word wo even mention silk a long a mention that be care for said gilks upon word added with sigh half to much care whether do not wyndham be too delighted relieved to pay heed to last dreary remark gratefully took leave feeling though battle be anything won yet be at least good deal nearer hope than have be hour ago very soon checked reviving flow of spirit a prospect of interview with silk began to loom out ahead have not seen silk since evening of rockshire match when a reader will remember meeting be anything pleasant one for timely arrival of third party might have ended severely for younger boy recollection of did not certainly add to hopefulness of present undertaking young wyndham be boy of such sanguine temper such elastic spirit that must not help hoping something must turn up in favour even now have got on far better than have dared to hope with gilks why not also with silk besides when be said be only chance therefore whether hoped anything nothing must try wandered about during hour between first second school with idea of coming across man in quadrangle playground must not make up mind to beard lion in den indeed at present have reason to fight shy of welch second third school passed before be able to renew search time be successful just a be beginning to give up hope be meditating show up for appearance sake at cricket practice caught sight of silk lolling on bench in distant corner of big heart sunk a made discovery be time for consulting inclination moved timidly over in direction of bench taking care to approach from behind so a to be spared discomfort of long inspection on way silk blissfully unconscious of visit in store be peacefully performing few simple addition sum on back of envelope calculating how with six shilling must be able to pay debt amounting to twenty six when wyndham shadow suddenly presented between figure gave quite start ah said in usual friendly style to appearance quite forgetful of incident of last interview with visitor ah wyndham so have come back wanted to see very particularly said boy plenty of room on seat said silk wyndham feeling far more uncomfortable at civility than have done at gilk roughness sat down nice weather said silk mockingly after pause have lasted little time want to ask favour great favour said wyndham feeling that beginning must be made very kind of replied silk going on with sum whistling softly to wyndham did not feel encouraged have mind to back out of venture even now desperation urged on know promised never to say word about beamish faltered at length so did replied silk drily must mind letting off promise what exclaimed silk putting down paper pencil staring at boy mean only a far a be concerned said wyndham hurriedly trying to avert storm a far a be concerned what on earth be talking about exclaimed other want to confess to doctor went two time said boy must mention name gilk only want to tell about have gone mad what cried silk utterly perplexed a gilks have be to understand boy meaning wyndham explained to a best must how matter stood how riddell appeared to have discovered delinquency be resolved to report of certain result of such exposure of one hope have by voluntarily confessing to doctor of averting expulsion silk listened to with sneer when be done replied mean to say have got impudence to come to to help to get out of scrape please silk said boy must be so grateful bah snarled silk have forgotten then nice row kicked up in study week ago way have treated term because if have have know be lot to ask pleaded boy be precious lot too much said silk one who have got cheek must do took up paper pencil again turned back on boy wo do then once more urged wyndham not likely rejoined silk if want favour 'd better go to precious friend riddell can go a soon a like want here if 'd only do said wyndham 'd do hear what say 'd never ask for money borrowed said boy quickly silk laughed a turned once more on victim said must really how awfully considerate upon word generosity of people be quite touching let see how much be thirty shilling said wyndham change out of post office order two pound make said silk putting figure down on paper three pound ten doe think what ask be worth three pound ten do be worth far more to said boy because be only thing can save from being expelled silk mused bit over figure then replied what must happen if did pay back must say word about cried boy eagerly if only 'd let off promise suppose told consider promise worth just double what do wyndham face fell for moment have not dared to write home about loss of last pocket money saw very little chance of raising wind for so large amount again yet seemed only hope must make right asked might think about said silk with sweet smile under condition know how can manage said wyndham will try wo mind then going to doctor what do suppose be fool enough to let do before have money exclaimed silk must have nice opinion of be use urging further wyndham saw have got all must hope for be little better than nothing for before must get money if got at explosion might have come must be expelled if only riddell now must wait little longer a thought crossed mind became aware that captain be slowly approaching bench on silk be sitting be anything pleasant for boy after have happened to be discovered thus in close companionship with very fellow have promised to avoid whom have along acknowledged to be cause of trouble instinct be to spring from place escape meet riddell silk saw intention in time forbade said with laugh run away a if be ashamed of stay where be let see keep good company now then oh must go exclaimed boy will think sort of thing will think be hypocrite after what promised oh do let go agitation only increased amusement of tormentor who with view to give captain a vivid impression a possible laid hand affectionately on boy arm beamed most benignantly upon be use for wyndham to resist after suspicious a might appear be doing nothing wrong yet what must riddell think captain be pacing big in moody abstracted manner at first appeared not to notice either bench occupant wyndham a sat trembled in silk clutch wildly hoped something might cause to turn aside back came straight on in doing so suddenly caught sight of two boy started flushed quickly for moment looked a if be inclined to make wild dash to rescue younger boy from companionship in found glance changed that intention if intention have be face fell walked past with averted eye apparently recognising boy paying heed to wyndham feebly attempted salute before be out of hearing silk broke into loud laugh upon word be a good a play cried did splendidly young 'un looked a guilty a dog bit will give up for lost now with vengeance wyndham misery must have moved pity of one silk new hope have risen within have be cruelly dashed by unhappy accident felt further care a to what happened to riddell must have lost faith in now must appear little better than ungrateful hypocrite impostor last motive for sparing must be swept away so boy thought duty of reporting must now become satisfaction tore from seat exclaimed let go brute silk looked at in astonishment then relapsing into smile said oh indeed brute be yes be let see forget what little favour be wanted brute to do for want to do favour cried wyndham passionately not even to allow to go to doctor tell about beamish not even must do now may now find out what like might interest if went told few thing about said silk go a soon a like tell anything like cried wyndham care must even care to have back three pound ten said boy not even if ever thought of paying back silk time have be growing furious last thing have expected be that boy whom supposed to be utterly in power must thus rise in revolt shake off shred of old allegiance found have gone too far for once last defiant taunt of late victim cut to quick sprang from seat made wild dash at boy wyndham be too quick for escaped leaving adversary baffled a have never be before almost doubting whether have not be still be dreaming wyndham ran a fast a must in direction of school must have probably gone on running till reached own study have not sight of riddell slowly going same way ahead of suddenly checked progress a be almost ran over before perceived who be for riddell just at moment have halted in walk stooped to pick up book lay on path however when wyndham saw who be swerved hurriedly in direction got to destination by roundabout way feeling a reached about a miserable hopeless a be possible for boy to be chapter twenty nine select party at doctor young wyndham have only known what be in captain mind a walked that afternoon across big must probably have thought twice before went long way round to avoid silk little piece of pantomime have not have effect author intended in quick glance riddell have given towards bench occupant have taken in pretty accurately real state of case poor fellow said to be surely in trouble enough without being laid hold of by cad silk think will fancy have captured old favourite let if have captured doe seem very sure of must hold down on seat like wonder brings together here wonder if have better go interfere think wo just now so walked on troubled enough to be sure not concluding quite a much from what saw a wyndham feared silk hoped a walked on fellow glared at from distance others passing closer cut dead few of most ardent parrett junior took liberty of hissing one ventured to call out pointedly who cut rudder line riddell however though winced under insult took little notice of be a determined a ever to wait confirmation of suspicion before unmasked culprit equally convinced that duty honour demanded that must lose not moment in coming to conclusion be in midst of reflection that small book wyndham have seen pick up caught eye picked up mechanically after noticing that appeared to be notebook have owner name in beginning carried with forgot about till reached study even here be time before again attracted attention a importance be wholly eclipsed by content of note found lying on table ran a follows dear riddell will join at tea evening at seven expect fairbairn

absurd entry most of meant nothing at seemed more like symptom of disease than healthy production of sane boy in one case however there seemed to be method in author madness have given clue so important that riddell in pondering over that evening calculating true value be very nearly being late for doctor tea at seven o'clock however came to just in time to decorate person hurry across quadrangle before clock struck on way over met parson telson walking arm in arm although same spectacle have met eye on average twice day that term be about commonest show in willoughby sight of faithful pair at particular time when revelation of bosher diary be tingling in ear impressed captain indeed impressed so much that at imminent risk of being late for doctor tea pulled up to speak to parson a became loyal parrett made a though must pas on telson held back say two said riddell will come to breakfast with to morrow morning after chapel without so much a waiting for reply bolted off leaving two must be guest trifle concerned a to sanity clock be beginning to strike a riddell knocked at doctor door began at length to realise what be in for did not know whether to be thankful not that bloomfield fairbairn must be there to share misery must be two extra witness to suffering tribulation be hardly likely to relieve however there be one comfort might have chance before evening be over of telling bloomfield that now have reason to believe suspicion about culprit have be wrong how thankful be have held out against temptation to name poor wyndham two day ago well riddell how be said doctor in usual genial fashion think have met lady before mr riddell dear miss stringer gentleman have probably seen before also have have riddell saluted lady very much a must have saluted two mad dog nodded usual willoughby nod to two fellow monitor who having already got over introduction have retreated to safe distance common suffering be surest bond of sympathy riddell positively beamed on rival in recognition of salute trust mother said mr patrick whose indisposition be regretting on last occasion when be here be now better very well indeed hope replied captain hardly knowing what said thank trust mr riddell chimed in miss stringer that be gratified by result of election thank replied riddell beginning to shake in shoe indeed if remember right professed to be liberal yes be radical got in faltered riddell wondering why in common charity one came to rescue pray mr riddell continued miss stringer ruthlessly can tell difference between liberal radical have often longed to know have doubt be authority riddell at point seriously meditated forced retreat there be saying what desperate act might have committed have not doctor providentially come to rescue election altogether said laughing be rather sore point in school told dear about manner in mr cheeseman letter be received did replied mr patrick who for few moment have have eye upon bloomfield with view to draw out now do really suppose mr bloomfield that boy in house for instance attached true importance at to issue of contest bloomfield who have not be aware till question be half over that have be addressed to started said most fatal observation must have made eh beg pardon be inquired said mr patrick fixing with eye whether really supposed that boy in house for instance attached true importance at to issue of contest bloomfield received ponderous question meekly made feeble effort to turn over in mind then dreading to hear repeated once more answered oh decidedly ma'be in what respect inquired lady settling down on settee awaiting with raised eyebrow victim answer poor bloomfield be match for deliberate style of tactic be yellow replied feebly what sir demanded mr patrick whig mean said exactly what mean to know be do of appreciate distinction between whig a mr riddell term liberal riddell winced between whig radical oh certainly not replied bloomfield wildly yet say that decidedly attached true importance to issue of contest be very extraordinary mr patrick rose majestically to take seat at table leaving bloomfield writhing turned mentally inside out to recover a best must from interesting political discussion rockshire match be great triumph said doctor cheerily a company established at festive board surprise too surely be not yes sir said fairbairn who seeing bloomfield be not yet in condition to discourse felt incumbent on to reply never expected to win by so much be quite event said doctor head of three house playing together in same eleven yes sir replied fairbairn bloomfield here be most impartial bloomfield said something sounded like not at be especially glad to see welcher coming out again said doctor with friendly nod to riddell yes

doctor think so sir replied fairbairn politely handing toast to miss stringer a spoke evidently be so well together a men what mr fairbairn asked miss stringer at point in most stately tone what pray be exact meaning of expression well together a applied to company of youth bloomfield riddell groaned inwardly for comrade have seen what be coming have marked rash approach to mouth of volcano with growing apprehension have be helpless to hold back now turn be come have met fate so at least imagined what then be amazement when turned not hair at question replied stirring tea complacently a did so see of rockshire men may have be good cricketer yet if have not be used to playing together a fellow have be must have decided pull on miss stringer regarded speaker critically have not be used to have problem so readily answered appeared to discover suspicion of rudeness in boy speech called for set down understand what mean by pull mr fairbairn said sternly why replied fairbairn who be really interested in subject quite pleased to be drawn out on so congenial topic be almost a important to get to know play of own men a to know play of opponent for instance when know bloomfield ball break bit to off generally know whereabouts in field to expect if be taken when porter go on with slows one know to stand in close look out for catch yes said bloomfield gaining sudden courage by example of comrade be just where rockshire be weak be always shifting about field bowler be certain have scarcely played together once added riddell also taking heart of grace entering into humour of situation seemed to save up good bowler for end instead of beginning with hitting men got easy bowling others who be never expected to score in case be put out by good in respect see continued fairbairn addressing miss stringer school eleven always get pull of scratch team miss stringer who during conversation have be growing manifestly uncomfortable vouchsafed reply turning to sister said with marked formality dear be brown at home when called afternoon regret to say be out replied mr patrick with withering glance round table of course depends too said bloomfield replying to fairbairn last

eleven a regularly a school doe dear have done tea inquired mr patrick voice across table yes will ring said doctor allow said fairbairn rising hastily nearly knocking over miss stringer in eagerness spinster who have already received in own opinion sufficient affront for one evening put worst construction possible on accident answered with evident ill temper be very clumsy sir beg pardon indeed said fairbairn hope be not hurt be silent sir fairbairn quite taken aback by unexpected exclamation did not know what to say looked round inquiringly at doctor a much a to ask if lady be often taken way doctor however volunteered explanation looked uncomfortable coughed if will excuse said miss stringer to sister with forced severity of tone will go to room be not well fear said mr patrick will go with next moment enemy be gone doctor boy be together dr patrick who to tell truth seemed scarcely le relieved than visitor made attempt to apologise for miss stringer sudden indisposition embarked at once on friendly talk about school affair have be only object in inviting boy have nothing momentous to say important change to propose indeed object appeared to be more to get to talk among on matter of common interest to school to let see that sympathy be with in effort for public good reference be made to state of affair in parrett to rivalry of two captain that doctor knew about matter one doubted took wise course of leaving to right at same time of making very clear what opinion be of effect of disunion divided interest in great public school altogether evening be profitably pleasantly spent when at boy took leave be with increased respect for head master one lady greatly to relief did not return to scene miss stringer said fairbairn a three walked together across quadrangle doe seem to appreciate cricket others laughed say said bloomfield put foot into awfully thought be chaffing time did what pity replied fairbairn of course be bound to help out when be once

captain nervously just wanted to tell that believe have be wrong in guess about boat race affair boy suspected now fancy have nothing to do with be still determined to keep to then asked bloomfield somewhat coldly of course replied captain at point reached parrett boy have inclination to pursue unpleasant topic more unpleasant because be one bar to friendship desired good night said bloomfield stiffly good night replied captain chapter thirty new light on old question fairbairn be startled next morning while engaged over toilet by sudden visit from captain what must be wrong to bring there at hour with face full of anxiety voice full of concern a inquired will do favour old man fairbairn knew friend have be in trouble for time past be sore beset on many hand have not attempted to intrude into secret to volunteer aid for knew riddell must ask if wanted in proof of here be of course will replied if can do happen to have pot of jam must lend fairbairn fairly staggered at unexpected request have imagined be to be asked at very least to accompany friend on matter of moment to doctor study to share tremendous secret affecting honour of willoughby to be asked now for loan of pot of jam be too great shock for gravity burst out laughing pot of jam exclaimed do mean oh sort have got said captain eagerly suppose have got pie of sort muffin fairbairn gaped at visitor with something like apprehension a came out with extraordinary request captain voice be grave suspicion of jest lurked in face must possibly have succumbed to mental strain of past term taken leave of wit

that captain got sent off to own breakfast in big hall half bribed thereto by promise of reversion of coming feast then feeling quite exhausted by morning excitement sat down awaited visitor arrived in due time still to judge of leisurely approach languid knock little suspicious of whole affair moment door opened eye fell on table manner changed to one of most amiable briskness good morning said

what narrow escape have have of doing boy cared for most in willoughby grievous injustice indeed by suspecting privately have done injustice enough a be for must not too soon atone in midst of relief about boat race must scarcely bring to regard seriously boy real offence bad a have be indeed be not until wyndham referred to that afternoon that gravity occurred to just a special meeting of parliament convened by private invitation of game ashley to select few of own way of thinking be assembling wyndham in compliance with message from captain strolled out into big towards very bench where yesterday have have memorable talk with silk riddell be waiting there for a boy approached wretched haggard look smote captain heart with remorse have scarcely spirit to return riddell salute a seated beside on bench waited for what be to come old fellow said riddell look so wretched thing may be so bad a think how must be anything else said wyndham dolefully if will listen to not look so frightfully down said captain will tell wyndham made feeble attempt to rouse turned to hear what captain have to say wonder said riddell how came to know about visit to beamish must astonish to hear till time yesterday never knew about at what exclaimed wyndham incredulously be talking to about two three day before so thought thought when said be duty to report that honour of school be involved in that be talking about scrape at beamish of course be said wyndham what else must have be talking about confessed to must see what honour of school have to do with going to beamish must asked riddell well perhaps have did see at time of course not said captain if have be thinking of beamish must never have said stupid thing why what do mean said wyndham puzzled why in talk never once mentioned beamish concluded what suspected of be concluded that scrape be confessing be one suspected of what do suspect of then inquired wyndham if be that be ashamed to say said captain suspected of having cut line of parrett rudder at boat race wyndham in shock of announcement broke out into almost hysterical laugh suspected of cutting rudder line gasped yes said riddell sorrowfully be ashamed to say why however must exclaimed boy in strange bewilderment riddell quietly told whole story of mysterious letter of visit to tom boat boy of knife of recollection of wyndham movement on night in question then of supposed admission of guilt wyndham listened to with breathless attention wonder when be done sighed a replied why riddell be like story be be said captain rather pitiful story a far a be concerned not bit replied boy a sympathetically a if riddell be person to be pitied be person who have wronged be misunderstanding how on earth must have helped suspecting one must have done same added after pause what ought to do about beamish of course be end of scrape mischief be promised two cad never to say word about by way saw with silk on bench yesterday afternoon yes said riddell did seem to be enjoying must think be 'd be trying to get to let off promise have offered to do for seven pound under condition might have closed with if have come past just then held down to rile got so wild rounded on made in frightful rage be very likely now may tell paddy if not said riddell be well out of clutch old man strike best way can atone for affair be by keeping out of for future having no more to do with fellow like what on earth must have done said boy without to look after 'd have gone to dog to dead certainty seems can look after rather too much sometimes said captain ah there be silk coming way need stop here to give return match come on two friend rose strolled off happily arm in arm chapter thirty one welch versus parrett junior of course said riddell a wyndham strolled down by river afternoon now that mystery be cleared up be a far off a ever finding out who really cut rudder line yes knife be only clue prof nothing for be always leaving about lending losing suppose kept one entire week in pocket time have for matter of that be not at impossible may have dropped in boat house time often used to change jacket there riddell have half expected wyndham must be able to afford clue a to who have borrowed taken knife at particular time be rather relieved to find that must not tom boat boy said distinctly say that fellow who be getting out of window dropped knife a did so of course may be fancy anyhow want knife more so may a well take so saying produced knife from pocket handed to companion want beastly thing cried wyndham taking pitching into middle of river goodness know be done mischief enough say wrote that note must have known something about of course said captain evidently intends thing to be found out without help never mind said wyndham cheerily give little rest old man come down see second eleven practise have be too much up tree to turn up lately mean to do so evening say wo be jolly if brother can come down to umpire in match will said riddell pair forthwith launched out into discussion of virtue of wyndham senior in one be scarcely more enthusiastic than other on way back to big met parson telson trotting down to bathing shed face of two young gentleman looked considerably perplexed a saw captain supposed victim walking arm in arm however with delightful simplicity of youth thought must be right somehow having important news of sort to relate made scruple about intruding on interview oh say riddell began telson have just come from parliament end of row last time be nothing to what happened asked captain why know said parson be game ashley affair summoning meeting sent round private note something telling fellow there must be special meeting signed by game first lord of admiralty ashley home secretary lot of fellow be taken in by turned up of course have taken good care not to summon anybody be sweet on so be packed meeting at least thought so telson showed up whole lot of skyrocket gave lively time of see said telson eagerly taking up narrative did guess 'd cut up rough because have be in row of sort once twice before wyndham broke out laughing at point have really exclaimed well continued telson too full of story to heed interruption stuck game in chair made frightfully rambling speech about that boat race business said knew who chap be be sheltering that be a bad bit a if 'd done did care hang about honour of school whole lot of bosh of sort sung out oh oh question ' once twice know be saving up so ashley got up said be awfully astonished to hear about howling cram of course for knew about a much a one did considered disgrace to school only thing to do be to kick out proposed then shindy began said parson sent young lawkins off to tell crossfield what be going on directly ashley sat down old telson got up moved amendment tried to cry down must do must rather not said telson proudly stuck there like leech fellow yelled too so that nobody must hear one speak kept on singing out hole in corner hole in corner for about twenty minute there be enough of to turn out then tried to get round by being civil be up to dodge parson went on after then old bosher then king then wakefield when 'd done started again must have seen how jolly wild got cried parson lot of fellow laughed joined too old game ashley be regularly mad came round bawled in ear that gave thousand line 'd be detained rest of term did hear when tried to get at hit out with ruler must do never saw such lark presently crossfield turned up said telson eye must have seen how yellow green looked when dropped in walked up to usual place shut up for bit a soon a came know fancy 'd have sooner kept up be bound to say something when row stopped so game tried to rush thing through get fellow to vote before crossfield knew what be up be to be done way did quite hear what motion be say a solemn a judge oh be about honour of school riddell ' excuse mr deputy chairman ex monitor say crossfield there be regular laugh at hit because of course game have more right in chair now be not monitor than have if be anything to do with honour of school of course must be in better hand than yours who have summoned meeting on sly taken such care to select nice little party tried to stop at that ca stop business now be just going to take vote when came in ' said game exactly say crossfield propping up comfortably against back of form a if be going to stay night be just why came be just why bloomfield porter coates fairbairn few other gentleman who have sort of mild interest in honour of school although be nothing of course to yours be coming on too will be here before have done speech by way one of kid said with wink way might go fetch riddell 'd like to be here too ' shoved young wakefield out of door to make believe to go fetch 'd have quite enough of shut up meeting of sudden adjourn meeting ' cried game a red a turkey cock right will suit just a well ' say crossfield grinning be to particular day will get notice a before ' of course did stop to answer so gave end of cheer for old crossfield then came on here having delivered of full true particular account of afternoon adventure two small hero continued trot down to river to refresh honest limb after day labour version of proceeding be very little exaggerated a crossfield several others who be present entertained own particular circle of friend with same story whole affair became joke against luckless game ashley even own house did not spare a for bloomfield evinced displeasure in way surprised two hero what be foolery have be up to two said coming into preparation room after tea where most of senior parretts be assembled be not flattering certainly to two in question to have noble protest for honour of school thus designated game answered rather sheepishly have be up to foolery may not call foolery said bloomfield who be in anything good temper do making whole house ridiculous goodness know there be be quite enough done in way without wanting help to do more what be use of going on like said ashley suppose did to amuse do if did amuse yourselves amused one else growled bloomfield everybody laughing at felt something ought to be done about riddell began game felt 'd business to feel if be best can show for said bloomfield will never set thing right look here said game quickly losing temper know well enough be meant for best need come kick up row like before everybody if care to have riddell shown up be reason why must precious lot have shown up if 'd wanted to get one on side must have done better suppose one must be frightened out of skin by anything couple of ass who 'd be kicked out of monitorship have to say bloomfield certainly have habit of expressing warmly at time on present occasion may have done so rather more warmly than case deserved be put out angry at ridiculous performance of parrett boy in felt entire house be more le compromised a to riddell bloomfield still kept own private opinion of difference between more ardent comrade be that have sense to keep what thought to at rate gave deep offence now to game ashley who retired in high dudgeon greatly crestfallen to proclaim wrong to small sympathetic knot of admirer perhaps most serious blow officious young gentleman have received hardly second to snubbing by parretts captain have be mutiny of own junior on whose cooperation have calculated to dead certainty to find parson bosher king co standing up in defence of riddell against be phenomenon so wonderful when came to think of that be inclined to imagine be only sane boy left out of house of lunatic be only consolation that mixed with affair at a to junior have far more to think about in three day match with welch must be upon panic ensued on discovery have be contemptuously confident of superior prowess be not until one two of have actually be down to inspect play of rival team bloomfield have come down to one of own practice declared publicly that be safe to be beaten hollow that regarded coming contest seriously then went to work in grim earnest having broken with game on whom have usually depended for instruction reproof boldly claimed service of bloomfield even pressed willing mr parrett into service mr parrett pulled very long face first afternoon came down to look at have be coaching welcher for week two past therefore knew pretty well what opponent ought to be be bound to admit that young parretts be very much below mark have few good men parson be fair bat king bowled moderately tail of eleven be in shocking condition everything must be done during next few day be done cricket be not study can be crammed up like virgil euclid despite united effort of bloomfield mr parrett few other authority team be pronounced to be shady one at best a took place on field of battle riddell have kept men steadily at to last with generosity very few appreciated forbore to claim mr parrett assistance at during last few day of practice got fairbairn one two of schoolhouse senior instead with help kept up courage hope of young welcher wisely taking care however by little occasional judicious snubbing to prevent from becoming too cocky sure of result be quite event to see welcher flag hoisted once more on cricket ground indeed be such event that doctor came down to watch play while muster of schoolboy be almost a large a at senior house match among spectator none be more interested in event than senior who have taken upon responsibility of coaching respective team riddell be quite excited nervous a watched men go out to field while bloomfield though must have be last to own felt decidedly fidgety for fate of young champion however parretts who went in first began better than one expected parson king went boldly not to say rashly to work from outset knocked bowling about considerably before lucky ball from philpot got round bat of former demolished wicket wakefield followed too managed to put few run together a soon a wicket fell dismal quarter of hour followed for parretts boy after boy in finery of spotless flannel pad glove swaggered up to wicket after taking middle in magnificent style giving lordly glance round field a though to select best point for placing stroke lifted bat miserably at first ball came have chance of lifting at be melancholy spectacle far more calculated to excite pity than amusement bloomfield chafed growled for time then unable to stand longer went off in disgust leaving young reprobate to fate scarcely le remarkable than collapse of parrett be steadiness of welch in field although have little to do did what there be to do neatly well unlike many junior eleven did quietly junior match at willoughby have usually be more famous for noise than cricket on occasion order of thing be reversed riddell a looked on heard compliment from quarter bestowed on young hero might be excused if felt rewarded for labour patience of past month offended not at to hear good result attributed generally to mr parrett instruction knew be true mr parrett took care to disclaim small amount of merit in matter be wonder to said to fairbairn in hearing of good many senior who be wont to treat anything have to say on athletic matter a authoritative be wonder to how riddell who be only moderate player have turned out such first rate eleven be about best cricket coach have have have seen several in time have worked on enthusiasm without stint next best to that have not so much hammered into what ought to do a have hammered out of what ought not to do three fellow out of five never think of be sure said fairbairn see how steady be inning too continued mr parrett three coach out of five must lay down a first rule of cricket be especially with youngster be steady first be expert next be right order riddell have discovered must even back steady eleven of moderate player against rickety eleven of good one in fact boy ca be cricketer at anything else unless be steady now see unless be mistaken will give quite a good account of at wicket a did on field off strolled honest mr parrett bat in hand to umpire leaving hearer not little impressed with force of view on first principle of cricket master prophecy be correct welcher notwithstanding fact that have only twenty five run to get to equal rival first inning played steady careful inning in just trebled parretts score bowling against be not strong certainly took liberty with indeed both captain mr parrett have so ruthlessly denounced snubbed anything like fancy hitting that batting be inclined to err on side of over cautious more run might doubtless have be made by little freer swing of bat however authority be well satisfied cusack carried bat for eighteen much to own gratification of companion pilbury philpot walker made double figure required riddell authority in face of splendid achievement to keep men from jeopardising second inning in field by yielding prematurely to elation for goodness ' sake hulloa till be out of wood said may catch up on yet seventy five be such big score after if look out will muddle chance away then how small will look with such advice to hold in check went out a soberly a before to field devoted whole energy to task of disposing of enemy wicket for fewest possible run succeeded quite a well a before indeed second inning of parretts be feeble imitation of first melancholy performance parson king wakefield be only three who made stand even fared worse than before side must put together be twenty one run about even have great trouble when became known that welcher have won match by inning twenty nine run great be amazement of willoughby greater still be mortification of unlucky parretts more be said about grand concert in intended to celebrate triumph evidently felt have not much to be proud of consequently avoiding public entry into house slunk in quietly shutting out distant sound of revelry rejoicing in victorious house mingled tear over sympathetic pot of tea to even telson be not invited chapter thirty two climax to everything among few willoughbites who took interest at in junior match be gilks be hardly to be wondered at that schoolhouse boy must not concern much about contest between fag of welch parrett yet if truth be known must have be just same have match be greatest event of season for gilks from cause other be in condition to care about anything wandered about listlessly that afternoon avoiding crowded big bending step rather to unfrequented meadow by river what be thinking about a paced along none of very few boy who met that afternoon must guess that be nothing pleasant be very evident at beginning of very term gilks have be one of noisiest liveliest fellow in willoughby although principle have never be lofty spirit always used to be excellent who knew best must scarcely recognise now in anxious spiritless monitor companion whose shout laugh have be so familiar only few month ago among who met afternoon be wibberly wibberly like gilks felt very little interest in junior match be one of small party who yesterday have come in for such smart snubbing from bloomfield only way to show sense of ingratitude of such treatment especially towards old toady like be to profess interest in event be notoriously interesting parretts captain so wibberly strolled down afternoon to river naturally met gilks two be not by mean chum indeed be scarcely to be called friend have one considerable bond of sympathy in common dislike for schoolhouse still more for riddell gilks a reader know be anything loyal schoolhouse man ever since became monitor have cast in lot with rival house so that be generally considered considered to be quite a much of parrett a schoolhouser so be not down looking at little boy said wibberly said gilks awful rot said wibberly making fuss about plea doe hurt replied gilks in opinion be bit of vanity on part of riddell 'd like to make one think have be coaching kid be just show off well let show off who care growled gilks very well ought to be hooted round school instead of flashing there in big hypocritical cad well why go do said gilks 'd get plenty to join must no must even bloomfield taking part be gammoned somehow well that doe prevent going hooting doe said gilks with sneer have right to enjoy a well a one else what have come round to worship holiness too asked wibberly who have at least expected sympathy from gilks not exactly said gilks bitterly have come round to letting cad alone what be good of bothering mean to say 'd let go on knowing who fellow be who cut rudder line of boat not make say who be expect that be stuff about knowing at said gilks not between fancy be have tip from somewhere have bah believe 'd like to make believe know about must pay know one think know not must have told fellow name long ago object must have in keeping back oh know say gammon about not being quite sure be have time enough to be sure by now gilks walked on in silence for little then inquired suppose did get to know who be what must be use use exclaimed wibberly in amazement why what do mean by jove be sorry for fellow when turn up will soon find out use of gilks said nothing walked on evidently out of humour wibberly having nothing better to do accompanied by way said latter presently seeing companion be not disposed to continue former conversation what be up between silk be true have have row gilks growled out something sounded very like oath replied yes what about inquired inquisitive wibberly who seemed to have knack of hitting upon unwelcome topic must do good to know growled gilks heard be betting row something of sort said wibberly eh yes something of sort said gilks well said wibberly never cared much for silk always seemed to know little too much for must break heart if be mean to said gilks in tone belied word even struck wibberly by wretchedness say said be awfully down in mouth time what be wrong what make think anything wrong be right tell said gilks half angrily wibberly be half inclined to say that must not have thought if have not be told so judging from companion look that little pleasantry must not be appreciated forbore walked on in silence be relief when wibberly at length discovered that be time for to be going back gilks wanted nobody company be glad to be left alone yet must gladly have escaped even from own company to judge by miserable look a walked on alone be le pleasant than be sorry now have not gone to watch junior where at least must have heard something le hateful than own thought seen something le hateful than dreary creation of own troubled imagination what be use of keeping up said bitterly to care thing ca be worse than be down in mouth 'd be down in mouth if be fool have good mind to yet dare face be use of trusting to fellow like silk bah how hate will betray a soon a ever suit oh care let gilks have reached dismal climax in reflection when suddenly became aware that object of meditation be approaching silk have own reason for not joining throng be looking on at junior match may have be mere lack of interest may have be special desire to take walk whichever be presence now be about a unwelcome apparition a gilks must have encountered smile on intruder face showed pretty clearly that be aware of fact what be prowling about here for said a came up with insolence of warder addressing convict have right to walk here if choose replied gilks sulkily what be here for to find want to speak to replied silk want to speak to replied gilks moving on replied silk with sneer will have to do whether want not boy there be something about welcher have effect of cowing companion gilks fuming inwardly with face a black a thunder said well say what have got to say be done with silk laughed thank will take time not yours way be going way at said gilks standing still very well be going way come with began to walk on gilks sullenly following saw wyndham other day said silk suppose did what did want know foolery other did listen to need tell lie what did want say how must know retorted gilks what did want do hear repeated other wanted to let blab about something about beamish be did tell might yes said might blab about too for cared so may wish to goodness must whatever business have to tell might say word about demanded silk angrily what business good deal more business than have got to ask question do know what be done care care snarled silk fast losing temper that foolery of yours have spoiled everything so much better care care exclaimed silk furiously will see care too fool what be happened then asked gilks why riddell for goodness ' sake start on cried gilks viciously be nothing to do with have be know blockhead suspected wyndham of boat race business ca make out how did young fool along thought be beamish be in row about riddell must have known to day if have given young idiot leave to go blab so clear up let blab wish 'd clear up everything growled rather groaned gilks look here said silk stopping short in walk rounding on victim have have quite enough of 'd better shut up know must make sorry for if chose gilks said nothing walked on sullenly worse thing about continued silk be that now wyndham riddell be a thick a brother young toady sure to tell everything suppose doe there be suppose about choose to have tell how can help said gilks must get hold of young again said silk will have to manage who said gilks with bitter laugh yes talk so loud do hear will have to manage think can put up to way for getting hold of can spare trouble said gilks stopping short folding arm doggedly wo do cried silk in passion be second time in one week silk have be thus defied time by boy whom have imagined to be completely in power wyndham mutiny have not wholly surprised from gilks have never expected wo do there said gilks now fairly at bay determined enough silk glared at for moment then laughed scornfully wo know what be saying yes know said gilks know what will do yes will tell silk face fell be beginning to discover once more have overdone part that ground be taken from under made one last effort to recover say gilks said half coaxing half warning be fool ruin did mean to be offensive know be a much in interest a mine if can get hold of young wyndham again if want get be not going to do once more said gilks with pale face clenched teeth silk manner changed once more face became livid eye flashed a sprang at gilks with sudden blow exclaimed take then be a good a proclaiming that game be over a gilks guilty confidant have retained to last sort of influence now with blow last shred of superiority have gone stood there beaten before ever fight began gilks have expected blow have not be prepared for suddenness struck full on cheek for moment staggered only for moment wasting word returned vehemently next moment fight have begun that fight be not growth of day week for many week have be getting nearer nearer sometimes by rapid stride sometimes by imperceptible step always getting nearer until now have suddenly reached climax cry fight gilks silk spread like wildfire over welcher in heyday of triumph heard above even chorus of glorious bouncer hearing forsook revelry hurried towards parretts quitted melancholy teapot rushed with one accord to spot ere reached telson be there many schoolhouse limpet game ashley wibberly from parrett tucker know not what crowd from welch crowded round took side speculated on result cheered impartially hit far be from to describe fight be different from twenty other fight same term except from one fact that combatant be senior one cared atom about quarrel merit be quite enough that be even match that there be plenty of straight hitting smart parrying that lasted over quarter of hour be wonder lasted so long not that men must not stay because monitor with power to stop appeared on scene indeed only monitor present be gilks took step to end conflict at length however while result be still undecided cry of cave be raised look out here riddell cried small boy round be just beginning combatant evinced desire to desist on account of captain approach riddell be not alone fairbairn be with being naturally attracted by crowd shouting hurried up in time to see end of round a soon a be over pushed way in among crowd entered ring stop fight said riddell two combatant glared at angrily gilks replied who say so say so said riddell quietly day be long gone by when captain issued order in apologetic voice diffident manner have learned enough during term to discover value of little self confidence have profited by discovery willoughby be far more docile to order than to request on present occasion gilks silk seemed disposed to argue matter put on jacket sulkily without further word to one to monitor betook battered self to several quarter willoughby perceiving that matter be at end also dispersed returned to several quarter welcher resumed interrupted revel with unabated rejoicing melancholy parretts called for more hot water to eke out consolation of teapot limpet turned in again to preparation senior to study one criticising fight wondering how must have ended scarcely one troubling much about merit le still about consequence one of consequence principal in engagement be not long in learning message arrived for before evening be over that be reported to doctor be to go to room at nine next morning silk did not get message till late a have be absent most of evening in tucker study who be expert at repairing damage incurred in pugilistic encounter when about bedtime returned to own study found captain note lying on table broke out into state of fury to say least of be well there be one at hand to witness late a hour be went at once to riddell study riddell be half undressed a visitor entered what do want inquired want do mean to say have reported to doctor of course be fight be bound to report bound to report snivelling humbug have sent name up yet why do want to know said riddell who have ceased to be in bodily fear of silk for time past because want to know have sent up have right will be sorry for said silk be sorry for replied captain silk saw at glance that captain be not to be bullied changed tone suppose know said will be expelled doctor doe usually expel for fighting said captain of course not remember getting note from little time ago from never have note from what not one telling to go down see tom boat boy be that from exclaimed riddell in astonishment of course be of course know now what mean must discover nothing said captain mean to say know who cut rudder line who gilks chapter thirty three treaty of peace captain first impulse on receiving from silk astounding piece of information be to go at once to schoolhouse confront gilks with accuser second impulse be to doubt whole story look upon a mere fabrication got up in vague hope of preventing from reporting fight to doctor be absurd to suppose gilks have cut rudder line not that be action of must be incapable on score accusation be likely enough then riddell remembered gilks though schoolhouse boy have along be strong partisan of parretts boat ever since have be turned out of own boat have made secret of hope that parrett might win have even if rumour spoke truly lost money on race how be likely then must do absurd thing a cut rudder line of very boat wanted to win on whose success have even made bet be much more likely that silk have made wild charge for sake of embarrassing captain leading to reconsider determination to report fight what followed partly confirmed idea want to get gilks expelled said silk with half whine very different from late bullying tone doctor never expels fellow for fighting will when find out other business said silk really ca help said captain not quite seeing how two offence be involved one with be bound to come out continued silk gilks will bring into too say ca get back name certainly not said captain be glad enough to hush up when thought be young wyndham have done said captain winced silk be quick enough to see profess to be fair honest do call fair to shelter one fellow because be friend tell about because be eh riddell be not bad move on silk part question thrust home have be content to leave matter there might have be time before captain with own scrupulous way of regarding thing must have detected fallacy not for first time silk overdid besides said seeing have made impression foolishly thinking to follow up besides young wyndham long way from being out of wood yet of course want to do must make rather awkward for if chose captain fired up scornfully silk did not notice continued must like to see expelled must if be to tell know about must be to certainty riddell on whom incautious word have acted with result wholly different from what be intended must scarcely contain to talk coolly a replied please leave room want here silk looked round in startled way at word face changed colour what demanded please leave room replied captain not till promise to get back name will hing of sort wo know consequence riddell said nothing will tell of wyndham said silk please leave room once more said captain silk glared at took step forward a though meant to try one last method for extorting promise riddell stood ground boldly spirit of bully faltered will be sorry for snarled latter riddell said nothing waited patiently for to go seeing that nothing more be to be gained baffled on point even on point where made sure of having enemy silk turned on heel went slamming door viciously behind riddell have rarely felt sense of relief a experienced on being thus left to suddenness of silk disclosure strange way in have be followed up have disconcerted now have time to think calmly over whole affair two thing seemed pretty clear one be strange a seemed there must be something in silk story must hardly have invented stuck to in way have for other purpose than embarrassing captain pressure have applied to get riddell to withdraw name before doctor saw confirmed idea other point made clear be that duty at cost even at cost of young wyndham be to report fight make term with offender if result be what silk threatened must only hope doctor must deal leniently with boy one other thing be clear too must see wyndham bloomfield in morning with resolve not without prayer for wisdom better than own to act in crisis retired to bed early next morning before almost sign of life showed in willoughby captain be up dressed magic so often attends on night sleep have done work on a walked across quadrangle fresh summer morning head be clear mind made up outer door of schoolhouse be still unopened paced outside a seemed to for hour before must get in went at once to wyndham study found that young athlete arraying in cricket flannel hullo riddell cried a captain entered have come to see practice be going to play scratch match with of senior play too will captain did not reply to invitation serious face convinced wyndham something must be wrong what be up say inquired looking concerned nothing very pleasant said riddell heard of fight last night eh between silk gilks yes half guessed must come to that have be quarrelling lot lately reported be to go to doctor after breakfast said riddell will catch expect said wyndham paddy sure to be down on because be senior expect to catch at least silk say so came to last night tried to get to withdraw name when said must be threatened to tell about get into row wyndham face changed colour what say do think really will exclaimed think be very likely said captain of course ca withdraw name said boy have right to do ca replied captain oh of course say have better do faltered boy hoped that bother be over must advise to go to doctor before chapel tell boy face fell how can promised must silk must let off when asked be going to tell of say have much better let doctor hear from than from if only must exclaimed boy how can want to persuade to break promise said captain be sorry for suppose be sure to get expelled said boy dismally be sure to make a bad against a can riddell reflected little then said perhaps be only threat more at rate if doctor be told be sure to give chance of telling everything so give up hope old man poor wyndham did not look feel very hopeful certainly a thought over situation thanks for telling about anyhow said say will be there to hear what say know think so if be sent for let know will go with with grain of comfort captain went leaving wyndham anything disposed to show up at cricket practice indeed for little while gave up thought of going out be not till messenger arrived to tell be keeping everybody waiting that screwed up to effort went riddell meanwhile with other half of mission still to execute went over to parrett parson be lounging about at door with towel over arm waiting a one might have guessed for telson have bloomfield gone out asked captain of youthful hero parson who ever since famous breakfast in riddell room have looked upon captain with eye of favour replied think so will go see if like thanks if be in tell want to speak to serene hold towel do mind be bosher may try to collar if see tell telson will be back in second off went leaving captain in charge of bosher towel soon returned with message bloomfield be getting up must be out in minute two say said after two have waited impatiently time for own expected schoolfellow did see much of fight last night said riddell did see at oh hard line got there late a went to tell telson gilks used right too much know thought so keep guard to speak of hullo where on earth have be time last exclamation be in honour of telson who appeared on scene at moment with whom speaker joyfully departed leaving riddell only half informed a to scientific defect in gilks style of boxing in due time bloomfield appeared not little curious to know object of early interview riddell too be embarrassed for last time met have parted on anything cordial term however that have nothing to do with duty now good morning said in reply to bloomfield nod do mind taking turn want to tell something bloomfield obeyed that morning one who looked out might have witnessed unusual spectacle of willoughby captain walking together round quadrangle in eager conversation heard of fight said riddell yes what about inquired bloomfield have reported last night silk came to asked to get back name wo do will asked bloomfield reason why silk

schoolfellow who have sat shoulder to shoulder in same class room for week bloomfield confided trouble failure disappointment riddell confessed mistake discouragement anxiety parrett captain marvelled to think how must have gone on term without finding out what much finer fellow captain of school be than riddell reproached inwardly for never having made more serious effort to secure friendship of honest kind hearted athlete gradually secret thought oozed out in word bloomfield a be only natural only right took to most of blame although riddell chivalrously insisted on claiming a much a ever

view of young wyndham very steady now must see wyndham before can decide said doctor have acted rightly in matter quite rightly captain went to find wyndham hoping for best decidedly anxious that young gentleman be engaged in agony of euclid when school messenger entered announced that doctor wanted to see at once face fell heart beat fast a heard summons needed not much effort to guess what meant gilks silk have of course be up before doctor latter have carried out threat of riddell have told now be summoned to hear fate at schoolhouse door found riddell waiting for oh riddell say exclaimed in tone of misery have to go to doctor at once silk have told about say do come with silk have told about at said captain have reported cried wyndham in tone of mingled amazement reproach oh

dismally to doctor study be anxious morning for captain wyndham have not returned before first school be over riddell felt must not rest till knew fate told bloomfield of morning proceeding even new friend encouragement failed to shake off suspense weighed upon presently when must wait patiently no longer occurred to wyndham might possibly have gone back to study unobserved be waiting there for so went across to schoolhouse to find out nearly study in schoolhouse wyndham included be empty a almost always be at hour of day during summer captain be about to return more uncomfortable than ever to big when door at end of passage opened one called name be gilks who a be dressed have evidently recovered from indisposition earlier than be expected beckoned a captain looked round riddell inwardly wondering when work a police officer must cease must be able to retire again into private life turned entered study gilks shut door carefully behind have haggard look about may have be result of ailment may have be caused by mental trouble certainly be not expression to captain have be used be to go to doctor at four asked yes put off a be reported on sick list of course think be shamming know be be must make out what to do be so stayed in bed be silk there yes did say anything no doctor told to come again at four gilks took one two uncomfortable turn up down room then said may a well tell be use keeping back longer for be sure to come out be fellow who cut rudder line did know have heard who told silk yes thought so knew must will tell paddy afternoon care if doe scarcely believed when said so said riddell eh suppose thought be rather too low even for so must have be once said bitterly backed parrett boat all along said riddell oh that if be puzzled be easily explained perhaps if be doing thing like in dark expecting to be caught out moment might make mistake too then meant to cut line asked captain seeing whole mystery explained at last of course did so must have done if rudder have be shifted parrett put into schoolhouse boat took few more turn then continued may fancy what pleasant state of mind have be in since daresay will be glad to hear have be miserable day night be very sorry for said riddell so sympathetically that unhappy boy started must be if knew be to spite be a bad a silk in though be idea about cutting line accident turned out well for in one way nobody suspected of silk have led life of dog ever since have not known what minute might come out be always holding over head have to do anything told can tell have thought of bolting more than once telling paddy must have be dreadful time for said riddell so be be glad be over now will be glad to be expelled have be ashamed to look one in face for week used to be happy enough before knew silk expect ever to be happy again now there be tremble in voice a said went to captain heart hope be not so bad a said quietly everybody here hate will hate more now said gilks young wyndham be only fellow have be good to have done of nothing mischief think said riddell fellow will soon forgive must know if guessed how have suffered already be right have suffered said gilks long pause followed during mind of be full one sensation in captain heart be pity forgot about crime in commiseration of wretchedness of criminal yet knew be useless to hold out hope of reprieve even if have be to be desired must do be to let poor fellow know at least that be not friendless sign of sympathy gilks gratefully appreciated know why must trouble about said after further talk owe le than anybody have be nothing le than brute to oh said riddell do know think must be well to go to doctor at once mean to go at once do think will let go off afternoon say must dare to face fellow have got most of thing packed up expect must stay till morning can have study be quieter than perhaps more hospitable invitation have be issued in willoughby gilks knew be too welcome not to be accepted gratefully captain soon afterwards departed leaving penitent behind subdued softened not by sermon moral lecture at time riddell felt must be only out of place by sheer force of kindness that virtue cost so little yet achieves so much in new excitement captain have for moment forgotten young wyndham be soon reminded of afflicted youth existence on reaching big be there waiting impatiently glance sufficed to show at rate worst have not happened wyndham face be such mixture of relief woe that captain felt misgiving a inquired eagerly what be news be frightfully kind said wyndham talked to like father never felt so ashamed of be certain be what said made let off so easy be so what mean for easy said nothing about expelling even when must tell name of two fellow be gated till end of term may only go out for half hour after first school hour after half past five know what mean added with groan what asked riddell too rejoiced that friend be safe to be over curious a to exact consequence of sentence why exclaimed wyndham be up with second eleven be blow undoubtedly perhaps next hardest blow to expulsion so much le hard that not even boy must for long regard a crushing infliction have have lesson after suspense of last few week be ready to expiate transgression manfully if sorrowfully anyhow said after pouring out disappointment into captain sympathetic ear be not a bad a being sent off home if have be for be what might have happened say think of brother coming down to umpire too what fool will look never mind ca be helped be sure to get into eleven next season say by way have right to be standing out here will have to go in so ended story of young wyndham transgression riddell have to officiate at yet one more investigation that eventful day scarcely have wyndham disappeared when message reached that doctor wished to see again with doubt time a to purport of summons obeyed found gilks standing in doctor presence where silk have stood hour so earlier riddell said doctor whose face be grave whose voice be more than unusually solemn gilks here have just be making very serious statement about accident happened early in term breaking of line at boat race confesses be doing wish to hear gilks told of just before came to sir said captain never expected to hear such confession from willoughby boy said doctor honour of whole school have suffered by disgraceful action if be to allow to pas without severest possible punishment must not be doing duty gilks have done one thing possible to to show remorse for what have occurred have confessed voluntarily have told must leave school to morrow morning gilks remained where be with eye on ground while doctor be speaking attempted plea to mitigate sentence against find continued doctor that if tell truth have not be only perhaps not principal culprit say did what did at suggestion of silk perhaps will send for silk now riddell riddell went off to discharge errand when returned gilks looked up said nervously need stay sir want to see doctor looked at doubtfully replied yes must stay long uncomfortable pause followed during one spoke stirred at length silence be broken by knock on door silk entered glanced hurriedly round seemed to take in position of affair with moderate readiness though be evidently not quite sure whether gilks captain be accuser doctor however soon made that clear silk said gilks accuses of being party to cutting of rudder link of one of boat in race last may repeat story gilks need do said silk have heard already say suggested said doctor be lie said silk sullenly never heard of till afterwards know did said gilks when be turned out of boat must baulk race way be suggested cutting line be glad enough to do so be snarled silk incautiously precious glad then did suggest said doctor sharply silk saw mistake tried to cover confusion only made case against worse did told about afterwards be heard about never suggested said knew how to get at boat said then did speak about beforehand said doctor be only said silk said doctor sternly be not speaking truth let implore not to make fault greater by denial silk gave in knew that case be hopeless that when gilks have said riddell must corroborate with what have be said last night well yes did know of said doggedly yes said doctor be glad at least persist in denying must quit willoughby silk will telegraph to father afternoon must be ready to leave by time to morrow silk hesitated for moment then with look round at riddell said before go sir think ought to know wyndham junior what about asked doctor coldly be in habit a riddell here know of frequenting low place of amusement in shellport have not mentioned before now be leaving riddell be not likely to tell of think ought to know of sir matter have already be

of young wyndham having be gated for breaking bound beyond that knew nothing nothing of treaty of peace between two captain of discovery of boat race mystery of double expulsion be impending still le did dream of unwonted scene be taking place that evening in captain study riddell gilks sat talked far into night be not going to describe talk let reader imagine let imagine that sympathetic honest

last night at old school be relief to to unburden mind riddell encouraged to do told sad history of failure folly sin have reached catastrophe that day captain on side in quiet manly way strove must to infuse hope for future courage to bear present punishment whether succeeded not must hardly tell when evening ended two finally betook to bed in anticipation of gilks early start in morning be with feeling of comfort relief on side if only have known before said gilks know why must be so kind to now be too late to be friend hope not said riddell cheerily need stop being friend because be going

fellow said fellow wo take trouble to abuse much now be gone at point two parrett junior came past be lawkins pringle two of noisiest most impudent of respectable fraternity among innocent amusement that of hooting captain have long be favourite at sight of now a concluded in altercation with own hero thought detected magnificent opening for little demonstration hullo booh fiddle de riddell cried pringle jocosely from safe distance who cut rudder line cheat kick out echoed lawkins captain who be accustomed to elegant compliment of kind from infant lip of willoughby took about a much notice of now a usually did in other word took notice at bloomfield turned wrathfully shouted to two boy come here two oh yes will come to cried lawkins be captain will obey said pringle with withering look at riddell what be that said just now demanded bloomfield only said kick out ' said lawkins somewhat doubtfully a noticed black look on parrett captain face bloomfield made grab at two luckless youth
