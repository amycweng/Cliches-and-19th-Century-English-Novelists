like began there be room here harrison old man williams called up table whereupon harrison plate in hand went down to keep williams company leaving for first time in life top hammer somehow did not enjoy dignity quite a much a must have expected be sorry harrison have gone for wanted to speak to about potter must not help fancying from unusual manner that be put out about something thought might have told about instead of chumming up to williams however be hungry took slice of ham passed dish along to fellow next who sat below two empty chair up have risen be rather solitary meal be glad when be over bell rang for first school there at least must have society of sympathetic sadgrove who a knew felt a sore a did about potter behaviour to mortification a well a perplexity sadgrove found have

slice from uninviting joint then artlessly pushed dish along one place opposite first of empty chair proceeded to regale be interesting to see perplexity simple manoeuvre caused next fellow below out of reach three chair away have nothing for to speak to calculated vow must not allow to do else ignominiously to walk up to seat next mine posse of dish did latter scored one only one scored for time to come for draven seeing be defiant felt hurt in pride drew blockade closer around have expected at least must make effort to win way back into popularity did not at like when chose to boycott must

good care that who did must sleep be used to have to put up with must have be close upon stroke of christmas day before finally condescended to turn in leave in peace one by one candle went out talk laughter gradually subsided even grunt twitch of doughty hero a first gave over to slumber died away in darkness for first time since rose that morning dead silence reigned in jolliffe in fact a lay awake tried to get to sleep silence seemed unnaturally profound tick of big clock down in hall struck on ear with almost thud light breeze outside moaned among ventilator played chromatic scale through keyhole in fashion quite disturbing wished that wind must shut up that clock must run down how be fellow to get to sleep with such row going on yet next moment utter silence of place disturbed even more than wind clock why actually seemed to hear winking of own eye a lay there wished one must snore breathe hard roll over in bed in thirty bed there be sound motion nothing be so unpleasant a listening for sound in dead silence half wished hullo what be rain on window why ca rain drop straight instead of tapping at fellow window sounded like one wanting to come in knew be only rain supposing have be somebody thief for instance bubble come to look after leg know what evil genius put thought of bubble into head once in must not get out downstairs before big fire have laughed a loud a one be a sure a sure must be that fergus story be invention of fertile imagination somehow now that light be out fellow asleep wind be moaning outside lay sleepless on bed did not seem so utterly preposterous not that believed in ghost oh dear hoped be not such fool a supposing rain again at window why must stop startling fellow in way yes supposing fergus story have be founded on fact what dreadful end to boy bubble end must have be do say word seemed to echo in ear that christmas eve re visit ferriby try to get down chimney in search of lost leg ugh why did not of fellow wake up how unnaturally still be must have given pocket money to two of to start steeplechase moment over bed in fact have mind to a reached point sudden noise made blood run cold froze to bed did not seem to be in dormitory on stair outside in quadrangle below none of companion appeared to have heard for slept on quietly silence followed be doubly a intense a have gone before what must be fancy be particularly cowardly boy somehow that sound terrified must neither move call out must do be to lie listen there be again time not so sudden far more distinct there be mistaking now a sure a lay there be something on roof sounded like something crawling slowly by fit start along gutter just above dormitory sometimes seemed to spring upwards a though attempting to reach higher position then sullenly slip down proceed on crawling way yes without doubt fergus have told truth suddenly voice in loud whisper at other end of dormitory exclaimed listen say listen be be voice there be at least comfort in knowing be not only one awake with desperate effort sat up in bed replied oh lamb what be only reply be gasp a noise recommenced body whatever be seemed to have dragged forward so a to be now just over head ceiling above went right up into roof must distinctly hear rustling sound against tile followed by occasional upward leap sometimes almost wild in eagerness how must mistake sound chimney be immediately above be towards goal a well knew that hapless legless bubble be destined fruitlessly to aspire at last one bound more frantic than rest followed by sudden clatter of displaced tile unloosed tongue fairly cried out oh dozen fellow be on alert in instant who be called out cried one 'd like to scrag what be row whoever be demanded fergus hush listen be must reply there must have be something in voice bespoke horror for dead silence ensued not for long once more dull dragging sound interrupted by spasmodic fruitless leap shudder went round dormitory at sound knew a well a did what meant be ghost faltered sparrow trembling voice one contradicted fergus like one suddenly confronted with spirit of own raising seemed most terrified of lot must hear gasping a sat petrified in bed ca one strike light lamb said presently very well match be on table to secure one must have to get out of bed one seemed quite inclined for a lay endeavouring to screw up courage to necessary pitch sound once more recommenced with violent motion towards edge of roof moon at same moment broke out from behind cloud shot pale light in at big window there be momentary pause above then casting sudden shadow across dormitory floor dim white figure a of body without limb floated down outside window moon once more be obscured be left motionless horrified in utter silence darkness what must come next how long might have remained in suspense ca say have not lamb fellow by combined effort of heroism dashed arm in arm from bed secured match be in act of striking light one match have broken have have no head be in act of striking light when lamb who be close to window suddenly exclaimed look there be such terror in tone that knew only too well what have seen where where managed to gasp there down in quad replied pointing out of window looking way curiosity be sometimes greater than fear for terror must not resist impulse to steal up to window look out others did same be a lamb have said there in quadrangle below moving restlessly to fro swaying upward a if in supplication be white form erect helpless for long time gazed without word at last one more hardy than rest said what can be what question what must be bubble still when question be once asked did occur to one two of possibly might have jumped to conclusion too hastily be wonderful how hardy fellow will get when be got twenty fellow clustering round be alive anyhow said one call out to one suggested be nearest window fraser said fraser be vice captain of second fifteen always touchy whenever pluck be called in question be not afraid said in voice be hardly quite steady a spoke threw up window called out hurriedly in rather deferential tone who be down there suppose fraser ever did pluckier thing than ask question listened ear for reply none came only faint moan a apparition swayed uneasily towards even seemed to try to raise in direction never word heard closed window again a much in dark a to identity a ever what must do must go to bed with bubble anybody ghost wandering about in quadrangle below be evident how be to solve mystery unless indeed be terrible alternative only one thought of good bit before one proposed at last fraser said who be game to come down into quad fraser be on mettle must never have be so mad at first dead silence be only answer to challenge then lamb said mind if did mind why must nearly choke saying so however broke ice others followed considered a good man a lamb day be only own opinion be going to be outdone by now so volunteered one two others who considered a good a volunteered too until forlorn hope numbered dozen come along said fraser who have armed with lighted candle led way think who stayed behind felt little dismayed when last of glided from door left behind still a far a happiness of mind be concerned must not have gained much have be of party for descended staircase in rather depressed spirit starting at creak of wishing twenty time be safe back in dormitory there be drawing back now what noise bar of big door made a unfastened what ominous shriek lock gave a turned key one hope be that ghost must have taken fright vanished before reached quadrangle a stepped out into damp breezy night first thing met eye be distant restless figure of bubble by one consent halted a did so gust of wind extinguished leader candle what be to be done glanced up saw light twinkling at far distant dormitory window oh possessed to come on wild errand now then fellow be fraser voice more like too now then stick together better get light first suggested one will run back to dormitory get match asked leader nothing more be said about light advanced few yard then halted again better speak to think said lamb right said fraser now then who be what be name there voice sounded loud startling in night air be wasted breath never word spoke bubble moaned a struggled restlessly on ground where lay fraser spirit be rising moment oh hang exclaimed believe be ghost at so saying made further advance to within few yard of apparition if be ghost be most unearthly thing in dark ever saw a lay there be still too far off to see clearly looked like bloated creature without leg trying hardest to rise on foot be not there do hear shouted fraser once more why ca speak tell who be creature gave long sigh by way of answer more fraser advanced step be preparing to follow when ghost slowly rose on end made sudden bound towards in instant be back in house rushing pellmell up stair looking neither way that till be safe back in dormitory with companion passed remainder of night dressed with candle burning be not till morning broke that dared once more look out of window then discovered mystery of bubble ghost small half exhausted balloon about five foot high lay on grass below with enough gas in still to toss about restlessly in breeze now then even to rise on end drag little car few inch where came from who belonged to never discovered probably toy balloon let up by christmas eve reveller who little thought must alight on roof of jolliffe after flopping about there for minute must finally tumble into court below

called tower of north west wind before stretched sea thundered ceaselessly at base like wolf gnaws at root of noble oak on side of glittered blue fiord dotted with numberless islet throwing long arm far inland behind frowned dense forest of pine a far a eye must reach in wind roared day night mingled often with angry howl of wolf tower of north west wind stood there solitary work of man in wild landscape not sign of life be to be seen besides not even fisherman hut on shore of fiord woodman shed among tree stranger might easily have taken rugged pile for part of black cliff on stood road seemed to lead up to banner floated from wall trumpet startled sea bird lodged amongst turret yet old castle be not deserted place looked for here dwelt sigurd mightiest hero of land brother to ulf king men hated ulf a much a loved brother for sigurd with prowess be just generous lied to man if sigurd be king said one to other land must be happiest sun shine upon a be ulf make wretched have rather be enemy than friend though said one to sigurd listened to none of when urged to rebel sternly bade hold peace went forth fought battle of king brother followed wishing only battle cry be sigurd not ulf for loyalty king gave brother little thanks indeed a victory followed victory sigurd fame rose higher higher ulf heart swelled with jealousy jealousy presently grew to hate for be not in ulf nature to endure that must be held greater than so instead of rewarding brother for service accused degraded made general in place now said soldier chief will surely rebel will follow lead pluck down ulf from throne set up sigurd sigurd sternly silenced bade serve king a feared meanwhile departed sadly from brother court came dwelt alone in tower of north west wind for many week time passed slowly a sigurd brooded over wrong pined in idleness yet grieved le than secret visit of not few of old comrade who have deserted ulf now came begging to lead forth rid land of tyrant sent sternly away bidding on pain of anger return to duty serve king durst not disobey so passed many weary month in tower of north west wind when one bright summer day little fleet of english ship sailed gaily up fiord under castle wall sigurd joyfully bade voyager welcome to castle for chief of little band be raedwald english king whom sigurd only two year before have visited in own land there too have met not raedwald only raedwald beautiful daughter who now with gay train of attendant accompanied father on visit to friend comrade now day passed gaily only too swiftly for happy sigurd in company of raedwald amid smile of lady ulf be forgotten wrong of past vanished tower of north west wind be no longer gloomy fortress gay palace like summer day in northern heaven sun of sigurd content knew setting before day of raedwald departure arrived wedding have taken place in chapel of good old tower english king a hauled anchor set sail westward knew not whether to mourn over daughter have given up to rejoice over son have gained a for sigurd must hing rejoice who saw heard laugh said smiling queen wife be fairer sweetheart than be king brother ulf country of be forgotten in smile of little english maiden three day after raedwald have sailed storm broke over tower of north west wind summer sea lashed furiously against rock far up fiord angry breaker rushed in so that boat must live upon surface for hour night a sigurd sat heedless of hurricane without feasted with lord lady came told that raft have be driven ashore at foot of castle with man upon half dead sigurd bade instantly bring to castle give fire clothing food to revive in unhappy plight did presently came to hero with hews that man lived desired to speak with deliverer so sigurd ordered to be brought up a tempest raged without heart rejoiced to know one man at least have be saved from ravage man be of common order though clothed in rough woodman suit be plain to see be soldier fell at foot of prince poured forth thanks for shelter given that night who art thou asked sigurd to whom such thanks be never welcome be servant of king ulf thy brother at mention of king name face of present fell sigurd asked sternly what be thy errand here be sent said man with two others to spy into state here king have heard of merrymaking of alliance with english king bade see how be armed how prepared for sudden assault then return secretly report to be thus perform errand cried sigurd where be thy companion drowned liege in fiord a have be for gracious help when be king coming to assault tower demanded english noble who sat near never said man shortly why asked sigurd oh liege said man dropping once more on knee please heaven in week time there will be king in land sigurd hero started from seat seized man roughly what be say cried speak out that plainly will be worse for on day week said trembling serf ulf be to visit castle of niflheim go there alone a liege came hither to receive bride will never return way came for bur harald friend prince have vowed to slay there at one blow rid land of tyrant give just good king when sigurd heard turned white red with wrath fear fiercely summoned guard bade seize spy cast into dungeon then a soon a word came turned to company said hear what knave say yes hear cried rejoice sigurd day have come at last long live king sigurd then sigurd struck table with fist a started to foot glared at rash companion villain shouted with voice made room tremble yes sigurd day have come day for teaching coward like duty of knight brother ulf at bridal unarmed slain by traitor hand be that chivalry ye praise if so begone from sight reach of arm 't be time for talk without there arm saddle horse what mean cried where go sigurd go to brother said brother ulf be eight day sail from here 't be five day across forest said hero at lady shrieked looked on sigurd a man be mad forest said cried one swarm with wolf sigurd where wolf be not robber lurk sigurd smiled scornfully be wolf robber go to seek said if thou wilt go said then will go with thee cried sigurd go alone let who love remain here guard lady can trust to be true to lady ye have yet to learn to be loyal to prince at many hung head be silent sigurd meanwhile put on armour turned hurriedly to bid farewell to wife hero voice trembled a prayed heaven to guard over accompanied to courtyard where quickly mounting departed rode slowly forward into forest sigurd rode slowly forward into forest a entered turned for one last look at brave old castle held within wall joy of life soft voice at ear whispered return yet halted not did courage waver for voice louder than other cried onward seemed like brother voice a have known year ago before trouble came when a merry boy two lived with one heart between at sound put spur to horse plunged into wood gloomy indeed be forest of lonely pine rocked groaned in wind in dim twilight deepening often into black darkness reigned on hand gloomier still be distant cry rose ever again above tempest caused even brave horse to shiver a heard sigurd shivered not rode forward trusting in god listening only to old remembered voice ahead for league road be easy peril few for thus far woodman axe have often fallen amidst thick underwood clearing path among tree driving before sullen wolf into deeper recess of forest a sigurd rode on bough overhead closed in between light of day few trace of man hand vanished good horse stumbled painfully over tangled ground often hardly finding path among dense trunk around wild yell have mingled with tempest seemed to draw closer a though eagerly awaiting horse rider somewhere not far off sigurd heeded not cheered a rode on by calling to mind of beautiful story of old religion of land thought of elf fairy who be said to dwell in very forest at midnight to creep up from hiding place gambol play trick among flower dewdrop with wild bee summer insect dance in magic circle on greensward did heart good to feel be not alone that merry little companion be with lightening way guiding course night through thought too of luckless dwarf whom odin have condemned to dig delve day deep in ground throw fuel on great central fire of earth who at night like fairy might come above revisit then old haunt even mischievous little companion helped to cheer heart of wayfarer beguile journey so plodded on through night resolutely plunging deeper deeper into forest leaving tower of north waistcoat wind league after league farther behind day passed a night have passed save for occasional halt to rest horse refresh body with food nothing broke dullness of journey wolf alone be silent waiting for night a afternoon wore on sigurd must see gaunt form skulking among tree casting many hungry sidelong glance way licking cruel jaw a foretaste of wished for meal now sigurd needed to stop ear closer than ever against voice cried return set face still more steadfastly towards niflheim for though heart never faltered spirit drooped a night closed in weary oppressed pushed onward fairy no longer cheered must smile again at antic of dwarf soft voice of one behind be heard music of tone be sad voice before still cried onward mingled dismally with storm overhead wild ever increasing howling of wolf horse too seemed to share master trouble for stumbled forward spiritlessly hanging head trembling at approaching howl nearer nearer cruel voice closed in around not one score stealthily at first dogged prey then gaining boldness advanced pressed more closely on heel of horse sigurd a glanced quickly round saw score of cruel eye flash out in darkness almost felt hot breath in face one bolder than rest made angry snap at horse heel unhappy animal who long ere have lost wonted nerve made sudden bound forward almost unhorsed rider sudden movement be signal for pack to leap forward with wild yell next moment sigurd gallant horse be fighting for dear life desperately fought sigurd swinging trusty axe right left carrying at stroke death among savage assailant at length horse beset on side exhausted wounded dropped to ground unable longer to hold out with cry of savage triumph wolf leapt upon in hideous howling struggling mass sigurd scarcely gaining foot after fall started forward alone for horse be dead be more to wolf than hero who yet lived over carcass jostled fought screamed ravenously till nought remained to fight for sigurd knew well a hastened forward axe in hand sword in belt spear have broken off short that respite be short few minute pack must be once more on trail then must be turn yet prayed god to send help bring through peril hurried on yet slowly by reason of tangled path dense underwood of forest listening to angry tumult behind wondering how long before hue cry began once more be not long scarcely have forced way half mile when must hear pack following onward came at rush with hideous tumult sigurd knew that foremost must be upon in moment strode on casting glance back at step gripping fast trusty axe presently just a reached small clearing among tree brushwood behind crackled pair of eye gleamed close at hand then sigurd turned putting back against broad tree waited on came half sated doubly savage with taste of blood on jaw desperately once more fought sigurd swinging axe right left dealing death at blow till stood surrounded by half circle of dead dying wolf sigurd fought till must scarce stand wield axe many cruel wound weakened eye grew dim hand unsteady blow uncertain must do more axe fell from grasp reeled back a did so there rose loud above wind above howling of wolf cry caused sigurd to start once more to foot wild beast to pause midway in mortal onslaught be deep mouthed voice of dog next moment huge mastiff dashed from out of thicket fastened on throat of foremost wolf be own watch dog thor whom dear hand have loosed from chain sent forth into forest to guard maybe save master at sight of great champion at sound of bark cowardly wolf one by one slunk sullenly back into wood sigurd felt that be saved joyous meeting be that between gallant master gallant hound thor brave dog cried sigurd be to thee then owe life brother life yet not to thee so much a to fair lady who sent thee messenger of love life to thanks thor thanks lady thank most to god now will reach niflheim even yet thor wagged great tail barked joyfully in answer night sigurd lay secure watched over by sleepless thor whose honest bark be sweetest music that ever lulled hero to repose for two day sigurd trudged safely onward through dense forest with thor dog beside way be hard painful hero limb now only support crashed wearily through thicket faint weary though be bold heart thought of brother carried through four day have come gone

deserted king now live robber life in wood stay here lord till band of will be going to jockjen together sigurd smiled scornfully thanking man started forward fearing nothing save arriving too late at niflheim yet woodman warning be not lost upon for walked with drawn sword in hand keeping eye ear open a went day pressed onward towards evening came to lonely part of wood where tree for short space round closed thickly overhead shut out light have passed through spot be once more emerging into open when three men suddenly sprang out of thicket faced two of be in garb of common peasant carried one club other knife sigurd guessed at once to be two of robber of whom woodman have warned companion be powerful man in dress of soldier carried sword in though knew not man sigurd recognised soldier of army of king who a might guess have deserted lawful calling for life of bandit party be plainly unprepared to meet knight fully armed have expected rather to find defenceless merchant even woodman whom might easily overcome a easily rob fell back instant before noble form of sigurd next true to calling rushed upon shouting to to surrender yield up whatever of value might posse on person sigurd wasted not word in replying to insolent challenge defended against sudden assault at first onslaught two bandit be foremost who thought to bear down by sheer weight sigurd stepping back pace caught knife of one on shield while with own sword ran comrade through body so quickly be done that soldier advancing wildly to attack stumbled fell over body of prostrate man before must rise again to foot second thrust from sigurd sword have laid low other bandit beside comrade soldier therefore be only adversary remained of sigurd thought to make short work in judged wrongly for robber proved to be man of extraordinary strength agility while sigurd be faint jaded with long painful march for hour afternoon wood resounded with clash of sword two men spoke not word fought with teeth set lip closed once again by common consent halted leaning on sword for breath a often closed again more furiously than ever surprised sigurd to find adversary so resolute dextrous at time might have pleased for loved courage even in adversary now when hour lost meant peril to ulf bosom swelled with wrath disappointment by force of superior weight drove adversary back inch by inch till at end of hour two stood yard distant from spot where fight began yet though falling back soldier kept bold guard while not inflicting wound on enemy be able to ward off blow aimed at at length when for moment sigurd seemed to flag in combat man gathered together for one mighty stroke at hero head fell like thunderbolt sigurd saw in time caught on uplifted sword with such force that soldier weapon broke in two overbalanced by shock fell backwards to ground then sigurd with glance of triumph planted foot on body of prostrate foe prepared to avenge delay of hour combat man struggled called for mercy looked boldly up in victor face awaited death with smile sword of sigurd did not descend passing memory perchance soft voice breathing mercy held back drew back foot sheathing weapon said keep thy life return serve king thy master man lay for moment a one bewildered then springing to foot casting from broken sword knelt cried oh merciful knight to thee owe life be thee will serve to world end peace said sigurd sternly be time for parley must be in jockjen night follow if thou wilt thus far with began to stride once more forward with rapid step followed closely by late adversary sigurd uttered not word walked with sword drawn a before fearing nothing save to arrive too late at niflheim once a neared jockjen two other robber rushed out from wood a if to attack when perceived stalwart champion who followed hasten forward place beside traveller refrained departed suddenly way came now be come at last to jockjen when sigurd made a though must enter town follower hastened to overtake said knight avoid town for ulf king be here have commanded that stranger enter be ulf here inquired sigurd told be at niflheim man looked strangely at lord said know what only few know ulf be to be at niflheim when demanded sigurd night said man sigurd answered nothing walked on quickly man seeing that be determined to enter town followed cautiously at distance waiting to see what might happen be evening a sigurd entered little town overshadowed by grim fortress be astir with unwonted bustle for king marriage on morrow have brought together many of country people who though loved not ulf loved pageant holiday to see in besides many soldier be there who talked mysteriously at street corner seemed to have other business than merry making on hand sigurd passed unheeded through street keeping face hid in cloak avoiding point where crowd seemed large curious be hastening thus stealthily down by street led towards niflheim when suddenly became aware of small group of men before under shadow of high wall in eager talk halted for by eager gesture cautious look judged to be desperate men whom must be well for to avoid rather then meet withdrawing quickly into deeper shade waited with impatience till conference must be over a waited heard speak by time said one must have learned what be in store doubtless said yet be glad be earlier for will all be over before can prevent ulf once dead said first sigurd can not help being king however much may dislike nay dislike not being king be so foolishly tender about brother other laughed there be others trust will not be foolishly tender with brother night at what hour be deed to be done by midnight at sigurd who have heard must not refrain from starting where stood men heard in instant finding thus discovered rushed with one accord on hero before sigurd must draw sword offer resistance be overpowered held fast by assailant who for fear must cry aloud alarm town threw cloak over head led off quickly to castle here when guard came out inquired what meant man said know to be enemy of king who have come disguised to town to do harm keep fast till morning guard without so much a uncovering sigurd face hurried through gate brought to dark dungeon into thrust turning key twice upon then sigurd cast on floor in despair to find thus confined after fatigue have suffered peril have escaped be fearful indeed more so because knew brother be close at hand yet must die with brotherly hand to help for cared nought men who have cast there called friend a knew desired only to keep fast believing to be stranger who might disclose plot when be over ulf dead must release perchance discover who be sigurd wished might die before morning presently a lay heard sound of foot on pavement without approaching dungeon door slowly opened monk stood before hope dawned in sigurd breast a door opened faded again a gruff voice without said do thy work quickly father short shrift be villain deserves with door closed again sigurd monk be left in darkness be to die then asked hero of holy man 't be reported said monk seek king life therefore in morning be to die added speaking lower will not die lord sigurd started not at word at voice uttered who art thou whispered one who owes thee life must repay thee lord be whom thou sparedst lately in wood in dark sigurd must not see face knew spoke truth quick said man throwing off gown hood off with thy armour lord don there be time to spare for moment sigurd paused amazed at man offer then thought of ulf decided brave friend said heaven bless for aid for four hour accept thy deliverance borrow freedom if before then have not returned call coward knave speak not of borrowing lord said man heaven forbid must require again poor life thou didst give peace said sigurd quickly casting off armour covering in monk garb in few moment exchange be made then sigurd grasping hand of brave deliverer pulled hood low over face stepped to door knocked guard without unlocked door a did so robber crouching in distant corner of dungeon clanked arm sighed have have brave monk said guard to sigurd laughingly villain like not news 't be clear have done task headsman will soon do sigurd said nothing with head bent hand clasped walked slowly from cell on towards gate here man stopped more devout than rest rendered obeisance crossed a passed once out of castle sigurd breathed freely with thankful heart quickened pace through fast emptying street in direction of niflheim double care now pressed on first on account of brother danger other lest in effort to save king must be detained so unable to keep faith with brave man have left in place in dungeon therefore pressed on with speed unheeded by passer by to whom sight of monk hurrying on mission of mercy be strange thing in due time in dim twilight castle of niflheim rose before felt that journey be nearly done late a be there be revelling going on in palace knight lady crowded hall whilst without in outer room person of degree congregated to witness festivity share in hospitality of royal bridegroom for though ulf be hated by through fear greediness failed not to keep up show of loyalty even mirth in royal presence sigurd entered palace unchallenged mingled with outer throng of onlooker one noticed looking round from under hood must see many face that knew amongst conspirator whom have that evening overheard plotting in street of jockjen sight of men doubled uneasiness for appointed hour be nearly come unless fulfilled errand forthwith might yet be too late therefore approached knight whom knew to be still faithful to king drawing aside said sir must speak with king have great news for can not speak to night holy friar said knight for king be banqueting come in morning may be too late in morning said sigurd why what news have be so urgent demanded soldier bear news of sigurd king brother who be approaching may be here to night have exclaimed knight eagerly sigurd advancing how many have with doe come in peace war know said sigurd there be peace between ulf sigurd pray take to king for have more news will not bear delay at soldier went sigurd waited anxiously knight soon returned king said will see anon after will have spoken to four worthy citizen of jockjen who have craved secret audience so saying left advanced to where conspirator stood expecting to be summoned then sigurd must contain no longer with hurried stride pushing way among crowd followed overtook knight before must deliver summons seizing fiercely by arm in way made man of war start in amazement led aside said eagerly sir must see king before men knight in anger at being thus handled cast off roughly sigurd must not be daunted bring to king said will go to without thy leave knight amazed at being thus spoken to looked round made a though must summon guard sigurd seeing now grown desperate caught by neck putting mouth to ear whispered something done drew back for moment lifted hood from face knight started in amazement quickly recovering presence of mind stepped aside with sigurd then sigurd knowing man to be loyal trustworthy hurriedly told charged to be secret see to brother safety knight begged to remain see king sigurd fearing delay feeling that task at castle be done must not stay departed forthwith before have well left place four conspirator be arrested lodged in deepest dungeon of fortress guard especially such a stood near person of king be enlarged guest be quietly dispersed that night ulf slept secure at niflheim little dreaming of peril have escaped of brother who have

great be amazement of soldier a assembled to see monk bareheaded stand with hand on throat of comrade greater still did become when recognised in stern noble feature own prince sigurd before must recover presence of mind sigurd held up hand to enjoin silence said let two men go at once to dungeon bring prisoner out while be gone group stood silent a men dazed wondered what must happen next in few moment two guard returned bringing with prisoner whom sigurd greeted with token of gratitude joy brave friend exclaimed for thy generous devotion night might have ended in murder ruin knave friend might have done king grievous wrong accept sigurd thanks what exclaimed prisoner falling on knee art thou sigurd do owe poor life to bravest of hero owe life to thee rather said sigurd not mine only brother then turning to bewildered shame struck soldier said men for scorn to call friend remains for to choose between duty punishment reserved for traitor may thank heaven wicked plan for night have be foiled that traitor though be stand here a murderer also let who refuse to return to allegiance stand forward not man moved then said sigurd demand pledge of loyalty will prove with life cried men conscience struck meaning what said ask said sigurd be that not man here breathes word of night doing besides yourselves one man only know of being at niflheim have vowed secrecy do do same soldier eagerly gave required pledge leave now said sigurd at post of duty let who must serve serve king will will cried men sigurd held up hand be enough said be content friend said to late prisoner will

therefore with astonishment dismay that heard reply to auld geordie proposal did not know singleton be highwayman if roof have fallen in must not have caused greater consternation singleton looked aghast to hear such speech from chief be boy mad said one in whisper coward said fool said laird joking said auld geordie in coaxing voice be glad to see ye so merry ye will be in earnest to morrow

something about old castle of mine for know be scarcely in since be boy be easier to turn talk than to turn thought of clansman experienced of distinct disappointment at first exercise of authority on part of young laird cheek of of younger among actually coloured with shame at thought that singleton singleton must be lacking a must not help thinking be in bravery however said nothing seemed to listen to auld geordie a launched out into account of old castle of singleton tower be brave old place said sir david singleton be who built here on arm of sea in time of king wallace story go that wallace set top stone of great tower with own hand sir david did not live long to enjoy stronghold a have heard how did die never heard that asked young laird ala be sad story though short one sir david have son that son be coward first hope last coward who ever bore name here looked hard at youth who not noticing meaning glance said amen with heart go on well son grew up like in england be not

of english be advancing on singleton tower old laird nothing doubting ordered son to take fifty men meet enemy while stayed behind to guard place lad obeyed marched forth met english under brantor hill yonder then appeared real character of boy at first onset before ever blow be struck turned fled one know whither old laird for long must not believe when on hand story be confirmed news came of lad sickened drooped shut up in turret room out there never left except at night when one walk be on east terrace over very room one night missed sound of footstep next morning be found dead in little chamber dead of broken heart say that if ever again coward must be laird of singleton that old man will walk out there where walked four century ago dead silence followed close of story eye by sort of common instinct be turned towards head of table at moment apparently from terrace outside came sound of footstep a listened cheek grew suddenly pale shudder crept round assembly silence however be broken by laugh from young laird who have be only unmoved hearer of last mysterious sound why there be poor dog jupiter out there have quite forgotten let in one one stirred young chief looked round perplexed then rose went to window opened a did so huge shaggy mastiff bounded into apartment barking capering for glee at seeing once again master hearing voice lie down sir quiet now men what think of for ghost thanks geordie for story remember now heard when child well let hope will be long while yet before sir david ghost be put to trouble of midnight walk hist young master said tam be ill jesting with spirit what tam one must think now by way speak must not dare to keep solitary watch on east terrace 'd dare anything replied tam must rather not replied singleton laughing that laugh roused spirit of tam who though superstitious be hardly coward never said that cried if need be must do even to night even to night repeated singleton what doe man mean even to night have good mind to order to watch to night for talking in riddle sirrah watch here have always be double one since can remember put in auld geordie to mind one man ought to be able to watch a well a two for matter of so tam mean must be more comfortable with comrade on east terrace to night perhaps sir david must oblige added with laugh soldier flushed angrily ay may say that muttered in undertone be more than likely sir david will be walking to night boy caught last word glanced quickly at speaker meaning of mysterious utterance suddenly flashed upon men then mistook chief captain for coward crimson flush suffused face flush of shame anger a sprang to foot at instant before must utter word bugle sounded at gate there entered hall soldier whose appearance bore mark of desperate haste singleton cried a entered king friend be up glencairn muster men at daybreak at scotsboro expects thirty men of singleton promised there then here be piece of news long wished for summons have come at last heart of singleton present beat high at prospect of battle yet in midst of elation serious difficulty presented thirty men said geordie looking round why there be thirty one men here counting laird must stay young laird who have noticed same thing cried out promptly to messenger tell general will have thirty men before dawn with soldier withdrew joy of singleton now gave place to something like panic a comprehended what rash pledge of young chief really meant meant that thirty of must go one must stay what must one man do to defend castle like singleton tower elder soldier be specially concerned call back singleton said geordie can not leave place defenceless think of peril ten men must stay at least who say must ' to cried young chief impatiently be singleton to be word breaker a well a highwayman thirty men will go have not promised who will stay asked one ah be cried who be to stay silence ensued on question then will stay quietly replied singleton laird shouted one in amazement can never be why not inquired youth who be chief here who be to lead in battle ah said singleton be duty know be equally duty to stay here be certain peril must do good let one of stay let stay with

there will be to morrow to night watch here ay on east terrace with sir david tam added with smile come to horse there lose time bring out gun on with belt men be brisk now take man bread meat from table with word martial fire of father blazed out in son so that men wondered more than ever how must have suspected of faint heartedness be equipped mounted lower drawbridge there open gate forward men singleton for king waving hand bade march forth watched slowly defile across drawbridge turn horse head eastward last man to cross be tam heaven protect said humbly forgive for insult put upon then reining in horse added almost beseechingly once again let stay with not replied young singleton gaily forward tam to morrow if return will hear how fared tam said nothing setting spur to horse bounded across drawbridge rejoined comrade singleton having watched troop a slowly wended way among tree of wood till be lost to sight drew up bridge closed barred great gate then with stout though anxious heart turned addressed to solitary hazardous undertaking sub chapter ii night watch young laird of singleton turned slowly from courtyard out of men have just ridden back into castle young a be inexperienced knew enough of state of country to feel that task have imposed upon be one of greatest peril not only to own life to ancestral castle of clan for country swarmed with freebooter hostile clan on look out for chance of plunder if only got wind of unprotected state of singleton tower must lose time knew in striking blow during absence of clan might end in loss of old fortress for ever still what else must have done be bound in honour to fulfil pledge to royal cause by sending thirty men a for have hesitation in deciding for night at least post of duty if not of honour be on rampart of own castle even though on account singleton must ride leaderless to king standard besides must be confessed there be spice of adventure about undertaking well accorded with bold spirit a thought went back to scene of banquet suspicion entertained there a to own courage pleased to reflect happened singleton must never again be able to charge chief with cowardice be nine o'clock quite dark when turned from gateway out of men have just sallied retraced step slowly into deserted castle solitary footstep sounded weird lonely across paved yard few minute before have rung with clatter of horse bustle of preparation still more solitary did sound a passed on way through deserted passage found once more in old banqueting hall where feast remained still on board empty chair round just a clansman have left to obey sudden urgent order to march forth dreariest of did sound a forcing open small long disused door grated back on hinge groaned a did so stepped out on to east terrace before did however took wise precaution necessary to insure a far a possible safety of old castle in respect be not difficult task for singleton tower stood at head of narrow arm of sea on three side completely surrounded leaving only east side assailable by land on side of sea castle rose perpendicularly from water only entrance being by way of creek half cave half boathouse entrance to must at pleasure be barred by portcullis precaution singleton took have satisfaction of feeling on seaboard at least castle be a secure a if garrison of hundred men watched on land side however security be not so possible water be continued in form of ditch twelve yard wide round side also be narrow protection at best drawbridge spanned be a have already seen drawn up great iron gate connecting with outside world carefully barred bolted still a singleton looked down felt concerned to think how easily few bold men must swim moat assault place be in for now a auld geordie have said gun of castle be loaded ready for action singleton be relieved to see that one of be mounted on turret over great gate further discovery relieved still more be that wood on side be so dense that except along narrow clearing through tree must hardly be possible for number of troop especially if brought artillery to approach therefore took advantage of moonlight to point gun carefully so a exactly to cover entrance to narrow path precaution a will be seen stood in good stead before night be out a to other gun there be one on east terrace rusty old fashioned happily loaded there be others at various corner buttress of young laird inspected ascertained to be ready for emergency also placed musket in readiness at various point in case of need preparation occupied long time in effecting be not till hour have passed since departure of men that singleton felt able to take place on watch quietly await result of venture have scarcely done so however when occurred to that though garrison have left place there be still plenty of armour in castle might be used to good purpose why not set out helmet on rampart pike a well a gun be good idea hurried to armoury quickly took from place steel helmet pike plume on must lay hand artfully disposed on various part of battlement so that to one below must appear that instead of one man twenty armed warrior guarded place who know numskull may serve in good stead said youth to laughing to think what excellent substitute for living man empty helmet with spear head beside may be made to appear little artifice being satisfactorily accomplished light set burning in various room of castle still further to aid delusion returned once more to east terrace began solitary vigil moon be up peeped occasionally from behind drifting cloud to light up dark scene below a singleton peered down from lofty post must see water sparkling below catch distant light here there on wood mountain not sound be to be heard moaning of wind among turret distant splash of water against south base of castle not moving creature be to be seen except uneasy bat flapped round now then over head everything below be motionless silent without one token of life except indeed distant light of beacon tinged sky with lurid glare added weird feature to dark solitary landscape singleton after turn two be conscious of half dismal sensation feeling of loneliness a long a have be busily occupied have not oppressed paced quickly to fro whistling to determined not to yield to effect of position wondered how far men be on way by time be old geordie riding at head suppose be attacked how must come out of wondered too if tam be what be that low groan from one corner of terrace clanking of chain singleton halted dead for moment heart be in mouth then broke into laugh jupiter again be second time have played ghost to night well old doggie have woke up have be going to keep company eh then a resumed march talked in low voice to dog who rose quietly from corner with soft stealthy tread proceeded to accompany master to fro along terrace singleton be ashamed of for being a startled a have be at incident pretty hero will make at rate said if be worst alarm be to have to night will get off easily eh jupiter solemnly wagged tail evidently considering have done enough in accompanying master twenty turn up down retired quietly to old corner once again composed to slumber singleton walked on halting now then to make careful scrutiny round continuing to whistle softly to time somehow mind continually found reverting to geordie story be old wife tale of course queer one too be very terrace on old warrior used to walk little turret chamber there be room ah strange how reflection of moon must make appear a if there be light in room if be not certain light be there must have vowed be one bah wished geordie have kept story to made feel quite dismal hark footstep be certain heard one close at side too stood still listened everything be silent moved on again there heard distinctly almost in step with own looked up down everywhere then geordie word rushed back on memory if ever again coward must be laird of singleton that old man here stepped forward again suddenly halted footstep that time be a distinct a own pooh what if be be not going to be afraid of ghost in scotland laughed out loud by way of assuring of nerve have hardly done so when just above sounded laugh mocking own a stepped suddenly forward footstep began again a clear a ever be more than singleton have bargained for sat down on end of gun in bewilderment alarm have one be there to see face must have appeared good deal paler than be wont be certainly something more than cold made shiver sat perfectly still listened there be not sound strained eye on hand nothing be visible through darkness silent terrace on watched what must be a sat wondered pike have be resting carelessly across knee slipped fell on to stone pavement with sudden clank be instantly repeated overhead just a laugh footstep have be of course flashed upon singleton then echo nothing simple echo among nook cranny of castle at simple echo cheek have turned pale heart have stood still hand have actually trembled scorned bitterly for cowardice once more relieved in mind humbled in spirit set out on night watch determined time that nothing not even score of ghost must terrify now night began to wear on by time men must be very near rendezvous for be hour past midnight moon be getting down towards west wondered what other clan must muster round royal standard how soon king force must be likely to meet enemy time to morrow must be with men be provided general permitted ten of to return relieve guard here supposing one came at moment jupiter gave very low growl made master stop short in march listen with ear for long time not sound be audible then fancied must just detect tramp of horse horse in far far distance seemed to die away again be utterly silent once more just a be starting again on walk jupiter growled time rose to foot came to master side yes be sound of horse somewhere more than one too with straining ear beating heart youth leant on pike listened sound grew more more distinct presently must tell whoever be be galloping ordered jupiter to lie down be silent be in wood somewhere be bound for singleton presently be able to distinguish voice minute afterwards seemed a if sound have ceased stepped quietly followed by jupiter from east terrace to rampart over great gate where be able to command a full view a uncertain light must allow of glade through free led to castle nothing must be seen a watched sound commenced again time fancied must detect rumbling noise a of cart accompanying horseman be now easy to tell meaning of sound troop of horseman must not yet guess how many be approaching singleton tower bringing with gun young laird heart beat now in right earnest not with fear have be left behind with ghost forgot everything defence of castle glory of clan waited eagerly for time of action cavalcade made halt about halfway through wood in still night air with light breeze carrying singleton must hear sound of voice a in hurried consultation then single horseman approached before many minute must just discern in dim moonlight form emerging from wood stealthily approaching castle let come spy said singleton to will see light perhaps few spear head on wall will report a much to chief ah at moment cloud cleared away from moon clearly revealed intruder be one of macfies singleton must see fully armed dismounted at border of wood advanced cautiously on foot to edge of moat made attempt to cross made observation from far side singleton taking care not to be seen crept back into armoury from took bugle bringing out into terrace sounded few shrill note then instantly seizing lantern ran hurriedly to fro with on various part of battlement then without waiting moment took up musket fired in direction of scout who however be by time out of reach there said singleton putting down weapon will satisfy be on alert of ready for perhaps will think better of turn tail in few minute sound of advancing troop again rose in night came on at trot dragging gun along with presently there be gleam among tree next moment fifty horseman appeared in view with cannon in midst equally to singleton satisfaction surprise proceeded to get into position at very entrance to wood be on spot will be remembered that young laird have carefully levelled gun surmounted great gate everything depended now on skill with have aimed gave foe minute two to fix point weapon once more carefully calculated poise of own then just a be proceeding to load horseman be preparing to follow up attack on gate applied match with mighty roar piece discharged be anxious moment while smoke slowly cleared away when did have joy of beholding enemy gun on end disabled not only at least three of enemy involved in same disaster must not resist triumphant cheer at success be promptly answered by defiant shout from enraged macfies a set spur to horse rushed towards moat now began hard work of night for foe thought nothing of such narrow obstacle a simple ditch swam on horseback left animal behind except two whom singleton trusty musket have found out crossed in safety raid made on great gate be something terrific singleton heart trembled within a heard creak before united weight worked away steadily at post always taking care not to expose yet never wasting shot with bad aim enemy very soon quitted gate took to more formidable work of attempting to scale wall here singleton power be tried to utmost for at one part ground sloped considerable distance up one of buttress made ascent from below comparatively easy if only macfies have be suitably equipped for assault must not have failed to carry place with ease happily for singleton have come very ill prepared evidently expecting to walk into defenceless stronghold without blow now be not only disappointed disconcerted yet there be keeping down eventually in vain singleton plied weapon with deadly effect in vain dislodged hurled down upon one of massive coping stone of east terrace a fast a foremost fell back dead wounded others swarmed up be well for singleton attempt be made on other part assailable buttress even be scaled at last young laird have stepped back hurriedly to load weapon when suddenly saw head appear above battlement next moment fierce lowlander sprang on to terrace with butt end of weapon singleton felled while at same moment jupiter flew at throat of man next to who be also springing on to wall be narrow escape indeed for dog castle might after have be lost once more youth cleared buttress time with such deadly effect that enemy halted moment before resuming attack short breathing space be unutterably valuable to singleton for gave time not only to load several musket to bring one of smaller cannon in position so a to almost cover weak point precaution however a turned out be not requisite for just a enemy be returning with redoubled fierceness determination to attack there be shout from wood cry of singleton to rescue well did young chief know that cry be saved in moment macfies have too much to do to defend from sudden attack in rear to think of renewing assault youth knew well enough how to make good use of interval with loud cheer to gallant clansman kept up dropping fire on enemy with musket gun until galled on side fairly took to heel plunged once more into moat how many came out of escaped history doe not record left of number under wall of singleton tower twenty men dead wounded be proud moment when young laird flung open great gate let comrade in leader of party be tam who have implored general of king force whom fortunately have met on way to rendezvous to be allowed to return if only for few hour to share young laird peril request have be granted with fifteen men delighted tam have spurred back to

calm motionless at others dashing furiously at foot of cliff be enough to attract lover of nature dull little place a be with one tiny inn handful of native time spent there with easel paint brush be one of most enjoyable of life beautiful a view be from land found view from sea still more attractive in order to gratify taste in respect took pain to get into good grace of one two of fisherman few of whom must speak english many time accompanied on fishing cruise in bay where while toiled at net sat drank in thousand beauty of coast worked eagerly with brush to commit to canvas expedition liked best be towards southern headland of bay where cliff be tallest steepest where to add to other attraction of view stood perched like eagle nest on edge of crag ruin of old castle by old mean roman even norman indeed in sense be comparatively modern for building what be left of looked more like one of tudor manor house dot country still than fortress yet that have be fortified be plain enough even still on side towards sea needed protection indeed looking up at from below seemed almost to overhang precipitous foundation on land side there remained trace of moat loop hole in wall massive gate be scarcely to be called picturesque ruin except inasmuch a ruin be picturesque bare wall rose gaunt black out of ground not out of heap of tumbled moss grown masonry covered over with ivy there be very few sign of decay about place ruinous a be very little examination be enough to show that have suffered not from old age from cannon of enemy from fire one about must tell story mystery of place only added to charm indeed be quite glad to discover that have not even name that country folk must a soon have thought of crossing old moat after a must have done of stepping over edge of cliff only thing must learn about in fact be that be haunted that one little turret still retained roof over only ivy visible tried to creep be railed lady tower be most haunted spot of must not believe that one corner of old ruin where there still remained sign of life verdure must be infested by very terrible ghost still be not quite sure whether must have enjoyed solitary night rest there to have

examination of picture naturally turned conversation on to ruin be delighted to find companion seemed almost a interested in subject a be be strange thing said that one thing wanting seems to be story ah be burnt out by fire sir be rude enough to laugh fancied be lamenting absence of top storey mean said what mean be one seems to know anything about place history not what must bother head about for must have history of sort said of course have do know of course do be quite shock to to find one knew anything about ruin be time before ventured to ask must tell to instead of saying yes coastguardsman laid down telescope pulled plug of tobacco out of pocket cutting off small quid put into mouth looked up at sail shifted once twice in seat then looking to see if be ready began be not such wonderful yarn after sir see something like two hundred fifty year ago when civil war be going on have heard of suppose yonder castle belonged to stout charles first man called fulke owned good bit about coast be told folk at new manor be sort of descendant direct descendant ca be for fulke only have one daughter sir never married if have be for cruel war must have be married though for be betrothed to neighbour young morgan who lived beyond hill there mightily loved one too fulke whose land joined on morgan be pleased enough to have two family united united must have be to day for civil war be great hand at date sir be somewhere about thing began to get unpleasant one day not long before wedding be to be fulke daughter went over to morgan hall while young folk spent day love making in garden two old folk sat discussed affair of nation in house be safe to say two out of door agreed far better than two indoors for morgan went with parliament told fulke king have right to try arrest five member that parliament have done fine thing in protecting that if 'd be there 'd have called out against king a loud a of at fulke who be hot headed man at best of time who went mad to hear one say word against king got up in rage taking hat stalked out into garden taking daughter by arm marched away from morgan hall with never word be sad business young folk begged old morgan sent letter fulke must listen to one of forbade daughter to leave castle whether lover saw one after know almost directly after war blazed out whole country went mad morgan son have to leave part took arm under parliament while fulke brought gun powder into castle hoisted flag of king charles young lady have busy time of sheltering entertaining royalist who came way have heart in not that did love king sir yet loved young morgan more so thing went on for four live year king a know sir got worst of be driven to wit end most of friend have fallen have deserted so far one have given fulke much trouble have never heard of saw there be not much to fear from so royal flag waved over castle day night young lady did what father bid never went abroad heard word of young morgan at last king not knowing what to do tried to bring over irish to help then be trouble in part began for one be suspected of aiding in venture be doomed by parliament fulke be suspected rightly wrongly ca say have notion there be something in anyway castle commanded bay parliament made up mind to have fulke have only time to get score so of men with arm provender inside gate when troop of roundhead came with gun over lull sat down before leader of troop be colonel frank cruel ruffianly fellow a will hear second in command be other than young captain morgan have have plenty of rough work during war have done well be pity sir parliament officer be of sort for be a unlike colonel frank a house dog be to wolf when first ordered on expedition did know where be going can fancy horror at finding out that be to lay siege to very castle that held lady love at first must have held back even refused be under iron rule besides thought might help lady more by going than staying away so came with troop to castle looked wistfully up at little turret yonder prayed that might never know that be where be colonel frank came expecting easy task with small out of way castle be not so easy a thought on two side a see sir mortal man must get at on other two fulke have guarded so well that by end of fortnight roundhead be not inch nearer getting place than have be when began rage of colonel knew bound vowed sort of vengeance may fancy one of men did not join in threat many time fortnight captain morgan wished shot from castle might find out end misery yet whenever be tempted to desert quarrel with colonel thought of lady left with protector at mercy of such man held to post must do be once twice to urge colonel to raise siege come to term with master frank be bent on vengeance at last poor morgan have to desist for fear of getting suspected about three week after siege have begun when roundhead be beginning to lose spirit morgan hope be beginning to rise once more trooper rushed into colonel tent to say have found small cave below top of cliff seemed to run up under castle colonel eye blazed at news ordered man to lead instantly to spot do see square grey patch on face of cliff up there sir nearly at top under south corner yes what be be mouth of cave at least be not cave now for be filled up be there trooper under cover of night led colonel captain did do more than mark place then for fear alarm might be given by sentinel within now say colonel frank castle ours not soul inside will be there by time to morrow ' what will do ' say captain morgan pale with shaky voice do art thou dunce morgan without doubt at end of cave be way up into castle though passage be too narrow for troop three men captain will suffice to lay faggot light at door what say comrade ' what ' cry morgan must burn place colonel will capture if can be soldier work to burn men in bed fool ' exclaims colonel in passion be captain work to read sermon to colonel sirrah rebel will be smoked out like other vermin ' say captain once more very pale hear there be lady in castle peace sir on peril ' exclaims colonel hold ready to obey order when will give ' be use saying more young morgan saw that a be knew colonel half suspected of treachery for rest of day put watch upon twenty time day be on point of risking consequence declaring to officer face must have hand in bad business thought of how much worse might be for folk in castle kept to post well sir day passed kept up show of besieging place on land side took care to keep fulke gun turned that way at nightfall colonel frank called morgan to ordered to take six men whom named try passage if find sentinel at end ' say colonel see be overpowered taken before alarm can be given over cliff will be shortest way with men take know business see perform yours say with scowl rest of troop will be ready to storm place a soon a see flame go now lose time hark there be quarter to night for traitor last remark may have be meant for captain who knew at heart be traitor to parliament night may have be meant for inmate of castle anyway sounded ugly enough be morgan must do to hold peace make reply found six men waiting for without in darkness crept stealthily round to edge of cliff where narrow ledge led down to end of cave be perilous step down especially to unaccustomed to way spot have be carefully marked in daytime presently little band stood there at entrance morgan in secret heart wished sentinel of besieged might have perceived so given alarm such be security fulke felt in secrecy of cave that never entered head to guard men entered one by one with man carrying light in front passage be too narrow to allow of two abreast too low for one to stand upright in so single file on hand knee crawled forward at last when have gone way sound of sea grew faint in distance morgan halted men give light say stay here while go forward see how passage end crawled forward to front of file took torch from hand of foremost man when began to move forward noticed that two of band followed at short distance did not order to remain with rest demand angrily pardon captain colonel bade keep close to ' say one of men sourly morgan blood ran cold in vein last hope of giving friendly warning to in castle vanished however be time to quarrel answered with forced laugh colonel flatters by attention a be anxious for welfare come on men keep eye on ' three went forward till cave became so narrow that must scarcely drag farther in one place little chink in roof let in faint ray of moonlight from above at length must get farther morgan turning head said be false scent after cave lead nowhere ' at moment over head heard sound of foot presently of voice at first must distinguish nothing after while morgan ear caught word pray master get to bed for one night scoundrel can hing till morning ' need rest tell ' said voice sternly how stand provender peter ' will last three day master shot will hold out for two water ala be already exhausted ah child how be ' in good heart master be sleeping like child a passed room just now ' morgan must forbear no longer turned quickly to men said in loud voice might be heard by unseen watcher

carried with fixing on to point of sword held up to board above at same time that other drew pistol pointed at morgan head not word be said not one of three stirred until sharp crackling of wood above told own tale soldier still held up brand till place be well alight then withdrawing beckoning to companion began to retreat towards mouth of cave saying a did so with mocking laugh farewell master
