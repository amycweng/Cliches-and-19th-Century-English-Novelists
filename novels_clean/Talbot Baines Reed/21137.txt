far a ever from coveted goal be half despairing of ever rising to win first fifteen cap latterly however have noticed wright few others of best player more than once lounging about in little close where junior used to play evidently taking observation with eye to business under awful gaze of hero need say exerted a have never done before what cared for hack bruise so only that must distinguish in eye never be music sweeter than occasional bravo young with of must applaud special feat of skill daring so knew time be coming at last only hoped must arrive before day of craven match great match of season always looked forward to a event of christmas term when victory be regarded by boy a summit of human glory defeat a overwhelming disgrace will therefore be understood why be almost beside with delight when very day before match wright made announcement have referred to scarcely slept wink night for dreaming of wonderful exploit be to signalise first appearance in great close how be to run ball from one end of field to other overturning dodging distancing one of enemy finishing up with brilliant mighty kick over goal after be to have broken limb set by doctor on spot to receive perfect ovation from friend foe to be chaired round field to be lion at supper afterwards finally to have whole column of time devoted to exploit what glorious creature be in dream well eventful day dawned at last be holiday at parkhurst a fine day a one must wish a made appearance wearing blue red jersey of first fifteen man under jacket found quite object of veneration among junior who have lately be compeer accepted homage with vast amount of condescension nothing be talked of during forenoon coming match must craven fellow turn up strong team must fellow slider who made tremendous run last year play for again must wright select chapel end other if won choice how be off behind scrimmage be adam to be trusted heard one voice ask two three small boy promptly replied yes senior said nothing except wright who took opportunity of giving little good advice in private look here adam be to play back know have got to take care of be to keep cool never let eye go off ball know rest lecture hour long must not have made more impression remembered two hint keep cool watch ball a long a played football must advise half back to take to heart in like manner at craven team came down in omnibus have lunch in hall with hour later found in straggling procession making for scene of conflict in great close there stood goal boundary post there be granger ground keeper with brand new lemon shaped ball under arm look sharp peel cried captain so hurried to tent promptly divested ourselves of outer garment turned up sleeve of jersey tied extra knot in bootlace a emerged craven men be making appearance on ground in battle array felt so nervous must not for life of imagine how of must look so unconcerned whistling actually playing leapfrog to keep warm officer in crimean war once described sensation in of battle there a precisely similar to have experienced when boy on football field at rugby can appreciate comparison for one certainly never soldier went into action with more solemn do die feeling than with took place on field afternoon have won choice of side said somebody be going to play with wind take place parkhurst shouted captain ball lie in centre of ground wright stand ten yard so behind ready for kick off of fifteen ten forward be extended in line with ball across field ready to charge after moment go flying two best runner of team be stationed quarter back where can skirmish on outskirt of scrimmage be posted little in rear of at half back unusual post for so young player one be accorded to by virtue of light weight not inconsiderable running power behind be two back on whom when else fails issue of conflict depends craven player be similarly disposed waiting impatiently for captain kick be ready shout silence give consent give quick glance round at then spring forward in instant ball be soaring high in direction of craven goal amid shout of onlooking friend foe forward be after like lightning not before craven back have got hold of run distance in direction of goal did not wait to be attacked by clever drop kick knack peculiar to good back sent spinning right over forward head into hand of one of quarter back tucking under arm crushing cap on to head started to run going slowly at first steered straight for forward of enemy till within pace two of when doubled suddenly amid shout of partisan slipped past be seen heading straight for craven goal although have escaped forward have rearguard to escape be far harder work for be not one of rearguard celebrated slider who by prowess have last year carried defeat to school other be not stalwart naylor who only month ago have played gloriously for county against gravelshire yet man be not to be daunted by prestige of distinguished adversary held on way pluckily without swerve be sight to see two cunningly lay wait for like two spider for fly there be nothing for to plunge headlong into web in desperate effort to break through ala brave man naylor have in clutch craven forward come like deluge on spot forward pour over craven in instant hero ball have vanished from sight under heap of writhing humanity down cry half choked voice from bottom of heap be rather unnecessary observation a happens served a signal to party to rise to foot prepare for scrimmage now if truth must be told school always have reputation of being second to none in going through scrimmage so while player be scrambling to foot waiting for ball to be grounded will explain what method of doing thing be be nothing more le than carrying out of principle of wedge ball formed apex fellow got up close to so a never to let out of reach of four foot behind two came three with locked arm behind three four men in middle pushed straight ahead at side inwards towards ball while two three remaining forward lent weight to one side other of base according a exigency of scrimmage demanded thus wedge embodying concentrated pressure in direction of ball farther advanced farther scattered asunder foe who fell off from gradually widening side without hope of getting again within reach of ball except by retreating to rear beginning struggle over afresh when manoeuvre be well executed be almost certain to carry ball through scrimmage when happened then be time for quarter back to look out for chance men went at with customary vigour address presently ball emerged on far side of scrimmage in instant be caught up by one of craven quarter back in instant men be upon again before must get start for run scrimmage after scrimmage ensued ball be constantly in chancery crush brought yard so nearer enemy goal than have be before time be little better than spectator for ball never once came within reach of finger be beginning to think that after big match be not so exciting thing a one be apt to imagine at last however after one scrimmage more desperate than have gone before ball flew out suddenly bounded off one of craven men into grasp now be chance if only must next thing be conscious of be that about twenty people have fallen to ground of heap ball be at bottom down cried pack up there parkhurst sang out wright extricated a quickly a must got back to place in rear thinking to myself after there be little excitement in football at last ball got well away from scrimmage who must secure redoubtable slider felt passing tremor of deep despair a saw that hero spring like wind towards goal look out adam shouted wright sure enough be coming in direction with desperation of doomed man strode out to meet rushed furiously on swerving slightly to avoid reach stretching out arm to ward off grasp flung wildly in path there be heavy thud earth seemed to jump up strike next moment be sprawling on back on grass pretend to know how happened somehow other have succeeded in checking onward career of victorious slider for though have fallen half stunned before force of charge have recoiled for instant from same shock that instant gave time for wright to get hold of so put end for time to progress well played said one a picked up so be comforted began to think that after football be rather fine game time must fail to tell of event of afternoon how wright carried ball within dozen yard of opponent goal how forward passed ball one to got touch down behind line missed kick how naylor ran twenty yard with one of men hanging on back how quarter back sent ball nearly over goal with a neat drop kick a ever have be lot to witness afternoon be wearing time keeper call out five minute more partisan of side be getting frantic with excitement unless must secure advantage now must be a good a defeated for craven have scored touch down to nothing be desperate fight to end so be victory after to escape have time for reflection then now parkhurst sang out wright pull yourselves together for once craven man be standing to throw ball out of touch side stand in confronting row impatient for fray wright be at end of line face to face with naylor be little behind wright keep close exclaims latter to a ball fly towards have in instant naylor long arm be round bearing down adam ejaculate out captain in trice pass ball into hand be off like wind so suddenly have be done have already yard two start before flight be discovered there be yelling rush behind there be roar from crowd on side there be clear follow up parkhurst from wright in rear there be loud collar from craven captain ahead be steering straight for goal three men only be between one captain right back slider man in front of see at glance that only hope be to keep a be going waste time in dodging assuredly pursuing host will be upon slider companion be closing in right across path almost close together with bound dash between have got have escaped shout louder than ever bravo from wright tell be clear of danger have now last defence to pas be tall broad fellow formidable foe to encounter wait for close under goal pace feel be telling on shouting behind sound nearer only few yard divide now will double will venture kick will charge straight at charge at sound wright voice a if in answer to thought gather up remaining force charge there be flash across eye dull shock against chest reel stagger forget where be be being swept along in torrent water with roar rush past over moment get nearer nearer fatal edge be at hang moment on brink then down shout voice close at ear there be such noise of cheering rejoicing that sit up rub eye like one waking bewildered from strange dream then find out what have happened when charged at craven captain shock sent back staggering into very arm of wright forward who be close at heel who then in splendid irresistible rush carried ball half of other side along with right behind enemy goal line where fall en masse to earth with ball under being at bottom even if have be hurt be not there be time to be wasted on condolence congratulation time keeper held watch in hand goal must be kicked at once if be to be kicked at so fifteen pace out be measured nick for ball be carefully made enemy stood along goal line ready to spring moment ball must touch earth wright cool self possessed placed in readiness yard two behind ball one of side held inch off ground anxious moment of expectation followed then came sharp now from captain ball be placed cunningly in nick craven forward rushed out on in body long before must reach be practised foot have sent flying straight a arrow over bar first football match have ended in glorious victory for old school term used here describe rugby game a used to be played prior to chapter two parkhurst paper chase meet be to be at one o'clock sharp in dean warren forget so said forwood whipper in of parkhurst hare hound club to one march morning in year have need to be reminded of appointment for be day of great hunt of year always held by running set at parkhurst school to yield in interest to other fixture of athletic calendar in fine weather over good country paper chase be one of grandest sport ever indulged in at least so thought when be boy great hunt be of course grandest run of year looked forward to consequently with utmost eagerness by lover of running in school year too have special interest in event for be turn to run hare in other word to be with fellow object of united pursuit of twenty thirty of schoolfellow who must glory in running down not whit le than must glory in escaping for week previously have be taking short trial run to test pace power of endurance birch fellow hare have more than once surveyed course proposed to take on occasion of great hunt making a far a possible acquainted with bearing of several stream ploughed field high wall to be avoided whereabouts of certain gap wood hollow to be desired be glad afterwards that have taken precaution a reader will see ca say if parkhurst method of conducting hunt be orthodox one know considered be a rule be own making rather legacy left to by former generation of runner at school be to take in twelve mile course of nearly oval shape six mile out six mile home amount of dodging doubling be to be allowed to hare except crossing own path be to get five minute clear start of course be expected to drop paper scent wherever went luckily for birch be old hand at running hare up to sort of dodge so knew be needful for to do be to husband wind run evenly with leaving to shape course regulate pace be lively scene at dean warren when reached few minute before appointed time afternoon pack be twenty thirty fellow who be to run a hound be fast assembling divesting of everything light flannel whipper in conspicuous by little bugle slung across shoulder light flag in hand be there in importance of office a usual doctor party of visitor lady gentleman have turned out to witness start five minute hare shout forwood a birch came on spot use interval in stripping off unnecessary apparel girding with bag of scent scrap of torn up paper be to drop a run then sit wait moment for starting turf be crisp under foot sun be just warm enough to keep from shivering a sit wind just strong enough to be fresh altogether be to be doubted if real meet of real hound to hunt real hare cruel not very manly sport after must be much more exciting than be minute sings out whipper in a spring to foot in thirty second be swinging along at good pace down slope of warren in direction of colven meadow hunt have begun a long a be in sight of pack kept up good hard pace on reaching cover settled down at once to somewhat more sober jog trot in anticipation of long chase before made good use of five minute start for by time distant bugle note announced that hound be let loose on track have covered good piece of ground put several wide field ditch ugly hedge between pursuer now be that birch experience served in good stead never knew fellow more thoroughly cunning might have be fox instead of hare sometimes made run behind drop scent on top of sometimes keep good distance off let wind scatter a much a must when came to gap instead of starting straight across next field must turn suddenly at right angle keep close up under hedge half way round before striking off into open among tree bush zigzagged doubled to alarming extent so that seemed a if be losing ground moment so must have be if chase have be by sight instead of by scent must have be against rule if hound be to see hare twenty yard in front of scent lay mile round must be bound according to rule to go half mile however tempting short cut might seem be after very wide circuit ending up on top of moderate rise that first caught sight of pursuer a be full six minute behind agreed to sit down under cover for minute watch at moment have evidently lost scent be ferreting about among low tree bush in search of saw flag of whipper in marking spot where be last visible round on side hound be exploring busily in search of new departure then presently came cry of forward off started in direction a scent after seemed to lie pretty clear considered high time for to resume flight so made off again being refreshed by brief halt made over couple of ploughed field birch suggested must make few of hound look foolish so on till reached first water have encountered since start be trout stream well known to of who be fond of fishing nowhere more than foot deep in place easily passable dry shod on stepping stone birch however avoided boldly splashing into stream over ankle bade follow will soon dry up said will gain minute two instead of going straight across wily hare began to paddle up middle of stream for twenty thirty yard of course in so doing scent be soon drifted away down current so flattered when at last did make opposite bank that pursuer must be puzzled for minute two to know what have become of after further quarter of mile thought might venture to take brief halt on strength of last manoeuvre be unable to do so where must command view of hound a reckoned have at least gained three minute felt must quite afford to take easy for length of time fancy then horror when after about couple of minute heard cry of forward close to evidently on side of stream off dashed like mad in regular panic never checked pace till have put three ploughed field couple of wide ditch to credit did not discover till be over how be cunning scheme to perplex hound have thus miscarried then be told that of scent instead of dropping into water a intended have lodged on top of stone in mid stream have at once betrayed dodge to practised eye of foremost hound be caution to be more careful time have to work hard to make up for ground have lost by mistake next sight of hound showed that be fairly ahead again that ploughed field have a birch predicted told on good portion of pack who now at least of who be at well up scarcely numbered dozen half mile farther brought to wincot village down main street of sped greatly to admiration of inhabitant who turned out in force to see sport by time have fairly got second wind began to realise benefit of steady training of past fortnight at ordinary pace with second wind well laid on felt ought to be able to hold out for run home unless very unexpected accident must intervene past village rattled on till came to railway embankment across trespassed not without difficulty a be steep railed off on side by high palisade once over turned at right angle ran for mile close alongside line past wincot station here be necessary to recross line down cutting time a be doing so caught sight on left of leading hound scrambling to top of embankment have passed only minute two before clear of railway there remained good steady piece of work cut out for to reach home across awful country full of hedge ditch a hilly a pie crust birch be well in humour of thing by time determined must not be fault if great hunt of year ended in victory for hound so spurted for nearly mile jumping most of narrow ditch low hedge crossed path making a straight course a hilly ground allowed of despite effort occasional glimpse caught of pursuer showed that be unable to shake off four five of leading hound who with forwood at head be coming on at great pace if not gaining on at least not losing ground must never do must be up if thing went on so must see so cunning birch have once again to resort to dodge to gain time suddenly altering track leaving field struck dusty lane wound in out in direction of parkhurst now a be very dusty very chalky lane a wind be blowing dust about very freely be easy to see why artful birch made use of on present occasion white scrap of paper falling on white road being fallen on by white dust have good chance of escaping detection unless looked after very carefully to make matter more secure dodged off into field back again into lane pretty often leaving pursuer ditch to jump time manoeuvre answered fairly well for next time saw hound be searching about by side of ditch for track good way to rear have now to face hardest bit of work of afternoon last two mile home be over perfectly flat bit of country so flat that hound must have in view nearly way consequently to dodge double must be simply useless only course be straight hard run for trusting to leg wind to pull through so settled down to task with will scarcely have emerged into open ground for couple of minute when saw figure dash out of lane in full cry after be forwood whipper in terrible scud across country be only fifty yard so ahead of three others also celebrated for pace so hare have work cut out for mistake for mile ran a hard a well must turning to right left halting at ditch dyke parkhurst tower rose before in distance more than one boy be already strolling out in direction to witness finish how wished be a fresh a put on hare shouted first who met will do yet hound be gaining cried next passed young urchin sitting on bank eating toffee now there met not single spectator only group who cheered loudly backing hare hound till hardly knew where be even began to run along with at respectful distance in order to be in at death playground wall be now visible only mile away on other side of gravelshire canal have to be crossed by bridge be fast approaching gave rapid look back forwood be now only hundred yard behind with lot of running still in must certainly run down in next half mile birch said a ran beside be good for swim rather exclaimed if be quick swerved suddenly in course to amazement of spectator left bridge on left in minute be on margin of canal next moment splash of double header shout of assembled onlooker proclaimed that have made plunge for canal be only about thirty foot wide be across in twinkling light flannel clothes scarcely interfering with swimming certainly not adding much to weight carried after being soaked through three hundred yard now ah that cheer behind mean that forwood have followed plunge what be laughing at though can have foundered shout mean be safe over hard at heel for last three hundred yard run regular steeplechase meadow be intersected with line of hurdle take one after in run a hard a can only one more then be safe suddenly find on face on grass have caught on last hurdle come to grief birch in instant haul to foot just a forwood rise to leap then for hundred yard be race for very life what shouting there be what rushing of boy waving of cap pas before eye on come forwood gallant hound at heel can hear behind distinctly now have shout one one spurt more hare cry be safe on bound on come pursuer not ten yard behind not ten more than five five never make up till birch be safe inside school gate winner by neck neck only of famous hunt pack came straggling in for next hour amid cheer chaffing of boy three of who have kept neck neck way be only two minute behind forwood have shirked swim taken higher drier course a indeed most of other hound did by way of bridge ten minute after one other fellow turned up quarter of hour later three more so on until whole pack have run walked limped ridden home except one little jim barlow tiniest youngest pluckiest little hound that ever crossed country be anxious to know what have become of small chap of thirteen who one said ought never to have be allowed to start on big run with little leg wait bit said forwood jim will turn up before long safe sound will see be nearly dusk good two hour after finish be sitting in big hall talking laughing over event of afternoon when there came sound of foot on gravel walk accompanied by vehement puffing outside window there be exclaimed forwood declare running still so be in minute door swung open in trotted little jim dripping wet coated with mud panting like steam engine otherwise a self composed a usual how long have fellow be in demanded of a sat down began to lug off wet boot two hour replied birch little hero looked trifle mortified to find be so far behind be quite sorry for never mind said ran on scent inch of way only pulled up once at wincot for five minute did exclaimed one two voice a stared admiringly at determined young hound yes nice dance gave chap size over railway across ditch did miss single one of same what did do at canal asked forwood why swam of course obliged to do be if hare went that way say be there grub going plucky little jim barlow after be hero of big hunt though did come in two hour late be last big hare hound ever ran in have many time since ridden with real hunt over same country never have experienced same thrill of excitement known same exultation at success a when ran home with birch two second ahead of hound in famous parkhurst paper chase of hundred something chapter three parkhurst boat race adam be wanted down at boat house such be sound greeted ear one saturday afternoon a lolled about in playground at parkhurst doing nothing jumped up a if have be shot asked small boy who brought message who wanted blade doe have got to cox boat afternoon instead of wilson look sharp said a be waiting to start off went without word filled with mingled feeling of wonder pride trepidation knew wilson former coxswain of school boat have be taken ill left parkhurst be first have ever heard of being selected to take place true have steered boat occasionally when one else must be got on such occasion have managed to keep moderately good course up two mile reach have never dreamed of such pitch of good fortune a being called to occupy seat a fixture now wanted only week of great race with old boy here be summoned to take charge of rudder at eleventh hour of course meant must have to steer boat on occasion of race wonder then be half daft with excitement a hurried down to boathouse in obedience to summons of blade stroke of parkhurst four must explain that at parkhurst be peculiarly favoured in matter of boating river colven flowed through town only mile from school boundary being at place short distance from sea be fifty yard broad clear deep stream just sort of water one must choose for rowing there be lock for six mile so up few craft came in from sea rarely proceeded beyond parkhurst so that have long uninterrupted stretch of water for boat a soon a ever spring set in weather became too hot for football hare hound appeared in force half holiday on surface of fellow on such occasion used to amuse by starting off for long leisurely grind up stream else with set sail to tack down lower reach towards sea most of who laid claim in degree to name of enthusiastic oarsman confined operation mainly to two mile reach on most of club race be rowed chief of be old boy race already referred to race have be instituted year before time at school by old parkhurstian who presented cup to be rowed for annually between best four oared crew of present school crew of old pupil who have be at parkhurst within two year race be absorbing topic in boat club for several week before event how carefully crew be selected how strictly trained how patiently mr blunt one of master old cambridge oar coached tutored how regularly boat went over course morning after morning before breakfast how eagerly fellow criticised commended rower how impatiently looked forward to coming contest year prospect be doubtful old boy have got together strong crew who be reported by who have be over to see to be very fast in splendid form while at last moment have have disadvantage to lose coxswain have to fill place with le experienced hand still school four be good one carefully drilled with plenty of power one mr blunt pronounced ought to hold own with other average crew so on whole there be saying how chance stood found have work before to get accustomed to new duty before day of race daily be out with four several time besides be taken over course in punt carefully shown willow bend eddy of stream made familiar with in out of bank luckily be light weight to begin with so that did not lose much by limited period of training being indeed not so heavy a former coxswain of boat whom have succeeded well eventful day came at last old boy arrived day before from two trial row took over course must see be first rate crew formidable opponent still coach who have watched minutely told have better stroke of two if must only hold out ought to win after be comforting information for showy style of opponent have struck terror into not few of whose sympathy be on side of present boy school turned out in force to witness event towing path be lined with spectator many of from distance attracted by prospect of exciting race goodly muster of old fellow revisited haunt of school day congregated about winning post while others of more athletic turn prepared to run along with race from beginning to end meanwhile in boat house have stripped for action launched boat a be ready to put off make for starting point mr blunt came up said to blade stroke now remember row steady stroke through be flurried if get best of start if can stick to first half of way ought to be able to row down in last mind adam said addressing let force out of straight course waste time in trying to bother keep a straight a arrow ca go wrong a fellow put off for starting place long clean stroke elicited little admiration from onlooker who saw much in augured well for success of boat thanks to mr blunt crew have learned to master steady strong sweep of oar be universally admitted to be perfection of rowing style most serviceable of stroke rowed well through from first to last gripping water instant oar be back body arm forward dragged clean through without jerk plunge swing of body regular a clockwork feather clear rapid essentially be kind of rowing not only put most pace into boat be capable of being sustained far longer than other not long after opponent embarked have opportunity of criticising style a paddled up to where lay waiting for certainly looked pretty taking stroke be quicker than ours equally regular seemed to end in spasmodic jerk a oar left water though succeeded in making boat travel quickly appeared to try power of rower rather more than style did still there be mistaking that be fast powerful crew remember to day passing thought wish be at end of flashed through mind a gathered rudder line together ready for start mr blunt be to act a starter be coming towards in boat with watch in hand rival boat be lying close beside ours can see stroke be leaning forward saying something to coxswain wonder be about perhaps be telling to push out of course perhaps be saying how nervous be looking well be nervous begin to think will forget way have to go perhaps will pull right hand line instead of left possibly will omit to pull line at what lasting disgrace will then be mine then suddenly remember what mr blunt said that be up with race if cox loses head by violent effort banish qualm resolve come what may nothing will unsteady still hand tremble a grasp line adam say blade make stretcher fast will voice of human being close to somehow have effect of helping to recover wit completely a kneel make fast stretcher then once again take seat in stern of boat feel quite again wonder at for being such as back water half stroke call out mr blunt to from skiff obey then find other boat be little in front of therefore move quarter of stroke forward still boat be not quite level other boat must come back foot two not quite enough boat must advance few inch there now be level be ready boat have drifted forward again must be moved back take time presently be once again level question be repeated be ready only answer time be leaning forward of crew with arm stretched oar well back in readiness for signal what age seems there actually wind have blown rival bow across stream before start two minute must be spent in manoeuvring back into position once again be ready answer save quick reach forward silent suspense then go feel boat half lifted in water under first stroke be rather scramble so be second by third boat have begun to get way on in stroke two more men have settled down to customary swing what of opponent at first stroke boat have dashed away inch two in advance of ours at third that distance have become foot presently be far enough ahead to enable to catch sight of coxswain back a settled down to work be rowing at considerably quicker pace than wrenching boat forward at stroke inch by inch improving advantage noticed before shout with spectator hailed start have died away have dim vision of body of runner starting along with on bank of eager cry to one crew other from sympathising onlooker have enough to do to keep eye fixed ahead without gaping at crowd remembering mr blunt advice selected landmark in front steered course direct for plan of have cause to be glad pretty early in race for old boy boat drawing steadily ahead to about boat length began very gradually to insinuate nose little over in direction so have not have fixed point on to steer must have be strongly tempted to give way unwittingly before so abandon inch two of water fairly belonged to boat a be however be able to detect defeat manoeuvre for keeping on perfectly straight course others be obliged to draw in horn return to straight course too having lost little ground in process still seemed to be forging ahead shout from bank announced that thus far at rate parkhurst boat be getting worst of stole look at blade face be composed unconcerned be easy to see knew what be about kept up long steady swing being well backed up by three men behind lifted boat well at beginning of stroke never letting down till end must see that knew exactly how far others be ahead at what rate be rowing yet neither quickened altered stroke plodded on with look of easy confidence at once felt quite satisfied in own mind a to result be not long before opponent gave indication of abating somewhat quick stroke have hitherto maintained by virtue of have already got nearly boat length ahead at same moment blade slightly quickened stroke instantly boat began to crawl up alongside that of rival amid frantic cheer of onlooker slowly surely forged ahead till stroke oar be level with coxswain then spurt from old boy kept two boat abreast for few second died away after little once more boat travelled slowly back a drew level began in turn to take lead now be time to what be ahead on water drifting right across bow of boat shout from bank apprises that others besides have taken sudden alarm empty boat insecurely moored to bank have got adrift be calmly floating up with tide in mid stream along very course what be to be done other boat being on opposite side can easily clear obstacle not so ours must put bow across enemy water so run risk of foul consequent defeat else must lose ground by slackening pace going out of course to avoid unlucky boat there be not ten second in to decide that suffices to choose latter alternative trusting to rowing power of crew to make up disadvantage look to oar stroke side cry at same time pull rudder line quickly be a expected boat lost ground instantly must see out of corner of eye old boy boat shoot forward with quickened stroke hear triumphant shout of partisan second two sufficed to get past obstructing boat oar on stroke side just scraping a did so a headed again into proper course saw opponent two clear boat length in front men pulling with energy of triumph confidence be sight to make one despair how be ever to make up tremendous gap how much blade inquires a swing forward towards two reply set face determinedly quickens stroke men behind at first get into altered swing for moment two rowing be scrambling boat roll unsteadily spectacle hailed with increased joy by partisan of old boy boat steady now cry blade over shoulder next moment boat right four oar dip feather simultaneously sitting in stern can feel swing a of one man boat dash forward like machine fellow on bank mark change cheer tremendously well spurted parkhurst put on now be gaining rowed indeed such be cry a heard set blood tingling with excitement be long time before perceptible gain be noticeable from where old boy have taken advantage of lead to come across into water must see of be blade of oar on in front rose fell swiftly with regular beat still shout from bank be be gaining presently saw boat edging off again into own water by concluded have pulled up sufficiently to make necessary to avoid foul men pulled splendidly cool determined plucky rowed best eye fixed on back of man before keeping perfect time pulling stroke through with terrible energy must see by pale look that shared common excitement there be sign of flurry distress nothing quiet determination augured better for result of effort than shout of onlooker where be now willow on left be know just mile from winning post will in distance be able to pull up length now divide rival there be chance yet leading boat be not going a fast a be minute ago can tell that by eddy from oar sweep past how much inquired blade again a swung forward one replied must see by gleam in eye that have hope still of making that one length nothing before winning post be reached that shout from bank mean something surely well rowed indeed parkhurst be overlapped yes who must see be watching little pink flag at prow of boat creeping inch by inch up stern of rival eddy from oar came past nearer now thud of outrigger sounded closer yes be gaining without doubt will overtake in time to avoid defeat can see mass of people ahead on bank know that be gathered opposite winning post ca be quarter of mile off now again that shout from bank ah yes bow oar be level with stroke now have shout fellow blade turn head for second cry to men a quickens up to final spurt what shout then rent air boat no longer crawled up beside old boy began to fly on on coxswain seems to be gliding backwards towards in vain attempt to answer spurt have not rowing left in to do nothing can stop in moment be abreast almost instantly there come such cheer after cheer from bank even dash of oar be drowned in parkhurst ahead ah well rowed now old boy be win on on what sensation so glorious so madly exciting a of one of crew of winning boat within twenty yard of goal be tempted to shout to wave hat to do something ridiculous set teeth sit still holding breath four stroke more will do one be level with stroke of old boy boat two fellow pull a if have half mile to go still three judge at winning post be lifting hand cocking pistol four crack go signal a men cease rowing boat shoot forward with impetus of last terrific stroke amid cheer shout of assembled crowd breathe again knowing that parkhurst boat have won by three yard grandest race in be ever lot to take part chapter four parkhurst versus westfield now parkhurst turn out sharp be going in first so shouted steel captain of eleven putting head in at door of tent in be arraying in flannel spiked shoe otherwise arming for great match against westfield school be now about to commence always looked upon westfield fellow a most dangerous rival on cricket field much in light in esteemed craven where football be concerned match in respective pretension be yearly settled be need hardly say regarded a match of season made object of untiring practice feverish excitement year after year for twelve year rival eleven have met always on last saturday of june one year at parkhurst next at westfield so far result have be that school have won six match fancy then state of feeling year a started off in early morning on omnibus from parkhurst to engage in decisive contest unless ended in draw must turn balance in favour of school to glorification of rival must not bear to think of possibility of defeat must be too tragical too shameful so a drove over to westfield that morning talked of nothing victory felt very like determined old spartan who when went to war made vow must return either with shield on of course there be regular swarm of people to see match old parkhurst bat who have played in first match thirteen year ago be there with big beard very majestic to look at old boy now settled in life be there with wife child carriage full of own westfield father mother shoal of young brother sister crammed space beyond flag doctor a usual have driven over almost gave offence to of most enthusiastic partisan by chumming up publicly with head master of rival then besides there be host of outsider drawn together by simple curiosity love of cricket so altogether a emerged from tent in snow white flannel pink belt felt that eye of world be upon be more convinced than ever that anything short of victory must be most terrible of calamity must fall on youthful head great hope be in steel captain one of best cricketer parkhurst have ever produced for coolness self confidence without equal anywhere adored for never snubbed youngster made light of doings if during practice fellow bowled batted fielded well steel took care to encourage if one played carelessly bungled steel scowled that unlucky man name disappeared for season from list of candidate for place in first eleven see now stroll up to wicket with wicket keeping pad on talking on way to one of two men who be to officiate first with bat on behalf of westfield youngster ca understand such coolness keep eye on a if moment expected to see fell rival to earth be great matter to be used to thing who be now making first appearance in first eleven felt a if world began continued ended within area of westfield meadow here be one who to appearance made more of great match than must of dinner away now with thought cricket ball have be tossing about idly be taken into custody by umpire steel be behind wicket looking round to see if fielder be in place motioning one two of to stand deeper closer in a deems advisable westfield batsman who be to receive first over be getting middle bowler be tucking up sleeve gripping brand new ball in hand ground keeper be chasing few small boy back behind rope scorer in big tent be dipping pen in ink altogether be critical moment in life moment seems a long a whole day play cry umpire bowler delivers first ball not very alarming one evidently meant more a test of ball pitch than a serious attack on enemy wicket reader of course expect to give full true particular account of ball bowled on eventful day must be a tedious for a for will do best to recall chief feature of game a presented to from post first at cover point while side be batting from tent wicket first few over be not eventful rarely be men have to get used to ground ball batsman chose to be exceedingly careful how hit out at first in third over single run be made of course westfield fellow cheered a if match be already won then gradually came one two more single two one three then just a two batsman be getting into good humour fancying might lay about little more freely down went first wicket amid cheer of fellow saw figure posted up on telegraph a indicating score so far standing to credit of westfield have not long to wait for next man in still le long to see out poor fellow for very first ball sent bail flying over steel head have to trudge back to tent take off pad almost before have got used to feel of on leg in over following arrival of successor easy catch by point disposed of wicket be something like exclaimed to myself three men out for fourteen run if go on like will have own way in satisfaction ventured to communicate idea to man fielding at point adam will attend to game be steel who spoke at sound of voice started like one shot discovered that next man be in ready to begin stepped back to place in instant must sooner have have one of hurley swiftest ball catch on bare shin than be thus publicly called to order before whole field can safely say that never in life since moment have caught talking during play in cricket match felt in disgrace got nervous dared not look at steel for fear of meeting eye wished mile away repented of satisfaction of being in first eleven most devoutly hoped ball must chance near a must assuredly miss a thought passed mind man who be batting cut ball hard low in direction be so hard so low that under circumstance must have be most difficult ball to field still more to catch flew towards few inch from ground be in despair knew eye in field be on steel in particular here must be hundred of witness to utter imbecility must that ground must swallow sprang forward tripped a sprang in fall ball dashed into hand fell from to earth have missed catch disgrace be complete fancy then astonishment when heard steel awful voice cry well tried sir when distant sound of clapping reached from tent must not understand at first afterwards found out that by lucky trip have more nearly succeeded in catching ball than more experienced player must have done have kept balance so got credit for good piece of play did not in least deserve however served to recover from nervousness bad spirit incite to desire to accomplish something for must honestly take credit never be such determination more called for than now driver captain of westfield eleven be at wicket most tremendous hitter bowling came alike to swifter ball happier be sending one over bowler head nearly into scorer tent among spectator behind rope score hitherto so slow began to fly up forty fifty sixty seventy saw posted up in rapid succession wondered how must end seemed to have a many life a cat easy catch be missed run out be only just avoided still scored matter who partner be one two came went while be in hit away merrily cheer of westfield grew almost monotonous from frequency on off side however have not much to do for nearly driver hit be to on curiously enough nearly found way between two of men mid wicket on long on just out of reach of must not help wondering why of fellow altered place so a to guard weak point be curious how sometimes in cricket same thing occurs to two people at same time while be inwardly speculating on result of change of position steel appeared to become aware of same necessity for saw behind batsman back silently motioning mid wicket on to stand farther back mid on to come round to square position manoeuvre however did not escape wily driver who sent next ball to leg next to identical spot mid wicket on have just quitted still steel motioned to to remain in new post knew well enough that if man have habit of hitting in one direction however studiously try to avoid place nature will sooner later assert ball will fly where have be wont to fly so be in case must not resist impulse to lift one specially tempting ball in direction of old haunt sure enough in so doing sent clean into long on hand with own inning ended to great relief inning of side for total score of of have contributed quite odd be good round score to overtake thing did not promise cheerfully for at commencement of inning westfield men be happy in possessing two swift bowler who made havoc of first two three on side who presented be one of when started for wicket armed with pad glove bat did not feel happy still be in hope might at least succeed in breaking duck egg be more than must be said for of predecessor felt rather important a requested umpire to give middle hammered mark little with bat still foot fidgeted there be sort of cobwebby feeling on face tickling sensation in small of back a stood ready for first ball convinced be by mean at home in new position play cry umpire bowler start to run with arm extended make sort of curve round wicket balance on one foot a discharge ball come like lightning right on to bat twisting in grasp then be snatched up in instant by point who toss to wicket keeper who return to bowler be very alarming here be eleven men banded together with one object of putting out be so quiet determined about that feel like guilty thing a stand there to defend wicket bowler start again for sinuous run again ball whizz from hand lift bat in attempt to strike slip under there be little click behind back then ball fly aloft discover that service at wicket be no longer required so ended first inning happily for side of men who went in afterwards made better show than three unfortunate who have opened ball have done steel made forty two others about twenty added to odds end contributed by rest of side brought parkhurst score up to run behind competitor there be great jubilation among westfield partisan a hero entered on second inning under such promising auspex especially when redoubtable driver went in first with bat have wrought such wonder in former inning there seemed probability too of repeating late performance with even greater vigour for first ball reached sent flying far high right over tent for six magnificent hit fairly deserved praise received not from westfield fellow only from ours who for moment must forget rivalry to admire great exploit next three ball be delivered to partner at wicket who blocked carefully evidently bent on acting on defensive while companion made running from fifth ball of over bye be scored brought driver once again to end facing bowler next ball came slightly to off tried to cut miscalculated be careless about direction gave for lodged clean into hand safe easy catch catch of enormous importance to side a disposed once for of most dreaded opponent bereft of champion westfield fellow only succeeded in putting together moderate score of fifty in second inning of twenty four be contributed by one man so spirit revived somewhat a discovered have only to make to win be indeed plenty against such bowling be good deal le than have dreaded well decisive inning began a soon a have fortified ourselves with lunch provided for by hospitable rival afternoon be getting on still crowd of spectator kept together patiently determined to see end of match will do heard one ask of steel do be evasive reply win said other how do know be captain curt answer if there be one thing annoyed steel above others be to be asked foolish question sent in two steady men first with order not to be in hurry to score to break back of bowling advice faithfully acted upon for over after over there be nothing blocking in vain bowler strained nerve to get round under stubborn bat must not do run came few far between field have nothing to do altogether game became very monotonous fellow did better service to side than many who scored more played in more brilliant style must see prolonged stand be not without effect on westfield bowler bowling became le le steady style seemed to lose precision a ball after ball fell hopelessly off obstinate bat be evidently just what steel wanted must tell by frequent played sir how thoroughly approved of steady discipline of men after time very monotony of game seemed to excite spectator who answered neat block with cheer showed too must appreciate tactic of captain be getting desperate for westfield humiliating too when one of bowler happened to change style instead of slashing round arm ball have hitherto sent in suddenly without warning put in underhand lob easy slow tempting ball apparently bound to rise exactly on player bat man fell into snare must hear steel who be near groan a watched lift bat have till now remained so well under control stepping forward prepare for terrific slog ala deceitful ball never rose at pitching quietly foot before crease shot forward along ground found way at last to wicket amid tremendous shout of crowd parting being thus made between two steady partner survivor a be so often case did not long remain behind companion when steel went in three wicket have already fallen with only fifteen run will captain save from defeat see stand coolly at wicket how sure of seems how indifferent to imposing combination of bowler fielder surround take time to get comfortably settled at wicket kneel down to tighten shoestring a if nobody be waiting for then pulling down peak of cap to shade eye from sun leisurely turn face to bowler announces ready for worst desperate character can do to watched breathlessly result of first over with excitement strangely in contrast with indifferent apparently careless demeanour of batsman be soon apparent however that might dismiss anxiety from mind a to safety for set briskly to work punishing ball came to yet never giving single chance have rarely seen such good round play unlike westfield captain who be strong only on leg side of wicket be thoroughly at home from attack be delivered ball hit to leg cut with terrific force past cover point ball came amiss to be up to twister lob thunderbolt walked into with faultless dexterity up went score twenty grew to forty forty to fifty be matter of time now if five remaining men still to go in must together make stand long enough to enable to overtake enemy score must assuredly do unless unforeseen accident prevented of five be next in order be long before turn arrived found sallying forth to join captain at wicket remembering poor figure have cut in first inning be not very sanguine of distinguishing on occasion still there be something in being opposite steel gave confidence relieved of nervous sensation marked late debut first ball two after arrival fell to lot of steel who sent flying promptly gave running to do in consequence helped still more to make comfortable so that when at last turn came to be bowled at experienced none of desolate feeling have rendered former brief inning so unhappy manage to block first ball second also then come third under contrive to get bat send flying come shout steel run cry run again be safe back before ball return to wicket keeper hand positively have scored two felt a proud a if have be elected mp next ball went for two more must hear cheer from tent made feel very valiant glanced to signal board score be ninety six only twenty seven to win why must not be able to hold out until steel made up figure so defeat westfield by four wicket at rate must try sent next ball for single then be steel turn to bat of course must send flying horror have missed deafening shout proclaims that glorious inning be at end feel like orphan a watch with bat under arm quitting wicket at have put together sixty six run in a fine style a player ever did be good to hear applause welcomed back to tent what be to become of here be twenty six run to get four weakest batsman of side to play however one can do best so played a carefully a must becoming gradually accustomed to bowling knocking occasional one two on to score new companion however kept company short time successor shorter still fellow coming in now be last man will ever be able to stick together till fifteen run be now required can be made up steady tom whisper a pass on way to wicket wink answer be responsible thing for two youngster with whole fate of school depending on keep cool play very best one by one score run up ten to win now eight seven be getting exciting crowd hang eagerly on result of ball two from companion westfield fellow look nervously at signal board a if by watching must make figure grow le two from bat time then single only two to win next ball get past comrade bat skim within hair breadth of bail steady now cry steel cheerily mind what be at steady be next two ball be blocked dead then companion make single hurrah be equal now at rate defeat be averted now for victory be turn to bat ball be not sort of one to play trick with so with effort keep bat square stop without hitting played sir cry one approvingly feel denial rewarded next ball be not so dangerous can see be careless one may safely punish punish will so step forward catching on bound bang know not care not where what shouting what cheering a run one two three four five time across wicket match be ours with wicket to spare a ride back that evening to parkhurst talk laugh exult over day victory be happiest eleven fellow without exception that ever rode on top of omnibus chapter five boating adventure at parkhurst once once only did play truant from parkhurst transgression be attended with consequence so tragical that to day memory be a vivid impressive a if event be about to record have happened only last week instead of quarter of century ago will recall in hope of deterring reader from following foolish example at least of warning of terrible result may ensue from thoughtless act of wrong doing have already mentioned that parkhurst stood two three mile above point at river colven flow into sea from school house must often catch hum of wave breaking lazily along shore of colveston bay if wind blew hard from sea carried with roar of breaker on bar mouth distant thunder of surf on stony beach of course walk ramble constantly took direction of shore of bay though perhaps schoolboy be more readily impressed with other matter than beauty of nature can remember even now once familiar view from raven cliff a if eye still rested upon can see on hot summer afternoon great curve of beautiful bay bounded at extremity by headland bathed in soft blue haze can see cliff chine sand basking like in sun on right jagged outline of ruined sea girt castle stand out like sentinel betwixt be land water on left can detect fisherman white cottage crouching beneath crag can see long golden strip of strand beyond farther still across wide estuary of wraythe line of shadowy cliff extend like rugged wall out to dim promontory of shargle head above can see again sea bluer even than blue sky overhead a tumble languidly in from horizon fringing amphitheatre of bay with edge of sparkling white ear can catch murmur of solemn music a heard in day long gone by well remember too same bay same sea oh how changed far a eye must reach great white wave charged towards land one upon furious headlong below thundered lashed rushed back upon fellow till who watched must not hear so much a own voice in distance leapt savagely at base of now lowering headland fought madly over hidden rock sand sent sleet foam flake before blinding where stood on cliff top seethed boiled in hollow of rock over river bar dashed plunged till far up stream fury scarcely spent at such time ship boat ventured willingly into colveston bay if did rarely if ever left again such time be rare very rare with indeed have be month at parkhurst before witnessed real storm month again before saw so that acquaintance with bay be almost altogether connected with milder aspect a such appeared fascinating tempting be on beautiful august holiday morning that four of be lounging lazily in boat down at bar mouth looking out into bay watching progress of little fishing smack be skipping lightly over bright wave in direction of shargle head sail gleamed in sunlight skimmed so lightly across water bounded so merrily through sparkling ripple that seemed more like fairy craft than real yacht of board canvas 'd give good deal to be in exclaimed hall one of party sea captain son to whom on nautical matter accorded amplest deference so must said hutton how jolly look ever so much more fun than knocking about on stupid old river chimed in say fellow cried hall struck by sudden idea why must have little cruise in bay must be glorious day like be not sure old rogers be disrespectful way in regret to say be wont to designate dr rogers head master must like said be got notion into head about current tide make fidgety current fiddlestick broke in hall with laugh what doe know about tell day like with good sailing breeze four of to row in case dropped there 'd be no more difficulty in going over there back than there must in rowing from here back to parkhurst how long must take to get to shargle inquired hutton why only two hour perhaps le wind exactly right for going coming back too can be back by four easily that allows hour two to land there certainly be tempting day be perfection colveston bay have never looked more fascinating headland stood out so distinctly in clear air that be hard to imagine shargle head be five mile distant from where sat when proposition have first be made have felt passing uncomfortableness a to lawfulness of such expedition without distinct sanction of head master more gazed on bay more hall talked in enthusiastic manner of delight of cruise longer watched fairy like progress of little white sailed fishing boat le thought of anything pleasure scheme offered so when hall said will go boy what do say for one replied serene while one of party have be silent watching fishing boat taking part in discussion be charlie archer new boy at parkhurst year junior from first have taken remarkable fancy to clever good humoured plucky boy who henceforth have become frequent companion with companion of others who now composed party now looked up said greatly to surprise say want to go why not asked oh doe matter replied in evident confusion want to spoil fun know 'd rather not go why what on earth matter with charlie asked thought be always ready for adventure 'd rather not go please repeated can put ashore why not again inquired hall time testily never liked charlie quite a much a hutton did be evidently displeased to have now putting forward objection to proposition of own making why not because because began boy hesitatingly because want to go hall became angry like most boy not sure of honesty of own motif disliked to have suggested that what be urging be wrong therefore replied with taunt keener than persuasion poor little milksop suppose be afraid of getting drowned of doing something mamma grandmamma somebody must like little pet to do 'd better put ashore boy mind precious little boot get wet while be about be cruel blow struck home at archer one weak point plucky adventurous a be one thing must not endure be to be laughed at face flushed lip quivered a heard hall brutal speech marked smile with be ashamed to say received be not afraid exclaimed then why want to go be silent for time struggle be evidently going on in mind sneer on hall face determined do want to go have changed mind be style said hutton patting on back knew be one of right sort hall too condescended to approve of decision at once began to busy with preparation for immediate start however be by mean comfortable at what have taken place be plain to see charlie have yielded against better judgment that with alacrity might now throw into scheme mind be not easy have be le selfishly inclined towards own pleasure must have sided with in desire not to engage in questionable proceeding ala wish in case have ruled conscience still made one feeble effort on archer behalf hall whispered a stooped with to disengage rope at bottom of boat what be use of taking charlie when doe want to go may a well put ashore if 'd sooner not go archer said hall looking up from rope did say wanted to go not question be accompanied by look made hard for boy to reply anything want to go be own free will eh yes so ended weak effort if only have be more determined to do right if ala have imagined thousandth part of what day be to bring forth must have set archer ashore whether must not even if to do so have cost life be anticipating for hour be busy getting boat trim for voyage be somewhat old craft in for many year past have be wont to cruise down seaward reach of colven carrying one lug sail with thwart for two pair of oar be steady on keel a far a have be able to judge sound in respect good sailor certainly on day like cockleshell must have have nothing to fear be half sorry have not lighter boat than one be in to take across to shargle hall who assumed command from first impressed not little by businesslike way in set to work to get everything ship shape before starting knew clearly use of rope pulley knew precisely necessary amount of ballast to be taken proper place for stowing discoursed learnedly on knot hitch aroused sympathy by lament on absence of bowsprit foresail hutton be sent ashore to buy provision charlie be set to baling out boat occupied with mopping seat generally swabbing up a hall called so that in due time be ready to sail well provisioned well equipped on eventful voyage up went sail watched first flap wildly then swell proudly in wind a sheet rope be drawn in hall hand put round helm then after little coquetting a if be loth to act a desired without coaxing rose lightly to rippling wave glided forward on way adam said hall 'd better make snug up in bow hutton sit where be be ready to help with sail when tack charlie old boy come down astern beside sit little farther over hutton now be trim trim be strange feeling of exhilaration filled breast a now darted forward before steady breeze dancing over wave with merry splash tossing to side of prow listening to a gurgled musically under keel there be neil cried charlie a passed coastguard boathouse spying at through telescope let spy laughed hall dare say 'd like to be coming too be slow work for fellow always hanging about doing nothing what be waving about inquired from bow for must see that sailor have put down glass be apparently trying to catch attention by gesticulation hall looked attentively for moment then said oh see be pointing up at flagstaff to show wind in north east suppose think one know that let see said hutton be going north west be yes so will be able to make use of wind way with little tacking be shouting something now said charlie with eye still on neil oh be old woman said hall laughing be always wanting to tell that a if one knew anything about sailing took off hat waved ceremoniously to old sailor who continued shouting beckoning while though without avail for only word came to across water be fresh afternoon be not much enlightened by be afraid be fresh in morning laughed short sail brought to bar mouth over a tide be in sea quiet passed without difficulty although hall have bade have oar ready in case of emergency must be necessary to lower sail in crossing of there be need in minute be at last in bay fairly at sea do see parkhurst over tree there fellow cried charlie pointing behind never saw place from bay before answered look better here than from other side be proud of old school house fully impressed with superiority over other building of kind in kingdom view in bay be extremely beautiful shargle head stood out opposite distinct grand towering up from water sweeping back to join moorland hill behind on left close beside bar mouth rose raven cliff where so often have be wont to lie look out on very bay one by one recognised familiar spot from new point of view agreed that from side doe grand coast look so grand a from sea boat scudded along merrily hall keeping steady course well up to wind after few lesson got to know respective duty so thought with regularity of trained ship crew with wind a be right across course have not much need to tack when order to stand by did arrive prided that knew how to act hall let go sheet hutton lowered sail charlie put round helm in bow be ready to aid others in shifting canvas to other side of mast hauling up sail again then hall resumed charge of helm drew in sheet charlie hutton trimmed over to other side of boat once again little craft darted forward be in exuberant spirit lovely summer morning even charlie seemed to have forgotten uneasiness at first starting for be now life soul of party told wonderful story about very bay gathered from of favourite history how after defeat of spanish armada when proud vessel of spain be driven partly by tempest partly by pursuit of admiral headlong along very coast one of have got into colveston bay there be driven ashore at base of raven cliff not one man of crew surviving that awful wreck repeated one after legend connected with druce castle whose ruined turret must discern away behind of cove crag cave a passed till in imagination bay became alive once more with ship battle seemed to watch gleam of armour on castle wall glare of beacon on headland to hear thunder of cannon from beach when presently hall cheery call to stand by wakened into sudden recollection of present circumstance then what song sang what famous sea story hall told how hutton made roar with recitation how time seemed to fly boat too in until at last found great shargle towering over head knew have reached destination hall looked at watch be good run boy said not quite two hour uncommonly good run for old tub like now where will land vote land on welkin island said charlie welkin island be separate about three quarter of mile from mainland famous for cave shell serene said hall putting boat about stand by so made last tack very soon be close up at island after cruising selected eligible creek for landing into hall ran boat a neatly a most experienced helmsman in majesty navy then landed dragging ashore hamper of provision picnicked at edge of rock with water on three side of with shargle head across narrow channel rising majestically above great amphitheatre of bay extended like picture beyond need say what jovial repast be what appetite have what zest situation lent to meal how vied with in merriment charlie be blithest of then wandered over wonderful island waded into cave climbed to cliff top filled pocket with shell bathed aimed stone into sea raced along strand cut name in row on highest point of island in commemoration of expedition there remain to day say hope be not going to rain said hutton looking up at cloud have for time be obscuring sun who care if doe shouted charlie hullo there go roof cried a sudden gust of wind lifted hat from head sent skimming down rock think be time started home said hall hurriedly there be something in uneasy look of face a said made uncomfortable so turned to embark once more in boat must not conceal from a made way to creek where have left moored that weather have thus far be so propitious to expedition be not holding out a must have wished wind have be little more than steady breeze during morning now met in frequent gust made raise hand to hat few ugly looking black cloud on horizon have come up obscured sun threatening not only to shut out ray to break over bay in heavy downpour of rain even on half sheltered side of island where be water have hitherto moved only in ripple now began to heave restlessly in wave curled over a met breeze covered sea with little white breaker there be uncanny sort of moan about wind a swept down hollow of rock even seagull a skimmed past on surface of now sombre water seemed uncomfortable however sea be not rough though sun happened to be hidden from must see shining brightly away in direction of wind too though stronger than have be in morning be still not violent have little doubt of making a quick if not quicker passage back than have already made so although in secret heart one of must perhaps have preferred weather of earlier part of day to have continued did not let uneasiness appear to fellow allow to interfere with show of good spirit tell what said charlie laughing a came down to boat must be real spree to have little rough water going back just for fun of seeing old hutton seasick will be very pleased to give amusement replied hutton perhaps adam will assist for saw looking anxiously over bow once twice a be coming so did said charlie must have seen ghost in water for looked awfully pale shut up fellow cried who be notoriously bad sailor easily disturbed by rough sea perhaps will say called out hall from boat where be busy tying up reef in sail wish fellow must lend hand here instead of standing chaffing there obeyed with alacrity very soon have boat ready for starting now adam hutton take oar will pull out of creek have better not hoist sail till be clear of rock a emerged from little boat lumped heavily over wave broke upon rock have hard pull to get clear of turn with stern to shargle now stand by shouted hall shipped oar in moment sail shortened by one reef be hauled up boat began to scud swiftly forward will have to sit right over two said hall to hutton to keep trim look sharp about a spoke gust took sail caused boat to heel over far on to side righted in instant however on went flying through water how do feel adam called out charlie mischievously from end of boat pleasant motion be put in hutton laughing look here fellow said hall abruptly stop fooling now look after boat why what be row said hutton struck with unusually serious tone be right be be right said hall curtly if will only attend to sailing merriment died away on lip for be plain to be seen be in jesting humour then several thing struck have not previously noticed one be that wind have shifted farther north be blowing hard right into bay gathering strength minute hall noticed be sailing a close a possible up to thus making course far wider than have brought in morning why be steering out like ventured to ask because if did look out exclaimed a sudden gust caught boat making stagger reel like drunken man in instant have released sheet rope sail flapped with tremendous noise about mast be instant however then saw coolly tighten cord again put back helm to former course after did not care to repeat question reader have ever found at sea in open boat mile so from land in gathering storm with wind in teeth sea rising ominously under keel with black cloud mustering overhead distant coastline whitening with breaker have marked headland change from white to solemn purple have listened to strange hiss upon water that moaning in wind have known boat to fly through wave without making way noted anxiously by landmark that be rather drifting back with current instead of a seems tearing before wind if so can imagine feeling that afternoon be useless to pretend thing be not a bad a looked be useless not to admit to be fairly in for now must brave out a best must be useless to maintain have not be foolish wickedly foolish in starting on so venturesome expedition be useless to deny that must have be better have remained at shargle returned to parkhurst by land be in for now one thing gave confidence be hall coolness now that danger be unmistakable neither allowed to get flurried alarmed sat with closed lip watching sail one hand on tiller other grasping sheet ready to let go at moment notice a for wished must do anything more active than sit still trim boat even be use so remained watching anxiously cloud a rolled down side of hill half obscured shargle head from view presently however hall said get oar out will have made way for hour way for hour have then be time plunging through wave for nothing with what grim earnestness set to work to row through unyielding current to effect scarcely little white cottage on shargle looked round at so anxiously from time to time to ascertain what progress have be made remained always in same position after twenty minute desperate pulling seemed a if total distance gained have be scarcely dozen yard be disheartening work still more so a sea be rising minute rain have already begun to fall be in for gale said hall a wave broke over side drenching hutton half filling bottom of boat with water look sharp charlie bale out that before next come charlie set to work with will for time rowed steadily on without saying word what be time asked presently of hall a saw take out watch five said be hour after time have expected to be back at parkhurst be not yet clear of shargle same thought evidently crossed mind of other three for glanced in direction of raven cliff now scarcely visible through heavy rain wish be safe home muttered most dispirited of crew what fool be to come said nothing pulled away doggedly at oar now really seemed a if be making progress out of wretched current for white cottage on cliff appeared farther astern than have done since began to row be beginning to congratulate ourselves on success when hall who have for time be anxiously watching shore cried out for goodness ' sake pull hard fellow be drifting in fast here charlie take helm keep way be while get down sail be use now mind head stop rowing shouted to a let down sail suddenly lowered mast keep head out charlie do let go that rope beside that be right now take hold of end of mast slip under seat so saying managed to get down mast stow away without impeding rowing steering immediately advantage of step be manifest in steadier motion of boat although groaned inwardly at thought of having now distance to row at least groaned inwardly hutton be hardly a reserved tell what said to stopping rowing know what other fellow intend to do ca row more have be at hour together what be to do then inquired why must hall take turn be be doing nothing be be steering replied be only fellow who know how charlie be not strong enough to row well can say be mean to row longer have be said in undertone to now hall cried out what be shopping for hutton pull away man will never get out of pull away said sulkily have have enough of brought here 'd better take back hall face at moment be study fancy if have be ship skipper must not have hesitated instant how to deal with unexpected contingency now did hesitate be bitter enough punishment to to be there exposed to danger of sudden storm with safety perhaps life not only of of whom have induced to accompany on hand to have one of comrade turn against in moment of peril be more than have looked for will take oar said charlie before there be time to say anything said hall starting up take helm charlie added to hutton give oar get up into bow voice in be spoken look of scorn accompanied fairly cowed hutton who got up like lamb crawled into bow leaving hall to row keep straight to wave do be up if get broadside on said former to charlie so for half hour laboured in silence then almost suddenly daylight faded darkness fell over bay rowed on doggedly in half dream story of shipwreck castaway crowded in on mind found wondering how when struggle must end then mind flew back to parkhurst tried to imagine what must think there of absence have missed yet must ever be back in familiar house dared not think of then tried to pray sin of boyhood came up before mind a did so in terrible array so vowed if life might be spared must begin new better life from time forward then by strange impulse eye rested on charlie a sat there quietly holding tiller in hand gazing out ahead into darkness what be that filled with foreboding terror a looked at boy scene of morning recurred to mind halfhearted effort to prevent from accompanying selfish wretch have be what must not now give to have be resolute then if anything be to happen to charlie how must ever forgive think have made way cried out cheerily not much said hall gloomily that light there be just under shargle head have better keep on a be asked see what else be to be done if let go before wind will get right on to rock have lot to answer for growled hutton from where lay half stupid with terror in bow hall said nothing dashed oar vehemently into water continued rowing wonder if light be anywhere near parkhurst presently asked archer do see looked saw then almost instantly vanished at same time lost sight of light on shargle head rain came down in torrent mist exclaimed hall in tone of horror well indeed might feel despair at last extinguisher of hope with landmark to steer by with wind sea dead in teeth with wave breaking in over side one useless mutineer in midst felt that fate be fairly sealed even hall for moment showed sign of alarm heard mutter to god help now next moment huge wave came broadside on to emptied into boat half filling with water in sudden shock oar be dashed from hand carried away overboard never mind said hall hurriedly must have be use put round charlie quick here give tiller in moment boat swung round to wind not however before have shipped sea then felt be simply flying towards fatal rock bale out of shouted hall obeyed including even hutton who seemed at last in very desperation to be awakening to sense of duty next few minute seemed like age a knelt in half flooded boat scooping up water there in hat must serve for purpose must hear ahead of angry roar of breaker knew moment be bringing nearer to doom by one impulse abandoned useless occupation what be use of baling out boat must inevitably in few minute be dashed to piece on rock hutton crawled back into bow charlie sat where be on seat waited must not fail even in such situation to notice admire hall self possession coolness desperate a case be kept steady hand on helm strained eye into mist ahead never abating for moment vigilance

month day of week school creek be full of sputtering choking youngster new boy be hunted down to river in turn by end of year there be hardly boy at parkhurst who must not keep chin up in deep water be long introduction one day two summer after in young jobson friend have tumbled into colven large party of be down at bathing place indulging in what have now become favourite summer pastime so happened that party be made up entirely of boy in two senior class of school fifth sixth most of be landed dressing while so occupied have leisure to watch performance of who still remained in water two of specially interested who be swimming abreast about hundred yard from landing place evidently racing home one of chanced to be sixth form boy other fifth sudden impulse seized of latter class to cheer man vehemently back to be first to reach home sixth form fellow thus challenged became equally excited in backing man so without premeditation regular match be made two swimmer hearing shout entered into spirit of thing desperate race ensued came on neck neck towards cheered like mad by respective supporter side deeming honour of form at stake in event within yard two of finish be still level when sixth form man put on terrific spurt to huge disgust just landed in nose ahead of course be not going to be beaten thus there then demanded revenge whereupon company half of in very elementary stage of dressing other half in stage at resolved into meeting on spot fixed day week for formal trial of prowess between two class three event be to be contested half mile race hundred yard duck hunt of course winner of two out of three must carry day then in great excitement finished toilet hurried back to school where naturally news of coming contest spread like wildfire caused great commotion school divided forthwith into two faction calling fiver sixer selection of representative to compete in race be matter of almost a much excitement a race need hardly say be proud day for when be informed be to act in capacity of hunter for fifth in duck hunt accepted honour with mingled pride misgiving spent busy week practising for arduous duty well eventful day came at last nearly whole school mustered at cramp corner to see sport for half mile race be to come off first there be only two fellow competing man be barlow of paper chase celebrity while sixth be very confident of winning with chesney hero nearly six foot high certainly a two stood on spring board waiting signal to go there seemed very little chance for small jim against lanky antagonist although of comforted with contemplation of man long arm muscle in leg course be to be once up cramp reach back just mile swimmer be at liberty to swim in manner chose bound only to one rule to keep right side be not long kept waiting in scanty attire on plank doctor gave signal to start at word darted with two swish into water jim head be up first off started at steady chest stroke meaning business chesney dive be long one considering have half mile race before foolish one for taxed breath at outset might have be avoided have thought le about elegance more about race however did not seem at first to be worse off for took slight lead of jim going through water swiftly easily with a pretty side stroke a fellow at school in point of style there be comparison between two jim pounded along monotonously steadily with square front preserving along same regular stroke same pace same dogged expression of countenance with have entered water rival on other hand delighted spectator by kind of graceful variety now darted forward on side now on back sometimes refreshed by swift dive sometimes swung arm like windmill in fact there be scarcely accomplishment possible in rapid swimming did not give benefit of be evident of friend did not approve of style heard one of running near growl wish must give over caper swim like rational animal rational not be keeping lead said so be plodding jim with everlasting chest stroke be dozen yard so behind did not look like picking up either nevertheless cheered like mad kept up hope that must stay out better of two when turned at top of reach chesney gave up fanciful swimming to alarm settled down to side stroke for time looked powerful effective have be too confident all along now when reckoned on shaking off opponent getting clear lead found out be destined to do just reverse what long face sixer pulled a man began to puff slacken pace half mile race be joke believe so chesney began to find out before distance back be covered showed unmistakable sign of going to piece very ominous sign took to changing from one side to at very frequent interval of course fiver howled with delight man have never turned hair be now pulling up at stroke a drew level chesney gathered up remaining strength for spurt came to nothing jim held on way almost remorselessly headed man fifty yard from winning post next thing saw be chesney pulling up dead making for bank in very feeble condition jim quietly swam on amid frantic plaudit landed pretty nearly a fresh a when started so far so good loud long be exultation for have hardly expected to win race have put chief confidence on hundred yard be to follow in race three side be entered of three knew one in school who must beat halley at hundred yard be rumoured indeed that payne one of three sixer have be doing very well in training report of be not sufficiently decided to shake faith in own hero be anxious moment a stood there waiting for doctor signal if only must win race must have two race out of three in hand without further combat go cried doctor at word six youthful form plunge into water for second be lost to sight moral of half mile race have evidently be taken to heart by six boy waste time wind under surface rising quickly dash to work after first few stroke payne showed in front greatly to delight of sixer who felt that everything depended on man however be glad to see man sticking close up keeping stroke for stroke after rival of others one only little watson of sixth seemed to hold own be good three yard in rear of halley while three others fell off hopelessly from very beginning race be short eventful to delight halley overhauled payne before way be reached felt now absolutely sure of race never occurred to to think of young watson at of sudden became apparent that young man meant business changed front so to speak in very unexpected manner just a be beginning to exult over man certain victory lay over on side with peculiar jerky side stroke began to work little carcase through water at wonderful pace before long have overtaken fellow sixer almost immediately drew up to champion be in consternation twenty yard more must end race if only man must hold out keep lead be right at first looked a if must for encouraged by cheer seeing peril spurted kept good yard ahead of audacious young sixer latter put one spurt on to drew up inch by inch ten yard from home be level then for stroke two there be frantic struggle then sixer sent forth shout must have frightened very fish well might for man have won race yard half clear ahead of champion one race now for duck hunt to settle match before go further ought to explain for benefit of who have not be initiated into mystery of pastime how duck hunt be managed at part of river selected be close to mouth where stream at high water be about quarter of mile broad two boundary boat one above one below be anchored at mile distance between limit hunt be to take place duck be provided with little punt about five foot long pretty wide in be to escape a best might from cutter manned by four rower coxswain carrying in bow hunter a long a chose a long a must duck might dodge pursuer in punt when once run down must have to take to water by swimming make good escape from pursuer whose hunter must be ready at moment to jump overboard secure if however after twenty minute duck still remained uncaught be to be adjudged winner such be work cut out for on memorable afternoon duck on present occasion be sixth form fellow called haigh one of best diver swimmer in school while a have already said have be selected to act a hunter on behalf of fifth duck arrayed in slightest of costume be not long in putting in appearance in little punt being only five foot long be so light that seemed to jump through water at stroke of oar while single stroke way sufficed to change course in moment cutter in prow of a slenderly attired a duck be stationed be also light boat of course with four rower far swifter than punt when came to turning dodging be because of length comparatively unwieldy clumsy now be ready for chase duck be to get minute clear start at signal off darted up stream minute seemed to in cutter a if be never going to end watched with dismay pace at lively fugitive be making track ready in cutter cry doctor off next moment be flying through water in full cry a gradually pull up to duck diminishes pace finally lie on oar coolly wait for put on now call out coxswain boat shoot forward when within few yard duck apparently alive to danger dash oar into water dart ahead be too fast for two stroke will row down now then cry coxswain ah at tremendous pace boat flew forward over very place where second before duck have be where be by turn of hand have twisted round punt a fellow dug oar wildly into water tried to pull up there be calmly scuttling away in opposite direction laughing at in due time have swung round be after again wiser for lesson next time overhauled made approach in far more gingerly manner kept a little way a possible on boat determined not to lose time again by overshooting mark a long a must duck led down stream then when have caught made feint of swooping off to right manoeuvre coxswain promptly followed sooner be rudder round than rogue deftly brought punt sharp to left so once more escaped sort of thing went on for long time be beginning to think hunt be likely to prove monotonous affair after when coxswain suddenly called to down boat be ready adam then began gradually to dawn on coxswain after knew what be about there be rather deep bay up near top of course bounded by two prominent little headland into bay duck in moment of carelessness have ventured be chance not to be let slip few stroke brought cutter up to spot once there cunning coxswain carefully kept pointed exactly across bay duck seeing danger made dash to one corner hoping to avoid be too late be there before before must double make other corner boat have back watered to spot thus gradually hemmed in closer closer to shore amid cheer of friend until at last be evident to one punt be longer of use still let sidle close up to before abandoned craft then with sudden bound sprang overboard disappeared from view be use going after knew till must see where must rise so waited ready for plunge watching water where must probably turn up several second passed there be sign of be good diver knew be surely very long dive have accident happened to minute elapsed two yet never appeared in boat be aghast must have come to grief ah be people on bank laughing at must there be trick next instant coxswain called out laughing be hanging on to rudder over go adam at word slipped overboard gave chase now began exciting pursuit haigh though perfectly at home in water be not rapid swimmer in point of diving dodging have tremendous advantage over of pursuer moment got near just a be thinking to grab must disappear suddenly come up behind must dive towards right come up towards left must dodge round boat swim round in circle effort of mine must secure time be getting on be nearer having than before with dodge too never seemed to take eye off for instant above below water once a be giving chase suddenly dived next intimation have of whereabouts be sly pinch of big toe a came up behind be adding insult to injury so dashed round made at again dived time without waiting instant dived too must see distinctly under water scuttling away in downward direction just below shutting lip tight dug way down after ala under water be match for haigh felt irresistible temptation to gasp nose smarted water round head seemed like lead a quickly a possible turned hand up struck out for surface what age seemed before reached second half second longer must have shipped mouthful perhaps chestful of water reached surface at last once above water felt right again looked about anxiously for duck be still down below reckoned from direction in have dived that must not be able to go far to side therefore must rise close to probably exhausted if so have good chance at last of catching so waited watched place never came remembering own sensation how nearly have come to grief took sudden fright concluding must be in strait down below shouted to boat to come to place then dived groped about looked in direction saw sign of finally in terrible fright made once more for surface first thing be conscious of on getting head up be great shouting laughing then caught sight of abominable duck who have come up behind have be laughing while behind back while have be hunting for in far more serious way than need ever have done before must turn make towards time be shouted from bank so parkhurst swimming contest ended in lamentable though not disgraceful defeat of fiver chapter seven athletic sport at last saturday before summer holiday be invariably great day at outdoor exercise of previous ten month culminated then in annual athletic sport made regular field day for whole school boy who have people living within reasonable distance always did best to get over for day doctor old athlete generally invited own party of friend large number of spectator from parkhurst village neighbourhood be sure to put in appearance help to give importance to occasion athletic sport without spectator at least so boy thought must be tame affair be sure to get through day performance better for large muster of outsider on ground occasion be about to recall be specially interesting to a be first athletic meeting in small boy just entering teen ever figured be only down to run in one of race be three legged race yet believe there be not boy in school so excited at prospect of sport a be thought time must never come be in positive despair when on day before little white cloud ventured to appear in blue sky wet day so thought must have be a great calamity a losing whole circle of relative almost a bad a having favourite dog stolen fishing rod smashed made regular fool of myself in morning of eventful day by getting up first at two be then at three then at four four five time more to take observation out of window till at last bedfellow declared must stand no longer since be up must stay up ah be unsympathetic duffer knew nothing of rapture of winning three legged race well day be splendid one after little hot perhaps ground be in grand order host of people must be sure to turn up race yoke fellow went out quite early for final spin over course found one two of more diligent of schoolfellow taking similar advantage of lie abeds of course a be of opinion that three legged race be most important attractive of day contest paid very little heed to what others be doing sought out retired corner for ourselves where after tying inside leg together putting arm round one neck in most approved fashion set to tore along a fast a must practised start fall pick ups spurt know what else till felt that if after be to be beaten must not be fault with comfortable reflection loosed bond strolled back to breakfast here of course usual excitement prevailed one topic engrossed conversation sat between fellow who be in for junior yard who be down for hurdle opposite be hero whom one expected to win in throwing cricket ball next to new boy who have astonished one by calmly putting name down for mile race before have be two hour at parkhurst in such company may fancy meal be lively one a most of be in training very careful one first race be to be run at twelve thought great hardship that lower school be ordered to attend class on of day from nine to eleven now be older dawn on that be most wholesome regulation for have small chap be allowed to run riot morning must have be completely done up fit for nothing when race really began did not do much work be afraid at desk that morning master be not particularly strict for wonder one thing have to do be to keep seat restrain ardour be easy task eleven came at last off rushed to mystery of toilet what must athletic sport be like without flannel shirt trouser ribbon canvas shoe at rate believed in importance of accessory be not long in arraying accordingly must not help noticing however a sallied forth into field fine feather always make fine bird there be tom sampson for instance biggest duffer that ever thought must run step got up in top of fashion in bran new togs silk belt most gorgeous of scarlet sash across shoulder while hooker who be a certain a greenwich time to win quarter mile have on nothing old not very white cricket clothes sash at there be thing noticed about old hand behaved in laziest of manner sprawled on grass sat on bench appearing disinclined for slightest exertion while others le experienced took preliminary canter along track showed off over hurdle fine fellow doubt thought have reason to be sorry for waste of energy before day be out programme with what excitement seized mine glanced down there be number three legged race yard for boy under trotter walker pink white benson green adam slipshaw blue reader have ever seen name in print for first time then may imagine sensation thing now begin to look like business doctor have turned up party of lady visitor enclosure be fast filling up there be fair show of carriage behind big fellow in tall hat be old parkhurstians come to see young generation go through pace little knot of men talking together in middle of ground consists of starter judge umpire not few of too turn eye wistfully to tent over yonder where know be concealed reward of day combat in secret heart find wondering more than once how will sound to hear name adam slipshaw called upon to receive first prize for three legged race hark there go bell be really about to begin number junior yard for boy under name entered slipshaw over go off to have look at kid queer sight be of course ca of run abreast so be being started in heat six at time first lot be just

speech have fairly off little fellow go at a if life depended on mother big brother be looking on chum be shouting to along course winning post be not very far ahead on go not in level row one have taken lead others straggle behind in queer procession doe last long even junior yard must come to end at last winner run puffing into judge arm dozen yard ahead of next boy yard ahead of last other three heat follow then amid great excitement final heat be run off best man win for senior yard followed only three be entered of have band of confident admirer slipshaw be very sweet on jackson who be monitor of dormitory often gave leaving of muffin ranger be lighter built fellow seemed very active while bruce long leg looked not at pleasant for opponent starter have trouble with be wonder three looked anxious a turned face to for in yard race start be everything a poor long legged bruce found out for slipped on first spring never recovered lost ground between ranger jackson race be fine one to within twenty yard of home when favourite fat began to tell on though stuck gallantly to work must not prevail over nimble ranger who slipped past won easily by yard be damper for slipshaw who a in duty bound attended champion back to where have left coat so missed throwing of cricket ball be easily won by favourite though missed that event have notion of missing high jump promised to be best thing next to three legged race that day four fellow be in for of shute catherall be two of best jumper parkhurst have ever have be well known over school that in practice have jumped exactly foot inch who must win now two outsider be soon got rid of one at foot inch other at foot real interest of event began when shute catherall be left alone face to face with bar shute be tall fellow of slight make excellent spring catherall be short with bounce of india rubber ball in wonderful knack of tucking foot up under in jumping be pretty sight to watch advance half inch by half inch from foot to foot inch there seemed absolutely nothing to choose between appeared to clear bar so easily at foot inch shute missed first jump greatly to dismay of adherent who saw catherall clear with complete ease if be to miss second time must be out of must be positive tragedy so watched next jump with breathless anxiety stood looking at bar for second two a if doubting own chance then face cleared up sprang towards to delight rose beautifully cleared easily at foot inch missed first jump cleared at second trial now for tug of war have accomplished utmost have ever hitherto achieved remained to be seen whether excitement of occasion must assist to excel shute came to grief altogether at foot inch again to dismay catherall bounded over bar at first effort shute friend be in despair if hero have be nervous fellow might have be same be very cool fish instead of losing nerve sat down on grass tightened lace of shoe then slowly rose to foot faced task at moment forgot about three legged race gave whole heart up to issue of jump started to run at last slow at first gathering pace for final leap amid breathless silence sprang forward reached bar then then coolly pulled up walked back again looked bad better to pull up in time than spoil chance kept waiting age before be ready to start again at last turned for last effort must tell long before got to bar that time at rate be going to jump whether missed jump did to unbounded delight just cleared bar so narrowly that almost shook a skimmed over be end of high jump for though attempted foot inch accomplished contest be declared to be dead heat after several unimportant race followed need hardly describe number on list be getting near be beginning to feel queer hungry sort of sensation did exactly like however mile be to be run before turn came must give time to recover for race have many of looked with curious interest on account of new boy of whom have spoken being one of competitor in did look likely sort of fellow to win race certainly for be slightly bow legged thick set what seemed to much more ominous sign be not even arrayed in flannel in ordinary white shirt light cloth trouser however took place very confidently at starting post together with three rival wearing respectively black red yellow for colour start for mile race be not such headlong affair a for hundred yard consequently at word off there be comparatively little excitement among spectator yellow went to front almost immediately with red black close behind while new boy seemed to confirm unfavourable impression by keeping considerably in rear mile be divided into three lap round field at end of first position of four be same a at starting be soon evident yellow be not destined to continue lead for before half distance be accomplished red black who along have be neck neck be up to past by end of lap new boy have also overtaken now became considerably more interested in progress of new boy who suddenly occurred to seemed to be going very easily be more than must be said of red who be dropping little to rear of black big boy near said that fellow got wind of balloon immediately began to think be not far wrong for in third lap when two of others be slacking pace when third be only holding own new boy freshened up remarkably must watch crawl up gradually nearer nearer to red till shout proclaimed to be second in running black be still well ahead in short space left a big boy near said must hardly collar man see fellow be positively beginning to tear along seems fresher than when started look out black shout twenty voice very well to say look out black be used up certainly can not respond to tremendous spurt thirty yard from home new boy be up to man before winning post be reached be clear ten yard ahead bellow did said big boy look at chest then for first time noticed where secret of hero triumph lay horror next race be number slipshaw scuttle off a hard a can go to get ready how miserable felt then hated athletic sport detested three legged race a emerged from tent other two couple ambling along on respective three leg shout of laughter greeted appearance for one did see anything to laugh at just then adam said slipshaw a reached starting place take easy old man mind go over right said feeling very much inclined to go over at instant then that awful starter began little speech be ready asked not at inwardly ejaculated off cried almost before knew where be slipshaw be hopping along on three leg amid cheer of crowd steady said a stepped out rather too fast ala be last other two couple be pounding along ahead at wonderful pace steady growled slipshaw again a began to try to run nearly capsized may laugh reader be joke that three legged race others ahead of showed sign of flagging be going hard one couple close at heel of other full five yard behind be giving one despairing thought to pot prize in tent when great roar of laughter almost made forget foot to put forward what must be slipshaw be laughing too steady now said come along laughter continued looking before suddenly detected cause leading couple in moment of over confidence have attempted to go too fast have come on nose on path second couple too close behind have not have time to avoid obstacle have plunged headlong on to top of be right now slipshaw trotted triumphantly past prostrate heap after won prize may fancy be too excited to think of much else after except indeed hurdle race be most exciting won most cleverly by catherall who though came to grief at last hurdle be able to pick up in time to rush in win race by neck from new boy whom found to be almost a good at jumping a be at running then followed two mile race rather dull to watch with sport be at end need say how proudly slipshaw marched up arm in arm to receive prize for race consisted of bat for telescope for companion how new boy be cheered how shute catherall be applauded before left parkhurst be old hand at athletic sport think ever thought of so interesting a day on slipshaw with leg tied together came in first in three legged race chapter eight sneak sneak be ugly name not ugly enough believe for

generally wet with ink up to very tip of handle by way usually nibble when be nothing better to do who will describe desk be generally understood that schoolboy desk be receptacle for moderately miscellaneous assortment of article jack seemed like great pie into everything under sun be crammed stored up lid never shut if be to open content must astonish a much a content of wonderful pie in nursery rhyme astonished king when lifted crust there be book paper hook ball worm stale sandwich photograph toffee bird egg key money knife cherry stone silkworm marble pencil handkerchief tart gum sleeve link walnut shell one venturesome enough to take header through might succeed in reaching layer of last year apple peel below in penetrating to crumb heap in bottom corner few there be who possessed amount of boldness of course jack have notion of what worldly good consisted have way of shying thing into desk forgetting only when became so full that lid stood nearly wide open did apprehend necessity of clear out if there be ever anything more awful to behold than jack desk be one of clear out event generally got wind when be about to happen never failed to create sensation in school who have right took care to be present at ceremony do believe if jack have have sense to issue reserved seat ticket might have made nice thing out of at rate made nice thing out of desk quite indifferent to presence laughter began leisurely to take out content spread in glorious array upon floor with view a be kind enough to explain to one who asked to sort up book paper went in pile by loose paper be thrust inside cover of book book without cover be jammed into cover without book seemed likely to fit then pen pencil be put into pencil case if happened to be too long be broken to required shortness being satisfactorily done jack used next to turn attention to miscellaneous article of food of found possessed sandwich if not more than week old either ate generously offered to of toffee put into pocket tart if jam be not already dried up put aside for private consumption hereafter shell stone peel etcetera heaped up in one place on floor trusted to providence to dispose of fish hook bait bird egg be not broken silkworm photograph pencil knife other article of use ornament sorted carefully then put back into desk by time must occur to have be long enough over business so shovelled book paper in anyhow anything else happened still to be left out then finding that lid must shut within inch sighed with relief of man who have well discharged painful duty how be to be expected jack must ever find anything wanted sometimes must sit grubbing in desk among book to find certain exercise paper for hour finally when everything be upside down must remember have in waistcoat pocket from recess of produced crumpled greasy almost illegible on sunday always have hunt for glove at end of term when undertook own packing generally first of contrived to pack up key in very bottom of trunk so have to take everything out before must get then when with aid of dozen of sitting on top of unfortunate receptacle to cram down jumble of thing inside to shutting point have succeeded in triumphantly turning lock be wonder if have not to open unpack again to find strap a to dress can safely say that though jack always have good clothes always looked much le respectable than other boy whose parent must not afford anything common material not only did lose button drop grease over coat trouser never folded brushed have mended in time a tidy boy must have done be quite ashamed to be seen walking with sometimes looked so disreputable reproof persuasion must induce to take more pain about appearance place for everything everything in place be lesson jack must not learn result be constant incalculable trouble if people must only realise amount of time lost by untidiness think must regard fault with positive horror why jack sloven at very mildest computation must have lost hour day hour day at end of year make clear working fortnight to bad so that in twenty five year if go on a have begun will have one year of will take time to give account not only doe untidiness waste time render person who fall into disreputable member of society seriously endangers success in life jack sloven be naturally clever fellow when must find book made good use of none of must come up to in translation have knack of always understanding what read if have not be for wretched habit might have got prize at school still higher honour in after life a be always came to grief note have made on work be never to be found spent more time in collecting material than have to spare for using most of work have to be scrambled through at last moment be accordingly imperfect if jack go to business have very poor chance of getting on for untidiness business will no more go together than oil water few thing be more against man in business than untidiness people fight shy of if dress be untidy letter slovenly habit unpunctual account confused will be regarded a man not reliable not to be trusted people will refuse to transact with if have house of own will never succeed in keeping servant long for so say have quite enough to do without unnecessary work in fact see how jack be to get on at unless mend way be possible for untidy boy to become tidy try if at first succeed try again be sure to succeed if stick to aim at apple pie order everything in lavender never to be touched sort of thing be a bad a boy who once possessed desk must never use for fear of marking blotting paper breaking paper band round envelope if can get into way of always putting book read back into place on shelf paper want where will be certain to find again if encourage jealousy of rubbish horror of dirt if take to heart proverb quoted just now place for everything everything in place will be a tidy a ever need be jack sloven trouble misfortune will never be yours chapter

often have be boxed solitary confinement imposition corner head master study have lost horror for so often have have to endure sam scamp of school be without exception unluckiest fellow ever came across be practice in case of ordinary offence for master of lower form to deal out own retribution special case be always reserved for higher court head master study hither culprit be conducted in awful state impeached here heard judgment pronounced felt sentence executed be awful tribunal head master study hope abandon ye who enter here be motto if not written at least clearly implied over door mere mention of place be enough to make one flesh creep yet somehow other sam scamp be always finding there must have abandoned hope once week at least during school life before left school be certain must have worn that awful carpet threadbare for offence be special offence when dozen boy have spent one afternoon in throwing stone over certain wall stone broke doctor conservatory window be a might be expected sam on occasion of memorable battle of dormitory famous fight in fifteen boy of ward dormitory arrayed in nightgown armed with bolster engaged at dead of night in mortal combat with twenty boy of johnson dormitory for possession of certain new boy who have arrived that day with trunk full of cake when monitor appeared on scene one boy one only be captured be sam when dozen fellow have be copying off one exercise book from discovery be made must be sure to be sam when in temporary absence of master schoolroom became transformed into bear garden a sometimes will if suddenly door be to open figure must inevitably fall on master eye must be that of sam dancing hornpipe in middle of floor shouting at top of voice covered from head to foot with dust have kicked up on such occasion be led off to doctor study happened to be there once when be brought up so have opportunity of witnessing scene if new to must have be very familiar to unfortunate schoolfellow by way reason be in doctor study be merely to return book have lent mind reader what here again samuel said doctor recognising too well known visitor be very sorry sir say sam humbly ca make out how be try know do indeed somehow be always in trouble be reply doctor what be about time mr wardlaw can tell sir begin sam eagerly be silent sir well mr wardlaw boy have be very disrespectful sir when came into class room morning opened desk found contained guinea pig two white mouse who have here unlucky sam after desperate effort in course of have almost choked with handkerchief burst into laugh what do mean sir thunder doctor oh sir must help really must must rather have choked than do be just like look so distressed humble that doctor turn from invite mr wardlaw to resume impeachment have only to say that boy on being charged with deed confessed to having done oh yes sir be right did be very sorry somehow ca make out how be be so bad say sam with air of one suffering from strain of constant anxiety talk nonsense sir say doctor sternly can make out a well a can will hold out hand sir say sam who by time have good idea of routine of practice pursued in such interview say doctor leave here mr wardlaw add for first time remembering be present can go so departed leaving sam shivering shaking in middle of carpet be hour before rejoined schoolfellow time hand be not sore somehow managed to avoid getting into scrape for good deal longer than usual there be resisting inevitable did in due time find in row then suddenly vanished from midst for have be expelled now with regard to sam boy like be of course only natural to hold up a example to others boy can be scamp not suffer for way other a to saying be one misfortune rather than one fault that be so that be a ridiculous a to say when choose to walk north be misfortune be not walking south in excuse for sam must say that be by mean worst boy in school though did get into most row be finally expelled in disgrace if have be deceitful selfish must probably have escaped oftener than did never denied fault told tale of others who knew generally found good natured jovial looked upon a far more desperate character than ourselves did once remember solemnly charged to take warning by evil fate still see sam sinned once too often even though crime be never more serious than putting guinea pig into master desk yet sort of conduct time after time be not to be tolerated in school example set by mischievous boy to fellow be not good if scrape be winked at always time will come when others will be encouraged to follow in step behave badly too sam doubt deserved punishment got because one bad boy who be punished be worse than dozen bad boy who get off doe not make out good boy boy more hardly treated than merited scapegrace be boy who being mischievously inclined be constantly transgressing line between right wrong up to certain point boy of good spirit fond of joke be a jolly boy a one must desire when good spirit break bound of order joke interfere with necessary authority then be time for to be reminded nothing ought to be carried too far in world one last word about scapegrace like sam get into head that be destined to get into scrape that therefore be use trying to keep out of must be proof of nothing silliness ca tell how be sam stone always broke window why master eye always fell on when there be row going on can tell that if sam have thrown stone window must not have be broken that if have behaved well when master eye be turned away must not have cut poor figure when door be opened boy make boast of number of scrape have be in fondly imagine hero in proportion to number of time have be flogged well if plea to think so by mean let indulge fancy can at least promise nobody else think so chapter fourteen unoriginal boy take one long time to discover that there be something wanting in character of ebenezer ditto take longer time still to make out exactly what that something be be ordinary looking ordinarily behaved boy there be nothing amiss with cut of coat be extra grand extra shabby there be nothing queer about voice doe stammer doe squeak there be nothing remarkable about conversation action be not dunce though be not clever be not scamp though be not goody never offends one though never becomes great friend with one be make not take to ebenezer why be on whole rather despise feel annoyed when in society for be truth much care about well answer to question may be a have said not very readily discovered if watch master ditto carefully make up mind will get at bottom of mystery will find that be very ordinary manner about to object fellow be dull be unoriginal feel sometimes a if must give sovereign to see ebenezer stand on head by way of variety annoys when sits there with eye on smiling when smile frowning when frown talking about weather when talk about weather when whistle nancy lee whistling everlasting grandfather clock be relief by way even to hear whistle different tune for be about only thing in doe take independent course if truth be known must come out only know one tune be reason have not originality enough in to learn second be annoying thing to be copied imitated by one most of by fellow one own age can understand little child imitating father enjoy seeing what caper sometimes cut in attempt there be nothing interesting amusing in way ebenezer go on when for instance by sudden inspiration of genius take into head to shy slice of apple across room at jack sleepy just while be in act of yawning with mouth open wide enough to let wheelbarrow down be not pleasant that immediately afterwards one at side must hurl walnut at same person wound seriously in eye besides making row take away from fun of achievement make whole affair more than joke being asked let suppose to name favourite hero in fiction be careful to select somewhat out of way name reply sidney carton be rather pleased to think have thereby not only named one whom one else be likely to hit upon also have delicately let master see have lately read very good book be rather vexing when ebenezer reply to same question sidney carton in knowing sort of manner although be positive have never read tale of two city doe even know that dickens be author of course distinction in matter have gone if answer be judged best only get credit deserve to take one more example supposing one day being utterly sick of ebenezer society longing to get little time by decline tempting offer of cricket match in know also be likely to play mean to read afternoon say well be too bad when next moment hear that wretched ebenezer saying in answer to same invitation very sorry mean to read afternoon then have come sit down on bench beside with book worst of be know if now change mind go in for match after will change mind do same most aggravating thing about unoriginal fellow be that can not well get in rage with for if find fault with find fault with yourselves what young as be not to play in match say to ebenezer hardly able to contain why be playing in reply oh have particular reading want to do say so have reply can not say have business to read when cricket be going on can say what do mean by clearly if do be not person to say will not doubt if ebenezer know to what extent carry trick of be so natural for to do a see others do that fails to see how

never come out not word added a bilk once more showed sign of breaking silence wait till speaks again long pause then long recital in gibberish by old woman broken by same coughing groaning a before then man said stand up hold hand above head bilk obeyed want to know how to escape peril said man bilk with hand still up nodded to night at nine o'clock will hear bell again bilk nodded gipsy knowing that will go up to small room with chair bed in undress pause nod from astonished bilk will put on long white robe coming down to ankle at past nine place will be dark a black a pitch bilk shuddered

magnus bilk leg of scared alexander must scarcely uphold a obeyed last order sped trembling towards school gipsy sat motionless a footstep echoed down lane died slowly away into silence then rose to go also a did so other footstep suddenly sounded approaching with alacrity astonishing in person of advanced age darted back to place of retreat too late footstep came on quickly followed to very hiding place next moment light of two bullseyes turned full upon aged couple be in hand of police chapter thirty fourchapter two de prudhom did not often allow luxury of evening out during term time on particular evening be pledged to fulfil long standing engagement with old crony fellow bachelor residing about two mile from school by mysterious mean worthy dominie intention have oozed out bilk

have be more favourable for carrying out intricate series of instruction laid down by gipsy for making of fortune with reflection consoled somewhat a ran back to school doctor have already started for evening dissipation if dining with professor hammerhead must be thus described eccentric old gentleman combined in one avocation of bachelor man of science justice of peace rarely took walk abroad preferring solitude of library occasional company of old comrade with whom to talk over old time unburden mind of scientific problem encumbered on present occasion have lit upon congenial spirit in worthy dr prudhom two spent very snug evening together over dessert raking up memory of good old day when lived on same staircase at brasenose plunging deep into abstruse question of natural physical science even sherry must not prevent from being dry professor present craze be what be commonly termed ethnology anything connected with history vicissitude of primitive race of mankind excited enthusiasm be never tired of inquiring into language manner custom dress ceremony movement generally of various branch of human family of whom most obscure be sure to be in eye most interesting be only natural therefore that when dr prudhom made casual reference to recent incursion of gipsy host must seize occasion to expatiate on history of extraordinary race tracing from egyptian downwards waxing eloquent on tribal instinct civilisation even persecution must eradicate domesticate fact be said with chuckle have to thank that be allowed here so long police came to end of first week said be nuisance told police when wanted opinion 'd ask end of second week police came again said farmyard round have be robbed said must inquire into time be making glorious observation boy note book full

library closely followed by scarcely le eager dominie at far end of dimly lighted room stood constable on side of aged couple of vagabond old man be arrayed in long coat nearly reached ground leaving only glimpse of stained weather beaten pair of pantaloon striped parti coloured stocking beneath old woman wore shawl gipsy fashion over head reaching to foot be shod in unusually large heavy hob nailed face hand of be black with dirt bronzed with heat a stood there trembling in grasp of law with chattering teeth tottering knee looked veritable picture of outcast humanity prudhom boy whispered magistrate to guest with most unjudicial nudge to emphasise remark be old one be ever such luck knowing one too guess will try to trick with gammon see now constable what have got here for first time elderly couple lifted head looked towards bench a did so uttered incoherent ejaculation attempted to spring forward active intelligent servant of law checked by vigorous grip of arm cry silence in most majestic menacing tone reduced at last to order see that whispered professor to doctor most characteristic simulation be of very essence of race oh be beautiful did catch what said just then be

heedless of threatening gesture cried out in shrill trembling voice please sir please doctor be two of boy doctor who have be intently looking out for curved nostril alluded to by host started a if have be shot eh what gasped what be heard why said professor in ecstasy be just a told dissimulation be second nature to tribe be too big for old lady say other rogue be child doctor there be notion for old bachelor like too be indeed cried old man echoing shrill tone of helpmeet be morgan dr prudhom be dell indeed be speaking truth only did there see once more observed delighted professor be very thing knew must happen know be schoolmaster want to believe oh be really most interesting doctor seemed to find interesting changed colour several time looked hard at two reprobate before weather dust beaten countenance conveyed information to voice certainly did startle with something like familiar sound might not be part of deep dissimulation dwelt upon with so much emphasis by learned friend must have missed for twenty pound said magistrate beaming on guest theory be confirmed to letter only did for lark sir be awfully sorry cried old man really be be dell yes sir cried old lady

to bewildered spectator in mud stained jersey knickerbockers of holmhurst football club draw veil over explanation lecture appeal followed a also forbear to dwell upon consternation of man of science cruel disorganisation of cherished theory be only fair to say that professor bore malice when once discovered how matter stood used magisterial influence with doctor to procure at rate mitigated punishment for culprit delinquent be ordered off to lavatory left there with can of hot water cube of soap to remove wrinkle sunburn from crestfallen countenance done humbly presented in library where doctor looking very stern stood already accoutred for journey home leave taking between two old gentleman be subdued solemn then in grim silence dr prudhom stalked forth into night followed at respectful distance by trembling disciple till that moment thought of bilk have never once crossed mind of agitated amateur gipsy flashed across now a doctor strode straight for cross road what if miserable alexander magnus must have swallowed absurd bait laid for be in act of making fortune on very spot be to pas held hurried consultation in whisper on terrible possibility will be expelled if come out groaned dell yes may a well tell at once said morgan may not be there know perhaps 'd better wait see in case so went on in doctor wake nearer nearer to fatal cross road at step suddenly a came within hundred yard of signpost doctor stood still uttered exclamation meaning of be able to guess only too readily straining eye in direction indicated must discern white shadowy form hovering in road before what be exclaimed doctor in whisper dell be conscious of secret nudge a morgan gasped oh look like ghost oh doctor two boy clung wildly to doctor arm trembling gasping with well feigned terror dr prudhom trembled too agitation be unfeigned three stood still breathless watched dim figure a hovered across path then vanished into darkness what can be said doctor bracing up with effort preparing to walk on oh please sir cried boy go on do let turn back oh dear oh dear foolish boy said doctor have sense enough to know that such thing a ah there be again yes there be again faint beam of moon broke through cloud lit up white figure once more where stood close to sign post a watched seemed to grow rising higher higher till head nearly touched cross bar then suddenly with groan seemed to drop into earth be darkness once more boy clung one on side to doctor who trembled hardly le than one dared move speak utter sound again moon sent forth beam a figure once more appeared slowly rose higher higher for moment seemed a if must soar into air again with dull crash descended vanished boy said doctor hoarsely confess be puzzled wonder said dell if ever dare go see what be say m m organ must g g go with for d d doctor sake oh dell be afraid yes will try brave boy said doctor never taking eye off spot where ghost last vanished two boy stole forward on tiptoe holding one arm then suddenly broke into rush straight for sign post there be loud shriek a white figure rose up to meet bilk idiot cut back for life here be doctor be only having lark with do cut stick slip in quietly will be right look alive be three done for ill starred bilk needed further invitation started to run a fast a long leg must carry night gown flapping in evening breeze two persecutor following with cry of booh scat shoo other formula for exorcising evil spirit after hundred yard so two hero gave up chase returned to slowly reviving doctor come along sir said dell there be nothing there vanished a soon a got to let be quick sir in case come back remainder of walk home that evening need hardly observe be brisk be not so brisk a same journey accomplished by alexander magnus bilk who have reached school full quarter of hour before pursuer be safe between blanket by time that peeped into room on way to bed whispered consolingly be up with duke daughter now old man doctor may have have dim suspicion of real state of affair if so gave sign boy happy in escape from what might have proved grave matter be content to forego further practical joke of kind for rest of session chapter thirty five night in dreadnought chapter stowaway be spending winter of young brother jack with grandfather at kingstairs quiet little seaside village not hundred mile from nore be not quite clear to day a to why be there whether be sent for treat for punishment whether be sent to take care of jack jack be sent to take care of ca remember that have committed unusually heinous offence at home indeed since attempt week two previously to emulate history by smothering twin after manner of prince in tower have be particularly quiet not to say dull at home for little accident of squib went off in night nursery in middle of night counted for nothing nobody being hurt only head nurse aunt having hysteric so that when day after have broken up for holiday father told be going to spend christmas at grandfather there be nothing in past conduct to suggest that step be to be regarded in light of punishment same be great treat at least must have be far more of treat to spend christmas at home carry out long cherished design of digging at bottom of garden till reached fire in middle of earth operation reckoned must occupy at least week to say nothing of usual christmas party did not see fun of missing visit to tower monument always seemed to be part of christmas holiday however a be settled for everybody seemed to think great treat for further a jack have boat wanted sailing yielded to general wish reminding everybody that present must be sent down in trunk day two before th took leave repaired to kingstairs father came with just to see settled down then returned to town be not till after have gone that began to think rather slow to be left alone down there with only grandfather jack boat for company grandfather be very old always used to put down at round hundred year believe be only seventy five really however be not a young a be being rather infirm subject to rheumatism preferred staying indoors near fire to coming with over rock sailing jack boat in mid december little knew pleasure missed of course happily did not insist on staying indoors with consequence be managed to do pretty much a liked indeed rather more so than one else interested in welfare supposed kingstairs a one who have be there know be not very exciting place at best of time in summer however be pleasant enough retreat where family party come down from town for week so spend day boating in pretty bay else basking on sand under chalk cliff where child construct fearful wonderful pit castle arm chair for mother to sit in canal pond in to sail craft in fine weather nothing be so enjoyable a day on rock hunting for crab groping for pungars else strolling about on jetty to watch packet boat go out to meet steamer see lugger coming in after week fishing cruise in german ocean be pleasant enough kingstairs in july kingstairs in december be two different place lodging house be desolate deserted boat be drawn high dry up on jetty bathing machine stood dismally in field behind town not soul sat in arm chair on sand from morning to night one walked along cliff except coastguardsman london steamer have given up running one be to be seen on jetty occasional sailor pipe in mouth hand in pocket looking picture of dismalness may fancy jack under depressing circumstance soon got tired of sailing boat when one day after have waited week for water to calm down started with sail crowded before gale of wind from jetty step watched heel over on to one side next moment disappear under foam of great wave nearly carried off foot where stood decided there be not much fun to be have out of kingstairs in december be often so rough stormy that be impossible to get to end of jetty on occasion be well enough pleased to take shelter in look out big room over net house reached by ladder where there be generally fire burning in sailor boatman of place always congregated when have nothing else to do struck up acquaintance with one two of rough tar who seeing perhaps that be in rather dismal way else glad of anything in way of variety used to invite up to warm at fire very soon got to feel at home in look out found plenty of entertainment in yarn song with men whiled away time great deal of what heard now remember be not very improving song many of be coarse a for yarn though swallowed at time fancy be spun mostly out of fancy of narrator wonderful story be of shipwreck battle peril over got so excited that lay awake at night shuddered else dreamed about be even worse one man remember told how fought with shark under water in south sea stabbed with knife in right hand just a monster teeth be closing on other arm to make story more vivid bared great shaggy arm showed ugly white scar among tattoo mark above elbow man told how have stood beside nelson on victory just a admiral received death wound never occurred to to wonder how man of not more than thirty five must have be present at famous battle took place fifty year ago yarn pleased most be one about wreck of wolf king when kingstairs lifeboat dreadnought put out in tremendous gale reached just a be going down rescued sixteen of crew story called for over over again till knew by heart many time a lay awake at night heard wind whistling round house wondered if be storm like when wolf king went down whether ship must be getting on to sand to night be christmas eve wild blustering night have be blowing up hard for several day now be used to howling of wind roar of wave on beach have gone to bed tired excited for promised hamper have arrived that afternoon have be unpacking what wonderful hamper be turkey to begin with swiss family robinson tool box telescope pair of home made sock for grandfather be fain to take possession of treasure at once old gentleman forbade made put back in hamper wait till morning so went to bed early hoping thereby suppose to hasten morning instead of that hour dragged past a though night must never go heard nine o'clock strike ten eleven be in humour for sleeping told one story knew finishing up of course with wreck of wolf king then lay for long time listening to storm outside seemed to get wilder wilder a night dragged on tide have be only just turned when went to bed sounded now close under house thunder of great wave a broke on sand seemed to make very earth vibrate surely must have be night like when wolf king tom what be awake yes be storm be there be silence for time supposed jack have dozed off began again presently tom what have better go on jetty why there might be wreck know so there might next moment be out of bed dressing quietly need not have minded about noise for roar of storm outside must have prevented one from hearing sound twenty time louder than made a crept into clothes pulled on boot ready jack yes mind how go down crept downstairs past grandfather room where light be burning down into hall through passage to back door pulled bolt opened carefully fortunately be on sheltered side of house have be front blast must have rushed in must certainly have discovered retreat stepped cautiously out closed door behind be surprised to find how still seemed at first compared with what have imagined next moment a got past back of house came suddenly into full force of wind knew that storm be even fiercer than supposed at first must barely stand a with head down knee bent struggled forward got more used to in little while once in harbour street be again in shelter street be empty one saw a glided down towards jetty heard church clock strike half past eleven chime being swept past on wind a turned out of harbour street on to jetty force of gale once more staggered have almost to crawl forward there be light cheery glow of fire in look out knew there must be plenty of sailor there somehow at time of night did not care to be discovered even by friend sailor so kept on holding on to chain towards where red light burned at jetty head be too excited to be afraid one of strange spirit of adventure have seized upon make boy ready for anything thought of standing alone at midnight at pier head in storm like did not even dismay before be half way along found that be not easy thing imagined huge wave struck jetty behind wall under crept next moment deluge of spray foam shot up fell drenching to skin almost before knew what have happened followed turned instinctively towards look out a did so fourth wave huger than rest swept jetty from end to end for chain on to clung must have be washed off only chance be to run for nearest shelter be lee of tarpaulin covered lifeboat lay up on stock out of reach of spray seeming to to offer a much protection ashore a must do afloat dozen staggering step brought to even in short space wave have drenched be thankful to creep under friendly shelter once there wondered for first time how be ever to get back heart be beginning to fail at last be cold shivering wet through now rain came in gust to add to misery must get inside said jack with chattering teeth a spoke shower of salt spray leapt over boat deluged yes why not get inside under tarpaulin where must shelter at once from cold wet wind nobody must see if one came must jump out presently perhaps storm might quiet down must get back to bed jack have already clambered up side lifted corner of tarpaulin followed in minute be snugly stowed away in almost a good shelter a if have never left bedroom then sat listened drowsily to wind raging round heard spray falling with heavy thud on tarpaulin above must be past twelve jack said merry christmas to jack be fast asleep chapter ii rescue how long jack have lain there curled up under bow of dreadnought stormy christmas morning never knew for like have succumbed to drowsy influence of cold wet fallen asleep remember just before dropping off thinking storm must be increasing rather than otherwise vaguely wondering whether wind must possibly capsize boat up here in top of runner however sleepiness be evidently greater than fear on point dropped off leaving question to decide next thing be conscious of be strange noise overhead sudden dash of water on to floor of boat just beside then before must rub eye recollect where be dreadnought seemed suddenly alive with people shouting cheering while loud bell at pierhead close by mingled harsh voice with roar of storm stand by cut away there shouted hoarse voice from boat then flashed across dreadnought be putting out in fearful storm to wreck horror jack be in wait say wait jack be here let out cried in noise darkness confusion not even nearest man noticed a sprang up with terrified shout shook jack wildly shouted again trying at same time to make way to stern of boat before have crossed first bench before two men seated there with oar up ready for launch perceived there be cheer from jetty great boat gave little jolt then began to slide slowly at first gaining speed a went on knew be off that short swift descent seemed to like eternity light on jetty went out cheer be drowned rough hand caught where stood half across bench drove back down beside jack who be yet too dazed to stir next instant with rush roar plunged into tempest be blackness seemed to a if first plunge be to be last for gallant boat in bow under crouched clinging for dear life to ring on floor be completely submerged water rushed over around nearly stunning with violence deafening with noise presently rose suddenly boat shot up till seemed to stand on end so that where sat must see inch of from stem to stern dim outline of kingstairs jetty behind at same moment ten oar dropped into rowlock coxswain with sou ' wester pulled down tight on head hand raised to screen eye from sleet shouted something boat soared wildly up wave once again be darkness for how brave boat ever got through first half mile of surf be mystery to wave seemed a though must pitch like plaything across to next now shot up till looked down on coxswain below a from top of mast next instant looked up at till seemed marvel how held to place did not drop on to while men tugged doggedly at oar heeding wave broke over flooded boat surf often nearly knocked oar from hand what of jack crouched there close together clutching fast at friendly ring looking out in mute terror on to fearful scene too stupefied to speak move almost to think have one seen have hand drove down at launch saved from danger by accident began to think must be so when man nearest whom even in cork jacket sou ' wester recognised a hero of shark story in look out turned towards be not one of rower have be busily drawing in coiling line close beside during first terrific plunge of boat after have taken water now turned hurriedly to where sat without word seized roughly by arm drew to foot made sure be to be cast overboard like jonah into fearful sea all did be to throw cork jacket round then thrust down again to old place just a great wave broke over prow seemed almost to fill boat a soon a have passed water swirled out from boat seized jack equipped in same way then throwing tarpaulin coat over left to ourselves while mounted watch in bow kept look out ahead cork jacket if of other use helped to warm bit a also did coat thankful for comfort however small settled down to see end of adventure hope for best settled down did say how must one settle down in open boat on sea like with wave breaking over head half drowning moment finding boat standing nearly perpendicular on stem stern how rower kept seat still more held on to oar pulled through wave can still scarcely imagine for friendly ring on to jack held like grim death be certain must have be pitched out of boat at first lurch dreadnought ploughed on not word be spoken save occasional shout between coxswain friend in bow a to course must see by receding light of kingstairs came into sight time mounted to top of wave that be not taking straight course out bearing north right in teeth of wind knew enough of boat remember to wonder with shudder must happen if

catastrophe unhappy tubbs having be shunted crashford took place with bowler kept boat head steady till gayford hauled up sail eliza began of own accord to fly through water at sight of majestic sail swelling with wind still more on perceiving decided improvement in pitching of boat spirit of party rose again braintree actually began to hum wule bwitannia cliff of raveling loomed dimly out behind

crashford here go for first on shore out of way tubby hurrah for new swishford leapt on shore half capsizing boat a did so bowler found authority unequal to task of controlling enthusiasm of fellow emigrant have to let land a pleased while gayford grimly held boat alongside when tubbs be ashore patience must hold out no longer followed general rush bowler cry out to tubbs a sprang ashore see make fast tubbs land grub will will be back directly off scampered with rest to join in ceremony of capturing island now tubbs be not best man who must have be chosen to execute so important trust a laid upon bowler have be rather le excited at moment must have thought twice before left to perform in first place tubbs must find place to tie boat up to a long a sat in boat held on to rock be

help poor tubbs be hard line to see rest of party scrambling triumphantly up hill find left here like sort of animated anchor happy thought how came never to have thought of anchor before there be in bottom of boat must be simplest thing to jump ashore with fix somewhere in rock where must hold sooner be brilliant project conceived than be executed seizing anchor in hand tubbs stepped gaily ashore triumphantly wedged one tooth of into crevice of rock where must hold firm enough to keep man of war in place watched with pleasant smile eliza a drifted slowly out on rope enjoying prospect of seeing presently tug at anchor then give up attempt to get free resign to fate be longer coil of rope than have imagined boat be twenty yard away at least still paying out by way where be rope with cry of horror tubbs sprang to anchor began hauling in rope came in gaily not eliza danced merrily cut to sea in straight line for north pole with six brown paper parcel on board leaving poor custodian to console a best must with loose end of rope have never be fastened to ring what be to do after taking few minute to collect idea by time boat be hundred yard on solitary voyage occurred to have better inform others of what have happened so started in rather low state of mind in pursuit of be long time before came upon perched in group on highest point of island singing rule britannia in lusty chorus sent scared seagull flying to right left hullo tubby old man here be got grub safe ashore not be bagging of peach eh have be long enough tubbs replied by pointing mysteriously to little speck out at sea what be row what be asked gayford must guess what little thing be said tubbs what be ca speak well if must know be boat anchor be tied know boat great booby cried one springing to foot

main force tell be only chance cried bowler let go do hear wo old man must make best of will be more like new swishford than ever now last argument have more effect with bowler than other slowly put on coat vote souse that idiot tubbs till be black in face said crashford viciously what be use of asked bowler fact be fellow said be regularly in for now sooner make up mind what will do better let make waft said braintree mindful of wobinson cwusoe where be wood asked wallas let hoist signal anyhow said wester one to see if do said wallas let have grub said crashford last suggestion met with general approval have have breakfast to speak of after voyage excitement hunger be beginning to assert one brown paper parcel rescued from eliza be forthwith handed in pronounced common property happened to be parcel bearing tubbs name contained besides seventh part of provision tubbs voluntary contribution to general store namely crib to sallust guide to environs of tunbridge well be proposed seconded must be handed over to owner a share of good thing contained in parcel bowler gayford interfered on behalf after having be reprimanded with severity took away appetite be allowed to partake of portion of potted shrimp potted peach together with small slice of cake bowler groaned to see what hole even frugal repast made in provision consulted gayford in undertone on possibility of slaying seagull merit of raw poultry generally rather dolefully provision be packed up deposited in ledge in rock while party proceeded to wander about island in search of board lodging charm of long stork island have fallen off greatly in short interval sea fog be beginning to wrap round hide mainland from view seemed like wet blanket on spirit person of adventurer after much dreary search hollow be found on hill side by fastening together three four ulster might be roofed over sufficiently well to keep out rain cold if required a to food island provided absolutely nothing except chance of raw poultry already mentioned few shell fish on rock day wore on fog turned to drizzle drizzle to rain held out against a long a must have to take shelter at last herd together in extemporised cabin here painful discussion ensued hope be satisfied now growled wallas be mess enough to please even bowler what do mean retorted gayford lot have done for public good there be plenty of seagull about without to croak too wish umbwellah have gone out to sea observed braintree shivering by way said crashford did see lying on rock will just run see off started when will ever get away asked wester may get starved here be sure to see find out in day two said bowler day two exclaimed wallas do really mean have got to stay here without food shelter day two wish new swishford be in middle of sea so be dryly observed bowler fine fool have made of with humbug child play growled other want much making retorted bowler if want to talk more can talk to one else accepted invitation growled round till everybody be sick of after long absence crashford returned without umbrella must find said sitting down be gone found peach blackguard said bowler springing up pointing to juicy remains still clinging to delinquent coat in righteous indignation dealt traitor blow sent out of tent fight ensued there then between bowler crashford unhappily to disadvantage of former who be match for practised hand opposed to company interposed after few round none too soon for damaged though still lion hearted bowler crashford profited nothing by victory for be decided unanimously to exclude from tent till chose to apologise for treachery meanwhile remains of slender provision be taken into safe custody out of reach day wore on rain fell heavier heavier upon ulster roof over head wind whistled drearily above mainland be entirely lost to sight a far a be concerned might be in real new swishford thousand mile from nearest land huddled together silently one caring much to speak only braintree broke monotony by shivering audibly footstep of crashford a paced up down outside to keep warm added dreary variety to silence afternoon drew on at last bowler said better let beggar in have better turn out see what be to be done said gayford will only come to grief here grub wo hold out for meal then will be something more than joke come on then fellow said bowler roof be hauled down party turned dismally out once more to seek fortune chapter iv consolation hero who in anticipation have never calculated on anything fine weather unlimited ration congenial occupation began to entertain serious doubt a to joy of founding empire a trailed dreadily along in rain after bowler gayford weaker of party have spirit to suggest anything to question what leader suggested so followed doggedly where be led neither knowing caring whither with bowler gayford be otherwise felt rather ashamed of for having lost head earlier in day resolved now to atone for in only way must put brave face on situation tried to impart courage to follower tell what said bowler cheerily a seven stood again on rock at water edge want good hour of dark least thing can do be to spend daylight in looking for proper place of shelter something to eat if can find suppose tubbs braintree start to walk round way gayford take rest round other way if of find anything will stop till other party come up have got whistle so will be sure to hear one must do harm might do good so party tacitly fell in with suggestion divided accordingly even crashford be wise enough to feel must gain nothing by sulking returned to allegiance without demur ca have something to eat before start said wallas dear fellow replied gayford wish must then will have nothing left for to morrow strange to say wallas disputed matter further turned with companion to start on tour of discovery bowler kept whistling cheerily gayford shouted in reply till two party be out of earshot then walked on in silence eagerly scanning sea shore in search of hope for bowler party there seemed very little prospect of anything turning up for way lay across bare ledge of rock with perhaps pool to wade little cape to scramble across never sign of food shelter braintree did indeed announce that in one place saw cwab disappear into hole chance of satisfaction from source be too remote to be pursued how longed to be back under roof of old swishford to hear cheery bell summoning boy to tea how gratefully now must have welcomed wholesome plenty of often abused meal ala there be cup of tea egg bread butter going on long stork of course said bowler must never be quite stuck up for grub a long a there be seaweed about if rain go on like there will be plenty of water too be wight there said braintree seaweed wain water be warthah spare diet anyhow said bowler have got enough of shrimp peach left for good breakfast to morrow be one comfort trudged on in glorious prospect for hour toiled along rocky shore until daylight almost suddenly vanished gloom of damp november night fell upon be use of exploring further even bowler lost heart a stumbled about in dusk heard braintree shivering chattering with cold beside tubbs scarcely suppressed whimper of misery better get back to rest a soon a can said taking out whistle blowing again listened answer came only shriek of gull steady splash of rain on rock never mind ca be long before get round to said bowler perhaps have found place know for half hour toiled on bowler blowing whistle few minute always without response where can be be almost round at place started from surely said bowler hullo look out there have reached sudden break in coast about twenty yard across with rock on side dropped almost precipitously into water forming serious bar to further progress must scramble down wade swim across else turn inland make long detour round head of chasm bowler made careful inspection of rock then said think must do do say if went round might miss others wight said braintree blowing hand be game so tubbs tubbs said nothing stood by miserably ready to follow bowler lead will go down first said latter mind how come rock be slippery lowered cautiously down steep rock finding just enough to cling on to with hand while felt way down with foot got to bottom safely found firm footing in ledge of rock close to water edge now then shouted down come braintree braintree obeyed managed with difficulty to reach ledge then tubbs attempted poor fellow clumsy at time now utterly unnerved by misery of day be not man enough for venture after one feeble effort begged to be allowed to stay where be nonsense cried bowler come on old man will help down right so tubbs tried again have not situation be so perilous appearance presented a clung wildly on to rock with hand kicked still more wildly with foot must have be ludicrous be time for joking two at bottom piloted foot a well a must encouraged in downward career before must reach slipped with howl fell backward into sea in moment bowler dressed a be be in beside holding up striking out to where braintree with outstretched hand waited to help in be long before must haul half senseless form from water by time be accomplished bowler be so exhausted that in turn needed braintree aid to land at last however three be on ledge what be to do next tubbs lay still half stupefied utterly unable to help rock have descended frowned above defying attempt to return way have come between ledge stood on rock other side twenty yard of uneasy water intervened must swim across with said bowler after little will do best said braintree thing be said bowler tide be dead out hour ago so must be coming in now oh what cad be to lead into braintree shut up old man say said braintree began to take off coat boot bowler did same will have to leave behind said ca be helped be ready yes say old man if get done up have to let go wait for be not much of swimmer bowler hesitated if must only be sure of getting over said pointing to tubbs might come back hullo say bowler look there exclaimed braintree suddenly pointing out to sea be that light blow whistle say bowler obeyed eagerly gazing in direction indicated by braintree there be answer light be certain saw something exclaimed braintree blow again old man once more whistle sent forth shrill cry seaward accompanied by loud shout from braintree waited in terrible suspense still answer must be wrong said bowler be not blow once more again bowler obeyed time sure enough fancied saw glimmer on water might be only light on mainland appearing through lifting fog for ten minute kept up incessant whistling shouting hope growing le le a time passed at length worn out desperate have given up be turning once more to prepare for swim across a did so light suddenly reappeared time close to shore once more with frantic energy raised signal of distress after moment terrible silence have joy of hearing faint shout across water be boat cried braintree whistle again to show where be again again whistled again again responsive shout growing ever nearer came back presently must even distinguish sound of oar at length dim outline of boat loomed across entrance of gulf where be shouted voice in familiar tone of raveling coastguard here can see be on ledge here thomson in few second boat be alongside three boy be safely lifted into where be rest of asked thomson a coolly a if sort of thing be everyday occurrence with want seven of know where be said bowler be coming round way to meet 'd better row round somewhere where can land look for give

jocular coastguard what har found grub enough on here island anyhow if do want something 'd better open that there bag see what can find bowler be too anxious to discover missing one to feel much appetite for food kept blowing whistle a boat slowly coasted island at length to unbounded joy answering shout be heard shadowy form of four outcast be seen standing on pier from have started two hour before jubilant be welcome exchanged a hero of new swishford once more counted full number ensconced snugly in stern of thomson boat round wonderful bag of food did not take long to chronicle doings of gayford party after about hour journey have be pulled up by same chasm have nearly proved too much for poor tubbs finding impossible to cross have turned inland for cheerful hour lost way completely in fog at length by mean of walking in straight line have come again to coast after much searching have found pier having found resolved to keep until other party completed circuit found where left however did find out thomson inquired gayford after repast have be done ample justice to did boat come ashore did young gentleman can tell will get to know how to spell name tolerable well

gammon about west indian island saying be going to lay hold of long stork to get hand in can tell have got hand in beauty there be cart load of birch be ordered for at school already awful warning failed to counteract satisfaction of hero at finding nearly back again in region of blanket hot porridge bowler in name of party magnificently presented thomson with odd shilling reserved for benefit expressed sorrow be not more added if eliza ever turned up might keep everything found on board including twelve tin of shrimp peach bottle of hair oil set of cricket bail copy of young night thought whereat thomson be moved with gratitude said be a nice lot of article a ever came across did not mind saying so hour later hero be in bed comfortable within without be let down easy for day escapade
