looked very pale with frame of black curly hair deep fringe of long eyelash finely chiselled nostril firm mouth redeemed from suspicion of weakness even a slept might judge lad of nineteen have will of own hidden up in delicate framework of body resembled father at least in that outer man be too narrow tenement for what contained almost at first flash of light big black eye opened started to sitting posture bewildered scared oh why hullo armstrong what be matter be sorry to disturb roger boy bounded out of bed stood facing tutor in night dress want to dress a sharp a can father be unwell

belied age by decade be still on sunny side of forty might have doubted if be yet thirty captain curtice wife have true kindness to attempt word a sympathisingly bade visitor farewell when hall door opened let in cold blast poor lady staggered moment clung closer to son side then abandoning composure to wintry wind found best refuge in tear let be led to carriage tutor helped to put in looked inquiringly at pupil come in too please said latter there be room inside mr armstrong must fain have taken seat beside robbins on box hated scene tear tragedy of sort there be something in pupil voice touched took place within prayed that moment might fly till reached maxfield scarcely word be spoken once roger hazarded question be signal for new outburst on mother part wisely desisted leant back in corner silent motionless a for tutor with front seat to nursed knee gazed fixedly out of window whole way what week two hour seemed how horse laboured panted halted how interminably dismal be dull muffled crunching of wheel through snow at length blurred light passed window tutor released knee put up eye glass here be said be lodge roger slowly reluctantly sat forward wrapped mother shawl closer round raffle stood on door step in hall beyond mr armstrong must see doctor standing a stepped out page touched on arm 'urry whispered over whereupon tutor quietly crept away to seclusion of own room chapter two living among dead household of maxfield worn out by excitement of night slept rather lay in bed till hard on midday tutor a slowly turned on side caught sight of winter sun through frost bespangled window felt profoundly disinclined to rise shrank from task awaited task of witnessing grief of widow pale look of orphan heir dismal negotiation with undertaker clergyman lawyer stupid question of domestic sickly fragrance of stephanotis in house then too there be awkward uncertainty a to own future what effect must tragedy of last night have on be notice to quit what must be sorry to go liked place liked pupil further have nowhere else to go altogether mr armstrong felt very reluctant to exchange easy bed for chance change of waking world besides lastly water in bath must see be frozen be hopeless on day like to expect that raffle must bring sufficient hot even to shave with however tutor have have little practice before now in doing what did not like with sigh shiver therefore flung aside blanket proceeded to break ice literally take bath after that felt decidedly better with help of steady ten minute grind at dumb bell succeeded in pulling together have reached stage in toilet when knock came at door come in raffle said mr armstrong beginning to see prospect of shave after be not raffle dr brandram equipped for road be off armstrong said 'd ask to come drive only think be wanted here see boy eats enough doe mope must amuse if can understand what told last night be not for by way here doctor held out sealed packet be lying on old man table last night be probably to give to that sent for in afternoon then forgot well good bye will come to morrow if road be passable only hope for sake will not make difference to remaining at maxfield mr armstrong finished toilet leisurely then proceeded to examine packet be large envelope addressed frank armstrong esquire in old man quavering hand within be envelope firmly sealed on same hand have written word to be given unopened into hand of roger ingleton junior on twentieth birthday effort of writing few word have evidently be almost more than writer must accomplish for towards end letter became almost illegible word be huddled in heap at corner of paper sealing too to judge from straggling blot of wax over ineffective mark of seal must have be labour of painful morning to feeble half blind old man to tutor however a held missive in hand looked at with reverence one feel for token from dead seemed to make one two thing tolerably clear first that content be be secret important else old man must never have taken upon labour must so easily have devolved upon secondly that old man rightly wrongly regarded frank armstrong a man to be trusted contemplated that year hence must occupy same position with regard to heir of maxfield a did now having arrived at conclusion tutor returned packet to outer envelope locked whole up in desk done descended to breakfast room a have expected no one be there what be worse there be sign either of fire breakfast to man who have not tasted food for about twenty hour such discovery must not fail to be depressing mr armstrong meekly decided to summon raffle to assistance a passed down passage must not forbear halting for moment at door of certain room behind knew mortal remains of dead employer lay a paused not liking to enter liking still le to pas on sound of footstep within startled be not difficult after moment reflection to guess to whom belonged tutor softly tapped on door only answer be abrupt halting of footstep mr armstrong entered found pupil roger be standing in ulster have worn last night eye be black heavy with weariness face be almost a white a face of who lay on couch a turned to open door teeth chattered with cold must leave alone whispered apologetically a tutor laid gentle hand on arm of course of course replied mr armstrong guessed be must rather be left alone said lad wearily thought by staying here must get help know what armstrong instead be half asleep have be yawning shivering forgotten who be here here eye filled with tear dear old fellow said tutor be fagged out come get little rest roger sighed partly to feel beaten partly at prospect of rest right said be ashamed must see so weak when wanted to be strong yes will come in one minute walked over to couch knelt beside worn out body have succumbed at last to misery against have battled so long for moment yielded to sorrow tutor waited moment then walked quietly from room for quarter of hour paced restlessly in cold passage outside then a pupil did not appear returned to chamber of death roger ingleton a expected have fallen asleep where knelt wretched day between death funeral dragged on in usual dismal fashion mr ingleton kept room domestic took occasion to neglect work roger ingleton minor passed through stage from inconsolable misery to subdued cheerfulness mr armstrong alone went through stage remained same unimpassioned

mother side be abroad be going over lot yesterday mother must scrape up single relation to come to morrow will have to get brandram father solicitor to come to funeral if mind of course will come said mr armstrong by way seems rather queer doe that will have charge of big property suppose be master of people about place naturally amongst humble obedient servant present tutor of maxfield will need

september ruth beloved wife of roger ingleton esquire of maxfield manor who died on february aged now new inscription must be added roger ingleton son of above named paul ingleton who died january when be added there must yet be space for name below roger shuddered little brought mind back with effort to solemn act be taking place clergyman voice ceased fatherless lad stooped to get last view of flower covered coffin then with heart lonelier than have ever known before turned away people fell back made silent lane for to pas poor lad said country wife a looked after pity know will be way

must mind wandered first to mother then to maxfield villager then to pet scheme for model village then to armstrong study then to certain pair of foil hung in room then to possibility of yacht next summer then to county festivity next winter with perhaps ball at maxfield then to approaching majority delight of unfettered manhood then have got so far at end of mile when heard step tramping through mud behind be mr armstrong boy first impulse be to put on air of dejection be far from feeling honesty came to rescue in time hullo armstrong be so glad be will never guess what be thinking about when heard about being elected mp for county asked tutor gravely how did guess tried to think about other thing know luckily chose to be natural instead well hope will be elected when time come two beguiled walk in talk if not exactly what might have be expected of mourner at least served to restore boy highly strung mind to proper tone to make aspect of thing in general brighter for than have be when started so dismally from graveyard now said with sigh a entered house now come awful business of reading will pottinger be sure to make occasion of must be worth while to be present to hear perform thanks said tutor will look to for full account of ceremony by by will accompany to slow music upstairs a happened mr armstrong be not permitted to escape a have fondly hoped to piano raffle followed presently to room said please sir mr pottinger sends compliment will be glad if will step down to library sir mr armstrong scowled what doe want muttered want gentleman two to say 'ear 'ear fancy said page with grin mr armstrong gave melancholy glance at piano screwed glass in eye aggressively right raffle can go what doe old idiot want with wonder said to unless be to give month notice tell may clear out heigho hope not with pleasant misgiving strolled down stair in library be assembled small select audience to do mr pottinger yeld attorney honour widow be there looking pale charming in deep mourning tasteful cap roger be there restless impatient little angry at fuss dr brandram rector be there resigned a men who have be through ceremony of kind before deputation of dead servant sat on chair near door gratified to be included in party mentally going over service to testator appraising in anticipation be waiting for mr armstrong said attorney severely a tutor entered mr armstrong looked not at well pleased to be thus accosted walked to seat in bay window behind mr pottinger man of law put on glass took sip of water from tumbler have have brought in blew nose glancing round on audience with enjoyment of man who feel master of situation began to make little speech there be first little condescending preamble concerning virtue of deceased one roger listened to respectfully son felt a much a must put up with to sit still hear began to fidget ominously greatly to disturbance of speaker when mr pottinger after few reproachful pause left topic began to discourse on own relation with late squire be turn of dr brandram to become restless be not occasion for dwelling on gratification received from here doctor deliberately rose walked across room for footstool a deliberately walked back with laid at foot of mr ingleton beg pardon go on said meeting astonished eye of attorney gratification received from kind expression here large coal inconsiderately fell out of fire with loud clamour raffle with considerable commotion came from seat proceeded to restore to lost estate mr pottinger took glass from nose regarded performance with such abject distress that roger catching sight of face involuntarily smiled really exclaimed now thoroughly offended friend of family really boy on occasion such a here rector to one relief came gallantly to rescue be very tedious mr pottinger said friend here be sure will prefer that must omit useless preliminary come to business at once let read document for eye be younger than yours at terrific act of insubordination almost blasphemous suggestion capped lawyer fell back in chair broke out into profuse perspiration gazing at rector a must at suddenly intruding wild animal then with gasp taking in peril of whole situation hastily took up will plunged into be long tedious document hard to understand when be ended no one exactly grasped purport then came moment of mr pottinger revenge party be at mercy after what doe amount to said doctor interpreting perplexed look of company have better perhaps explain in simple word said attorney condescendingly if will give attention might have heard pin drop now briefly provision of dear friend will be proper provision be made for support in comfort of widow during life legacy be also left a have heard to certain friend servant charity whole of remaining property be impression will be found to be very considerable be left in trust for testator only son roger young friend here who be to receive absolutely on reaching age of twenty one condition of trust be trifle peculiar there be three trustee who be also guardian of heir first be mr ingleton widow second be edward oliphant esquire of majesty indian army second cousin understand of mr ingleton in event trust be not likely of death of young friend here heir presumptive to property trusteeship be dependent on coming to country assuming duty of guardian to heir provision be made accordingly third trustee guardian be mr frank armstrong who be entitled to act so long a hold present post of tutor to heir post will retain only during mr ingleton pleasure be also provided that in event of difference of opinion among trustee mr ingleton a be most proper will be permitted to decide lastly curious eccentricity on dear friend part be perhaps hardly necessary to insert in event of roger ingleton previous to attaining majority becoming felon lunatic marrying be to be regarded a dead property thereby pass to next heir captain oliphant think may congratulate ourselves on what be really very simple will provided trustee named consent to act present very little difficulty have telegraphed already to captain oliphant mr armstrong will do favour at convenience of intimating to consent otherwise mr armstrong made response be indeed doubtful whether have heard question for at precise moment gazing about in bewilderment at unexpected responsibility thus thrown upon eye became suddenly riveted by picture be portrait partly concealed behind curtain of window in sat unveiled sufficiently to disclose face of fair haired boy younger by year than roger with clear blue eye strong compressed mouth somewhat sullen in temper with air of recklessness determination even in portrait fascinated beholder mr armstrong although have frequently be in late employer study have never noticed picture before now a caught sight of suddenly met flash of wild bright eye experienced something like shock must not help recalling dr brandram sad story other day something seemed mysteriously to connect portrait story together in mind strange at moment when fate of younger son be being decided guardian must thus come suddenly face to face with elder mr armstrong be not superstitious man felt decidedly glad when general break up of party allowed to get out of range of not altogether friendly eye escape to seclusion of own room chapter three missing inscription week later mr pottinger a trotted into office found letter telegram lying side by side on desk opened telegram first read bombay january consent be starting oliphant be right said lawyer to will have one competent executor at rate endorsed telegram proceeded to open letter too be very brief communication sir beg to say accept duty of trustee guardian conferred on by will of late roger ingleton esquire yours etcetera frank armstrong humph growled attorney be afraid so well well be not affair squire knew opinion so conscience be clear adventurer nothing le dangerous man like well well to do mr pottinger justice opinion of be of recent date indeed be of a long standing a tutor first arrival at maxfield eighteen month ago be one of few matter on late client have differed calmly indifferent a to effect of communication on lawyer mr armstrong be at moment having audience with co trustee mistress mr ingleton mr armstrong said hope for sake see way to accept duty dear husband requested of have written to mr pottinger to notify consent be so glad will have to depend on for so much will be so good for roger to have with father be always anxious about most anxious know mr armstrong added if there be question a to salary anything can do to make position here comfortable must tell for roger sake be anxious must be happy here thank madam be most comfortable said mr armstrong looking anything what described have detestation of business interview wished profoundly be out of be sure will like captain oliphant said widow have not seen for many year indeed since shortly after roger be born have heard from constantly mr ingleton have high opinion of be very distant cousin of mine know so understand poor fellow wife died quite young three child will be quite grown up now poor thing well thank very much mr armstrong hope will always be good friend for dear roger sake good bye roger a may be imagined have not waited whole week before ascertaining tutor intention have be good deal staggered at first by father will with curious provision amongst great deal be perplexing disappointing in derived little comfort from fact that mr armstrong be to be one of legal protector see know said a lounged against tutor mantelpiece one evening see why fellow of nineteen ca be trusted to behave without being tied up in way be impression know a well how to behave now a be likely to do when be twenty one be reflection in advance on dealing with during next two year said tutor with grin a swung half round on piano stool so a to get hand within reach of key mind said boy hope cousin edward whoever be wo try to deal ' with too be informed be virtue amiability said tutor if be serene will take walk abroad with one little hand in yours other in like good boy if be not there will be row armstrong in anticipation of feel in humour for turn at foil so adjourned into big empty room dedicated to manly sport of man boy there for hour mortal combat raged at end of roger pulled off mask said panting where did learn foil armstrong for year have be trying to run through body have never even yet scratched arm fenced good deal at oxford ah wonder if will ever go to oxford will cut out of nicely not at how well ca be tutor here while be undergraduate there can 'd sooner give up oxford than armstrong kind of wrong of too perhaps at twenty one will be own master may not be in humour then besides will have hand full of work here then be hard line to have to kick heel in idleness for two year while have so many plan in head for improving place to have to ask leave to spend so much a halfpenny be rather tragic strike however that cousin edward will be financial partner of firm will attend to literary part of business poor mother have to umpire in squabble upon word why must have be treated like man straight off instead of being washed dressed fed with spoon wheeled in perambulator by three respectable middle aged person who vote nuisance in first place roger ingleton be not yet middle aged in second place vote nuisance in third place if stand there much longer like with coat off will catch death of cold must annoy exceedingly be one of many conversation took place be difficult to say whether mr armstrong took new duty seriously not generally contrived to say something flippant about when pupil tackled on subject at same time rarely failed to give boy hint two somewhere hidden away behind cool odd exterior of man there lurked very warm corner for fatherless heir of maxfield for next week two day passed uneventfully manor house settled down to old routine minus old man who have once be master villager having satisfied that thing be likely to be pretty much same for under new regime a old resumed usual way touched cap regularly to young squire trampled grass in yeld churchyard lifted head again new inscription be added to family roll on door of vault armstrong said heir one day a stood inspecting last memorial have good mind to have brother name put on here too be first time tutor have ever heard boy mention brother indeed have like dr brandram doubted whether roger so much a knew that have have brother what brother inquired vaguely oh died long ago before be born be son of father first wife know pointing to inscription of ruth ingleton name be not buried here died abroad believe think death must be recorded with others certainly said tutor must try to find exact date said roger a walked away father must hardly ever talk about death must have be knock down blow to believe broke mother heart sometimes wish have lived be called roger too dare say brandram vicar can tell about mr armstrong be good deal concerned at unexpected curiosity on boy part doubted whether must not be better to tell sad story at once a have heard from doctor disliked secret extremely especially when happened to be custodian of painful a discovery of one might be to ward might be best that must know now instead of hovering indefinitely in profitless mystery be therefore with sense of relief that half way home perceived dr brandram in road ahead doctor be in fact bound for maxfield by way doctor said tutor determined to take bull by horn glaring at friend rather fiercely through eye glass be talking about just now roger have be telling about elder brother of who died long ago think record of death must be made on vault think so too be saying said roger father never cared to talk about so except that died abroad that name be same a mine really know much about did know doctor looked uncomfortable not altogether grateful to mr armstrong for landing in dilemma think said ignoring last question a squire did not put up inscription must be better to leave tomb a be see said boy of course must say where really did die where be that by way really did not hear abroad understood father to say be delicate then that have to go away how old be doctor upon word be so seldom at home when be saw so little of that memory be very hazy about altogether ca have be more than boy of fifteen sixteen must say by way roger how doe new cob do middling be rather lumpy to ride will get mother to swop for horse if can say doctor what be like who cob oh brother fancy be fine young fellow not particularly good looking at like not at must say really a say can recall very little about doctor uttered in tone conveyed so broad hint that did not relish subject that roger decidedly mystified desisted from further inquiry what on earth said former to mr armstrong when at last have reached maxfield boy have left what on earth have put into head can not tell rather hoped must tell knew must come better from if know anything of roger will find out for whether like not nice thing to be family doctor growled dr brandram have charge of family skeleton between armstrong be never quite satisfied about story of boy death abroad old man said have have news of be anybody even poor mother ever got out of really brandram said tutor be most uncomfortable person wish must not make party to mystery like be upsetting well well old fellow replied doctor whatever be once be mystery now for poor fellow have long ago made good right to inscription on tombstone need have doubt of letter with indian post mark arrived that same evening served for present at least to divert thought of roger a well a of tutor to other channel letter be from captain oliphant addressed to mr ingleton very dear cousin read need say with what deep sympathy received news of dear roger sudden call at great distance blow of kind fall with

sad enough reason for going said roger say be not very complimentary to to say have not soul to talk to half jesting petulance in rosalind face have given place to look almost of pain a held out hand good bye mr armstrong said did know be in trouble will be jolly when come home chimed in jill somehow in mr armstrong ear a whirled along to town afternoon two pretty farewell rang continuous change when at evening took seat in dover express still followed now in solo now in duet now in restless fugue on steamer rose fell with uneasy wave played in whistling wind a sped towards paris past acacia hedge poplar avenue among foreign scene amidst chatter of foreign tongue surrounded by foreign face still caught sound of two distant voice one quiet low other gay piping even when at last dropped asleep forgot everything else joined in with rattle of rail to give lullaby such be freak of sensitive musical ear be often victim at maxfield meanwhile remained in mind of one two of inmate two young lady assisted by cousin genially obstructed by easy going brother proceeded seriously in task of adorning studio now then speculating about absent tutor now then feeling very dejected lonely roger did best to enliven evening make visitor feel at home although tom jill readily consented to be comforted miss rosalind a stubbornly refused protested score of time that cabin of oriana be preferable to misery of being condemned a termed to eat head off in dismal place be sorry for mr armstrong be vexed too that must go off very first day after arrival leave to fight battle alone after talk on steamer have in own mind reckoned on a ally disappointed not to find at bidding after be not only person whose mind be exercised by tutor abrupt exodus captain oliphant felt decidedly hurt by manner of going argued lack of appreciation of newly arrived trustee position in household on have hardly calculated bespoke spirit of independence in tutor colleague must not regard a unpromising indeed when after day labour captain oliphant sought seclusion of own apartment amiable pleasant spoken gentleman grew quite warm with who be grandee asked man hired at few pound year fed at maxfield table in order to help heir to little quite unnecessary knowledge of ancient classic modern science be old dotard old dotard by way be captain oliphant private manner of referring to lamented dear one whose name so often trembled on lip in public what be old dotard thinking about at rate must like to know little more about fellow myself with laudable intention questioned mr ingleton next morning be good friend to dear roger said mother roger be devoted to be sure will get to like edward be perhaps little odd in manner have good heart be about mr ingleton knew except be university man accomplished musician captain oliphant be not much enlightened by description sat down for third time carefully read over dear one will think said at lunch time will stroll over to yeld afternoon see mr pottinger roger will walk with walk must do good be looking pale boy oh be right said roger whose cough however be still obstinate will come with pleasure walk of five mile on damp afternoon through drenched country lane may be good specific for cough in india in england occasionally fails in respect roger be wet through when reached will not be long said captain a reached attorney door catch cold there be good fellow remember health be very precious roger undertook to act on considerate advice occupied time of waiting by strolling up down high street in rain paying call here there at one two shop finally dropping in to see friend dr brandram captain meanwhile be having interesting chat with attorney after introducing receiving suitable congratulation said mr ingleton will mr pottinger so far a can understand seems fairly simple be ready anxious to perform part of provision yes see after be only matter of two year trouble a soon a master roger come of age will be released unless say captain laughing marries becomes mad go to prison be that what curious proviso be old squire have peculiarity like most of set heart on boy turning out well ah presume tutor mr armstrong have very high qualification since so much depends on of ca say captain oliphant to tell truth never quite understood that appointment doubtless squire knew best doubtless must have have very high opinion of to associate with mr ingleton in guardianship take by way hardly extends beyond present duty a tutor be just said mr pottinger according to will have right to participate in action taken by other trustee a regard boy estate anything else how very singular mean to say that be to be consulted in matter of finance management of property technically yes if claim imagine however be hardly aware of be not inclined to urge to claim must be sorry to give unfavourable impression captain oliphant like mr armstrong appears to be well thought of at maxfield said captain private opinion be must not let influence that be somewhat of adventurer know nothing of antecedent indeed not even where life squire be reticent on matter told have good recommendation with that be oxford man surely must be satisfactory hope will find not difficult to get on with after will have to wait week so however before putting question to test a have just gone off rather abruptly at particular time rather inopportunely on journey for what object know humph said attorney like mystery however trust will be a say dr brandram when presently captain called in for ward be in by mean good temper have be blowing roger up sky high said puffing smoke rather viciously in captain direction for behaving like lunatic idea of coming out getting wet through with cold upon dear dear said captain have got wet through why dear boy what did tell must have let come said doctor bluntly be business to play trick with really doctor said roger laughing coughing alternately be not baby be worse said doctor severely let happen again must go home in fly wo allow to walk armstrong must have let do grated on captain nerve to hear tutor thus quoted in what seemed to be reflection on roger boy said be fortunate to have somebody to look well after quite agree with doctor must drive home hope thing be dry be made change everything have on said roger quite right quite right doctor took opportunity before fly arrived of talking to captain seriously about ward health be not robust can see said wo take care of be equally evident must make do wo answer for consequence captain laughed pleasantly duty grow on apace said have come over from india to look after moral estate education now find must add to oversight of of flannel certainly see be well aired be more important than of others good bye maxfield household be dismal one evening mr ingleton in distress have prevailed on roger to go to bed miss rosalind defrauded in one day of two ally sulked in dignified way in own room visited displeasure with world in general on poor jill who consoled by beginning letter to dear mr armstrong tom having wandered joyously over whole house making friend with everybody admiring everything be engaged in feverish occupation of trying to find stamp album have left behind in india only serene member of party be captain oliphant who in arm chair of library smoked excellent cigar ruminated on thing at large poor lad said to great pity be so delicate not at pleasant cough quite churchyard tone about tut tut be not favourably impressed with doctor officious bumpkin seems to armstrong must really like to know little more about pottinger be decidedly of way of thinking not nice fellow at armstrong wrong sort of companion for roger poor fellow how be coughing to night kindly soul actually laid down cigar went out into passage to listen shocking cough said a returned relit cigar then took out document from pocket copy of will in fact read again done relapsed into genial meditation one more presently kindly feeling prompted to pay ward visit well boy how be better hope oh yes said roger coughing be only cold in head will soon be right be awfully sorry to desert girl tom tell nothing

displayed on wall table be littered with classical exercise music score letter college boating jacket hung behind door one two prize goblet decorated mantelpiece captain oliphant displayed genial interest in everything read inscription on goblet glanced casually through paper read address on few of letter generally took stock of apartment of course like honourable gentleman disturbed nothing presently distressed by sudden fit of coughing from direction of ward room hastily stepped out into lobby again made way back to library before went to bed methodical person committed three several matter to paper in memorandum book wrote name of certain college at oxford date corresponding oddly enough to name date on one of goblet in mr armstrong room that done scrawled post card to dr brandram requesting to call see roger whose cough be still little troublesome after that pulled out of pocket read with somewhat pained expression letter have received day before by indian mail be gather long passage pained captain oliphant particularly ran thus trouble about mess account be not blown over yet have done can for hope will make unnecessary for to enter into detail with party chiefly interested in affair depends pretty much on what be able to tell whether can give time mention in last will consult own interest best by being quite square so on expression captain oliphant mentally applied to writer a re read pleasant passage be not wholly flattering countenance a have said bore trace of considerable pain however after little meditation cleared somewhat wrote seems to pity must take up position can only end in trouble round know how thing stand how impossible be to hasten matter at present moment there seems probability of being able to discharge account yours among considerably earlier than time first mentioned be worth while under circumstance reconsidering what must allow to say be preposterous claim for interest of course if charge for full term have very little inducement to settle up sooner turn over like sensible man believe meanwhile yours truly eo p enclose copy of clause of will most likely to interest be sorry to say ward be in very bad might say seriously bad health have constitutional complaint greatly fear will make winter most anxious time to after captain oliphant soothed down with cigarette spent little time in admiring

sternly discouraged conversation inattention really roger said when at last meekly submitted final copy for boy of age be uncommonly rough hand tom be much more promising pupil than have promised bob

scratching of pencil rosalind occasional terse criticism over shoulder little incident opened roger eye considerably be astonished at afterwards for taking rebuff so meekly submitting to what after be rather preposterous regulation be aware that must not have submitted to one rosalind possibly armstrong why must do so to did not particularly know unless be because felt must be pleasanter on whole to have a friend than a foe when three day later mr armstrong neither appeared communicated with member of household uneasiness prolonged absence caused found expression in several different way miss jill cried in corner miss rosalind tossed head painted fiercely roger already pulled down with return of cough moped in own room while mother impressed by growing indignation of cousin began to work

tom said be too clever however did guess that be dying to hear how break down be danced did till father said so here roger two young lady laughed again whereat tom concluding have said something good unawares laughed too thought to how jolly be to be clever keep table at roar in private captain oliphant pursued subject of gustav relation apart from mutual connexion with break down with maxfield tutor received very little satisfaction from inquiry tom be so full of main topic that other event of memorable evening in town occupied secondary place in memory recollected gustav a good natured foreigner whom armstrong called by christian name who talked french in return must not remember where lived except that be ten minute walk from christy minstrel have slightest idea what two men talked about except armstrong have promised to hold somebody hand that gustav have tried to kiss by way of recompense captain oliphant chose to take very serious view of disclosure fitted in exactly with theory that tutor be adventurer of shady antecedent a such undesirable companion for late dear one orphan boy must not feel be doing duty said to mr pottinger afternoon if be not to follow up know whom have to deal with fact of mr ingleton having confided in really know weighs very little with old men of enfeebled intellect dear pottinger be so easily hoodwinked quite so doe not occur to captain that simple solution of difficulty must be for mr ingleton to send boy to college mr ingleton said captain be unfortunately incapable of regarding subject in light that of son liking roger ingleton minor be infatuated humph said lawyer thought so then agree with will be useful to institute few inquiry leave to said captain by way what about piece of land be speaking of ah said lawyer making a near approach to blush a must muster fact be hodder lease fall in next week have have at ridiculously low figure be not profitable tenant be old dotard who be always croaking about maxfield

name said lawyer looking sufficiently conscious happen to know must be better tenant to maxfield than old man mr pottinger amused with making little mystery about matter be secret to captain oliphant that gallant gentleman knew a well a lawyer did that mr pottinger whose land adjoined hodder be eligible tenant in question there will be difficulty about pottinger of course must give hodder option of offering friend price if doe not be clearly duty of executor to take better tenant took up hat turned to go by way said at door will hardly be necessary take to go through farce of bringing trifling matter of kind before other executor mr ingleton must really be spared worry of sort a for other one well chooses to be somewhere else quite so quite so if mr ingleton sign lease will be sufficient said mr pottinger unluckily for pleasantly arranged plan of two good gentleman miss rosalind oliphant took into pretty head day so afterwards to call at old hodder cottage in passing to ask for glass of milk young lady be in very discontented frame of mind be angry with mr armstrong for staying away so long not that cared what did till came back felt did not know full extent of force arrayed against at maxfield wanted to know worst besides although roger be diligently prosecuting art study displaying most docile obedience to discipline must not help thinking must not have taken to art except to please displeased mightily besides tom brother be too silly for anything insisted on enjoying whoever else be miserable jill be very little better altogether miss oliphant be out of humour felt walk must do good found hodder family in mighty tribulation old man sat in corner with hat on floor beside cry boohing like child two little granddaughter looked on at grief pale half

letter have come into hand have not hesitated for moment a to duty desire in matter have cheerfully accepted task of finding that lost aggrieved perhaps hardly used brother to whom heart went out a gazed on likeness of what once have be now to abdicate in favour of blackguard to look for to tell maxfield be to have to depend on generosity for livelihood to see good name of ingleton represented in county by drunken profligate what task be that writer evidently did not know of second will suspect that after maxfield be own one knew of document roger armstrong for moment there returned to boy

in way tutor failed to understand ward doe not seem to be fraud at said roger why did tell of before did not regard statement seriously do now there be lie written in line of letter clumsy attempt to extort money ought not to be allowed to succeed give not single proof of identity horsewhipped on night of birthday for insulting lady what lady asked roger miss oliphant said tutor flushing little then a desperate expedient for getting off punishment deserved blurted out preposterous story having once published appears mean to make capital out of roger old fellow be fool be fool enough to

amusement further motive be to evade possible return of dear friend mr ratman whose abrupt departure from maxfield have perplexed relieved second of gentleman uncomfortable bill be falling due in few day a on present occasion lucky windfall have dropped in from american mayor seemed altogether fitting occasion for dropping for season below horizon when however roger unexpectedly consented to accompany guardian visit assumed altogether different aspect captain have long desired to have dear ward to opportunity now presented be certainly one not to be neglected dear boy said a two took

made reference to dr brandram stoutly disapproved of rosalind tossed head when heard of hoped might enjoy failed to see why when there be football in air at maxfield one must be bothered to travel up to london for pleasure unless indeed intended to take season ticket for christy minstrel altogether roger did not feel elated at prospect of visit for that persuaded that duty called thither even if be bad temper drove from maxfield what have become of ratman inquired of guardian casually during journey captain oliphant looked up from paper sharply mr ratman whereabouts have be occupying thought

call on wo find died before went abroad drank to death be sorry to hear that enlisted under present name of ratman of course present name be ingleton if called ratman be because did want father to

glass that mr fastnet who will be glad to hear have also come to life again be still in good health when ward saw few week ago retains vivid recollection of runaway son having entertained for year at own lodging at end of time prodigal so far from enlisting took to stage spent year at least with company of strolling player have unfortunate nephew story proceeded tutor carefully traced up to

dragging into business since be here stay to see out be relieved to hear say so tell now said mayor what story be what doe young friend mean by farewell threat thereupon mr armstrong gave new ally faithful account of family difficulty of captain oliphant embarrassing relation to claimant of miss rosalind dilemma of roger quixotic determination to find lost brother of own tutor conviction of hopelessness of quest visitor by mean shared last conclusion rather calculate that lost young man ai a dead a think said by account be born to be drowned be not hung yet bet young brother will come up with before time called well by last account seems to have vague clue a to whereabouts fifteen year ago said tutor will hear what make of to morrow must come up to maxfield see co trustee presence of unexpected friend of family in capacity of impartial umpire struck tutor a particularly opportune at juncture have be witness to ratman virtual admission to imposture natural interest in discovery of

to theory that ratman be brother have theory must find brother even if be murderer said boy with groan say have nothing be heard of police have traced to london there scent end for present be probably in hiding there one may have to wait week month till get off guard be caught about ten day later started by slow stage on homeward journey whether madame received expected for hospitality be doubtful mr armstrong duty of cashier used eye glass considerably in scrutinising figure craved interview with madame in parlour to discus arithmetic although appeared eventually to arrive at satisfactory understanding with good lady so much so that shed tear at departure did not complain that charge be extortionate a french hotel go home coming of heir of maxfield created welcome flutter of excitement among desolate occupant of manor house neighbour flutter in heart be nothing compared with in heart of heir a walked across park on day after return to call at vicarage invite rosalind to accompany in ride what passed whether flutter be contagious what brought back deserted colour to miss rosalind cheek why rode so slow left so much of course to decision of steed many other matter for wonder history recordeth not a be quite proper doe record when on return mr armstrong chanced to come out on to door step where two stood unmounted roger said armstrong rosalind have promised to be wife tutor flushed little at not unexpected announcement then taking pupil arm said mean great happiness for be glad very glad why if be so glad did slink off to study forthwith play dirge on piano there

what appeared to be hopeless loss of brother roger have by mean yet abandoned search twice already have armstrong be up to london to make inquiry without avail billiard marker of l'hotel soult have vanished a completely a well a mr ratman know of course said tutor once with rather unsympathetic drawl in be wont to allude to lost ingleton know of course that if man want be ratman be having assistance of police in search warrant be out against heaven earth be being moved to capture roger sighed be looking for one brother said even if turn out to be miscreant can not help quite so only be right to remember to find ratman mean to hang at least be object police have in view need not disturb on score roger ingleton major if find may be villain wo be murderer of miss oliphant father returned presently baffled to maxfield one at depot recruiting head quarter pension office must tell word of soldier sailor named callot who might have enlisted gone to sea about twelve year ago how must expect did most careful search among old squire paper lead to discovery of record of supposed report of lad death a matter of fact if billiard marker at l'hotel soult be man have already traced down to date long subsequent to of rumoured death together ransacked memory of dr brandram vicar old hodder one two other inhabitant who might be supposed to know something of matter very few there be who have seen boy at have spent most of time at school during occasional holiday have usually found amusement needed in ample confines of park one have seen in black white announcement of death squire have told doctor news of have arrived from abroad where when under what circumstance never said old hodder remembered story of quarrel between father son identified portrait a of missing lad despite boasted threescore year ten old man be absolutely useless in present inquiry so thwarted at turn not knowing what to hope for too proud to own beaten roger abandoned search awaited majority very much a debtor awaits bankruptcy mr armstrong who chanced to look up at moment when raffle delivered letter concluded at once from startled look on lad face that be missive of common importance be from ratman bore on envelope london post mark dear brother for last time claim help know quite well that be being hunted to death by employ without shred of evidence be willing to believe murderer suppose

be two day here never so much a heard of oliphant death must not believe fancy be much use telling that scoundrel owed money be shielding from consequence of old felony for might have have penal servitude that little did pay be stolen from property of course must believe be only about brother who have be slung stone life who never have friend never knew kind look from one that be ready to believe evil be nearly at end of tether here in day two will probably hear that be arrested then will have revenge on for daring to be flesh blood will have difficulty in convincing judge jury have committed crime saintly tutor choose to concoct between pleasant to be rich influential must escape if have money fifty pound must rid of almost a effectively a gallows must cost something therefore be absurd to imagine possible when three day hence make last call at general post office hear once more that there be nothing for not even message of brotherly pity cost nothing will know last hope be gone in lap of luxury counting thousand monarch of survey will be able to breathe again will hear of arrest if courage befriends may read in obscure corner of paper of wretch hounded to death who escaped pursuer after preferred to die by own hand rather than of brother good bye till then brother roger ingleton p post office know messenger a richard redfern ' doubt will show letter to tutor who must have difficulty in using information be obliged to give a to whereabouts to run down flush on roger face have died down into pallor by time reached end of savage yet dismal letter till came to

together be not surprised said tutor want money of course ca show letter simply because contains vague clue a to whereabouts must feel bound to follow up undoubtedly must said mr armstrong will not no give in confidence in hope will send money intend to do must hardly be fair to use letter against be captain oliphant murderer denies once more call brother tutor shrugged shoulder a please burn letter probably doe not tell more than police know already roger dismally obeyed have felt sure that man be brother must have at risk in spite of tried to help even so to help with one hand must mean to ruin with other if found must be to hand over to police if procured escape must be to oust irrevocably from inheritance there seemed nothing for to hing wait in other quarter policy of inaction

robbed well sir be private matter must not mention if be not for talk be going to fro about young mr ingleton lost brother understand there be claimant for title not very eligible one on contrary most ineligible said tutor seems likely that will under present circumstance keep far enough away from part naturally coroner jury have given pressing invitation feel compelled to decline well about lost boy will think impertinent think can tell something about tutor started looked hard at speaker yes said latter mildly a know have not be here long predecessor mr morris be friend of family remember once mentioning elder son of squire who have be reported dead be ever heard of matter from anybody else only last week in bundle of document relating to mr morris own affair a executor be duty to examine came upon letter though evidently private at time seems a if ought at least to be seen by ward now prof that ten year ago elder son be alive being in handwriting may be important evidence if have to deal with claim of impostor tutor expressed considerable discomfort at new complication regarded document in banker hand a if be infernal machine be private say must not be better to regard a such think must be seen if prefer will submit to mr pottinger settled business tutor stretched out hand for letter be dated from on board ship cyclops off havana ten year ago by unsteady character of handwriting rendered word almost illegible have evidently be written in high sea mr armstrong must scarcely help smiling at banker naive suggestion a to use of document a evidence of handwriting note be a follows dear mr morris write to in strictest confidence father probably have given up for dead hope so on account must know have written to object be to enclose twenty five dollar note owe once before quarrelled lent five pound want to pay back without one knowing of because be determined not to owe anything to anybody especially to one who have told be not honest please put into bank account probably will never notice anyhow please do tell one alive where came from that ever heard word from of trust a gentleman yours truly roger ingleton well sir said banker who have watched reading curiously doe not seem important letter think so appears to be genuine too on face of if will allow must like ward to see will interest tutor be not wrong with strange missive in hand roger yearning towards lost brother returned in full force object of search seemed suddenly to stand within measurable reach ten year appeared nothing beside twenty only few month back have divided if must postpone majority year then came miserable doubt about ratman if after unlikely discredited story must prove to have grain of truth at bottom of dismissed doubt for hope armstrong must go to town to find out about cyclops come with there be good fellow in three week will be too late tutor be prepared for decision by mean said will go to morrow to inquire after passenger sailor who be on board sailing vessel nationality unknown happened to be off havana in heavy sea on october ten year ago know be absurd said roger ca help never seemed so near brother before must despise if sat idle here so

decorously to think of football just a rosalind be beginning to make up mind that be not destined for ever to teach element of art science to vicarage child just when everything seemed to be settling down for last scene of drama roger tutor vanished once more on familiar wild goose chase dr brandram grumbled county gentry shook head mr pottinger breathed again one thought well of expedition went so far a to make jest of roger cared nothing for what people thought with armstrong to back with rosalind to bid brave god speed with own stout heart to buoy up with lost brother only ten year distant must afford to start in good cheer let world think what liked cheer be destined to failure heard of one two vessel called cyclops respecting crew passenger of none of be possible to glean word of news

never heard of of quest seemed most vague hopeless up to last roger stuck doggedly to even if spent majority in london dock must not turn tail tutor backed up loyally did most of work made most of inquiry never grumbled gibed protested when roger looked most like giving in be tutor who put fresh heart into to morrow said roger on eve of birthday will give up there be day yet sure enough on last day vague ray of light came in shape of telegram from port master at havana to whom at tutor suggestion message of inquiry have be sent cyclops known writing writing letter must take week to come have

up trust be over now no longer now be guardian governor be therefore to lose gallant comrade to whom brotherhood in nature went out with reflection such a be scarcely to be wondered at little be said during long aimless walk at last roger shivered let turn in said mr armstrong be in street off strand long way from hotel cab in sight place will do said roger why not pointed to door of seedy looking private hotel over lamp burned with legend night porter in attendance tutor surveyed house curiously through then said quite so stayed here once before rang bell door be opened by person of whose nationality there must be little doubt particularly when after momentary inspection of belated guest uttered exclamation of joy accosted tutor mon ami oh be glad to see good friend friend of pauvre
