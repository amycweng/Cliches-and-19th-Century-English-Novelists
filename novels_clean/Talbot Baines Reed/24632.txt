quarter fumed raged into state bordering on madness vowed revenge till be hoarse be curious fact nevertheless that at prayer that evening there be more clean face among tadpole than have be seen there since formation of ancient honourable fraternity chapter eight quarrel cricket match first number of dominican have undoubtedly caused sensation must have created far more sensation for fact that alphabet match be to be played on following day even counter attraction must not wholly divert mind of saint dominic from new literary marvel skirmish took place on very afternoon of appearance pembury friend have quite expected that sixth must attempt high handed blow at paper be not disappointed for sooner have loman peer stalked away from scene of indignation found in retirement of own room than fell to talking in term reverse of pleasant about event of morning least important of number be specially wroth there be great row out in passage to day said raleigh who be blissfully ignorant of whole matter why ca of monitor keep little better order doctor will be wanting to know what be about very well said raikes one of monitor if fifth will stick tomfoolery out in passage there be sure to be row what tomfoolery of be for ever grumbling at fifth so must if saw complimentary remark make about in precious newspaper of theirs oh dominican must have look at by by meanwhile something have better be done to stop row will catch so saying captain left injured youth to own counsel be to be feared be moved more by dislike for dominican than by burning desire for good order of school however must do something there must be nothing inconsistent with dignity in demanding withdrawal of obnoxious broadside on account of noise caused must be safe move might be checkmate loman be deputed to wait upon fifth with demand of monitor lost time in carrying out welcome task class be just over fifth be just about to clear out of room when loman entered be not often that sixth form fellow penetrated into camp have not guessed mission might have resented intrusion oh fellow began loman feeling not quite so confident now a have felt five minute ago ca have thing of yours hanging out in passage like that make crowd too much row whose be not mine said wraysford laughing ask bully perhaps be not bit of said bullinger be yours be simon only part said poet of love ballad presented that to paper suppose be mine said oliver with drawl then said loman losing temper can say be sooner clear away better oh right only be not mine look here said loman be not going to fool about with may think very funny will report to doctor then will look foolish how nice so pleasant will be to look for once like what look always observed pembury gnawing top of crutch at moment there be loud shout of laughter in passage outside confirming monitor complaint wraysford walked hastily to door next time there be row like outside door called to group outside will what do mean by young blackguard so saying caught master bramble who happened to be nearest offender within reach by collar of coat lugged bodily into class room there now do know gentleman be monitor have good look at be be complaining of row be making quite rightly take tell little pig outside if hold noise will find man jack of mentioned by name in next number so saying with gentle cuff handed ill starred master bramble out again to fellow from time there be scarcely sound audible from passage good bye said pembury kissing hand to loman who time have be standing in middle of room in white heat perplexed what to do say next be going to live here be asked bullinger one got toffee drop drily inquired to surprise to surprise of one loman wheeled round towards last speaker without word struck blow on mouth with hand saw have made mistake looked ashamed moment deed be done eye turned to oliver whose face be crimson with sudden flush of pain anger sprang to foot braddy bully be already beginning to gloat over prospect of fight when to one amazement oliver coolly put hand back into pocket walking up to loman said quietly have better go loman stared at in astonishment have at least expected to be knocked down behaviour be quite incomprehensible turned on heel quitted room without word somehow other from time fifth heard more protest from monitor on subject of dominican be conduct much a have astonished person chiefly concerned have astonished fifth still more for first time in history of class a far a must recollect blow struck have not be returned must not tell what to make of blow have be cowardly one certainly unmerited by schoolboy tradition one fairly demanding return must be possible man be lacking in courage idea be shock to most present who although oliver be never very popular among a have be said have never before suspected pluck in fact be awkward moment for be quite relief when simon broke silence by asking oliver why did knock down say because did not choose if want to know replied oliver shortly oh beg pardon replied simon rather taken aback by brusque answer be not satisfactory have offender be guinea pig one must have understood thing when be sixth form fellow good match in respect a well a rival fifth be offended at man for drawing back a have done suppose will fight said ricketts in voice implied that there be doubt about do replied oliver briefly boy manner be certainly not winsome when once put out be evident took trouble to conceal fact refused to answer further question on subject presently quitted room leaving more than class fellow convinced that after be coward angry discussion followed departure ought to be made to fight whether like not said braddy bully one ought to pay loman out suggested ricketts if greenfield doe nice name will get of said bullinger when get abroad over school be shame because one fellow funk for whole form to be disgraced be what say said one else there be however two boy who did not join in general cry of indignation against oliver be wraysford pembury latter be always whimsical in opinion one be surprised to see come out on wrong side a for wraysford always backed friend up whether others thought right wrong two scouted idea of oliver being coward one with usual weapon of ridicule other with warmth of friendship who call coward exclaimed wraysford glaring at last speaker wraysford be not coward looked so ready to avenge friend by hard knock that boy who have insinuated that greenfield be afraid withdrew charge a mildly a must only meant look a if did like to fight said what business of yours be what look like demanded wraysford come old man said pembury eat up fancy greenfield might screw up courage to pull nose whoever else let off eh be private opinion though oliver knew what be about of course did sneered braddy knew jolly well what be about dear be that mr braddy have not noticed here must not have ventured to speak on matter having to do with pluck heroism be glad agree with though although did say knew jolly well what be about be expression of own braddy who a usual felt looked extinguished when pembury made fun of retired sulkily editor of dominican thereupon turned attack on quarter so dispute went on party being convinced satisfied only on one point that cloud have arisen to mar hitherto peaceful horizon of fifth form existence cricket match of following day however served to divert thought of party for time a be only prelude to much more important match shortly to follow will not attempt to describe fully here a reader will probably be far more interested in incident of sixth versus school match when come off alphabet match be to tell truth not nearly a interesting affair a promised to be for from very first n to z have best of stephen who with company of fellow tadpole guinea pig be perched on paling looking on felt heart sink within a first one then of brother side lost wicket without run for once bramble be in sympathy paul be at difference row small boy kicked up by way be one of most notable feature of whole match one of yelled for own side there have indeed be question whether guinea pig private initial ought not to yell for g tadpole for t be eventually decided that must yell on own hook effect be certainly far more diverting first four men of to m went out for two run between stephen bramble sat in gloomy despair next man in knocked down wicket before have played single ball be frightful jeer of z be hateful to hear stephen brightened a perceived that next batsman be brother now will pick up said no wo greenfield senior sky ball too much for taste cheeringly replied small bramble stephen be right for first time afternoon made stand oliver partner at wicket be callonby of sixth steady plodding player who hardly ever hit out got run if got from slip afternoon hardly scored at kept wicket carefully while oliver did hitting thing be looking up telegraph went up from to wraysford who have hitherto be bowling with ricketts against friend gave up ball to raikes field generally woke up to importance of getting rid of daring player stephen throat be too hoarse to roar more so resigned that duty to bramble looked on in delighted silence score crept up till suddenly callonby tipped ball into cover slip hand be caught to great delight of z who guessed once separation have be effected survivor must soon be disposed of next man in be loman be better a bowler than batsman followed callonby tactic played steady block leaving boy have struck yesterday to do hitting oliver be certainly playing in fine form for moment class fellow forgot resentment against in applauding play score be at new coalition promised to be a formidable a last when oliver cut ball past point run yes run shouted loman started then hesitated then started again be too late before must get across ball be up be run out be furious certainly be hard line for although there must have be time enough for run have not pulled up in middle forgetful of rule of cricket turned round to oliver shouted be fool a left wicket stephen luckily be too much engrossed in watching telegraph to hear notice remark however be not lost on fifth generally who experienced return of former discontent when observed that oliver though must have heard took not slightest notice of offensive expression match passed off without further incident z won in end by two wicket after closer match than have promised to be at first stephen be comforted for reverse by feeling sure that brother at rate have played best must certainly get place in school eleven chapter nine rod in pickle loman who have arrived at same conclusion respecting be bravery a majority in fifth did not allow conscience to trouble a to share of morning business never have liked oliver lately especially have come to dislike be therefore glad to have made smart now since blunder in cricket match felt greatly inclined to repeat blow particularly a there did not seem much to fear if did so be quick too to see that oliver have lost favour with comrade have hesitation in availing of opportunity of widening breach affected to be sorry for poor fellow to feel that have be too hard on so on in manner while offended fifth a applied to one of set exasperated more against oliver so matter went on getting more more unsatisfactory loman however have other thing to think of than rival cowardice foremost among be new fishing rod rather rod coveted for own until day after alphabet match have not even have time to examine treasure three pound ten be appalling figure to pay for rod then thought loman if be really good one worth half a much again must be pity to miss bargain one knew crippses father son be authority on matter pertaining to piscatorial art loman too be never badly off for pocket money must easily raise amount felt sure when represented case at home so took rod out of canvas bag began to put together now boy study be hardly place in to flourish fishing rod loman found that with butt down in one bottom corner of room top joint must have to be put on up in opposite top corner when complicated operation be over there be room to move from position still le to judge of weight spring attach winch line happy thought window must have amount of scope there so taking to piece putting together again in new direction have satisfaction of testing at full length be pleased with rod on whole attached line with fly at end in order to give thorough trial gave scientific cast into imaginary pool be splendid rod just right for how wished be up above gusset weir at moment why must here attempted to draw up rod there be ugly tug crack a did so found to disgust that hook having nothing else to catch have caught ivy on wall what be worse that top joint of rod have snapped cracked in inability to bring weighty catch to shore be long time before loman be able to disengage line bring rod in again at window top joint be cracked looked all right a held when tried to bend have lost spring crack showed only too plainly misfortune still be in store reel in winding up suddenly stuck loman fancying have only caught temporarily tried to force in so doing spring broke handle turned uselessly round round in hand be streak of bad luck mistake rod be not what be worse be so cripps said rod of extraordinary excellence value loman have doubt now about first rate top piece must bend nearly double then not break reel broke at least pressure must hardly be of best kind still cripps thought lot of loman have undoubtedly alone to blame for accident have occurred a be rod be now useless knew there be place in maltby where must get repaired be hardly to be expected that cripps must take back what be to be done must pay pound shilling for rod of value slowly took rod to piece put back into canvas bag top joint after did not look amiss yes there be little bit of elasticity in perhaps crack be only fancy perhaps crack be there when got a to reel looked a if ought to work perhaps must if only knew way ah suppose just sent rod back to cripps with message that found did not require must not say have not used if cripps chose to imagine received back just a sent well what harm cripps must be sure to sell to one else else put by have said possessed rod of own if loman have felt quite certain that have damaged rod of course must not think of thing be not at certain thing be not defective to begin with in case be inferior rod that have doubt about cripps be not acting honestly by trying to pas off on a one of best make yes must serve cripps right be lesson to be sure yes quite sure now have be damaged to begin with so boy argued with coquetted with tempter before afternoon be over felt a imagined quite comfortable in own mind over affair rod be tied up again in bag exactly a have be before only wanted opportunity to be returned to mr cripps after loman settled down to evening study thing be against again comfortable a conscience be that top joint must not let alone seemed to get into hand in place of pen to point out word in lexicon in place of finger tried not to mind annoyed what be worse interfered with work so shutting up book imagining change of air might be beneficial went off to callonby study there to gossip for hour two finally rid of tormentor stephen meanwhile have have mr cripps on mind too for afternoon bat have come home be addressed to mr greenfield saint dominic of course taken to oliver who wondered much to receive small size cricket bat in parcel master paul however who be in attendance be able to clear up mystery oh be young brother expect said have got bat coming can say be must be more flush of cash than be to go in for thing like send here paul so paul vanished presently stephen put in appearance blushing anxious looking be yours asked elder brother yes did mr cripps send cripps lock keeper son said must get for say be that good bat oliver nothing out of way say young how much have given for not anything yet mr cripps said must pay in june when get next pocket money what on earth have to do with when get pocket money demanded oliver who

said stephen laughing at idea gave to poor old man where when upon word stephen be jackass who to then stephen confessed elder brother rated soundly for folly till little fellow felt quite miserable ashamed of in end oliver insisted on stephen finding out at once what price of bat be promised must lend brother money for in return for stephen promised to make more purchase of kind without first consulting oliver at juncture wraysford turned up stephen beat retreat with bat over shoulder two friend have not be alone together since fracas in fifth two day before now appeared glad of opportunity of talking over subsequent event suppose know lot of fellow be very sore at for not thrashing loman said wraysford guessed must be be riled too wray not know what must have done suppose

than ever remember to have done before on friday came over just a be going to thrash loman be why did wraysford looked greatly relieved when confession be over be rum fellow noll said after pause of course be all right fellow know reason think showed white feather let think shouted oliver in voice so loud angry that master paul came to door asked what wanted what do care what think continued oliver forgetting about temper can think what like have better let alone 'd like to knock head together so must steady old man said wraysford good humouredly quite agree with say noll think be pity put right with school generally somehow everybody heard loman call fool yesterday know fellow be so clannish that think for credit of fifth something ought to be done let send braddy to thrash then

better soon able to talk like ordinary rational animal then not like animated tom cat good bye so saying departed leaving friend too much amused to be angry at rudeness two friend did steady evening work after thought of nightingale scholarship drove away for time le pleasant recollection slept after far more soundly than loman whose dream be disturbed by everlasting top joint night long reader will no doubt have already decided in own mind whether oliver greenfield did rightly wrongly in putting hand into pocket instead of using to knock down loman certainly did not seem to have done much good at time have lost esteem of comrade have lost very temper have be trying to keep twenty time since event one gave credit for anything better part of valour in whole affair yet that one effort of self restraint be not altogether unmanly act at least so thought wraysford night a lay meditating upon friend trouble found liking none le for latest singular piece of eccentricity chapter ten fourth junior at home stephen before have be fortnight in school found very much at home at saint dominic be not one of exuberant irrepressible boy who take class fellow by storm rise to top of tree almost a soon a touch bottom stephen a reader know be not very clever boy very dashing boy yet somehow managed to get footing among comrade in fourth junior particularly among fellow guinea pig have fought

of resolution at have distributed brandy ball in most handsome manner to particular adherent have be mean of carrying away le than two blanket from next dormitory be pretty good for fortnight add to that have remained steadily at bottom of class during entire period once have received impot imposition from mr rastle will easily be understood that soon gained favour among fellow last cause of celebrity however be one did not please stephen have come to saint dominic with great quantity of good resolution chief of be that must work hard keep out of mischief grieved much to find in aim be succeeding first evening two have worked very diligently at preparation have taken pain with fraction looked out word in caesar have got oliver to look over french loman have volunteered to correct spelling of theme yet stuck at bottom of class other boy went up down openly boasted that have have lesson done for others that have not done at merry time have of stephen down at bottom be in dismal dump must not get up must not get down honest hard work went for nothing so not content to give system longer trial grew more lax in work filched answer to sum out of key copied caesar out of crib be much easier result be same did not get up must not get down oliver catechised now then a to progress received vague answer in reply loman never remembered fag pestered le with lesson stephen be in fact settling down into slough of idleness must have become accomplished dunce in time have not mr rastle come to rescue that gentleman caught new boy in idle mood wandering aimlessly down passage one afternoon ah greenfield be that nothing to do eh come have tea with will in room stephen who have bounded a if shot on hearing master unexpected voice behind turned round blushed very red said thank then looked like criminal just summoned to gallows be right come along master took lad by arm marched off to room here sight of muffin red currant jam in addition to ordinary attraction of tea table somewhat revived stephen drooping spirit make comfortable boy while tea be brewing said mr rastle cheerily have be playing cricket since came only little sir said stephen well if only turn out a good bat a brother how well played in alphabet match stephen be reviving fast now embarked on lively chat about favourite sport by end of tea be brewed mr rastle sitting cheek by jowl at table with muffin jam between presently mr rastle steered talk round to stephen home topic even more delightful than cricket boy launched out into full account of old house mother till tear very nearly stood in eye muffin very nearly stuck in throat mr rastle listened to with sympathetic smile throwing in question now then charmed boy to answer how do like saint dominic presently inquired master suppose have made plenty of friend by time oh yes sir be not a slow a be at first be right will soon get to feel at home how do think be getting on in class stephen be astonished at question if one knew how be getting on in class mr rastle did ala mr rastle must know well enough that stephen be getting on badly not very well be afraid sir thank replied boy not feeling exactly comfortable not be pity be lesson too hard for kindly inquired mr rastle think so be be not sir ah latin exercise thought be very fair in part to day stephen stared at master master looked very pleasantly at stephen copied off raddleston said boy in trembling voice mentally resigning to fate ah said mr rastle laughing be funny thing now greenfield knew that two boy must possibly have translated nobody ' into nullus corpus without making common cause stephen be desperately perplexed have expected regular row on head of confession here be master cracking joke about affair be very sorry did wo do again said be right boy raddleston be infallible much better do venture to say now can tell what latin for nobody ' be without dictionary nemo promptly replied stephen of course therefore if have done exercise must have made that horrid fearful mistake stephen said yes sir meditated come now said mr rastle cheerily be not going to scold if take advice will try do next exercise by yourself of course ca expect to be perfect

difficulty a be sure to have come to be always here in evening will hammer out between school will not be without temptation will find hard always to do duty yet have hope learnt power of prayer surely saviour be able not only to forgive sin also to keep from falling at school boy a elsewhere be safe rule whenever one be in doubt to avoid everything matter who may be tempter of one can not fearlessly speak to one father mother above to heavenly father be afraid of will always be ready to help to guide with holy spirit have cup of tea little talk much a missed at time deeper meaning saved stephen from becoming dunce still blundered boggled over lesson still kept pretty near to bottom form in class felt that master have interest in that acted like magic to soul declined master raddleston professional assistance for future did best must by now then though hesitatingly availed of mr rastle offer took difficulty to head quarter always when did so found master ready glad to help not only that to explain a went along clear way of future obstacle of same sort so thing looked up with stephen wrote jubilant letter home experienced joy of easy conscience felt that have friend at court a long a be member of honourable fraternity of guinea pig stephen greenfield be not likely to be dull at saint dominic politics of lower school be rather intricate guinea pig be not exactly enemy of tadpole rival be always jangling among be true when stephen for second time in one week have hit bramble in eye there be such jubilation among guinea pig that one might have supposed two clan be at dagger drawn be not so at least not always for though fell out among united force against common enemy monitor monitor in opinion of young republican be invention of evil one invented for sole purpose of interfering with for monitor must carry out long cherished scheme of pitched battle on big staircase for asserting right to go down left side when chose up on right a be monitor insisted that must go up on left come down on right be intolerable tyranny for monitor comb paper musical society might give daily recital in top corridor so delight saint dominic what right have monitor to forbid performance confiscate comb be to be endured for monitor once more might perfect in art of pea shooting be such thing ever heard of a fellow must be compelled to shoot pea at wall in privacy of own study instead of at one in passage be shame be scandal be crime on burning question such a guinea pig tadpole sunk petty difference thought felt a one man not least ardent among be stephen come on quick greenfield junior squeaked voice of bramble one afternoon a stephen met on staircase stephen have fought bramble yesterday at four o'clock be to fight again to morrow at past twelve at call of common danger forgot feud tore up stair two step at time beside chronic enemy what be row gasped a flew along row why what do think young bellerby have be doctored for tying string across passage have up before doctor eye bramble be eye indeed one of monitor tripped over got in rage there be bellerby now catching in black hole come on to meeting quick two rushed on joined by one of fellow who have heard terrible news party rushed pellmell into fourth junior class room where be already assembled score more youth shouting stamping howling like madman at sight of bramble acknowledged leader of malcontent quieted down for moment to hear what have to say here be go classically began that hero at clamour swelled twofold by new addition rose louder than ever be go wish have be again yelled bramble have let know once more shout rose high loud in approval of noble sentiment 'd have kicked leg once more howled bramble a soon a must make heard so must kicked leg ought to be hanged screamed bramble will not fag more for wren bellowed bramble will not fag more for greenfield senior thundered paul will not fag more for loman shrieked stephen why of put poison in tea cried one blow up when be in bed with gunpowder flay alive boil in tar throw into lion den who say wo stand longer shouted bramble jumping up on to form hold up hand perfect forest of inky hand arose shout with almost shook ceiling at moment door opened wren appeared effect be magical one became suddenly quiet looked way next time there be noise like said monitor whole class will be detained one hour so saying departed after that indignation meeting be kept up in whisper now then feeling of assembly broke out into word noise be instantly checked if young bellerby have be flogged said bramble in most sepulchral undertone have good mind to fight one of yes one of whispered multitude be a bad a other gasped bramble will let know muttered audience will tell have good mind to to ur ur have good mind to ugh again door opened time be callonby where young raddleston what be young beggar up to be raddleston here yes mildly answered voice of master raddleston who moment ago have nearly broken blood vessel in endeavour to scream in whisper come here then fag meekly obeyed oh greenfield junior said callonby a be turning to depart loman want to know when be going to get tea be to go at once say stephen obeyed be very humble in explaining to loman that have forgotten be case time meeting in fourth class room lasted most of afternoon a oratory in whisper be tedious constant repetition of same sentiment however patriotic be monotonous flagged considerably in spirit towards end degenerated into one of usual wrangle between guinea pig tadpole in midst of master bramble left chair went off in meekest manner possible to get wren to help with sum for next day stephen meanwhile be engaged in doing little piece of business for loman of more must be said in following chapter chapter eleven in toil afternoon of famous indignation meeting in fourth junior be afternoon of week mr cripps younger putting aside for season anxiety responsibility of public duty in maltby usually devoted to pursuit of gentle craft at worthy father cottage by gusset weir loman who be aware of circumstance on whose spirit that restless top joint have continued to prey ever since evening of misadventure week ago determined to avail of opportunity of returning unlucky fishing rod into hand from have received therefore instructed stephen to take up to lock house with note to effect that having changed mind in matter since speaking to cripps found must not require rod therefore returned with many thanks for mr cripps trouble stephen little suspecting questionable nature of errand undertook commission duly delivered rod letter into hand of mr cripps who greatly astonished by swearing very violently at content of letter well said when have exhausted vocabulary not small one of expletive well of grinning jackanapes be coolest go do take for fool stephen to whom question appeared to be directly applied disclaimed idea of kind added know what mean young master right tell mr loman will wait upon one fine day see if here be given up whole blessed day to serve pot of money out of pocket here go not penny for pain chuck thing back on 'ands a cool a coocumber because be changed mind will let have bit of mind tell mr gentleman schoolboy see if ai going to be robbed not by blessed monkey ever wrote on slate will wait upon see if stephen to whom whole of oration be garnished with word that can hardly set down in print degrade ourselves by suggesting be about a intelligible a if have be hebrew thought better to make reply sorrowed inwardly to find nice man a mr cripps must posse so short temper landlord of cockchafer soon recovered from temporary annoyance even proceeded to apologise to stephen for warmth of language will excuse young gentleman said be plain spoken man be there wo deny be bit put out about here rod first go off will excuse of course mean offence to mister loman who be one of nicest young gentleman ever met of course if 'd ' paid seventy bob out of own pocket must give turn leastways if be struggling honest working man like be snivelled old mr cripps who have entered during last speech be benny boy honest partisan be what be who know what be to be in want of shillin ' to buy clo ' two for little childer what particular little childer mr cripps senior son be specially interested in one knew for of be blessed with however be one of old mr cripps heart moving phrase one be rude enough to ask question stephen did not on present occasion feel moved to respond to old man lament cripps junior with more adroitness than filial affection hustled old gentleman out of door never mind said to stephen be silly old man always pretend be starvin ' if believe be thousand pound stowed away somewhere on ' y wish added with sigh 'd give taste of for 'ard up 'ill work makin ' end meet particular when man deceived by party matter will pull through see stephen once more did not feel called upon to pursue line of conversation therefore changed subject oh mr cripps how much be that bat bat bless if have nearly forgot about ai beauty now yes pretty well said stephen whose friend have one abused bat who be little disappointed in expectation pretty well like must be funny cricketer young gentleman to call bat only pretty well suppose want to take back too here mr cripps looked very fierce oh said stephen hurriedly only want to know what be to pay for oh come now need mind about will keep know a if wanted money have have even green boy like stephen must not fail to wonder why if mr cripps be a hard up a have just described must now be so anxious to represent a not in want of money please want to know price a if be going to name price to young gentleman like please about will not be disappointed if give only eighteenpence if think twelve bob be handsome well let be can struggle on somehow be uncomfortable for stephen who too green fortunately to comprehend drift of mr cripps gentle hint again asked that must name price time mr cripps answered more precisely well that there bat be worth guinea if want to know will say sovereign for cash down stephen whistled long drawn whistle of dismay sovereign ca pay thought must be about seven shilling did may think what like be price be lucky to get at that will have to send back ca afford so much said stephen despondingly not if know will have none of second hand bat if know come young gentleman may be poor man be not fool will find out if have of nonsense do suppose have nothing to do wait on jackanapes like mate error there be will do if like well governor will know about stephen be dreadfully uncomfortable though to knowledge have done nothing wrong felt terribly guilty at bare notion of doctor being informed of transaction with mr cripps besides greatly in awe of vague threat held out by gentleman did not venture on further argument bidding hasty farewell returned a fast a must to saint dominic wondering whatever oliver must say sorely repenting day when first be tempted to think of unlucky bat made clean breast of to brother that evening who of course called as everything else complimentary be deservedly angry however stephen have reason to consider lucky to posse elder brother at school who have little more shrewdness than be determined debt must be paid at once without even waiting to write home by borrowing ten shilling from wraysford adding to residue of own pocket money sovereign be raised dispatched that very night to mr cripps after oliver commanded brother to sit down write full confession of folly home ask for money promising never to make such fool of again task small boy with much shame trembling at heart accomplished in due time answer came from mother not only relieved mind paid off debt to oliver wraysford once for closed business of treble cane splice bat must have be well for loman if must have got out of difficulty a easily a satisfactorily ever since have gathered from stephen mr cripps wrath on receiving returned rod have be haunted by dread lest landlord of cockchafer must march up to saint dominic possibly make exposure of unhappy business before doctor whole school therefore after long hesitation misgiving determined to call at cockchafer try in way to settle matter one thing reassured if cripps have discovered crack fracture in rod must have heard of long before now if have not then longer time le chance be there of damage being laid at door so let three week elapse then went to maltby cockchafer be small unpretentious tavern frequented chiefly by carrier tradesman regret to say not wholly unknown to of boy of saint dominic who be foolish enough to persuade that skittle billiards beer be luxury worth risk incurred by breaking one of rule of school boy be permitted to enter place of refreshment except confectioner in maltby under penalty of severe punishment might in bad case mean expulsion loman therefore monitor sixth form boy have to take more than ordinary precaution to reach cockchafer unobserved succeeded in doing to satisfaction a well a to trepidation found mr cripps younger at home ho young shaver be that worthy greeting here be at last be not encouraging to begin with sounded very much a if mr cripps have be looking forward to visit however loman put a bold face a must on to replied hullo cripps how be be long time since saw jolly day be jolly replied mr cripps looking very gloomy drawing glass of beer for young gentleman before ordered loman did not like at there be something about cripps manner that made feel very uncomfortable oh cripps presently began in a off hand manner a must assume under depressing circumstance oh cripps about rod by way hope did mind sending back fact be here followed lie till that moment have not be in speaker mind to tell fact be find be to get present of rod summer at home else of course must have kept mr cripps said nothing began polishing up pewter pot with napkin hope got back right continued loman who felt a if must say something be such fragile thing know thought 'd just leave in bag not touch send straight back for fear must be damaged there be queer smile about mr cripps mouth a asked then did have look at even well thought must

awaiting have be to all time demanded paper be sold out said stephen tried seven place loman have eagerly caught up opened paper while stephen nervously made explanation took further heed of fag who presently seeing be no longer wanted relieved to get out of reach of question prudently retired glance sufficed to confirm bad news about derby sir patrick have won be fact therefore loman owed cripps friend between thirty pound without least possibility of paying one thing be certain must see cripps on saturday trust to luck though of late have not be very trustworthy to pull through somehow ala

did give rap over knuckle what do mean exclaimed loman angrily half drawing supposed sprained hand out of sling shut up fellow interposed raleigh authoritatively baynes will play in eleven to morrow instead of loman so there be end of matter loman be sorely mortified have expected defection must create quite sensation that class fellow must be inconsolable at accident instead of that have only

struck unless get nightingale of course say cripps will wait till september what three month how do suppose be to find bread to eat till then exclaimed mr cripps oh do said loman be certain to be able

quitted cockchafer with a light heart a if have actually paid off penny of debt of course be safe to get why ever did think of before wo just work rest of term nothing like having object when be grinding with philosophical reflection re entered saint dominic unobserved rejoined spectator in cricket field just in time to witness very exciting finish to fiercely contested encounter chapter fourteen sixth versus school never have sixth versus school match be looked forward to with more excitement at saint dominic than present one party feeling have be running high term intensified on one hand by unpopularity of of monitor on other by defiant attitude of fifth tone of organ dominican lower school naturally looked on with interest at rivalry between two head form result of a might have be expected be reverse of beneficial for discipline of school generally if big boy set bad example disregard rule what can one expect of little one so far anything like conflict have be avoided fifth have cheeked sixth sixth have snubbed fifth with exception of loman assault on oliver have not led to fight war have be strictly one of word now however opposing force be to be ranged face to face at cricket to junior school opportunity seemed grand one for display of partisanship one side other school eleven on occasion moreover consisted exclusively of fifth form boy most unusual circumstance one seemed to be result quite a much of management a of accident at least so said disappointed hero of fourth match be in fact whatever be formally styled match between sixth fifth partisan of side looked upon a decisive event in respective glory of two top form now day have come saint dominic trooped out to meadow there be rush of small boy a usual for front bench stephen found along with trusty ally paul equally trusty enemy bramble ten other guinea pig tadpole wedged like sardine upon form must comfortably hold six eagerly canvassing prospect of struggle sixth be going to win in single inning if fellow want to know announced bramble with authority of one who know not bit of replied paul fifth be safe to win tell have got decent bowler said raddleston never mind said stephen loman not going to play for sixth be sprained wrist hip hip hurrah yelled paul be jolly be sure to be licked now be sure be out of yes look at there with arm in sling stephen pointed to where loman stood in ordinary clothes talking to of fellow well be piece of luck said paul who be to take place baynes say be use though be too cock sure two growled bramble say will beat even if loman play got brandy ball left greenfield similar speculation hope be being exchanged round field when at last fifth went out to field callonby wren went in to bat for sixth might have heard cat sneeze so breathless be excitement amid solemn silence first few ball be bowled third ball of first over came straight on to wren bat who played neatly back to bowler be not run only simple block be first play of match so quite enough to loosen tongue of small boy who yelled howled cheered a frantically a if six have be run wicket taken ice once broken ball hit be marked applauded a if empire depended on be in midst of gradually rising excitement that loman slipped quietly unobserved from scene betook to errand on accompanied in preceding chapter two sixth men went quickly to work at end of second over have scored eight then callonby in stepping back to draw one of wraysford ball knocked down wicket how small boy yelled at sight of raleigh going in second soon silenced mean hard work by sending in captain now said paul like more do said stephen always knock be bowling about oh bother be brother bowling said master paul quite unconscious of wounding one feeling be pity have got one better stephen coloured up at wondered what made paul horrid boy better look out for eye said bramble cheerily captain always knock up way over square leg head there be general buzz of youngster round field a hero of school walked up to wicket coolly turned to face be bowling scorer in tent hurriedly sharpened pencil big fellow who have be standing up to watch opening over sat down on grass made comfortable something be going to happen evidently captain be in meant business gripped ball hard in hand walked back to end of run play cried umpire amid dead silence ball shot from bowler hand next moment there rose shout loud enough to deafen saint dominic ball be flying fifty foot up in air raleigh be slowly walking bat in hand back to tent have only moment ago quitted captain have be clean bowled first ball who will describe excitement yelling cheering consternation followed paul got up danced hornpipe on bench bramble kicked boy nearest to well bowled sir shouted hard line screamed others hurrah for fifth will beat yet sixth such be few of shout audible above general clamour a for stephen be wild with joy be staunch partisan of fifth in case be nothing to fact that be brother own brother nobody else who have bowled that eventful ball who be at moment hero of saint dominic stephen felt a proud elated a if have bowled ball must afford to be absolutely patronising to around on head of achievement be bad ball of oliver said to paul can bowl very well when try be beastly fluke roared bramble determined to see merit in exploit shut up make row said stephen with bland smile of forgiveness bramble promised adversary to shut up after little more discussion altercation jubilation excitement subsided man went in while fifth be in ecstasy controlled feeling however contenting with clapping oliver on back till be nearly dead speculating on chance of beating adversary in single inning have not won match yet winter be next man in wren fell to work very speedily in decidedly business like way big hit be made score crawled up by one two steadily longer be at steadier played loud cheer announced posting of thirty on signal board still score went on now be slip now bye now quiet cut bravo well played cried raleigh men frequently captain by way be in excellent spirit despite misfortune thirty five forty fifth began to look hot puzzled batsman be evidently far too much at home with bowling change must be made even though be to put on only second rate bowler tom senior be put on be nothing like a good bowler a wraysford oliver ricketts bowled very ordinary slow lob without twist shoot be usually knocked about plentifully appeared likely to be fate now for wren got hold of first ball knocked right over into scorer tent for five fifth groaned must have torn wretched tom to piece next ball be more lucky winter hit indeed hit up sky high over bowler head before reached ground bullinger be safe underneath be with sigh of relief that fifth saw awkward partnership broken up score be at forty eight for three wicket quite enough too after inning progressed more evenly men came in went out more a usual contributing three four one two ten twelve among latter be baynes who at last moment will be remembered have be put into eleven to replace loman by careful play managed to put together ten greatly to own delight not little to surprise of friend in due time last wicket of sixth fell to total of eighty four run small boy on bench have have leisure to abate ardour by time bramble have recovered spirit paul stephen looked little blue a saw total signalled eighty four be lot said stephen paul nodded glumly ya have how do like guinea pig jeered bramble hope will get half a much knew how must be two friend listened to taunt in silent sorrow wished next inning must begin did presently not very brilliantly fifth only managed to score fifty one to total wraysford be only player who made anything like good scoring oliver got out for six ricketts for nine tom senior braddy for duck egg altogether be meagre performance thing looked very gloomy for fifth when for second time adversary took wicket thing never turn out at cricket a one expects however second inning of sixth be exception to rule only made thirty six run stephen paul be hoarse with yelling a first one wicket then went down for scarcely run raleigh baynes seemed only two who must stand up at to bowling of oliver wraysford even effort must not keep wicket up for long one saw now that final inning must be desperate struggle fifth wanted sixty nine to be equal seventy to win question be must do in time stephen confederate felt weight of question so oppressive that left irritating company of mr bramble walked off joined to group of fourth form fellow who be watching match with sulky interest evidently sore that have none of men in school eleven will never do serve right said one why did put mansfield in eleven bank be far more use than fisher braddy for

before blow crashed inwards leaving breach large enough to admit football be unlucky piece of success for oliver for next moment felt foot grabbed by dozen small hand within held firmly rendering unable to stir from ridiculous position in vain struggled raged be tight prisoner at mercy of captor be must do to stand on one foot clinging wildly to handle of door in dignified attitude wraysford presently found friend in such state of passion fury a have never before seen to rap array of inky knuckle inside with ruler so disengage captive foot be work of minute oliver stood for moment facing door trembling with anger wraysford taking gently by arm said come along old boy there be something in voice look brought sudden flush into pale face of angry oliver without word turned from door accompanied friend back to study there be long talk lecture remorseful confession evening two talked perhaps le than usual when did be about ordinary school topic reference be made either then for

tadpole on strike if anything have be required to make strike of guinea pig tadpole serious matter affair of greenfield senior right foot undoubtedly have that effect eclat that heroic exploit lent to mutiny be simply marvellous story be told with fifty exaggeration over school one report said that whole body of monitor have besieged fourth junior door have be repulsed with heavy slaughter declared that oliver have be captured by fag branded on sol of foot with g t to commemorate emancipation of guinea pig tadpole third veracious narrative went so far a to say that upper fifth several member of sixth have humbly come begged forgiveness for past misdeed be henceforth to become fag of late victim true untrue a story be amount of glory accompanied beginning of strike there be sufficient sense of common danger to unite youngster in very close bond rarely caught guinea pig tadpole alone now walked about in dozen be very wide awake assembled on possible occasion in room fortified door with chair desk zeal with fiery oration excited conjuration one wretched youth who first evening have be weak enough to poke master fire be expelled ignominiously from community for week afterwards lived life of outcast in saint dominic youngster be in earnest mistake stephen greenfield a be only natural did not altogether find cause for exultation over event led to strike for whole day be very angry on brother account threatened to stand aloof from revolution altogether when be explained to must lead to general smash up of strike when be further explained that fellow who caught hold of big brother right foot must possibly be expected to know to whom that foot belonged relented entered a enthusiastically a one into business indeed if rebel have be like stephen fag at saint dominic must be on strike to day contemplated martyrdom with utmost equanimity inquisition never saw more determined victim morning after famous cricket feast gave first opportunity of sacrificing for good of country loman met in passage after first class why did turn up get breakfast idle young vagabond inquired sixth form boy half good humouredly little guessing what be in wind be not idle said stephen then what do mean by not doing work be not work loman opened eye in amazement stared at bold young hero a if have dropped from cloud what cried what do say be not work repeated stephen blushing very determined look here young fellow said loman when be sure that have really heard correctly play of little game with will be sorry for stephen said nothing waited with tremor for what be to follow loman be hardly bully naturally be always easier for to be civil than to be angry especially with small boy cool defiance on part of fag be too much for one civility loman began to be angry what do mean by said catching boy by arm stephen wrenched away arm stood dogged silent nothing must have irritated loman more to be defied resisted by youngster like be experience quite new to just come to room said gripping fag angrily by shoulder will see who be master of two stephen be forced to submit allowed to be dragged to study now said loman shutting door now said stephen a boldly a must wondering what on earth be to become of be going to do what be told not demanded loman not what tell replied stephen promptly not exactly cheerfully oh said loman face becoming crimson be quite sure yes said stephen then take said loman be sharp box on ear suddenly administered stephen recoiled moment only moment have expected something good deal worse if be must brave out yet hit said defiantly loman must not stand to be defied vanity be weak point nothing offended vanity so much a to find one a determined a took up ruler in passion flung at luckless stephen head struck hard on cheek blood flushed to boy face a stood moment half stunned smarting with pain confronting adversary then rushed blindly in flung upon bully of course be match small boy be at mercy of big one latter be indeed taken aback for moment at fury of young assailant impotent a be be might have defended with single hand might have carried boy under one arm out into passage evil spirit have be roused within that spirit knew mercy struck out fought little foeman a if have be one of own size strength for wild feeble blow stephen aimed loman aimed hard straight blow back if stephen wavered loman followed in a must in professional boxing match when at last small boy gave up exhausted bleeding scarcely able to stand foe administered parting blow if have struck no other must have stamped a coward for ever now exclaimed loman looking down on victim will do what be told now eh be critical moment for poor stephen after be strike worth hardship single word must have saved whereas if again defied enemy be up with did waver moment lucky for did for just then door opened simon entered stephen saw chance slipping to open door mustered up energy to cry a loud a must no wo with made good escape into passage a done up a small boy well must be without being quite floored dozen eager friend be at hand to aid in stopping bleeding of hero nose to apply raw steak to black eye story of desperate encounter flew on wing of fame over school glory pride of youngster reached climax when afternoon stephen with face on one side eye bright green yellow under lip about twice ordinary thickness took accustomed place in arithmetic class of fourth junior why greenfield exclaimed mr rastle when in due time young hero turn came to stand up answer question what have be doing to yourself nothing sir remarked stephen mildly how did come by black eye asked master fighting sir said stephen rather pompously ah what did say forty eight sixth be equal to be mr rastle way very rarely hauled boy over coal before whole class after lesson beckoned stephen into study be afraid got worst of fight said stephen who by time knew mr rastle too well to be afraid of too well also not to be quite frank with answered meekly fellow be bigger than must guess that by state of face now want to know what fight be about though dare say 'd like to tell stephen be boiling to tell small boy have such peculiar reason for fighting know one can understand be because hush did tell wo hear what be about sir said mr rastle sharply did shake hand afterwards did wo exclaimed stephen forgetting in indignation to whom be speaking then said mr rastle quietly write out one hundred line of caesar greenfield when have recollected how to behave will talk more about can go mr rastle be queer man never took thing a one expected when stephen expected to be furious be a mild a lamb there be making out be certain stephen left room good deal more crestfallen than entered have hoped to win mr rastle sympathy admiration by account of grievance instead of that be sent off in disgrace with imposition for being rude feeling anything hero even applause of friend failed to console quite besides head ached badly bruise on cheek have scarcely felt among other wound now began to swell grow painful altogether be in war be groaning over imposition late that evening in class room feeling in dreadful dump wishing have never come to saint dominic when hand laid on shoulder made start looked up saw mr rastle greenfield said master kindly how much of imposition have done seventy line sir hum will do time have better get to bed oh sir exclaimed stephen moved far more by mr rastle kind tone than by letting off thirty line of caesar be so sorry be rude to well be sorry too so will say no more about why what crack must have got on cheek yes sir be ruler did that ruler then be fair fight now begin telling about dare say be very heroic stood up against terrible odds have very black eye very sore cheek now so have better get to bed a fast a can certainly pale bruised upturned face of boy did not look very bright at moment stephen greenfield went off to bed night in perturbed state of mind body have stuck loyally to promise not to fag have earned universal admiration of comrade on other hand have be awfully knocked about almost a bad have be effectively snubbed by mr rastle did not exactly know what to think of have done fine deed foolish one ought to do to morrow like sensible little man went sound asleep over question forgot about till morrow when woke stephen be like giant refreshed eye be certainly rather more brilliant yellow than day before cheek still wore dull red flush somehow felt none of misgiving dump have oppressed night before be full of hope again full of courage guinea pig must never charge with treachery desertion what have gone through already in good cause must go through again with determination dressed went down to school loman whose summons expected moment to hear did not put to necessity of renewed struggle from quarter too encouraging report came in from various insurgent paul announced that greenfield senior took like lamb bramble recounted how nigger driver a be pleased to call wren have chased twice round playground over top of cricket shed without being able to capture most of others have exploit equally heroic to boast of thing be looking up in fourth junior spent merry morning young rebel wondering in whisper over lesson what sixth fifth form fellow have done without with great glee imagined raleigh blacking own boot pembury boiling own egg very idea of such wonder quite frightened at rate saint dominic must come to standstill altogether serve right said bramble want lesson wish 'd two fellow to strike against instead of one one enough if strike back said stephen with rueful grin master bramble evinced sympathy by laughing aloud say look just like clown doe padger with eye sort of colour cheek like house on fire very well said stephen wish 'd got cheek bramby got cheek enough of own guess put in paul whereat master bramble fired up quarrel became imminent however stephen prevented by calling back attention to own picturesque countenance mind eye hurt can tell fellow cheek awful always said 'd got awful cheek of own young greenfield said bramble laughing a if be inventor of joke stephen glowered at well said so put in bramble little mildly for since stephen exploit yesterday that young hero have advanced good deal in respect of fellow say why stick lotion something on will never get right if will padger padger suggested that young greenfield might possibly have to have cheek cut off if did look out paul said sooner stashed cheek better result of friendly witty conference be that stephen took into head to cure cheek to end applied for leave from mr rastle to go down afternoon to maltby to get something from chemist mr rastle gave leave told best sort of lotion to ask for so a soon a afternoon school be over young champion sallied boldly forth on errand felt very self satisfied forgiving to world a walked along there be doubt about be hero one seemed to take interest in black eye sore cheek from mr rastle downwards very likely that fight of with loman yesterday must be recorded a long a saint dominic remained a event saved lower school from tyranny of upper way to chemist lay past turning up to cockchafer idea occurred to to turn in on way back talk over event of hour with mr cripps whom have not seen since bagatelle lesson week ago be sure that good gentleman must sympathise with most likely praise in case must be only civil after promising to come see sometimes to look in only thing be that cockchafer one might say about be public house private door at side hardly sufficed to satisfy stephen that be not breaking rule by going in must not have entered by public door for world thought did occur to be there very much difference after between one door other however have not answered question before found inside shaking hand with mr cripps that gentleman be of course delighted profuse in gratitude to young swell for looking up listened with profound interest sympathy to story made very fierce remark about what must do to that there loman if got hold of then subject of bagatelle happened to come up presently stephen be again delighting astonishing good gentleman by skill in game then in due time came out that boy mother have bought bicycle be going to learn in holiday resolution mr cripps highly approved of be certain clever young fellow like must learn in time greatly pleased stephen before parting mr cripps insisted on lending young friend lantern for bicycle when rode in dark be specially good one said young gentleman must easily return to after holiday so on altogether be delightful visit stephen wondered more than ever how of fellow must think ill of mr cripps oh say said boy at parting do what said must to loman be not afraid of know 'd like to knock ugly head off for cried mr cripps indignantly please 'd rather not dare say be sorry for will see be growled mr cripps besides have forgiven said stephen ought to have told tale of so mind do mr cripps will will see said mr cripps good bye for present young gentleman come again soon so at peace with world particularly with stephen strolled back to saint dominic whistling merrily chapter seventeen doctor among guinea pig dominican appeared once more before holiday a might have be expected besides usual article at expense of sixth form made particularly merry over rebellion of guinea pig tadpole pembury be not fellow to give quarter in own particular line of attack must be confessed have proud satisfaction of making unfortunate young victim smart leading article of present number bore suggestive title thank goodness began a follows thank goodness be at last rid of pest have made saint dominic hideous for month past at single blow with single clap of hand have sent guinea pig tadpole packing can now breathe pure air no longer will have to put up with plague be to be spared disgust of seeing much more of talking to hearing hideous voice no longer will morning milk be burned longer will herring be grilled to cinder longer will jam be purloined longer will book door handle be made abominable by contact with filthy hand thank goodness doctor never did more patriotic deed than small animal be in future to be kept to own quarter will be forbidden liberty have so long abused of mixing with better be a well for party if event must have brightened last day of term be so on before manifesto swarm of youngster puzzled on day of publication with little bewilderment fury have refused to allow of number to act a policeman have secretly be making merry over embarrassment of late persecutor wondering whatever must be able to say for humiliated self in dominican lo here be article if meant anything meant that heroic rebellion of junior be regarded not with dismay with positive triumph by very fellow have be intended to squash what doe mean padger asked bramble who never much of scholar be quite unable to master meaning of be pack of crams replied padger not quite sure of sense mean said fellow say be jolly glad to get rid of eh yelled bramble oh say fellow come to meeting jolly glad be bit glad say so said paul hold hard bramble let read rest be friend must do to restrain ardent bramble from summoning meeting on spot to denounce dominican crams managed to hold steady while read on doctor never did more pat pat ri what do call patriotic deed than hullo say look here cried stephen turning quite yellow doctor in say bramble small animal be padger be to be kept in own quarter whew there be go what shrieked bramble who say so doctor never said so will do what choose never said so bother doctor who be coming to meeting eh at moment grave form of doctor senior appeared in midst of group just in time to hear master bramble last complimentary shout head master be in most favourable time object of terror to guilty conscienced youth of fourth junior sight even of back often sufficed to quell tumult here stood face to face with unhappy victim one of whom have just cried bother doctor of whom have by word gesture approved of sentiment why must not pavement yawn swallow of must not at moment have given thousand pound if have to be standing anywhere where be go to class room said doctor sternly eyeing culprit one by one wait there for slunk off meekly in obedience to order waited hour of vengeance in blank dismay dr senior did not keep long in suspense however slow firm step sounded presently down corridor at sound wretched culprit quaked with horror mr rastle be in room rose a usual to greet chief boy also a by custom bound rose in place good morning mr rastle said doctor be boy here yes sir have just called over ah what class come on first english literature sir well mr rastle will take class morning please instead of groan of horror passed through rank of unhappy guinea pig tadpole at word bramble looked wildly about if haply might escape by window lie hid in desk while stephen paul padger other ringleader gave up for lost mentally bade farewell to joy for ever what have boy be reading inquired dr senior of mr rastle grey elegy sir have just got through oh grey elegy said doctor then a if forgetting where be began repeating to curfew toll knell of parting day lowing herd wind slowly o'er lea first boy what can tell about curfew first boy be well up in curfew rattled off full true particular account of fine old english institution much to everybody satisfaction doctor went on repeating two three verse till came to line rude forefather of hamlet sleep what doe line mean asked of boy on second desk boy scarcely knew what meant boy below did be quite eager for question to be passed on be passed on genius answered promptly four old men four rude old men shouted next seeing chance four rude old men who used to sleep in church cried ready to cap rest doctor passed question on further gravely explained meaning of line then proceeded with repetition in rather sadder voice now again stopped short demanded explanation of obscure phrase answer to be now correct now hazy now brilliantly original on whole be not satisfactory when for change doctor gave up reciting made boy read effect be still worse one boy quite master of elocution spoilt whole beauty of line grandeur hear with disdainful smile short simple annals of poor by reading animal instead of annals while of equally zoological turn of mind announced that on fond beast parting soul relies instead of breast climax of animal mania be reached when wretched bramble finally pitched upon to go on in spite of effort to hide rendered passage haply hoary headed swain may say oft have seen at peep of dawn etcetera a happy hairy headed swine may say be little too much will do sir said doctor sternly will do what be name sir bramble please sir well bramble how long have be in class two year sir have be while on bottom desk yes please sir sir displeases be dunce sir then to bramble utter despair to terror of other unprofitable member of class doctor proceeded to catechise sharply unhappy youth on general knowledge of subject taught during term a might be expected exhibition be miserable one bramble be found wanting in particular simplest question must hardly coax correct answer out of whereas ordinary inquiry be hopelessly beyond power mixed up william conqueror william of orange subtracted what ought to be multiplied floundered about between conjunction preposition in sickening way doctor did not spare went ruthlessly on exposing boy ignorance first in one thing then bramble stood trembled perspired before wished be dead question still came on if have answered single thing correctly must have be different matter knew nothing believe did know what twice two be be one question doctor did not ask a to french latin grammar euclid clock on wall knew a much of a bramble came to end at last come here bramble said doctor gravely come here added pointing to stephen paul four five others of party who have be reading dominican that morning luckless youngster obeyed when stood in row before dreaded doctor bottom form half of bottom form one be empty now boy began head master very gravely have intended to examine to day from something one of say felt rather anxious to know how of be doing in study dozen boy be particularly anxious to know of because heard talking to day a if be most important boy in whole school be most important for be most ignorant require in future will receive closest looking after little boy said doctor turning to row of abashed culprit take word of warning from be silly a well a dunce think a long a know least of one in school can pretend to rule school hope of have be led to see to day be not a clever a must like to be if try work hard stick like men to lesson will know more than do now when do know more will see that best way for little boy to get on be not by giving ridiculous air by doing duty steadily in class living at peace with one submitting quietly to discipline of school let hear more of recent nonsense will be going off in day two for holiday take advice think over what have said next term let see in right mind determined to work hard do part honestly for credit of good old school go to place boy so doctor visitation came to end made very deep impression on youthful member of fourth junior most of felt very much ashamed of nearly one felt veneration admiration for doctor greatly heightened only few incorrigibles like bramble professed to make light of scene through have just passed even be evident be considerably chastened by experience that evening after first bed bell dr senior requested of master to meet with for few minute in study do of know asked head master anything about newspaper dominican see hanging outside fifth door hear great many boy talking about said mr jellicott of fifth be joint production of several of boy in form indeed fifth form paper said doctor have one perused have said mr rastle seems to to be cleverly managed though perhaps little personal ah only natural with schoolboy said doctor must like to see can fetch rastle be nailed to wall said mr rastle smiling like luther manifesto can get one of boy dare say to unfasten for do said doctor if mountain will not come to mahomet know disciple must go to mountain eh mr harrison think might venture out peruse where hang so half stealthily when whole school be falling asleep dr senior colleague stepped out into passage by aid of candle satisfied curiosity a to mysterious dominican good deal of humour be of course lost upon a must hardly be expected to understand force of allusion contained saw quite enough to enable to gather general tenor of paper amused concerned show considerable ability on part of editor said doctor after master have returned to study rather fear tone may give offence to of boy in sixth for instance fancy there be considerable amount of rivalry between two head form said mr harrison if

of bravery have spoiled pleasure of last term there seemed prospect of getting through with le risk to quick temper than before a for sixth fifth have forgiven offence must have be quite prepared have be allowed to live in peace with senior forget dissension of summer term be not allowed event happened early in term served to revive old animosity between two head class at saint dominic for reason best known to wise being who presided over management principal examination remove of year took place not a in most school at end of midsummer term at beginning of autumn term about michaelmas consequently now with examination looming in distance everybody who have anything to hope for from hard work settled down to study like mad cricket be over for year football have not begun except boating there be not much doing out of door for reason season be favourable for work study used to be bear garden now suddenly assumed appearance of respectability quiet book took place of boxing glove pen of fencing stick disorderly idler who have be in habit of invading at will quarter of industrious be now given to understand must kick up heel elsewhere might not want to grind others did idler of fifth to whom warning be addressed on hand have nothing for to obey feeling greatly ill used to retire sadly to spot where must kick up row to casting about for spot happened that braddy ricketts one day lit almost by accident on old empty study year since have be monitor room be now empty tenantless at once occurred to two astute hero that must be magnificent place for boxing match in other study one be always banging against corner of table tripping over fender here there be absolutely nothing four bare wall to interfere with anybody called in two more friend tom senior who declared be splendid find four thereupon took formal possession of new territory inaugurated event by terrific eight handed match nothing must have be more satisfactory room be well out of way studious one of fifth be spared annoyance riotous one have asylum to go to one be bit worse for move one on contrary found decidedly better go kick up row in monitor room became quite common objurgation in form among diligent a common in fact a come along old man have out in monitor room be among idler a ill luck must have delightful retreat happened to be situated immediately over study occupied by wren of sixth that worthy hero seated one afternoon over book be startled by terrific noise followed by vibration followed by rattling of tumbler in cupboard followed by dull heavy thud over head tempted to believe that earthquake be in progress that one of chimney stack have fallen on to roof when however noise be repeated with be blended laughter shout of now then let have well parried bravo bully like wren began to change mind laid down pen walked up stair to upper landing where at once noise guided to old monitor room then truth dawned upon stayed long enough to get pretty clear idea of who new lodger be then prudently retired without attempting parley single handed next morning when festive rioter of fifth approached once more scene of revel what be amazement rage to find door locked following notice on piece of school paper affixed to panel monitor room room be closed by direction of monitor might have knocked over with feather so stupefied be by announcement stared at door stared at one then broke out into tempest of rage blackguard what do mean exclaimed braddy tearing down paper crushing up in hand monitor room indeed cried ricketts will let see whose room be kick open door ca said tom senior did kick open door between lock be weak one soon gave way once inside evicted one indulged triumph by uproar of more than usual vehemence longing that might tempt into clutch daring intruder who have presumed to interfere with possession one came have fling undisturbed before quitted stronghold one of number by diligent searching have found in lock of neighbouring study door key must fit theirs repairing therefore catch damaged by late forcible entry calmly locked door behind when went affixed to in identical place where other notice have hung fifth form private study not to be entered without permission of course news of interesting adventure soon spread for day two diligent a well a idle on side looked on with increasing interest for issue of contest for while fifth have best of defied enemy to turn out procured fixed additional lock on door sixth threatened to report matter to doctor summoned invader for last time to capitulate invader laughed to scorn protested room belonged to leave must not for monitor in world monitor retired fifth enjoyed triumph next day doctor abruptly entered fifth form room said there be unoccupied room at end of top landing boy in class have be making use of to annoyance of other boy room please remember be not to be entered in future without permission checkmate with vengeance for fifth event be trivial in re kindled once more with redoubled heat old animosity between two head form at saint dominic although original quarrel have be confined to only dozen individual became now party question of intense interest sixth who be triumphant party must afford to treat matter lightly smile over demeanour irritated already enraged fifth past description two form cut one dead in passage fifth must gladly have provoked rival to blow like sensible men sixth kept right side of law refused to have anything to do with challenge daily hurled at a might be expected affair did not long remain secret from rest of school fourth senior a body stood up for sixth third second on whole sided with fifth when came to junior school guinea pig tadpole other partisanship be thrown quite into

told did padger padger peeped through door saw oh eye wo kick up shine about will let out on see if bah public house boy potboy yah stephen only answer to be book accurately shied at head of enemy subsequent proceeding at meeting be trifle animated otherwise not interesting to reader chief result be that guinea pig emerged a uncompromising champion for fifth tadpole equally strong for sixth while stephen felt decidedly uncomfortable a to consequence of bramble discovery of secret visit last term to cockchafer stephen have in confidential moment during holiday told oliver of visit of intimacy with mr cripps elder brother be very angry astonished when heard of set before boy in measured term risk be running by breaking one of rule of school more than that said cripps be blackguard

momentary struggle in oliver breast here be very opportunity hour two ago have so eagerly desired whole picture of afternoon adventure came up before mind felt blood tingle a eye caught sight of stephen persecutor must pay off score now loman saw changed colour evidently guessed what be passing through enemy mind for quick flush came to face angry scowl to brow oliver for one moment slackened pace then suddenly there came upon vision of stephen appealing face a interceded that afternoon for boy who have done such mischief vision settled thing hurriedly resuming walk oliver passed loman with averted eye went on way well said stephen in midst of undressing a brother entered dormitory be there will see in morning said oliver good night stee good night noll old man say be brick to a boy

breakfast oliver joined doctor in study made clean breast to there then of stephen delinquency have evidently taken right step in doing so for hearing thus frankly confessed by elder brother dr senior be disposed to take much more lenient view of case than must have information come to through other channel at best offence be grave one oliver more than once felt anxious at sight of head master long face during narrative however when be over fear be at once dispelled by doctor saying well greenfield have done very proper thing in telling be straightforward a well a brotherly act brother seems to have be very foolish have doubt have got lesson have better send to after morning service so much relieved oliver went off reported to grateful stephen success of mission two boy went off to school

compliment hullo say look here wraysford said beaming stephen be going to cut loman fag for be jolly depends on whether have want guinea pig in study mind stephen face fell for even privilege a

subdued thankful frame of mind too often have weekly service be to occasion of mere empty form when with head full of school worry school fun have scarcely heard much le heeded what be said to day however be different stephen be sobered boy have passed through peril temptation from if have escaped have be through merit of own thing might have be far different life have be saved so have peace of mind now even consequence of old transgression have be lightened for what have done to deserve be question boy humbly asked a entered chapel that morning doctor sermon fitted well with altered frame of mind be sermon such a have often heard before in chapel word struck now with new force almost startled forgetting thing be behind reaching forth unto thing be before be doctor text in few simple word in urged hearer to lay past with burden disappointment shame upon in whom alone forgiveness be to be found stephen drank in new courage hope for future in thankfulness penitence of heart resolved to commit way more honestly than ever to best of keeping compared with even brother love be powerless before morning be over stephen duly went to doctor who talked to very seriously need not repeat talk here stephen be very penitent have good sense to say a little a possible when be over thanked doctor gratefully promised must never have to talk to for bad conduct again must thank brother for not dealing great deal more severely with case said dr senior be quite ready to believe will not occur again now good bye off stephen went happiest boy alive determined more than ever to respect doctor authority prove model boy sunday afternoon at saint dominic be usually spent by boy in fine weather in strolling about in garden rambling into wood by bank of shar afternoon however be somewhat overcast good many of boy consequently preferred staying indoors to running risk of spoiling best hat in shower among who kept house be oliver who in reply to wraysford invitation to go out pleaded that be not in humour indeed be case for now stephen affair be settled dread of approaching nightingale examination came back over like nightmare made quite miserable nearer hour of trial came more convinced did oliver become that stood chance whatever of winning with conviction bright hope of university course prospect of after success seemed extinguished of course be very ridiculous of to worry into state then reader have be working just little too hard be hardly fault if be ridiculous wraysford though by mean in high spirit kept head good deal better tried to enjoy walk forget about book a if nothing at be going to happen to morrow a for loman be not visible from morning till night good many guessed guessed correctly that be at work even on sunday small boy not so much though fear out of reverence for day a for partisanship of fifth be very indignant on subject held small full dress meeting after tea to protest against one of candidate taking such unfair advantage over others ought to be expelled exclaimed paul very well said bramble greenfield senior cramming too be be in afternoon be not cramming be got headache said stephen oh yes dare say padger got headache be nice excuse for copying out of crib on sunday doe use crib tell be not working said stephen indignantly shut up do hear will get turned out potboy be too much for stephen who left assembly in disgust after threatening to take early opportunity on next day of giving adversary one for threat may a well say at once here did not fail to carry out with wonted energy long sunday ended at last sunday spoiled to many of boy of saint dominic by distracting thought care day many impatiently wished over wished must never give place to morrow that morrow came at last with rose oliver strengthened hopeful once more for trial lay before be early at wraysford study whom found only just out of bed look alive old man what do say to dip in river before breakfast have got plenty of time will wash off cobweb before exam serene said wraysford not very cheerily though anything better than doing nothing why wray thought be going to let get down about thought be going to let get up why be quite festive morning well see fellow ca do better than best so a have done best mean to punish by getting in blue pity did make resolution yesterday be awfully glum know then now have got turn see oh never mind

wray cupboard come along old boy so went down to river oliver in unusually good spirit wraysford most unusually depressed nervous bathe be not great success for wraysford evidently did not enjoy what

tell against at exam strike answer give will tell against hope be that get scholarship mean to try just like loman so went into breakfast be solemn meal despite stephen care in hunting up delicacy not very well partaken of seemed age before nine o'clock bell summoned down to fifth form room here however sympathy encouragement of class fellow amply served to pas time till examination began well fellow cried pembury a two entered do feel like winning not more than usual said oliver how do feel oh particularly cheerful for have nothing to do day find be not in for nightingale for mathematical medal for english literature simon in for know so there be chance for one simon smiled very blandly at side compliment so fellow continued tony may command service from morning to night if like loman

man be up who be going to funk said oliver impatiently on friend behalf tell wray will most likely win well a long a one of doe said tom senior with noble impartiality care do braddy of course not so then sympathy encouragement be not for two boy at for form might just a well have be two carefully trained racehorse starting on race with heavy odds upon doctor entry however put end to further talk a usual dead silence ensued after boy have taken seat doctor looked little uneasy doubtless be impressed too by importance of occasion proceeded to call over list of candidate for different examination in fidgety manner very unlike usual self then turning abruptly to class said mathematical medal candidate will remain here for examination english literature nightingale scholarship candidate will be examined in sixth form room boy not in for of examination may go to study till twelve o'clock bell ring before disperse however here doctor grew still more fidgety want to mention one matter have already mentioned in sixth mention not because suspect boy here of dishonourable act because matter being mystery feel must not neglect most remote opportunity of clearing up what on earth be coming be a good a ghost story one be so spellbound mystified on saturday evening have occasion to leave study for rather le than five minute shortly after nine o'clock have be engaged in getting together various paper of question for to day examination left lying on corner of table on returning to study have not be absent five minute found that one of paper one of nightingale scholarship paper have only just copied out be missing if be not perfectly sure full number be there before left room must conclude be mistaken of be sure just wish to ask one question here have already asked in sixth doe boy present know anything about missing paper might have heard pin drop a doctor paused for reply no expected not be quite satisfied can disperse boy to various place what fellow doctor be for speech wray said oliver a friend made way to sixth form room yes be very queer thing about paper though oh be certain to have mislaid somewhere be queer thing saying anything about for look uncommonly a if suspected one so doe oh horror here be at torture chamber wish be over entered sixth form room be regularly cleared for action one long desk be allotted to three nightingale candidate two others to english literature boy to competitor in sixth form greek verse contest loman be already in place waiting with flushed face for ordeal to begin two friend took seat without vouchsafing notice of rival uncomfortable two minute ensued during seemed a if doctor be never to arrive did arrive at last however bringing with examination paper for various class boy for greek verse prize come forward wren raleigh winter callonby advanced received one paper boy for nightingale scholarship come forward three competitor obeyed summons to be handed paper be not in human nature to forbear glancing hurriedly at momentous question a walked slowly back to seat effect of momentary glance be very different on three boy wraysford face slightly lengthened loman grew suddenly aghast oliver betrayed emotion boy for english literature prize come forward duly advanced be furnished then silence reigned in room broken only by rapid scratching of pen solemn tick of clock on wall reader doubtless know horror of examination room a well a do know what be to sit biting end of pen glaring at ruthless question in front of know what be to dash nervously from question to question answering bit of bit of lacking patience to work steadily down list have experienced doubtless aggravation of hearing pen of man on right flying along paper with hideous squeak never stopping for moment to give chance knowing there be need for to describe vicissitude of particular day of ordeal at saint dominic work went steadily on from morning to afternoon more than one anxious face darted now then nervous glance up at clock a hour of closing approached loman be one of be evidently in difficulty fifth form fellow who looked round occasionally from english literature paper be elated to see own men writing steadily hard while sixth man looked aground there be one boy however who have time for such observation be simon have got hold of question be after own heart demanded second of attention describe in not more than twelve line of blank verse natural beauty of river shar here be chance for dominican poet shar be very beautiful stream of ouse tributary up at gusset weir be prettiest ween because there bird sing so merry four line poet styled canto one canto be much of same excellence altogether effusion be in one of simon happiest mood ala a poet said art be long time be fleeting clock pointed to three long before bard have penned fifth canto sadly regretfully fellow candidate gathered together handed in paper for better worse among last to finish up be oliver who have be working hammer tongs during whole examination how did get on said wraysford a walked back to fifth middling not so bad a feared how did not very grand be afraid better than expected said wraysford say did see how gravelled loman seemed fancy did do very much so thought have time to watch much in fifth there be crowd of questioner eager to ascertain how champion have fared great be delight to learn that be utterly cast down at own effort fellow be regular brick if get cried ricketts will be best thing have happened for fifth for long time oh say said simon suddenly addressing oliver in peculiarly knowing tone be funny that about doctor losing paper just very time met coming out of study know on saturday evening of course wo say anything only be funny what have come over oliver that suddenly turned crimson without single word struck speaker angrily with open hand on forehead be mad must possibly be that before assembled fifth must recover from astonishment conjecture a to motive for sudden exhibition of feeling turned abruptly to door quitted room chapter twenty three turn of tide earthquake must hardly have produced greater shock than oliver strange conduct produced on fifth form at saint dominic for moment two remained almost stupefied with astonishment then rose sudden clamour of tongue on hand what can mean exclaimed one mean be easy enough to see what mean said hypocrite must never have thought greenfield senior went in for sort of thing went in for what sort of thing cried wraysford with pale face in perfect tremble why cheating replied other be liar to say so shouted wraysford walking rapidly up to speaker other boy however intervened held indignant wraysford back tell be liar to say so again exclaimed be not cheat tell never cheated be pack of liar of say draw mild wray know interposed pembury need include in compliment wraysford glared at moment then coloured slightly call oliver cheat said inquiringly must till be cock sure of fact replied cautious editor of dominican do mean to say be sure said wraysford pembury vouchsafed answer whistled to can say be said bullinger who be one of wraysford chum look uncommonly ugly if what simon say be true believe word that as say oh began simon with most aggravating cheerfulness assure be not telling lie wraysford be sorry said anything about never thought there must be row about promise will not mention to anybody blockhead who care for promise believe well know met greenfield senior coming out of doctor study on saturday evening about five minute past nine be positive of said simon suppose have paper in hand sneered wraysford looking very miserable expect 'd put in pocket know at least be must have candid admission on part of ingenious poet be too much for gravity of one two of fifth wraysford however be in laughing mood went off to study in great perturbation must not for moment believe that friend must be guilty of such dishonourable act a stealing examination paper impulse be to go at once to oliver study get suspicion of fifth laid there then fear of seeming in least degree to join in suspicion kept back tried to laugh thing to scorn inwardly called villain traitor twenty time for admitting even shadow of doubt into own mind yet a wraysford sat that afternoon brooded over friend new trouble became more more uncomfortable when on former occasion fellow have called in question oliver courage have felt so sure so very sure suspicion be groundless one that have never taken seriously to heart somehow affair be quite different what possible object must simon for instance have for telling deliberate lie if have be lie why must oliver have betrayed such confusion on hearing be question try must wraysford must not get out of mind when stephen presently came in cheery a ever eager to hear how examination have gone off elder boy felt awkwardness in talking to have never experienced before a for stephen put down short embarrassed answer received to wraysford own uneasiness a to result of examination little guessed boy what be passing in other mind there be just one hope wraysford clung to be that oliver must come out anywhere first in result if loman wraysford be to win one must be able to say friend have profited by dishonourable act indeed must be a good a proof have not taken paper yet wraysford felt quite sick a called to mind unflagging manner in oliver have worked at paper that morning covering sheet upon sheet with answer scarcely drawing in until time be up did look like losing threw back in chair in sheer misery must sooner have done thing groaned to than oliver then suddenly added be not true be certain of must do will never believe of poor wraysford be easier to say generous word than feel pembury looked in presently with face far more serious overcast than usually wore say wray said in troubled tone be regularly floored by do believe replied wraysford so sadly hesitatingly have at once confessed did must not have expressed meaning more plainly 'd give anything to be sure be false said pembury so must lot of fellow a for fool simon bah exclaimed wraysford fiercely fellow ought to be kicked round school be getting on way already fancy said pembury be saying 'd think nothing at about if what say be only thing to go by well saw what state greenfield got into about maybe be just in sudden rage with fellow for thinking of thing said wraysford looked like something more than rage said pembury dismally something good deal more wraysford said nothing fidgeted in chair long silence followed busy with own thought yearning for sign of hope see what good must have done if did take paper 'd have time to cram up yesterday be out with be afternoon said wraysford not looking up have headache stayed in pembury gave low whistle of dismay say wray said presently really doe look bad think so know what to think said wraysford with groan be quite bewildered be use pretending not to see what be a plain a daylight said pembury a turned hobbled away fifth meanwhile have be holding sort of court martial on affair simon be made to repeat story once more stuck to too in spite of browbeating got what make so sure of exact time asked one of inquisitor oh because know wanted to get off letter by post thought be in time till saw clock opposite doctor study said five minute past did greenfield say anything to when saw one else asked oh yes asked if knew where doctor be did tell oh yes said 'd gone down to hall somewhere did greenfield go after oh know went off other way a quick a must said simon in voice a though must say how can ask absurd question did ask what wanted in study oh yes of course did tell not likely say suppose be sure to win nightingale now be mind be not going to tell anybody because of course be secret shut up miserable blockhead unless want to be kicked shouted bullinger one want to know what be going to do have done mischief enough already oh well did mean know said poet said be met coming shut up do hear will catch once more exclaimed bullinger wretched simon gave up further attempt to explain still what have said in blundering way have be quite enough thing be beyond doubt a fifth sat there in judgment sense of shame humiliation came over to many of be unused know said ricketts giving utterance to what be passing in mind of nearly class fellow 'd sooner have lost scholarship twenty time over than win like precious fine glory will be if do get said braddy unless wray win suggested ricketts such luck a be afraid said bullinger be just worst of be not only disgraced be swindled best friend be blackguard shame added fiercely at rate loman be out of from what hear got regularly stuck in exam tell said ricketts 'd sooner have have loman take scholarship two men nowhere at than there be nothing more than to be said assuredly to prove disgust of fifth at conduct of class fellow suppose greenfield will have grace to confess now be come out said ricketts if doe fancy can promise pretty hot time of among said braddy one two laughed at to most of present matter be past joke for must be said of dominican think may be said of good many english public schoolboy besides however foolish may have be in other respect however riotous however jealous of one however well satisfied with point of honour be point took seriously to heart must forgive schoolfellow for doing disobedient act sometimes perhaps even vicious act cowardly dishonourable action be thing nothing must excuse felt not only disgrace to boy perpetrating disgrace put upon have oliver be most popular boy in school must have be same a be be long way from being most popular never took pain to win good opinion of fellow when by mean of achievement in excelled have contrived a in case of cricket match last term to bring glory on school to make hero in eye of saint dominic have be wont to take applause bestowed on with utmost indifference might even construe into contempt in precisely same spirit must take displeasure now then managed to incur boy like irritates to see praise blame made little of for reason if for other oliver must hardly have be favourite there be reason now that fifth found faith in greenfield senior rudely dashed to ground be not slow to recall unpleasant incident of last term when by refusing to thrash loman have discredited whole form laid under suspicion of cowardice most of fellow have at time of nightingale examination forgotten forgiven repented of suspicion indeed by challenge to loman previous saturday have be considered quite to have redeemed reputation in respect now came up again fellow who must do cowardly deed at one time must do mean one at if one be natural to character so be other in fact one explained other be mean when showed coward last term be coward when did mean act term what wonder in circumstance if fifth felt sore very sore indeed on subject of oliver greenfield to one relief did not put in appearance again day kept study paul brought down word at prayer time that have headache have gone to bed at fifth smiled grimly said nothing next morning however oliver turned up a usual in place looked pale otherwise unconcerned who looked for trace of shame self abasement in face be sorely disappointed surely must have known guessed resolution fifth have come to with regard to from unabashed manner be evidently determined not to take for granted hint must be given pretty clearly on ricketts whose desk be next to of oliver fell task of first giving hint how did get on yesterday in english literature asked oliver ricketts ' only answer be to turn back begin to talk to other neighbour who be watching incident noticed sudden flush on oliver cheek a stared for instant at late friend then with effort seemed to recover did not however attempt further conversation either with ricketts other neighbour braddy who in most marked manner have moved a far a possible away from on contrary coolly availed of extra room on desk busied silently with lesson for day now then looked furtively up in direction of wraysford who be seated at opposite desk eye of two friend met now then when did seemed greatly embarrassed for wraysford after night heart searching have come to determination not after to cut friend yet found impossible to feel behave towards a formerly tried very hard indeed not to appear constrained more tried more embarrassed felt after class purposely walked across room to meet old chum how be said in forced tone manner utterly unlike old self be ridiculous feeble remark to make must have be far better have said nothing oliver stared at for moment in perplexed way then without answering question walked somewhere else wraysford be quite conscious of own mistake still hurt sorely that well meant effort have cost so much must be thus summarily thrust aside without word for first time in life felt sense of resentment against old friend beginning of gap be destined to become wider a time went on only person in room who did meet oliver on natural ground be poetic simon to oliver walked up said quietly beg pardon for hitting yesterday oh said simon with giggle oh be right greenfield know never meant to let out will soon get hushed up intend to let go bit farther poet be too much carried away by enthusiasm of own magnanimity to observe that be in imminent risk during delivery of speech of blow good deal more startling than of yesterday when concluded found oliver have left to hurriedly quitted room chapter twenty four result of examination adventure of morning did not certainly tend to make fifth think better of oliver greenfield have appeared before humble penitent there be who even then might have tried to forgive forget what be done instead of that be evidently determined to brazen thing out have begun by snubbing very fellow whom have so deeply injured wraysford felt specially hurt have cost good deal to put on friendly air speak a if nothing have happened to find scorned for pain actually avoided by friend who have wronged be too much even must not have be so bad have not oliver immediately gone made up to simon before class wraysford did not remain to join in chorus of indignation in others indulged after morning school be over left strolled out dismally into playground must do something must know one way other what to think of oliver even now must gladly believe that be dream that nothing have come between old friend more pondered more convinced became be anything dream wandered unconsciously beyond playground towards wood on side of shar where oliver have walked so often in old day old day be yesterday that have last walked there yet what age ago seemed how impossible that old day must ever come back again have not got far into wood when heard what seemed to familiar footstep ahead of yesterday must have shouted whistled called on fellow to hold hard now have such inclination impulse be to turn round go back yet thought why must go back if be oliver what have to feel ashamed of so advanced boy in front of be walking slowly wraysford soon came in view of a expected be oliver at sight of old friend wandering here solitary listless wraysford old affection came suddenly back at least must make one more effort so quickened pace oliver turned saw coming did not wait walked on slowly a before apparently indifferent to approach of anybody be damper certainly to wraysford at least oliver might have guessed why friend be coming after be desperately hard to know how to begin conversation oliver trudged on sullen silent in anything encouraging manner still wraysford now mind be made up be not to be put from purpose noll old man began in a much of old tone manner a must assume well said oliver not looking up be to be friend still question cost speaker hard effort evidently went home oliver stopped short in walk looking full in old friend face said why do ask because be afraid be not friend at moment whose fault be that said oliver scornfully question stung wraysford a much a amazed be then of fellow in school to have explanation thus demanded of from one who have done most grievous personal wrong one schoolboy well must do to face flushed a replied slowly fault greenfield how can ask gave short laugh very like contempt then turned suddenly on heel leaving wraysford smarting with indignation finally convinced that between old friend there be gulf now must be hard indeed to bridge over returned moodily to school stephen be busy in study getting tea hullo wray shouted a elder boy entered wish be time to morrow do be mad to hear result be said wraysford yes so be old humbug noll say think did pretty well that answered well too say what joke if be dead heat get bracketed first cut away now said wraysford a coolly a must make such row there be something unusual in tone surprised small boy put down however to worry about examination quietly withdrew a commanded next day came at last two day ago in fifth form at rate must have be uphill work for master to attempt to conduct morning class in face of eagerness enthusiasm with result of examination must have be looked for now however there be suspense indeed be suspense of dread rather than triumph never mind said ricketts to pembury after two have be talking over affair for twentieth time never mind there be just tony if wray be only second will be splendid win for fifth same see nothing splendid in whole concern said pembury be general feeling oliver entered took accustomed seat in silence one spoke to many moved away from nearly favoured with long unfriendly stare thing took unmoved sat coolly waiting for class to begin when did begin one must have supposed be only comfortable easy minded fellow in room lesson dragged on languidly that morning most of boy seemed to regard a something inflicted on to pas time rather than a serious effort of instruction clock crawled slowly on from ten to eleven from eleven to half past one be glad when at last mr jellicott closed book then followed interval of suspense doctor be due with result be even now announcing in sixth what age seemed before footstep sounded in passage outside fifth at last entered hush fell over class one two glanced quickly up a though hoped to read fate in head master face others waited too anxious to stir look up others groaned inwardly with sort of prophetic foresight of what be to come doctor walked up to desk unfolded paper wraysford looked furtively across room to where old friend sat there be flush in oliver face a followed doctor with eye be breathing hard wraysford must see corner of mouth be working with more than ordinary nervousness ala thought wraysford envy thought doctor began to speak following be result of various examination held on monday english literature maximum number of mark st bullinger mark nd west rd maybury th simon be afraid simon be little too venturesome entering for examination like paper be very poor performance simon groaned gulped down astonishment say whispered to oliver who sat in front of know be mistake know wrote five canto about shar good too be lost that say have better tell oliver vouchsafing reply unfortunate poet merely replied to head master remark sir then subsided more convinced than ever saint dominic be not worthy of mathematical medal maximum number of mark st heath nd price rd robert heath answer may say be very good examiner have specially commended heath being sixth form man information be absolutely without interest to fifth who wondered why doctor must put out of way to announce nightingale scholarship ah now there be quick stir then deeper silence than ever a doctor slowly read out maximum number of

familiar friend who have turned against thus grievously wronged yet with sense of injury must hardly stand by listen to bitter talk about oliver in absence without sense of shame two day ago must have flared up at first word given rash speaker something to remember now be misery to stand by hear old chum abused despised to feel that deserved word be spoken of if must only have found one word to say on behalf must not so left room a soon a be possible to escape retired disconsolately to own study a for fifth pembury advice prevailed with there be few who be still disposed to take revenge on oliver in more marked manner than by merely cutting dread of tongue of editor of dominican a well a conviction of uselessness of such procedure constrained to give way fall in with general resolution

so saying tried to dismiss matter from mind think of pleasanter subject such for instance a oliver crime own clever use of to delude sixth thing altogether be looking up with loman cheating lying gambling looked a if must pay after chapter twenty six at coventry be ever at coventry reader mean quaint old warwickshire city that other place where from morning till night be shunned avoided by everybody where friend with whom be once on most intimate term now pas without word look way a go by where whichever way go find alone where one speak to be deaf one appear before be blind one go near have business somewhere else where will be left undisturbed in study for week to fag for study by disport with where in playground will be a solitary a if be in desert in school will be class by even in church on sunday will feel hopelessly out in cold among fellow worshipper if have ever be to such place can imagine oliver greenfield experience during christmas term at saint dominic when gentleman of fifth form have once made up mind to anything generally carried through with great heartiness certainly never succeeded better in undertaking than in of leaving oliver to only drawback to success be that proceeding appeared to have little effect on very person on whose behalf be undertaken not that oliver must be quite insensible of honour paid must not be too marked for without doubt be a unpleasant a be unmistakable for sign of unhappiness displayed whole affair might have be matter of supreme indifference to indeed looked quite a much a if greenfield have sent fifth to coventry a fifth greenfield if determined none of to speak to be equally determined none of must have chance if be part of scheme to leave a much a possible to have little trouble in doing for except when inevitable never came near of course be dreadfully irritating to fifth moral revenge have promised on disgracer of class never seemed to come off wind be taken out of sail at turn object of aversion be certainly not reduced to humility penitence by conduct on contrary one two of felt decidedly inclined to be ashamed of feel foolish when met victim oliver always have be queer fellow now came out in queerer light than ever having once seen how wind lay what have to expect from fifth altered course of life to suit new circumstance with greatest coolness instead of going up river in pair oar four now went up in sculling boat canoe seemed to enjoy quite a much instead of doing work with wraysford evening after evening now did undisturbed by to judge by progress in class more successfully than ever instead of practising with fifteen at football went in for regular course of practice in gymnasium devoted with remarkable success to horizontal bar high jump instead of casting in lot in class with jovial though somewhat distracting set now kept mind free for study earned frequent commendation of doctor mr jellicott now reader ask if have be one of fifth of saint dominic must not all have be very riling here be fellow convicted of shameful piece of deceit caught one might say in very act by own conduct a good a admitting here be fellow say whom sensible boy ought to avoid not only showing utterly indifferent to aversion of class fellow positively thriving triumphing before very face be wonder if felt very sore increasingly sore on subject of oliver greenfield one boy of course stuck to exile through thick thin if oliver have murdered saint dominic with slow poison stephen must have stuck to to end stuck to now at least never once admitted that brother be guilty when slowly first discovered what be suspicion of fifth be common talk of school about oliver small boy indignation be past description rushed to brother do hear lie fellow be telling about noll yes said oliver why stop tell be use have told once if choose to believe need other boy must of course have taken a clear evidence of elder brother guilt only strengthened small boy indignation will let know if wo forthwith went proceeded to make perfect nuisance in school began with wraysford say wray demanded do hear lie fellow be telling about noll make row now said wraysford shortly be busy stephen have notion of being put down fellow say stole exam paper blackguard 'd like to punch head will too clear out of study now said wraysford sharply stephen stared at moment then face grew pale a grasped meaning of say wray surely believe cried go away now be wraysford only answer did not suit stephen blood be up meant to have out surely believe repeated disregarding impatience of other be blackguard like rest do hear what tell said wraysford mean to retorted irate stephen if be anything of friend 'd stand up for oliver be beast wraysford be what be continued in passion be blackguard be liar must kill poor boy wild with rage misery actually flung blindly upon brother old friend saviour of own life wraysford be not angry there be more of pity in face than anger a took small boy by arm led to door stephen longer resisted after giving vent to first flood of anger misery got upper hand of longed to go anywhere to hide must have endured to know oliver be suspected by good many of fellow to find wraysford among be cruel blow in due time indignation again came to fore ventured on crusade time be to pembury knew before went have little enough to expect from sharp tongued editor of dominican so went hoping little to surprise however pembury be kinder than usual told plainly that did suspect oliver explained why advised stephen if be wise to say a little about oliver a possible at present young champion be quite cowed by unexpected reception did best to fly in rage be defiant be use retired woefully discomfited from interview others to whom applied when once again anger got better of wretchedness met with taunt others with contempt others with positive unkindness after week stephen gave up retired in dudgeon to territory of guinea pig tadpole determined that there at least must at edge of knuckle if need be compel faction to declare for brother in undertaking need hardly say be eminently successful there be among guinea pig tadpole who be ready to declare for anybody anything a long a there be chance of row on head of already question of greenfield senior have be occupying magnificent mind when story first fell suddenly into midst be so surprising that like frog log in fable be inclined to be little shy of gradually becoming accustomed to looking carefully into from side seemed somehow to contain promise of jolly row heart warmed to proportionally one quite liked to start thing at first for fear doubtless of not doing full justice only wanted spark to kindle whole lower school on question of greenfield senior stephen be who supplied spark entered fourth junior room one day after one of unsuccessful crusade of have spoken utterly cast down out of humour flung cap on to peg on to seat in unusually agitated manner then to astonishment of everybody broke out into tear be rare glorious opportunity of course for bramble beastly young blub baby exclaimed that doughty hero be always blubbing never knew such fellow to blub did padger padger said be worse than baby at home two thereupon started mocking caterwaul on own account in not few of nearest dearest friend joined performance have effect of restoring stephen composure hastily dashing away tear flew with unwonted wrath at enemy bramble however managed to get behind padger rest thus fortified shouted out yah boo howling young sucking pig go home to mammy great big cheat of blackguard thief of caddish big brother do hear who stole exam paper eh padger yah boo pack of sneaking guinea pig last objurgation be quite unnecessary to beauty force of speech gave rise to huge tumult guinea pig present took up a direct challenge to decided instantly to declare in favour of stephen big brother paul led attack shut up young cad will said know well enough stole paper of course one not even paul attached meaning to absurd accusation came conveniently to hand declaration of war be promptly taken up on side for short period fourth junior have rather dusty appearance when at length little order be restored lively discussion on crime of greenfield senior ensued tadpole to man believed in gave a candid opinion that fellow ought to be hung yes expelled too added few of more truculent guinea pig on other hand thought protested vehemently that greenfield senior be most virtuous heroic saintly jolly fellow in saint dominic denounced tadpole rest of school a most brutal ruffian in christendom ought to be expelled one of said one except greenfield senior hope will be know be said paul will let have bit of mind of so will said have got to give bit of squealed bramble so now all right will give bit of then retorted paul must get of to touch with pair of tongs added be too much for bramble brief period of dust ensued then comparative quiet once more prevailing paul said tell what mean to stick to greenfield senior so do said youth with face over ink mean to fag for so do shouted so do shouted general chorus of assent hailed idea will fag for vote eh stee said paul whole lot of eye that will be prime wo others just about look black blue be magnificent idea sooner conceived than executed there be great rush of guinea pig to oliver study be not there so much better must give delightful surprise so proceeded straightway to empty cupboard drawer to polish up cup to unfold clothes fold again to take down book put up again to upset ink mop up with one of handkerchief to make tea spill on floor to dirty collar with inky hand to clean boot with hat brush many other thoughtful friendly act calculated to make heart of hero glad in midst of orgy wraysford pembury passed door stopped to look in wondering what on earth tumult be about be greeted with storm of yell hiss that passed on little uneasy in mind a to whether hydrophobia have broken out in saint dominic after detachment of tadpole headed by bramble appeared on scene for purpose of mocking purpose may have be be abandoned for more active opposition when paul presently emptied tumblerful of lukewarm tea in face of master bramble notable battle be fought on threshold of greenfield senior study in many be wounded on side in midst of oliver arrived on scene kicking right left causing general rout how hero appreciated attention admirer have paid during absence guinea pig did not remain return to ascertain took for granted be grateful bashfully kept out of way of thanks for whole day after enthusiasm returned time found new vent decided that although must fag for to end of day must not for season at rate solicit job from rather encourage by sympathy applause at more respectful distance so took to cheering in playground following down passage not being enough further relieved by hooting at respectful distance also chief of senior school whose opinion on question of greenfield senior be known not to agree with own if oliver be not grateful for moral support in trouble must have be villain indeed of deepest dye never said in so many word be grateful then guinea pig remembered that feeling be often too deep too many for word so took for granted thanks conscience told deserved meanwhile fresh number of dominican be in progress rapidly nearing hour of publication chapter twenty seven dominican on situation examination at beginning of term have seriously interfered with prospect of dominican pembury knew well enough be good trying to get anything out of diligent section of class fellow at time knew equally well that number contributed entirely by idler of fifth must neither be creditable to paper appreciated by one outside so like prudent man held back patiently till examination be over then pounced down on men with redoubled importunity look here said one day to ricketts when be going to let have paper of yours what paper do mean demanded ricketts why for dominican of course suppose want one of cast off exam paper do oh ca do anything for dominican time said ricketts yes can yes will coolly replied anthony who say will demanded ricketts inclined to be angry sound a if do replied editor why of course will do something for rick 'd be glad enough really be not in humour said ricketts why ever not demanded tony why fact be said ricketts fancy fifth be not exactly looking up at present have nothing particular to be proud of if take advice will keep dominican quiet for bit dear fellow be very thing must do see old duffer that if shut up shop retire into private life everybody will be thinking dare hold up head mean to hold up head for one added tony proudly if there be thousand greenfields in class mean to make hold up yours too old man will be time enough to do hang dog business when turn knave till do have a good right to be known at saint dominic a anybody else so none of humbug rick will get out extra good dominican let fellow see be alive kicking speech have required effect not only won over ricketts most of other leading spirit of fifth who have be similarly holding back tony be not fellow to let advantage go by having once got men into becoming frame of mind kept well in hand worked up into something like old enthusiasm on subject of dominican one be determined present number must be out out good one laboured racked brain accordingly somehow other fellow have never found so hard first to get inspiration then to put down on paper a did at present one thought have something very fine very clever to say if must only find expression for amount of brain cudgelling went on over dominican be simply awful wraysford gave up in disgust ricketts bullinger tom senior others stumbled through task must only turn out lame production at best even pembury lucubration lacked good deal of wonted dash spirit cloud be hanging over fifth seemed to have overshadowed genius for while still pembury kept men at gave peace till production such a be be safe in hand one boy only be equal to emergency need hardly say be simon be indeed more eloquent than ever offered pembury poem of forty verse entitled elegy on wick of candle have just be blown out to begin with volunteered to supplement contribution with one two smaller piece such a little lark adventure outside dormitory door mind mewsings pembury prudently accepted said must insert what thought fit assurance delighted simon who immediately sat down wrote more piece in case at last moment there might be room for too in spite even of valuable contribution dominican fell flat there be few good thing in here there be far below ordinary form not few of writer repented sorely that ever have put pen to paper to help produce chief amusement of paper be contained in new code of regulation for better management of guinea pig tadpole from editor pen began thus society have lately be started at saint dominic for preservation management of

guinea pig tadpole will be at liberty providing be regularly washed to use a warming pan for own bed small tribe of furious junior who a usual have crowded round paper on morning of publication to get first read broke forth at point into howl of exasperation wo will see wo use a warming pan wo padger brute will bite horrid cold foot if stick against be what will do will keep pin to stick into said will get leech put on leg shouted will tell said stephen changing subject be cool cheek of calling ' a if be thing so have exclaimed paul oh say that be too much will let know be not thing yes be

pickle tadpole a specimen for school museum following be recipe for take ugliest dirtiest noisiest most ignorant specimen can be found lift carefully with pair of tongs into bath full of vinegar close lid let remain there to soak for week at end of time lift out scrape well over with sharp substance to get off first coating of grime soak again for week scrape again so on till ninth tenth coating be removed after that creature will appear thinner than when began hang up to dry in clean place be sure other guinea pig tadpole come near then put in clean gown quickly before can get at ink put in large glass bottle fasten down stopper label specimen of curious reptile formerly found at saint dominic now happily extinct ' there be said paul when after much blundering sticking at word remarkable paragraph have be read through there be bramble boy what do think of bramble have difficulty in intimating what thought of in pretty strong language for little time further reading of dominican be suspended when however row be over group have be joined by several of elder boy who appeared to appreciate simon poem adventure outside dormitory door be called epick began thus reader must be contented with short extract outside dormitory door walked slow upon floor just outside doctor study youth met in hurry name perhaps have better not tell like snail retire into shell last simile have evidently particularly delighted poet so much so that brought in at close of succeeding verse epick went on of course to unravel thread of adventure to intimate pretty plainly who youth referred to be to one not interested in poet epic production be dull one moral at end be not quite clear even to most intellectual now must say farewell yet stay methinks how many many youth do sit on brink oh joy to feel soft breeze sigh in shady grove to wipe eye make feel man know full well like snail will now retire within shell be only article in dominican afforded amusement remainder of paper made up of usual article sneering at sixth crowing over school generally be very tame result of nightingale scholarship be announced a follows examination for nightingale scholarship be held on st october scholarship be lost by loman of sixth by mark to good performance on whole manner of announcing unfortunate result be ingenious did tony credit for whether object be to annoy sixth to shield fifth succeeded amply in there be however in fifth who be by mean content greenfield must be let off so easily in dominican read with interest following note from coventry contributed by bullinger anthony have accepted inserted against better judgment if fellow be at coventry why not let stay there said to bullinger best thing can possibly do be to let alone see said bullinger everybody will think be trying to shield if keep so quiet anyhow here paper can put in not like be not going to write anything else pembury took paper put in reader may like to hear few of note from coventry quaint old city of coventry have lately be visited by gentleman from saint dominic who appears so charmed with have seen heard that be expected will remain there for considerable time object of visit be of private nature possibly for purpose of scientific research for absolute quiet be necessary experiment be chiefly directed to making taking of examination paper on return may look for valuable discovery meanwhile see very little company society in most delight be that of certain guinea pig between whom special bond of sympathy appears to exist be touching sight to see taking daily walk in company with singular animal who be said seem to be only creature able to appreciate character curiously enough since left saint dominic have not collapsed indeed be singular fact now be away be no longer considered necessary for fellow to lock study door when go out keep key so on miserable stuff indeed a stephen thought quite stinging enough to wound over over again a saw sneer heard laugh with reading of extract be greeted everybody evidently be against brother with deep disgust fury at heart left to laugh by returned to oliver study found brother in what be now usual cheerful spirit for after first week so of being sent to coventry oliver in own study at least kept up cheerful appearance hullo stee said a young brother entered be just in time here be letter from mother be there how

considerable because be so sure deserves hear hear put in stephen poor mr wraysford hope be not very much disappointed how nice must have be if there have be two scholarship must have have one suppose fifth be making quite hero of oliver know one foolish old woman who must like to be with boy moment to share triumph oliver laughed bitterly must be treat for stephen very red in face be too furious for word so oliver went on if instead of triumph must ever be in trouble sorrow still more must love to be with to share most of do trust pray may make constant friend of saviour who want to cast burden on follow example have left in thing there be silence for moment after home message fell on brother ear heart of be full too full for word think have widow mother far away be able to divine secret thought of boy hope must have mingled with pity solicitude on account old trouble for present at rate be destined to swamp other emotion oliver continued reading christmas will not be so very long now in coming must have real snug old fashioned time of here uncle henry have promised to come cousin must be nice if must persuade mr wraysford to come here then be so anxious to see again tell from reckon on to be one of party if can possibly manage baa exclaimed stephen beast will let know what sort of blackguard fellow be easy young 'un said oliver sha easy noll exclaimed boy be

other fellow suspect ca help that if do come now stee have have enough of will come right day see meanwhile what do say to turn in gymnasium well persisted stephen not satisfied surely be going to give mother message to wraysford want home at christmas one asked if did young duffer think same will give just yet be walking down big passage arm in arm in direction of gymnasium a oliver spoke last word subject of conversation appeared advancing towards who must have believed that three friend who only month two ago be quoted over saint dominic a inseparables must ever meet pas one a three met passed one now wraysford coloured a caught sight of old ally looked way oliver more composed kept eye fixed straight ahead appeared to be completely unconscious of presence of one stephen who hung on to arm snorting fuming inwardly raging like young tiger held in by chain from prey odd meeting indeed miserable one yet to none of three so miserable a to injured wraysford who ever since day of nightingale examination have not known happy hour at saint dominic chapter twenty eight mr cripps at saint dominic oliver greenfield banishment from civilised society however much may have gratified

pound note from aunt sum have promptly virtuously put into envelope sent down to mr cripps in further liquidation of little bill be ever such luck next week usual remittance from home must be due there must be three four pound paid off loman felt quite touched at thought of own honesty solvency if only everybody in world paid debt a did what happy state of thing must be for country so a said loman looked forward to football match in quite good spirit just a man who have be working hard anxiously for eleven long month look forward to well earned summer holiday thing be looking up with mistake then just like luck doctor have same day made announcement already referred to of scholarship to be competed for directly after christmas be for sixth form boy under seventeen meant to go in

to pay oh dear oh dear what thing be to be straight honest everything prospers with man when go in for being honest why loman be positively being bathed in luck at present time saturday came at last stansfield have drilled men a well a must during interval devoutly hoped that have got respectable team to cope with landfield fellow if must only have be sure of half back must have be quite happy never practice passed without growling louder than ever at disgraceful custom of sending useful behind scrimmage men to coventry at last moment decided to give responsible post to loman rather than move forward wraysford from position at back loman usual place at quarter back be filled up by young forrester of fourth greatly to young gentleman trepidation to exultation of fourth senior a body who felt terrifically puffed up to have one of men actually in first fifteen of reader may perhaps know from actual experience be numerous serious anxiety always beset captain of football fifteen if fellow be worth salt know to nicety where be strong where be weak know if wind blow one way be best quarter back to put on left on right know of bulldog can safely put into middle of scrimmage be most useful in second tier know when to call kick to man when to call run man know better when to throw ball far out from touch when to nurse along close to line be very well for outsider to talk of football everlastingly a game dear good people football be science if ever there be science more know of more will find out piece of lecturing be thrown in here for purpose of observing stansfield be model football captain however worried worrying crabby be in ordinary clothes in football togs on field of battle be coolest quickest readiest cunningest general must desire said no more than must help never scolded men while play be going on best of worked like horse in thick of fight looked to one else to do same yet on saturday captain prowess generalship must not win match for saint dominic against landfield match began evenly for first half of time game be one long succession of scrimmage in middle of ground from ball hardly ever escaped when did escaped only to be driven back next moment into mush will do at rate think stansfield to a long a keep among forward sha hurt ala one might almost have declared tell tale evil spirit have heard boast carried to ear of enemy for next moment half time be called side changed over with landfielders completely reversed tactic game be no longer locked up in scrimmage in middle of ground became looser all along line ball began to slip through struggling foot into hand of behind who sent shooting over head of forward into more open ground quarter back half back on side ran got round scrimmage when at last be collared took to ending up with expiring drop kick sent ball far in direction of coveted goal nothing must have happened worse for saint dominic for strain fell upon just at weakest point stansfield groaned a saw chance after chance missed behind scrimmage young forrester played pluckily hard at quarter back shirked nothing must not kick short run be consequently of little use callonby of course did good work loman half back be woefully unsteady what jackass be to put fellow there said stansfield to yet loman a rule be good player with plenty of dash not little courage be odd that to day must be showing such specially bad form there go ball again clean over forward head straight for be going to catch run be not be going to take flying kick be not be going to make mark be not be going to dribble through now if there be one thing fatal to football be indecision if wobble about so to speak between dozen opinion may just a well sit down on ground where be let ball go to jericho loman get flurried completely end by giving ball miserable side kick into touch to extreme horror of everybody unmitigated disgust of peppery stansfield yet have captain men known cause of have be aware that flash half tipsy cad of fellow who with dozen of pal be watching match with critical air there at rope be landlord of cockchafer holder of loman little bill for pound must perhaps have understood forgiven comrade clumsiness did not have brought cripps there thousand possibility flashed through loman mind a caught sight of unwelcome acquaintance in middle of match be come to make row about money before school have anything fresh turned up what why on earth did bring other cad with of whom loman recognised a pot house celebrity of own acquaintance wonder if boy lost head became flurried felt miserable time ball flew over to cripps side of ground there be possibility landlord of cockchafer have only come up out of curiosity if so might not have recognised young friend among player delusion be soon dispelled ball went again into touch time close to spot occupied by unwelcome group be about to be thrown out stansfield signalled to loman go up nearer line close up loman obeyed a did so there fell on ear in familiar tone noisy greeting what cheer nightingale what cheer hearty stick to man eh let have mr loman two to one in half sovereign on mr loman laugh greeted encouraging appeal in midst of loman knowing full well one have heard word became completely disconcerted let ball go through finger a if have be quicksilver be too much for stansfield patience go up forward for goodness ' sake exclaimed if must play fool will go half back loman obeyed like lamb only too glad to lose in scrimmage escape observation match went on worse worse for saint dominic despite stansfield gallant effort at half back where have never played before despite wraysford steady play in goal ball worked up nearer dominican line landfield men be quick enough to see weak point of enemy make use of discovery played fast loose giving ball not moment peace above avoiding scrimmage saint dominic forward be thus made practically useless brunt of encounter fell on four five player behind be not equal to calamity come at last one of landfield men get hold of ball run down hard along touch line forrester be quarter back that side gallant a fourth form boy be big opponent run over a mastiff run over terrier stansfield anticipating be ready at back will go hard with indeed if doe not collar man ala just a landfielder come to close quarter saint dominic captain grip round waist ball fly neatly back into hand of of enemy who amid shout of own men crowd make off with like fury with clear field before only wraysford between dominican goal look out behind there need of such caution to back like wraysford be looking out have be looking out ever since match began if have eye of argus leg of atlas must not prevent that goal for landfield man have notion of coming to close quarter be crack drop kick must be as indeed if did not employ talent with chance a only run short way then slackens pace wraysford rush forward in front pursuing host rush on behind one see how will be fellow take deliberate drop kick at goal up fly ball a true a rocket clean over post a certain goal a saint dominic ever lost be use cry over spilt milk for rest of game stansfield relaxed effort to stay tide of defeat succeeded too for though ball remained dangerously near school goal once twice slipped behind enemy be unable to make addition to score before time be called when match be over loman tried best to slip away unobserved by respectable town acquaintance be far too polite to allow well cried mr cripps coolly joining boy a walked with other player back to school well do do do bless call proper sport do what do put on game bob sovereign eh never mind pal wanted dander so thought 'd look up eh know tommy granger here heard saying a came along wondered what 'd stand to drink

keep eye on little comedy came to conclusion that greenfield have done be being pretty severely paid out reported a much to doctor who however still deprecated interference might only make thing worse said by meddling thing like always right far better than outsider can right besides a greenfield will get move up after christmas will be le dependent on good grace of present class fellow so matter ended for present a far a master be concerned reader will perhaps feel very indignant declare doctor be neglecting duty in treating so serious matter so lightly ought one say to have investigated

master thomas senior forlorn youth no longer now rollicking tom of fifth meek mild withal sulky hopeful of reverend thomas senior dd of saint dominic watched last of chum go off with anything glee be doomed to three week kicking of heel in empty hall playground of saint dominic with nothing to do one to do with for boy mother be ill kept whole family at home tom baby brother vivacious youth a be be hardly of companionable age yet a to doctor tom by way even in bosom of family always thought talked of father a doctor a for doctor well tom be inclined to shirk risk of more tete tetes than must possibly help with so formidable personage even though be own parent try must tom be let in for once when found face to face one day at dinner with doctor third person to help out occasion be quite early in holiday be indeed about first opportunity father have have since breaking up for anything like conversation with affable son tom conversational power be never very brilliant when in subduing presence of father always dwindled down to nothing be therefore somewhat difficult under circumstance to keep talk going doctor did best tom answered in monosyllable looked fearfully sheepish found best policy be always to keep mouth full so have excuse of good manner on side for silence tom said doctor presently steering round to subject have be for time in mind to question son about be extraordinary demonstration on prize day when greenfield senior came up to get scholarship be said tom colouring up dear boy never supposed be said doctor laughing surprised very much a well a pained must help again said tom of course must tom be sorry to find greenfield be so unpopular in school doctor did not care to put direct question to tom on matter be perplexing hoped to draw out by more indirect mean be mistaken if ever expected for tom with perversity of fellow who will take everything be said a rebuke to showed inclination to follow lead doctor have therefore to ask outright what dreadful crime have committed tom to be treated so severely want to treat severely said tom tom said doctor half angrily be very foolish be not referring to particularly to whole school tom sulked at more than ever be going to be called foolish doctor however tried once more what have done to offend have missed catch at cricket kick at football hope whatever be be once more growled tom heartily wishing meal be over doctor gave up a bad job there be use trying to get rise out of tom if ingenuous youth have be trying to shield form must not have done better a be be only stupidly trying to shield letting dread of doctor father get better of common sense good manner luckily for tom friend wrote to invite to spend last week of holiday in london invitation youth a well a parent for thankfully accepted indeed during holiday mr senior became so ill that poor doctor have thought to spare for anybody anything hope of recovery watched night day through vicissitude of fever when at last crisis be over doctor said must recover said also that unless dr senior wanted to have illness must go away get perfect rest change for week two at very least consequence of be that saint dominic have to reassemble after christmas holiday without doctor to of boy be sorrowful news others regarded circumstance with indifference while one section there be who received intelligence with positive joy strange that section must contain in two such opposite a loman of sixth bramble of fourth junior loman despite run of luck have spent uneasy holiday have be in constant terror of seeing cripps time ventured outside house have be in still more terror of cripps calling up at saint dominic telling doctor about directly after holiday for now loman time be up though have in one way paid off debt to landlord of cockchafer eight pound still knew cripps must make quite a unpleasant about eight pound a about thirty pound probably must a long a doctor be away did matter so much besides examination for exhibition must of course be postponed meant so much longer time for preparation meant so much better chance for loman of winning for when tried must work hard effectively so loman be very glad to hear doctor be away ill so be bramble that youth who by way have during holiday quite recovered from sobering effect of grandmother visit to school be always on look out for escaping eye of constituted authority hardly ever saw doctor from one month end to somehow to know be away to know one be away who ought to be there to look after be glorious opportunity launched at once into series of revolutionary exploit on strength of organised mutiny ten time day have specification drawn up for blowing up saint dominic with paraffin oil there be nothing in short bramble must not venture while doctor be away there be knowing how far might have carried bloodthirsty conspiracy into effect have not mr rastle caught one day with saw sawing leg off writing master stool given such chastisement bodily mental a induced for brief season to retire from public life devote spare time to copying out imposition on first morning after reassembling mr jellicott master in charge of saint

wraysford a much a did loman one else have never entered mind that must go in for have got nightingale be that enough for one half year did one know how have got how must fellow now have assurance to put in for examination oliver always have be queer fellow move struck one a queerer than ever to wraysford one two others occurred in different light if oliver have really won nightingale in manner one suspected must hardly now boldly enter for examination in might possibly not succeed so prove suspicion to be true for subject be almost exactly same a examined in for nightingale unless oliver did a well here a did there be remarkably well must be open for anybody to say of course must steal paper time be why wraysford a thought over became more more uneasy ashamed of one moment persuaded oliver be hypocrite next that be innocent at rate said to examination will settle in due time examination day came once more three rival heard name called upon to come forward occupy memorable front desk in sixth form room time at rate there have be chance for one to take unfair advantage for doctor paper did not reach saint dominic till morning of examination indeed mr jellicott be opening envelope contained when boy entered room one closely observing three boy a glanced down paper must once more have be struck by strange contrast in face oliver a eye glanced rapidly down page be composed immovable wraysford a looked first at paper then hurriedly at oliver loman be perplexed troubled loman be blank pale desponding of three happiest that morning be wraysford not that be sure of success not that conscience be clear of reproach because a sat there working hard hearing one pen on left flying with familiar sound quickly over paper felt at last absolutely sure that have misjudged friend equally resolved come what must of humiliating a confession must be must before day ended be reconciled to oliver greenfield what mattered to then who won exhibition loman might win for cared a long a won back friend however loman at moment did not look much like winning anything if have be in difficulty in former examination be utterly stranded now tried first one question then inspiration seemed to come at last after dashing off few line at random laid down pen burying face in hand gave up to own wretched thought must see cripps soon must go to cripps must come up to saint dominic then well loman did not do much execution that morning be thankful when presently mr jellicott said time will be up in five minute boy announcement be anything welcome to other two competitor of whom be

with pen at inkpot have to dip again threw back second at least unconscious of interest amusement be exciting among sporting section of sixth kept pace up to finish when at last mr jellicott said cease writing bring up paper groaned simultaneously a much a to say second two more must have done examination be over event of memorable day be still to take place five minute later oliver who have retired alone a usual to study there to announce to anxious stephen how have fared in examination caught sudden sound of old familiar footstep outside door sent blood to cheek with strange emotion

exhibition be announced have other three boy actually taking part be competitor few outsider must have felt much interest in result of ordinary examination confined to sixth form boy on occasion a have seen general curiosity be aroused one expected much of loman school have discovered pretty well by time that be impostor chief surprise have be that must venture into list against two such good men a oliver wraysford of two be to win be question one few have be positive must be wraysford whom looked upon a lawful winner of nightingale last term whom be convinced oliver be unable to beat by fair mean yet to have be great astonishment to hear that oliver have entered for examination unless be certain of winning must only do harm by confirm suspicion against yet if must win after if be able fairly to beat wraysford why must have gone to trouble last term of stealing examination paper making most unpopular boy in saint dominic question sorely exercised school made await eagerly announcement of result news came at last have just received said mr jellicott that morning when fifth sixth be assembled together in lecture theatre have just received from examiner report on waterston examination result be a follows first greenfield mark second wraysford mark third loman mark here mr jellicott be interrupted by laugh muttered bravo loman very good in what sounded to knowing something like pembury voice master looked up frowned angrily then proceeded examiner add expression of very high approval of greenfield answer highest mark obtainable be considering left last question untouched doubtless for want of time feel that have passed with very great distinction fully in accordance with expectation of winner of nightingale scholarship last term will now proceed to usual lesson announcement made strangest impression on present one attempted demonstration while mr jellicott be speaking many perplexed troubled face turned to where oliver by side of friend wraysford be sitting wraysford face be beaming a clapped friend on back oliver looked a unconcerned indifferent a ever fellow be puzzle certainly a soon a lesson be over fifth retired to own quarter in perturbed state of mind there to ponder over what have happened oliver spared embarrassment of society a usual wraysford be not there either so fifth be left pretty much to own device guidance of lesser light be queer said ricketts whoever must have thought of turning out like one must understand said braddy if there have be chance of repeating dodge of last term must have done know said may have be up to other dodge perhaps copied off wraysford hardly likely said bullinger up on front desk just under jellicott nose well ca make out at said ricketts can said bullinger while pembury have not spoken now turned to simon said what do think simon did see greenfield stealing examination paper time eh oh not time promptly replied poet last term be know did see time oh did even see with in pocket now be very careful be sure did have in pocket day before exam why said simon laughing at pembury innocence how must see what be in fellow pocket pembury silly ca tell what be in pocket oh ca thought must upon honour thought saw paper in greenfield pocket last term so did be here wretched poet be interrupted by general laugh in midst of modestly retired to background left fifth to solve riddle in hand by suppose began pembury after pause suppose when braddy done playing fool if time ever come here braddy collapsed entirely must sooner be sat upon by dr senior than by pembury suppose once more began pembury amid dead silence suppose instead of greenfield senior being thief liar of have be fool worse for last six month must that be funny fellow why do mean demanded tom senior why suppose mean anything do retorted cross grained tony what be use of saying what mean do really began bullinger say suppose bullinger one two others here who ought to have known better have be making fool of ourselves must that be funny there be pause till simon plucking up heart replied very funny gravity even of pembury broke down at present conference of fifth ended without arriving at nearer conclusion on question be perplexing meanwhile oliver wraysford be in study talking over event of day be certain how must be old boy said wraysford genuinely delighted wonder what fifth will say now bah doe become to say too much though for be a bad a of no be old boy never really believed say wray intend to take exhibition must have exclaimed wraysford not bit of won never meant to go in for must have if have not be for fifth after be only twenty pound do take old man have got nightingale know what doe matter must have for anything fellow tried to make think be real winner of nightingale be idiot enough half to believe think have have lesson wray not word dear fellow wo hear of very well then will shy money when get into nearest fish pond serene said wraysford laughing hope fish will relish at moment there be knock at door come in said oliver door opened to astonishment of two boy loman entered be peace war what loman miserable face strange manner quickly answered question oh greenfield said excuse want to speak to here glanced at wraysford who rose to go stay where be wray said oliver what be loman loman quite cowed hardly knew how to go on be glad to hear got waterston said thought must what be fellow at after long pause seemed to drive loman almost to despair said will wonder what have come here for know have not be friend greenfield be in awful trouble what be again asked oliver why fact be said loman gaining courage a found neither oliver wraysford disposed to resent visit fact be greenfield be in debt have be very foolish know betting say greenfield must possibly must lend eight pound know why ask unless can pay money to day will what exclaimed oliver eight pound to pay bet oh not bet have be swindled too by cripps know cripps here loman utterly miserable threw down on chair looked beseechingly at two friend must pay back in month so went on at rate before easter do lend please greenfield know where else to go ask will get into such awful row if ca pay will oliver looked at wraysford wraysford looked at oliver then looked at loman sight of wretched boy there entreating money of very fellow who have least reason in saint dominic to like be strange indeed wray said oliver abruptly after pause during have evidently made up mind have money about have three pound said wraysford taking out purse oliver went to desk took from five pound note be there saving for last year with wraysford three sovereign handed without word to loman then not waiting to hear thanks wretched boy tried to utter took wraysford arm walked out of study chapter thirty two dominican come round fifth be good while coming round on question of greenfield senior delay be more on account of pride than because still considered old class fellow knave have taken up such grand position last term talked so magnificently about honour morality credit of school that be sad come down now to have to admit have be wrong still more that have be fool yet after what have happened must no longer retain suspicion of oliver greenfield few of better sort like pembury bullinger have courage at cost to act up to conviction declared at once that have be wrong be ashamed of next step be to approach oliver be more difficult for be such queer fellow there be knowing where to have however pembury wit helped over difficulty a usual be hobbling down passage one morning when suddenly encountered oliver wraysford arm in arm approaching if at time in life pembury did feel uncomfortable awkward felt now if let go by time without making up somehow chance might never come again how to set about be difficulty half second brought two nearer twenty different idea flashed through mind be not sort of fellow to go to one eat humble pie straight off be far too tame proceeding no there be only one way must think of must chance that noll old man said in old familiar tone have got spare arm may take oliver stopped short looked at for instant in astonishment next moment with hearty rather slipped arm into of happy pembury three went on way rejoicing sight moral for saint dominic be whole of anthony pembury making up a for bullinger wrote man letter worded in beautiful english in most elegant handwriting punctuated to nicety setting forth contrition hope that greenfield must henceforth reckon among friend yours very sincerely h bullinger literary effort carefully dispatched by guinea pig to destination awaited reply with utmost impatience reply be laconic highly satisfactory be verbal one given by oliver in class that afternoon who volunteered information to delighted bullinger that be jolly day be indeed jolly day to contrite youth never believed must all be got over so easily have dreaded sort of scene lecture humiliation here be by single word passed back straight into friendship question asked sight of oliver surrounded by three friend of whom must have be hard to say be happiest made deep impression on rest of fifth certainly did not tend to make feel more comfortable a to what ought to do in similar direction be very well said ricketts when question be being canvassed for hundredth time among immediate friend dare say be right make jolly uncomfortable for ought to have given in in way without letting rest of know first said braddy just see what corner put in can say be said tom senior will be better satisfied when know who did collar that paper if greenfield did oh said simon seeing chance can assure saw when took be going shut up great booby cried ricketts who asked anything about simon modestly retired hereupon braddy took up talk yes who did take paper be greenfield must have done why a good a admitted last term well then be very queer fellow making up to said ricketts be use trying to send fellow to coventry when others back up wraysford always be daft about greenfield said tom senior be astonished at pembury bullinger can say be said braddy greenfield will have to ask before have anything to do with do know said ricketts heard to day be down to play in match against county be exclaimed braddy in excitement very well then will not play if doe that be about ricketts laughed awfully sorry old man be not in fifteen time braddy face be picture at moment turned red blue white in astonishment what exclaimed a soon a must find word be not in team will see list on notice board 'd better go look off went wretched braddy to be convinced of fate be in team ricketts see said tom senior will play if greenfield doe know said ricketts fellow doe get chance to play against county day be precious awkward so be be just where began too said tom philosophically a matter of fact whenever young gentleman of fifth started subject of greenfield senior among always found in end at identical place from have set out be only boy at saint dominic in dilemma guinea pig tadpole be equally taken aback by new aspect of affair young gentleman have looked upon oliver row with class a peculiar mercy designed specially for benefit have hardly known happy time a during row have lasted did want pretext for battle greenfield senior be glorious bone of contention did want object for indignation meeting what better object must have than greenfield senior did want excuse generally for laziness disobedience tumult greenfield senior served for too indeed name of fifth form martyr have passed into household word among lower school of glory reproach round small fry rallied a round old flag of battle now friend foe be aghast to guinea pig charm of position have be that be greenfield senior sole champion in saint dominic while one else avoided stuck to week day sunday now however discovered with something like consternation that no longer have field to sight of greenfield senior walking down passage one day arm in arm with wraysford next day with one arm in wraysford other in pembury day after between pembury bullinger with wraysford stephen in rear struck bewilderment bitter jealousy to heart have come out into passage to cheer went away silently sadly feeling that very occupation be departed bramble always quick to see chance took advantage a usual of panic hullo say guinea pig can shut up shop now know be going to let off greenfield senior time ai padger jolly fellow greenfield senior be abominable to have hero idol thus calmly taken out of hand appropriated by set of sneaking tadpole

critical period in history of saint dominic that new number of dominican came out pembury have be compelled to write nearly for in present state of divided feeling in fifth found harder than ever to get contribution even of own way of thinking oliver wraysford bullinger begged to be let off indeed two former ingeniously pleaded that a be now really sixth form fellow though remaining in old class till doctor came home have right to have hand in fifth form magazine conscientious scruple on ground be so strong that persuasion of anthony must shake so unlucky editor have finally a on previous

fellow have got to do be to keep ball in close nurse along while else run 'd better let quarter back do that sage advice be not thrown away on worthy who lead van for saint dominic opportunity for putting into practice occurs moment game begin for school have to kick off to kick off against wind be hopeless business stansfield doe not attempt anything like big kick just drive ball hard low on to leg of county forward sending own men close after so that scrimmage be formed almost at very spot where ball ground now school sit on do hear call out captain certainly look a if unhappy ball be never destined to see light again enemy forward can not get out from among foot of school forward try will until by sheer weight simply force through then when doe go through there be young forrester

be ashamed of chapter thirty five vocal instrumental dramatic entertainment in fourth junior now among who be present to witness famous rush up of greenfield senior wraysford ended in fall of county goal be one boy who showed very little enthusiasm over achievement very little delight at glory school thereby derived loman who unable to sit in study not knowing what else to do have wandered almost instinctively to meadow found on particular afternoon one of most miserable boy in saint dominic two year ago when first entered school be popular with fellow voted acquisition on cricket ground football field whenever youth of saint dominic strove in emulation against rival must remember time when fellow strolled arm in arm with down to match when small boy looked quite meek in presence master gave friendly nod in answer to salute be when be quite new at saint dominic how changed now afternoon for instance a stood looking on have cheerful knowledge that not boy in assembly cared two straw about why be playing in match why did fellow a came near look straight in front of go round to avoid why did guinea pig tadpole strut about crack vulgar joke right under very nose a if be nobody ala loman something be wrong with for last year thereabouts if know cause can see effect for be fact be nobody in eye of saint dominic at present time however be destined to become somebody pretty soon indeed a soon a football match be over supper after be disposed of guinea pig tadpole who know have selected same afternoon for great football match have ceased row in slumber one mind at least mind of one in two head form turned naturally to strange mysterious event of morning what various conclusion came to be not for to set down here probably came to a good conclusion a reader have done waited impatiently to have whole thing cleared up looked a if doctor be about to do next morning for summoned together fifth sixth thus solemnly addressed before begin lesson for day boy wish to refer to incident happened here yesterday morning must be fresh in memory mean accidental discovery of lost examination paper for nightingale scholarship hope will not draw hasty conclusion from what then occurred boy in whose book paper be found be present here have assured on honour never saw paper before be quite ignorant how came into book be so loman yes sir replied loman when boy make statement to on honour accept a such said doctor very gravely looking hard at boy accept a such loman sat motionless with eye on desk before went on doctor turning again to boy before dismiss subject must do justice to one among who find much to pain have be object of suspicion in connection with same lost paper greenfield senior have hesitation in saying be perfectly clear of such imputation a put upon may say in presence believe to be incapable of fraudulent mean act further than that boy will be interested to hear that question answered so brilliantly in examination be not question appeared on lost paper at entirely new set for own satisfaction drew up on morning of examination announcement did interest one fifth particularly who felt own humiliation now fourfold a looked at oliver thought of what conduct to have be interested oliver wraysford a much a one for different reason supposing loman have taken paper be reflection darted through mind supposing loman have taken paper worked up answer from might not sudden change of question described by doctor account for low place have taken in exam altogether doctor speech left thing except a concerned oliver not much more satisfactory than before natural impulse of everybody be to suspect loman then six month ago natural impulse have be equally a strong to suspect oliver well that have somehow turned out bad spec so might so saint dominic really did know what to think settled down to work of term in uneasy frame of mind wishing something must turn up to end wretched affair of lost paper definitely one way of course report of new state of affair soon penetrated down to lower school guinea pig tadpole at rate be not slow in making up mind on burning question turned out in body hooted loman up down passage with a much if not more glee than of have lately hooted oliver yah boo who stole exam paper there old loman such be cry presently became familiar in school until one day mr rastle dropped down on twenty of howler set twelve proposition of euclid to learn by heart two hour piece in detention room there to meditate over evil way quiet of lower school during next week be something delicious tyrannical proceeding on part of mr rastle provoked bitter indignation of course in breast of culprit why be to be allowed to express feeling if rastle did want to pot why must give euclid to learn when knew perfectly well euclid be very thing not one of must learn by heart if did want to detain why ever must fix on identical week in grand vocal instrumental dramatic entertainment of fourth junior be due to come off be

unanimous one contumacious tadpole who have escaped notice having hand held down by side during ceremony a soon a door be open bramble who have meanwhile collected large muster of adherent rushed in turning out guinea pig have elected treasurer padger honorary secretary exciting appointment having be made meeting be thrown open programme be drawn up preparation be in very forward state when sad interruption occasioned by mr rastle brutal conduct took place if mr rastle thought be going to extinguish vocal instrumental dramatic entertainment be woefully mistaken a soon a ever by superhuman exertion bramble few others of potted one have struggled through euclid served term of detention evening be fixed upon for great event to come off immediately question arose must public be admitted rather exclaimed bramble treasurer five bob master half price suggested padger greenfield senior free shouted loyal paul bah do think greenfield senior must come to hear spout young muff roared amiable bramble know what must come for retorted paul 'd come with too guess sha guess will padger may a well suggested padger 'd come cried paul not waiting for tadpole to guess 'd come mile to see hung so must there be time before meeting got back to subject of admitting public be finally agreed that though public be not to be invited door must be left open one presenting card young bilbury suggested might come in with exception of loman mr rastle tom braddy school cat for next few day guinea pig tadpole be busy learning part practising song arranging detail of dramatic performance so on mr rastle have to pot one two more of detain one two others before must get anything like ordinary work of class done young vocal instrumental dramatic enthusiast bore patiently devoting so many extra ounce of dynamite to mr rastle promised blow up for offence at last festival day arrived stephen on whom somehow work have devolved while talking discussion of knotty point have fallen on two brother officer looked quite pale anxious on eventful morning well young 'un said oliver suppose wray be to be allowed to come see fun to night yes said stephen with considerable misgiving about fun serene will be there wo wray not first guinea pig kick up have be witness to do think pembury will come asked stephen nervously oh rather will have to report in next dominican will see come oh think need

being fleeced made promise not to utter word of to doctor so really know how to help be impression be good reason to be afraid of doctor just now said wraysford that nightingale business have yet to be cleared up two friend pursued disagreeable topic farther agreed for loman be nice boy for have of much cause to love must see next day if must not do something to help in difficulty meanwhile gave over to pure refined enjoyment of vocal instrumental dramatic entertainment at seven evening after tea fourth junior room became centre of attraction to saint dominic fellow from sixth fifth always ready for novelty in way of amusement looked in to see sport fourth senior grandly condescended to witness vulgar exploit of junior other class be most of represented by one more spectator programme have be carefully got up stephen took chair solemnly at appointed hour with great deal of stammering announced that proceeding be now about to commence then sat down awful pause ensued at first be borne with interest then with impatience then when stephen began to whisper to paul paul began to signal to bramble bramble gesticulated in dumb show at padger four whispered together finally looked very gravely in opposite direction to audience then began to be amused oh said stephen very red turning round abruptly after awkward pause have continued for minute two oh be wrong doe begin other fellow away look here bramble do thing now ca whispered bramble in audible voice have forgotten first line something about kid asleep suggested padger also audibly oh yes said bramble starting up blushing very red a began line on seeing wife two child asleep ' hood modest announcement of subject be overwhelming in be greeted with such yell of laughter that poor elocutionist found utterly impossible to go on tried once twice never got beyond first half line have earth here stuck in answer to cheer began again looking round for padger to help have earth go padger give fellow leg up ca ca find place said padger very hot flurried whipping over page of book with moist thumb have earth look in index lout wo give to afterwards once more began wretched bramble got farther even have remembered word voice must never have risen above laughter continued a long a remained on foot retired at length in dudgeon stephen called on paul for song went off better only everybody stamped time with foot so that singer must neither be heard for row seen for dust after followed reading time subject be humorous one ben battle by t hood one by way chose hood be only poetry book to be have in fourth junior reading progressed satisfactorily for first two line indeed until joke occurred here reader be so overcome with humour of thing that broke into laugh time tried to begin next line laughed before must get out until at last got to be quite a monotonous a watching hyena at zoological garden finally did get through line in voice so weak wavering by reason of effort not to laugh that effect be more ludicrous than ever must get farther however for recollection of joke have passed anticipation of one be coming fairly doubled up let book drop out of hand in middle of one of convulsion next performance be instrumental one bade fair to be great success four of boy have learned to whistle home sweet home in part be now about to ravish audience with time honoured melody stood meekly side by side in straight line facing audience waiting for leader to begin screwing mouth up into proper shape just a signal be given have taken long breath be in act of letting out lout in audience laughed result may be imagined first note be to have be so beautiful sounded just like letting off of steam from four leaky safety valve effort must recover melody more tried more laughed more laughed more audience roared there stood with face of mingled agony mirth frantically trying to get sound out never came finally have to retire leaving audience to imagine what effect of home sweet home might have be have only got at however a dramatic performance came next audience be comforted modest subject chosen be hamlet stephen who be combining duty of master of ceremony with of president rose said to company turn round look till tell of course one pretended to turn round of course everybody looked a hard a must saw bramble hop up on chair lower gas to represent night saw paul padger stick up two three form on end to represent castle saw two other boy walk majestically on to platform in ulster billycock hat trouser turned up stick in hand to represent soldier now can turn round cried stephen did turn round just at very moment when bramble attempting to lower gas still further turned right out effect be remarkable one nothing be visible out of black darkness came following singular dialogue who be there have got lucifer about of nay answer stand unfold be fool in agitated accent be shoving off platform why light up long live king ah here be one what be become of chair next moment amid great applause gas be re lit thrilling tragedy proceeded went on right till ghost enters here calamity occurred padger be acting ghost dressed up in long sheet with flour on face being rather late in coming on did so at very unghostlike pace in hurry tripped up on bottom of sheet falling flop on platform being none of cleanest left impression of dust on face garment greatly added to horror of appearance recovered perpendicular with help of two soldier few friend be about to proceed with part when door suddenly opened mr rastle appeared have evidently not come to see show indeed hardly seemed aware that show be going on face be grave voice agitated a said have one here seen loman one have seen since breakfast that morning be greenfield senior here yes sir answered oliver will come with to doctor at once please oliver be out in passage in moment hurrying with master to dr senior study be afraid said mr rastle a went be afraid something have happened to

of unhappy schoolfellow trouble of difficulty worse still of dishonesty for oliver have doubt in mind that loman have taken examination paper came to mind now with terrifying force oliver have never be fond of loman a reader know somehow there be time when one forgets whether one be fond of person not oliver felt a if must give anything now to be sure here be at doctor study dr senior be standing at fireplace with very grave look holding letter in hand greenfield said moment boy entered when did see loman last last night sir after preparation be not in class morning sir sent down word have

nothing for to narrate knew of loman recent money difficulty of connection with cripps of own wraysford share in helping out of strait doctor heard have to say putting in question here there whenever

to feel ground very uncomfortable round here be telling tale right left help for surely doctor be carrying little too far do suppose loman be in debt at time have idea replied boy wondering have to do with loman disappearance now wonder why ask question said doctor apparently reading boy thought letter will explain will read to a may be able to throw light on received just now be from cripps hon sir take liberty of informing that one of young gent name be mister loman be prig be be regular down at shop twelve month never paid farthing for liquor more than that be be drawing money from up to thirty five pound have got promissory note due last micklemas said be going to get nightingale something then must pay off be flat enough to believe if ai enough be be played nicely over rod sold might have persecuted over job did cracked to right then try to pas back on for same a when got if have be bit sharper folk must have be clean done be to tell ai going to stand no longer if get money there will be rumpus up at school wo be pleasant for none of so shortest cut be to send on money sharp to humble servant ben cripps p have wrote told young swell have put on job be evident said mr rastle letter have something to do with loman disappearance yes said oliver be awfully frightened of father getting to know about sir foolish boy said doctor with half groan what little must be done at late hour be done strict inquiry be made on hand a to when where missing boy be last seen be ascertained that must have left saint dominic that morning during early class time when one supposed ill in bed with headache where have gone with what object telegram be sent to father reply came back that boy have not gone home that mr loman be on way to saint dominic at maltby railway station one have seen heard anything of meanwhile mr rastle have gone down to cockchafer to see cripps landlord be not at home said potboy be most likely up along with old 'un at lock from mr rastle gathered there be chance of seeing mr cripps junior at residence of mr cripps senior at gusset lock house thither accordingly went mr cripps junior be there sweetly smoking particularly amiable in answer to mr rastle inquiry made secret of belief that boy have run away for fear of exposure see mister said like getting young folk into trouble when come to robbing man downright why considers dooty to give governor tip let know mr rastle have opinion to offer on question of moral what wanted to know be whether cripps have seen boy day have slightest idea what have become of mr cripps laughed at idea not likely said 'd tell where be goin ' to when 'd got thirty five pound of mine in pocket young thief can say be 'd better not show up again in hurry till little bill squared up here mr cripps relapsed into quite state of righteous indignation wait till do come back say repeated will be on mister error will let folk know kind of young gent turn out up at school so will mr rastle took notice of admitted to that man have reason for being disagreeable if loman have really absconded with debt a represented thirty five pound continued cripps becoming quite sentimental over wrong if wo believe look at here bit of paper have got in return for money have got so saying took from pocket exhibited to mr rastle very promissory note signed by loman have pretended to tear up burn last time that unhappy boy be at cockchafer have mr rastle known a much a reader know must not have wasted more time over mr cripps must have seen that have happened to boy mr cripps purpose be to make money by did not know looked at bill with mingled astonishment sorrow a important piece of evidence really owed asked did so brass farthing have waited ever since michaelmas for mister ai going to wait no longer must have money slap down let know somebody will hear of have paid something said mr rastle remembering be account of loan of eight pound have exclaimed cripps satirically oh be right only ai seen be do mean have paid anything demanded mr rastle becoming impatient with jocular manner of course a say so ai for to say contrairy if have told must have said ai paid one brass farthing so now dear dear exclaimed mr rastle of course if be so loman must have borrowed eight pound from oliver on false pretence kept for own use tell what broke in mr cripps in midst of meditation want to hing unpleasant to governor anybody what say be 'd better see little bill put square among then thing can be kept quiet do see must be awkward for to have regular shindy about man be what will come to if get money declaration mr cripps delivered in solemn voice be nearest approach to earnestness be mistaken in expecting mr rastle to be much affected overawed by on contrary gave that gentleman new insight into acquaintance character decided that prolongation of interview must neither be pleasant profitable so mr rastle abruptly turned went much to regret of cripps who have not half spoken mind yet returning to school master reported have to say be not much there anxious night be spent by master one two boy who be in confidence in matter half hope that loman might return of own accord before night be quickly dispelled bed time came sign of later father arrived anxious excited be closeted for time with doctor meanwhile everything must be done at time of night be done maltby newspaper be communicated with police unpleasant a be master decided right thing to do be to make matter known at once not damage chance of boy discovery by attempt to keep disappearance quiet at dawn next day organised search be begun inquiry be started in direction mr cripps among others once more received honour of visit time from mr loman who greatly to astonishment of worthy landlord called for son promissory note being produced paid without word cripps be fairly taken aback by unexpected piece of business even trifle disconcerted never suited to be quite square with anybody now that mr loman have paid farthing must be claimed against son did not like look of mr loman at liked le before interview ended for mr loman who by way be barrister by profession put man that morning through cross examination wanted wit to get over creditably a be be once twice driven completely into corner have to acknowledge for sake of telling one lie that last twenty statement have made have be lie too still mr loman kept at now wanted to know exactly how often son have visited cockchafer when be there last when time before what have done during visit have played card with whom with cripps have lost have cripps won have cripps gone on letting run up score lose money even though got payment why have cripps done so where have expected to get payment from in end altogether be hot quarter for cripps that morning once twice struck completely putting on dignity declared be going to be questioned brow beated a if be common pickpocket objection mr loman quietly silenced by saying very well turning to go movement so terrified worthy publican that caved in at once submitted to further question mr loman then followed up advantage by finding out must about companion whom son have be in habit of meeting on occasion of visit to cockchafer what be name occupation address so on cripps if one have told twenty four hour ago that must be meekly divulging information to one in own house must have
