whispered what be so quiet about down there of course must not answer do hear what be so quiet about only added to misery to know that there be fellow being so close at hand yet be powerless to make aware of condition silence offended for turned away muttering to sulky humbug declare people have so much a manner of kitchen clock after be left to myself in agony suspense to wait moment of dissolution long time passed before master stirred when did housekeeper tea be cold bustled about to make more be so kind in buttering toast hunting for jam that drooping spirit of tired out boy revived wonderfully indeed a meal proceeded became on friendly confidential term even with so awful personage a mr packer must like to see knife ma'be asked bless what knife be cried lady will go

randlebury be melancholy tedious be hard for after boisterous surroundings of public school to settle down to heavy monotony of dull lodging in back street of london be harder still after being pride favourite of boy like charlie newcome to find property of tom drift not that tom used badly at first wound up regularly for sake of absent friend honoured with considerable share of affection indeed for first week so be quite gushing scarcely letting out of sight sometimes even dropping tear over remembering charlie last word be good to tom drift felt glad to be able to remind new master of old

tom have eye open saw evil a well a good ala for having seen looked still student of saint elizabeth hospital be not on whole bad set on tom arrival in london however have firm impression in mind that medical student be bad character foolish notion did much harm if two three of be to go off for spree imagination must at once picture in scene place such a respectable man must like to frequent whereas if truth be known misjudged young men have committed no greater crime than of taking boat up river drive in dog cart if group of must be seen by laughing talking instinctively concluded topic must be ribaldry whereas must perhaps be only joking at expense of eccentric professor else chaffing one of own number so happened that tom failed in time to distinguish between really bad such a only imagined to be bad from habit of looking on at doings from studied distance presence began gradually insensibly to exercise very considerable influence over mind after must sometimes say to fellow get on pas exam pay bill gain confidence of professor at same time manage to enjoy perhaps be fool to take so much pain about first three of thing to deny fourth perhaps after fellow be not so bad a have fancied perhaps be prudish then silly fellow having once inclined to admit there be something to be said for medical student having before considered bad alike became tolerant round more particularly of really bad set who appeared to to enjoy most a companion became more attractive to work became le interesting why must grind plod here said while one else be enjoying if young charlie be here be

something like old eagerness discharged duty in ward with interest thoroughness refused to allow mind to be distracted by proceeding of fellow student resolved to spend very evening at mr newcome tom drift must probably have laughed at idea that sudden change be due entirely to charlie letter to seemed like spontaneous reassertion of natural self by mind matter for such self congratulation

charlie master that must remain appeal so pathetic that there be resisting charlie politely handed good people to chair while jim under cover of preparing second edition of breakfast hastily arranged

to find jim alone over quiet cup of cocoa to reduce to sense of wickedness put out of reckoning quite to find that if be to open fire at once must have to be in presence of two gentlemanly rather imposing stranger however be too full of mission to delay so uncle began will be a well james must state to not word now till have have breakfast interrupted wary jim poor dear aunt must be simply

unbounded delight gratitude george began calmly to give review quarter of hour long of work in question for benefit of two old people who a listened became more more impressed with importance of nephew friend of impossibility of obtruding special grievance on party at present time indeed aunt have almost forgotten speech with have come prepared in pleasure at hearing young men talk even joined in conversation in manner showed how enjoyed uncle be still gloomy appeared to be waiting first favourable opportunity for coming to point opportunity however never occurred after long lively talk on sort of matter jim adroitly turned conversation on to subject of athletics by appealing to uncle to add voice to of reader other friend in rebuking for never taking exercise look at pale face exclaimed be disgrace george bore attack good naturedly began to excuse uncle who have not before noticed look interrupted by saying pardon sir quite agree with james if be very wrong to cultivate brain at expense of body observation brought down charlie hearty approval who forthwith launched into rhapsody on athletic sport particularly football appealing in sentence to uncle who now found fairly in toil if be for nothing more than moral training give man said charlie for pluck manliness endurance put into must over estimate value of athletics must sir er be to say why look at jim here upon word sir if will excuse saying doe greatest credit way have be brought up to value healthy exercise why there be parent guardian who instead of encouraging sort of thing must positively so far wrong son a to forbid ca make out that sort of training can eh well possibly not faltered uncle turning very red of course not will have reward in seeing jim turn out far better clergyman than mollycoddle who know way to look fellow men straight in face jim old man have have cup up there ten minute hand up jim filled to overflowing a token perhaps of gratitude of heart towards champion forthwith handed up propos of pursued charlie having gulped down coffee be just come up here in nick of time for there be glorious football match on to day uncle groaned aunt fidgeted in jim be playing one deserves honour better must come see by mean eh jim rather said jim must never do to miss especially a newcome be playing against worst of be a be engaged there will be one to pilot about

since gained over by enemy will be most pleased to have escort eh love besides will help to keep out in fresh air for once james said ca get over mr newcome being opponent in match yet such friend one laughed at charlie confided to good lady fixed determination of breaking nephew leg before day be out purpose from speaker point of view must not help admitting be laudable one thus breakfast ended

cried aunt starting on tiptoe well to be sure five onto one what shame so kept up running commentary on fortune of game much to george amusement that of near now then uncle appeared suddenly to recollect must come out with grunt of disapproval once for instance when by sort of common impulse whole of player engaged in one of scrimmage fell to ground be hardy enough to ejaculate disgraceful hold tongue love broke in wife know very well 'd like to be in if be boy must after that uncle thought said nothing side appeared to be very evenly matched so much so that when half time be called

before have known so familiarly a property of charlie newcome at first must not believe marvelled how two watch must be so much alike then discovered cn scratched long ago inside well remembered further inquiry enabling to trace back to muggerbridge silversmith from to pawnbroker sale in london have doubt left be actually watch of nothing have be heard since tom drift owned new master did not long remain in cambridge after death of friend left university in many respect more thoughtful earnest man than have entered in leaving set honestly faithfully to work for have prepared on heart be fixed will not follow through labour of first village curacy lasted year during time many people learned to love manly open hearted young clergyman to bless day when have be sent among at end of year be removed to charge of church in distant large seaport where everything be in strangest contrast with scene have just left instead of simple villager rustic work now lay amongst labourer artisan of poorest lowest class instead of fresh country air have now to breathe vitiated air of close court ill kept street instead of atmosphere of repose innocence have now to move in atmosphere of vice disorder from very often soul turned with deep disgust still worked manfully at post with bold heart ready to face hardship in service of master never weary of striving by spirit help to bring into hard life around elevating joy alone know who can call christ saviour theirs one day adventure befell have strange bearing on own fortune fortune of more than one of several master gaol chaplain at seatown have recently died during interval necessary for appointing successor jim be asked undertook to add to other labour that of visiting prisoner confined there be melancholy on whole monotonous work for person whom thus attended be mostly stupid ignorant being on whose hardened soul be difficult indeed to make slightest impression listened sulkily to what chaplain have to say to appearance neither understood cared about single word have disappointment of noticing week after week month after month scarcely sign of good rising out of labour in case of one of one day governor met a be about to pay customary visit oh good morning sir will find new customer to day gaol governor will observe spoke about prisoner in very commercial sort of way yes queer one too added doe look like one of regular customer what be imprisoned for be drunk quarrelled with sailor on quay pushed into water believe be sailor drowned fished out gentleman have got six month for seems very down about so 'd like to see right will make point of visiting cell good morning jim went on round thinking very little about governor communication presently came to gallery in new prisoner cell be asked turnkey to show door use going in there muttered that functionary why asked jim do swear so a never hear cove swear afore ah said jim suppose have heard good deal too in time so may say here young fellow come out with a if 'd skin alive well must see let in please when door be opened prisoner back be turned did alter position a jim entered cell there be undoubtedly something unusual about man figure be not that of labourer rough be attitude one of stolid brutishness such a chaplain have grown only too familiar with jim stood moment irresolute then said may speak to friend man turned without raising eye from stone floor poured out volley of curse fully justified turnkey description jim started uttered quick exclamation be not at curse terrible a be amazement be of kind altogether for in face voice of unhappy speaker be forcibly reminded of one once knew in very different scene a man went on watched keenly earnestly heeded not oath taunt threat flowed from lip a word followed word gesture gesture look look became gradually convinced that resemblance be more than imaginary indeed blaspheming convict be one whom have once known still remembered walking up to laying hand on shoulder jim said quietly tom drift do remember man started a for instant raised eye then letting drop once more growled be not name know let alone jim more convinced than ever now did wisest thing must in leaving cell without word well said turnkey with half triumphant grin a turned to leave gallery be right did give dozen a pretty bit of language a ever heard speak to about please replied jim more tartly than have be ever known to speak to one did not return to gaol for week then first visit paid be to new prisoner cell entered anxiously not without misgiving tom drift be sitting on little bench with head in hand may come in said jim nervously tom spoke raised head jim quietly stepped in be evident interview of week ago have have effect on tom drift seemed a sat there like man who must fain lose if only knew how never once raised head from hand uttered syllable while jim sat talked to latter knew better than to return to topic have so startled prisoner week ago contented with mere kindly talk reading of short passage of scripture tom suffered without interruption stirring head foot time now good bye said jim rising get to think have friend man fidgeted impatiently next moment jim be out in gallery what be man name inquired of turnkey dyke tell what mr halliday open door please man interrupted jim by way of cutting short during week followed jim be restless out of spirit seemed unable to settle down to anything be evident heart be ill at ease why be easy to guess have found tom drift there be chance of rescuing how to do how to approach one who be ashamed of own name who repelled with oath offer of help long earnestly did master think over matter also wrote long letter to charlie telling promising to do must be done for poor prodigal during day intervened before next visit too made a

have found once down by water edge looking a though intended to throw in man who gave drink at public house remembered man whom have assaulted be wretched enough be picture presented of hopeless friendless vagabond weary of life yet not daring to die finding only solace in deeper degradation tom be walking to fro in cell next time jim called be almost first time have be able to get view of face oh how changed be not merely that looked pale worn with bloodshot eye hectic cheek there be scared despairing look there fairly shocked dissipation shame want have set mark there ala how soon may likeness of god be degraded defaced continued to walk to fro a jim sat down began to read must see more than once darted quick glance from under clouded eyebrow at master must tell by beating of latter heart that have made up mind not to leave morning without effort to speak to tom of old time trembled for result of venture seemed impossible to say word while tom continued to walk up down cell like caged beast in den jim saw that moment opportunity be becoming le likely will stand still listen to moment said at last tom growled out oath halted in front of be quick said be not going to preach said jim want to look at something want to look at nothing muttered tom beginning to walk again must will look at exclaimed jim starting at once to foot tom stopped short suddenly turned upon like hunted animal jim neither faltered quailed walked resolutely up to poor fellow suddenly drawing from pocket held out towards saying look at tom drift tom knew at once never saw man change a did that moment savage scowl vanished from face sudden pallor came to hollow cheek trembling seized a held out hand to take for jim support must hardly have remained standing master led gently to bench putting into hand said will leave with till to morrow old fellow good bye heard key turn in door behind counted retreating footstep down gallery then became fully conscious where in whose charge be now old familiar sound rang in ear once more be good to tom drift long long have ceased to believe possible that chance of obeying dear first master request must ever again come to here be lay in prodigal trembling hand looked up into troubled face heard deep drawn sigh felt that there be still something left for to do one disturbed tom drift that night jim have explained enough to governor to gain permission for to remain in poor fellow company till next day need hardly say never left hand memory of better day of noble friend of broken vow crowded in upon a sat bending over that night

difficulty now for jim halliday tom even gave up when heard how have come into master possession then asked about charlie jim told knew so week went on hope once more lit up tom drift face how must help rejoicing in share have have in blessed work of restoration ala how fleeting be world satisfaction short time afterwards only week so before termination of tom drift imprisonment master be

ordered to hold in readiness for immediate service at seat of war in india what excitement there be what cheer exultation what spirit men be in what friend one became of sudden with everybody else

vein once more to have heart beat again with renewed animation master glee be only equalled by astonishment looked at first a if suspected duck downie of being in league with supernatural power when eminent mechanic took trouble to explain to value of operation have just performed on paddy without word rushed out at risk of sort of penalty into town knew peace till have possessed of kay henceforth became inseparable companion of watered ribbon chapter twenty seven how made long journey reached happiest moment of life one morning in autumn of same year small cluster of men standing on deck of troopship lizard a tumbled lazily forward over wave descried in far horizon before dim low line of blue master be one of cluster having recovered from depression have afflicted spirit stomach during early part of voyage now celebrated discovery of india with cry so outlandish other manifestation of joy so extravagant one of be pitching one of sergeant cap overboard that be instantly summoned before officer in command ordered to remain below for next twelve hour be need hardly say disappointment to of day long heard overhead crowding of footstep clanking of chain banging about of baggage men be paraded on deck one two servant down where be be very busy polishing officer sword altogether looked a if be not intended to remain hour longer in bombay than be necessary before marching to front indeed arrival of newspaper on board along with pilot created ferment among officer men that be evident something unusual have happened since last heard news when towards evening master be allowed once more to come on deck be not long in discovering cause of indian mutiny have just broken out when left england have suddenly assumed enormous hideous dimension rebel taking advantage of first success seemed to have gone mad with most cruel madness helpless englishwoman child have be massacred outraged gallant englishman overpowered by number have be put to shameful death one by one stronghold have be surprised captured carrying before traitor bade fair to leave england not so much a foothold in india be enough to make blood of tamest among boil with indignation a dreadful truth bit by bit dawned on gallant fellow impatience became almost beyond control master be in sad peril of arrest by reason of excitement show spalpeens show roared almost beside let at duck

everybody by time paddy have picked up helped poor young ensign to foot ardour be sufficiently damped apologised with a good grace a must to late victim made very humble excuse to sergeant in charge who fortunately for have witnessed that affair be accident duck downie however with coat off sleeve tucked up still awaited man a if nothing have happened seemed surprised that paddy be not a eager a before for fray latter however quite sobered by time merely cried out in hearing of everybody arrah downie darlint ye may put on coat because forgive onst man dear do again be thereby considered by everybody to have have best of whole adventure under such dignified circumstance did set foot on indian soil reader will be surprised have never yet remembered that when last heard of charlie first master be in india did remember often often during voyage after landing yet quite despised for imagining a did that next white face saw must surely be india be big place dreadfully big place chance of finding one particular person there be about a great a of discovering needle in haystack might have left india long ago might have fallen in massacre of past few month might be somewhere right across continent so though must not get rid of vague sort of expectation during first few day of being in india always laughed at for simpleton for thinking chance possible however have time for thinking just then from moment landed in bombay for week two afterwards be continually on move long forced march under broiling sun be enough to wear out ordinary troop men column to be now attached formed ordinary body of men be englishman hastening to rescue nothing on earth must stop be strange how slowly news of stirring time came to ear one day heard with horror can never describe of foul massacre at cawnpore where in cold blood gentle english lady innocent child have be brutally massacred body flung into well then news came of achievement of wonderful army of relief led by havelock day after day came news of march on lucknow where besieged fellow countryman lay one know of heroic march inch by inch almost handful of men fought way fighting battle day never yielding step one day horseman galloped into camp in great state of excitement a flung from horse shouted something only caught two word havelock lucknow be enough lucknow be saved there rose cheer upon cheer at news shout upon shout men officer alike waved hat shook hand paddy a usual let feeling get better of nearly broke larry spine with joyful thump gave indeed be safe to say men be almost a proud a if have achieved relief presently however there spread rumour though lucknow be saved be not yet relieved havelock have fought way in until help arrived too must be prisoner within wall almost in same breath came grand news column be one destined for glorious work how heart beat what mattered now how long march be how grilling sun lucknow be cry that magic word sustained in hardship peril reached cawnpore at last there joined sir colin campbell force sight of house of murder be simply maddening to men left place next morning with sort of shudder set face towards lucknow be not till be well on march have leisure to look about notice how force be increased several now regiment be with commander in chief staff heavy gun siege train accompanied march with exception of few skirmish master have yet to learn what battle be crept on halting sometimes sometimes pushing on until one jubilant afternoon distant wall of lucknow appeared in sight then indeed brave fellow began to breathe again to morrow must bring to city wall what be equally after heart face to face with enemy bivouacked here for night now happened on particular night master be on sentinel duty for first time in life mightily proud of charge there stood a stiff a poker with rifle at side verily believe must have thought nothing of running bayonet through body of commander in chief if have presented without password patrick be not dreamer a looked across in direction of lucknow suppose meditation be of loftiest kind knew there must be fight to morrow so be happy knew duty might call to action even to night so kept very sharp look out at post otherwise mind be profoundly untroubled be not so with on eve of battle must not feel that in few hour might be ownerless in dead man pocket a looked back upon strangely eventful life sighed half hoped if be slain must in mercy bury with so end care once for little knew be scarcely ten o'clock when paddy be startled by approaching footstep belonged to officer of force who be returning at hour from outpost paddy eyed suspiciously even when gave word looked disappointed at not having privilege of using bayonet upon just a be going on way officer turned said in voice startled be ten yet man why did voice startle must not see speaker face a spoke fancied back in randlebury schoolroom memory saw bright eyed boy have known once whom must almost have believed to be speaker of few word strange what fancy take possession of one patrick a have watch have by time learned mysterious art of telling time be not man to answer question a at random hould gun cap'n said till sthrike light fancy sentinel asking officer to hold gun knew enough of military discipline to make tremble at thought of what must become of unceremonious master officer instead of flying into rage took rifle laughed that laugh reminded more than ever of randlebury be pretty fellow said be that manner teach at home axe yer pardon colonel here officer laughed again oh how heart beat a heard if stay here much longer will get promoted to general suppose said look sharp tell time patrick without word produced light officer face be half turned a did so must not catch feature a turned impatiently towards sentinel light fell full upon with bound of astonishment recognised in swarthy soldierly officer before other than oldest dearest master charlie newcome of randlebury strange

allowed to be led into scene be in slightest degree discreditable did enter rather too readily into frivolity of new quarter at expense of peace of mind popularity be greatest snare everywhere went became favourite people be eager to get to join party be often enough too good natured to refuse thus charlie wasted much of time in end found far more dissatisfied with than in quiet monotony of up country duty let do injustice reader in account of during few week at calcutta be gay not fast frivolous though not dissipated error be error of unprofitableness never of viciousness even in most

true have eye must penetrate number of scarlet jacket what good be that when knew about a much of art of war a did of candle making there be thing in event of memorable day will remember a long a live after about hour march be suddenly halted almost at same moment there came sullen boom of gun ahead must feel charlie heart leap at sound be enemy at last now fate of lucknow be to be decided horseman dashed up to head of column called out to colonel in voice loud enough for to hear bring up battalion next moment be advancing in double quick time through lane of troop to front there two other regiment stood waiting almost instant arrived whole body moved forward at run be exciting moment enemy gun sounded louder more frequent ahead dropping shot at side announced that danger be not in front pace be kept up for hundred yard so until reached cluster of tree in whose shelter column be halted to get breath fire in front still kept up through smoke thought must discern dim outline of low building not five hundred yard distant at moment charlie other officer be summoned to front for order be brief to point straight for fort there said commanding officer shortest way can take men be order meant certain death to score of brave fellow yet when have heard cheered a schoolboy cheer for holiday again stood waiting officer with sword drawn stepped in front men quickly loaded fixed bayonet then came shout forward a cleared tree burst full in face of enemy fire for moment ball whizzed harmlessly over head then there be crash on ground before a rushed on men parted on side to avoid stepping over dying man be awful step took grew more more fatal under withering fire men went down by dozen yet still column rushed on front rank broke into gap rear rank men dashed forward to fill till fell still on rushed officer too everywhere to front dropped one by one still never checked pace sullen wall of fort stood clear before poured upon unceasing shower of bullet ball in minute foremost men must be at wall forward now follow heard charlie cry looking round noticed for first time that captain of company be missing men cheered by way of answer run broke into rush a followed under gun others be at fort before storm have already begun heedless of wound heedless of peril men swept towards breach called on behind to come on charlie be one of earliest of battalion there already foot be in place be waving to men to come up when felt dull crushing sensation nerve collapsed sens left speech sight hearing failed in instant strange darkness came over then be conscious of nothing when sens slowly wearily recovered be still lying in master pocket in place where have fallen at storming of breach firing be still going on around shout of men rose now from inside fort instead of outside what shouting be enemy gun ceased a if by magic distant sound of firing showed plainly enough that main body now that have silenced fort be resuming march on lucknow flashed through a sens gradually returned before even have time to contemplate own condition what wreck be helpless cripple past healing of use to one utterly incapable of resuming ordinary duty of life almost before must realise care flashed through mind drove out other master what of there lay motionless pale with blue eye closed little stream of blood trickling down chest must be dead anxiously listened if

in arm carried inside fort where rude hospital have be fitted up here charlie who after extraction of bullet staunching of blood have shown symptom of recovery opened eye found able to say few word to
