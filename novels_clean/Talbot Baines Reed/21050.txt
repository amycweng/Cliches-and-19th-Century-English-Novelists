spokesman be chairman of governor have be through testimonial second time mr railsford be satisfied with refer to scholarship relate to character other qualification be also glad to know from that have fully considered responsibility of very important post be prepared to enter upon in firm yet conciliatory spirit governor head master agree with in considering taken a whole qualification be higher than of other candidate therefore have agreed to appoint to vacant post trust may result in mutual satisfaction good of school chapter two veni vidi if light heart faith in one own good luck be omen of success mark railsford undoubtedly entered on new duty at grandcourt under most favourable of auspex must not have be to discredit if light heart have acknowledged even slightly weight of responsibility be undertaking a matter of fact be lighter for very responsibility greater task argued greater achievement greater achievement greater triumph le sanguine hero might have be daunted by picture with nervous friend did best to damp ardour grover delighted a be at success of friend application took care to keep rock ahead well above surface in letter conversation railsford laughed pleasantly to scorn grover be not only attempt made to intimidate hero week so before entered upon duty nervous looking man called to see be mr moss late master hear have be appointed to house said by way of explanation thought must be only friendly to call tell sort of thing be to expect when go there thanks very much said railsford with smile of corner of mouth may be made of cast iron be possessed of patience of job began cheery adviser if so be right be either did find boy unmanageable not more than other boy boy of course be sworn foe of law order nobody imago anything else difficulty if have anything like luck will be more with colleague than subject how do make objectionable asked new master rather contemptuously mr moss did not miss tone of question fired up of course if mind being systematically snubbed at head quarter thwarted slandered by fellow master baulked in attempt to improve condition of house school misrepresented undermined in influence among boy may go up enjoy did be why left at rate have one friend among master grover oh poor grover be only master who can get on at doe so by effacing on possible occasion agreeing with everybody not very noble character to hear of one friend said railsford who be beginning to get tired of jeremiad blame can stand more than can that suppose be meant for compliment to said railsford laughing think then must be wise to back out before be too late say that only only pity thanks very much that evening railsford sent line to grover tell in two word why moss left grandcourt telegram came next morning incompatibility of temper whereat new master chuckled dismissed lugubrious ex master friendly warning from mind although gloomy prognostication of job comforter failed in least to depress spirit one very small cloud hovered occasionally on horizon be attitude of worthy respected prospective pupil brother in law arthur herapath that young gentleman who have be prudently kept in dark while term lasted be a may be imagined considerably astounded on arriving home to be met with news that new master of shell at grandcourt be to be mark railsford what lark exclaimed now genial a remark be tone in be uttered be not calculated to inspire confidence in breast of to whom be addressed there be more of enjoyment in than respect boy will be boy who can gauge depth of nature below smile ripple on surface be little incident like occasionally suggested to railsford far more forcibly than lugubrious warning of officious friend that task before at grandcourt must tax power considerably on whole rejoiced that must not be plain sailing at first that there be chance of relapsing immediately into condition of humdrum pedagogue christmas holiday slipped away only too fast for arthur for daisy mark much a felt approaching separation from betrothed must not suppress slight feeling of exultation a day drew near when be to go see conquer at grandcourt three idle year made prospect of hard work now welcome importance everyone else attached to new duty made doubly keen for fray on so many eye be turned dr ponsford have suggested in term amounted to mandate that new master might find convenient to arrive at grandcourt day before school returned in order to take possession of quarter acquaint with detail of coming duty arrangement be not altogether satisfactory for deprived mark of pleasure of future brother in law escort be great loss also of prospect of finding grover at journey end on have reckoned with confidence however be only difference of day during day must at least do utmost to make favourable impression on chief so with heart full of confidence cab full of luggage set out gaily on new career good bye mark will be good to son know said mr herapath good bye boy take care of health said mr herapath good bye mark said daisy ta ta old man called arthur see to morrow last greeting strange a may seem recurred to railsford memory more frequently than of others during course of long railway journey to grandcourt took sort of form a day wore on at first seemed only fraternal au revoir then became rather serious promise finally sounded in ear rather like menace here be going down like prince to coronation subject must see to morrow have never occurred to before that subject might have something to say to ordering of new kingdom that must have to reckon with a well a with idea be not altogether comfortable tried to shelve of course must get on with must look up to must discover that interest theirs be same be prepared to go way to meet must be odd if must not come rest to meet turned mind to other subject still wished must be quite sure that arthur innocent see again to morrow have double meaning for railway took a far a blankington junction about five mile from grandcourt a must be time before grandcourt train came up decided after seeing effect into cab to take advantage of fine frosty afternoon complete journey on foot be in fact beginning to grow little depressed exercise must brace up have foolishly enough looked forward to somewhat different kind of advent dropping perhaps with little eclat on school where arthur have already proclaimed fame among boy where grover have prepared welcome among master compared with solitary backstairs arrival seemed tame dispiriting half regretted that have not postponed coming till to morrow even in face of dr ponsford suggestion mile from grandcourt caught sight of square red ivy covered brick tower of school among tree even in winter looked warm picturesque be growing dark when passed lodge

dudgeon to work be room be sure know be day too early room be up will take time to get done against school come back to morrow be extraordinary thing said railsford who began to feel dignity somewhat put upon dr ponsford must tell to come to day that preparation 'tai got to do with 'd best go to doctor house out of gate across little square house on far side of chapel railsford leaving luggage stacked on pavement outside porter lodge started off with flushed cheek to lion den doctor said maid be in be at dinner gentleman have better call again in hour so railsford in closing twilight took savage walk round school precinct in mood to admire natural beauty of place to indulge in rhapsody at near view of scene of coming triumph in hour returned be shown into doctor study how do do mr here doctor took up visitor card to refresh memory mr railsford be afraid sir said mark have mistaken letter about coming to day there appears to be one one who can have be unable to ascertain where be to go doctor waited patiently for end of lucid explanation rather wonder did not suggest to to call on for information railsford wondered so too felt rather sheepish train must have be late expected hour ago think be up to time walked from blankington here really wish have known of intention trust said railsford struck by horrible suspicion be not waiting dinner for not in least said doctor with grim smile have calculated on taking round before must defer visit till morning talking of dinner added will be ready for something after journey will not a railsford be nearly famishing must only colour up reply thank doctor rang bell see that mr railsford get dinner have to go out added will doubt make at home great man withdrew leaving new master in very crestfallen disturbed state of mind if be sample of sympathy might expect at head quarter moss prognostication after be not quite baseless made best of solitary dinner then sallied out in dark to try to find porter lodge once more rescue luggage that functionary be still absent mark be compelled to haul belonging in under cover leave word with little girl that be to be taken over to mr railsford room a soon a father came in then taking with bag contained what wanted for night returned to head master house made point of retiring to rest before host reappeared on scene once more luck be against vanished early last night said

still knocking about at porter lodge made further expedition in search of at last with superhuman effort succeeded in getting transferred to quarter greatly to disgust of mr hastings who remarked in audible aside to fellow scrubber mr willis that people ought to keep dirty trap to till place be ready for after railsford deemed prudent to take open air exercise await patiently hour when carpet must be laid grandcourt must wake up into life for new term chapter three opening day combined labour of madame farthing hastings wilson myrmidon have barely reached successful climax afternoon in rescue of order out of chaos have reigned in railsford house when first contingent of grandcourtiers arrived in great square railsford who have at last be permitted to take possession of room to unstrap box looked down from window with little curiosity at scene below solemn quadrangle hour ago have looked so ghostly dreary be now alive with crowd of boy descending headlong from inside outside of four big omnibus hailing one boisterously scrambling for luggage scrimmaging for possession of mr farthing porter service indulging in horseplay with driver singing hooting challenging rejoicing stamping running jumping kicking anything in fact standing still in own opinion evidently be lord master of grandcourt strutted about with air of proprietor railsford began to grow half uneasy lest of

quitted omnibus mile from home run in one two on tricycle one hero in great state on horseback cheer sometimes yell greeted arrival when presently there lumbered up staid old four wheeler with luckless new boy on board demonstration became most imposing see to morrow thought railsford to a peered down suddenly unwonted excitement manifested be occasioned by impromptu race between two omnibus hansom cab having be temporarily deserted by rightful jehus have be boarded by three amateur charioteer set in motion hero in charge of hansom cab generously gave more heavily weighted competitor start of fifty yard standing up in perch shook rein defiantly smacked whip to infinite delight of everyone licenced gentleman who be nominal proprietor of vehicle of omnibus one got speedily into difficulty owing to charioteer getting rein trifle mixed thereby spinning vehicle round in semicircle bringing up finally in middle of lawn where abruptly vacated post retired into private life other omnibus have more glorious career horse be spirited entered into fun of thing almost a much a driver railsford long remembered picture youthful hero presented with face flushed head bare sandy hair waving in breeze body laid back at obtuse angle a tugged with hand at rein cab behind came on apace jaunty jehu flourishing whip shouting loudly to opponent to keep right side crowd forgot everything else flocked across grass with loud cheer for champion wire in hansom shouted stick to dig cried others how mad career might have ended one must tell at corner cab closed in ominously with clumsy competitor whose horse be fast getting beyond control of driver while vehicle be dragging rocked yawed behind like tug in gale railsford be meditating descent on to scene with view to prevent catastrophe if possible when shout of laughter greeted appearance on scene of lawful master of omnibus in headlong pursuit of property by adroit cut across grass outraged gentleman succeeded in overtaking vehicle boarding by step behind then amid delighted shout of whip behind dig spectator watched owner skip up step along top just a dig having received timely warning of peril dropped rein skipped contrary way along top down back stair depositing neatly on terra firma where with admirable sang froid joined spectator triumphed in final pulling up of omnibus consequent abandonment of race by indignant hero of hansom cab who protested in mock heroic that be winning hand over hand must have licked 'bus to fit if dig have funked in altercation ensued company generally took part returned braced up fortified by few minute sport to serious business of identifying extricating luggage from general melee conveying belonging into winter quarter new master be impressed by

by eccentric habit of mugging a anybody know be most uncomfortable alarming symptom in boy of house such a railsford true there be among few noble spirit who never did stroke of work unless under compulsion a rule fifth form fellow in railsford lay under imputation of being studious took very little trouble to clear character only when school sport came round house match detractor used to

cordially to dislike such be miscellaneous community mark railsford found called upon to govern be not worse than good many master house have even good point yet just now be admitted to be in bad way doctor have eye on there be nothing more adverse to reform than consciousness one have bad name late master mr moss moreover have notoriously found place too hot for have given up again tell against reputation of house lastly although have few good scholar athlete who won laurel for school there seemed not enough of to do anything for house have steadily remained at bottom of list for general proficiency for several term if inquired how came about must hear sort of explanation one found most favour in delinquent house be summed up in single word bicker origin of deadly feud between boy of

have grown up round feud if anyone have have patience to examine to bottom must probably have found long short to be that mr bicker being unhappily endowed with fussy disposition sour vindictive temper have incurred displeasure of boy of rival house not being man to smooth away bad impression have aggravated by resenting keenly what considered to be unjust prejudice against little digression may enable reader if have have patience to wade through to form idea of state of party in particular section of grandcourt chiefly came under railsford observation with roe grover house on other side

instruction for next day work endured few morning hour in shell patiently resignedly be polite enough to yawn behind book be rarely put out by own mistake when occasionally master dropped upon with penalty remonstrance deemed pity that anyone must put so much about on account railsford be baffled there seemed more hope in turbulent skirmisher at back of room who at least must now then be worked upon by thunder always in theory acknowledged that lesson be thing to be learned on first day mugger knew task well railsford glowed with hope a expressed approbation when came to gapers spirit sunk to zero have unfortunately mistaken passage else page be torn out of book else have be prevented by cold sprained wrist chilblain from learning when told to construe passage read out not two minute

grateful for countenance a must have be still bore malice time must come when elder must cry aloud to younger for aid must get meanwhile on particular evening arthur found too busy getting new study into what termed ship shape order to be able to adopt friend suggestion about line idea of ship shape did not in particular correspond with ordinary acceptation of term have brought down in trunk several fine work of art selected chiefly from sporting paper representing stirring incident in life of chief prize fighter after endeavouring to take out few of crease contracted in journey displayed

shelf shelf for side dig have good deal of trouble with saw cunningly constructed arrangement of string to reduce fabric into similitude of bookcase when at last be done nailed to wall exhibited tendency to tilt forward moment anything touched pitch content on to floor after much thought occurred to herapath that if turned upside down defect must operate in other direction hold book securely against wall so having wrenched nail out be fortunate enough to find space on wall not gaping with wound in plaster re erected inversely ala although top shelf now tilted back at wall bottom shelf swung forward inch two let content out behind with same regularity punctuality with have previously ejected in front dig pronounced rotten concern voted for smashing up herapath more dauntless determined on one further effort began to drive large nail vehemently into floor immediately under refractory bookcase then tying string round bottom shelf hitched other end round nail drew fabric triumphantly into wall be complete success even dig applauded cried out to friend that inch must make job of inch did make job of for just a bottom shelf closed in top gave spring forward pulling nail along with burying two mechanic under cascade of book plaster shattered timber arthur dig sat on floor surveyed ruin stolidly while smiley evidently under delusion that whole entertainment have be got up for amusement barked vociferously seizing student gibbon in teeth worried in lightness of heart like rat at juncture door opened railsford with alarm in face entered be matter exclaimed be excellent cue for two boy who forthwith began to rub arm shoulder make demonstration of quiet suffering horrid bookcase wo stick up said arthur be trying to put thing tidy came down be pretty good

friend worked off about penalty by time arm elbow be very sore indeed dimsdale who came in later be bribed with invitation to jam breakfast in morning to help with remainder same inducement prevailed upon tilbury so that by fine co operative effort dig stood clear with doctor before night be over considered entitled to little rest forthwith proceeded to take breakfast party next morning be great success on whole be little marred by fact that whereas cover be laid for four just fourteen guest turned up be partly arthur fault for having sallied forth with invitation in pocket to anyone who must help friend out with few line have dropped about in good many other quarter have secured attendance of simson maple of shell of bateson juke of baby with view to ingratiate with of neighbour on first floor have bidden to banquet wake ranger wignet sherriff of fifth actually prevailed upon stafford to lend dignity of sixth form patronage to reunion hero be naturally little disgusted on turning up at rendezvous to find room crowded with scarcely standing space to space by troop of hungry noisy junior good host perspired with heat of room a guest after guest crowded in began to look little anxious at modest fare on table speculate mentally on how far one loaf one pot of jam four pat of butter pint coffee pot three half tea cup must go round lot at length when stafford arrived must not get in at door for crush despair seized kid have better hook said arthur to dozen of junior who have squeezed into front rank near table there be not room to day come to morrow loud be complaint not

about crumb half piece never saw such skinny spread in day in ten year comprehended master bateson day have have little experience of sort of thing company being now reduced to eight to wit four fifth form boy two host dimsdale assumed more manageable proportion there be room at least to move arm leg even to shut door when came to taking seat still became evident that table must by possibility hold more than six crisis thereupon arose dimsdale be regretfully dismissed departed scarlet in face promising a slammed door to show up host amiable worthy much distressed not whit cooler that room be now comparatively empty smiled feebly at threat arranged to sit on one lap so a to bring company finally down to capability of table at juncture stafford who have grown tired of waiting evidently saw little prospect of conviviality in entertainment remembered that have work to do before morning school rose to leave why have not begun yet gasped host really must go thanks for asking have enjoyed so much said amiable prefect departing look here say expostulated arthur might stay will get egg herring if will stop guest of morning be beyond reach of blandishment with muttered reflection on human depravity generally host took seat at end of festive board bade four fifth form fellow fall to have already done so one have cut loaf have meted out jam have poured out coffee have distributed butter

into room a though just arrived to quell uproar few boy snatched up book flopped down at desk mr bicker have too keen eye to let be imposed upon have witnessed scene from window in own house surmising by noise that authority be present to deal with disorder have taken upon to look in in friendly way set thing right silence cried closing door behind walking two step into room where be mr railsford

felgate be in charge of house thundered mr bicker obey go withdrew chafing crestfallen very uncomfortable now said mr bicker when door be again closed arthur herapath come here mr bicker knowledge of

six time consecutively with emphasis brought tear fairly into hardened eye now go of to study continue preparation will remain in house till mr railsford return report what have occurred to when hour later master of shell full of athletic prospect returned to quarter be gratified a well a surprised by dead silence reigned astonishment be by mean diminished when on entering common room encountered mr bicker pacing up down floor amidst scared junior there assembled railsford with folly be man of quick perception took in whole situation at glance understood why mr bicker be there why place be so silent still more perceived that own authority in house have suffered shock that lesson be being read by man whom of colleague disliked most good evening said mr bicker with show of friendliness mark nodded be glad to be able to render up house to in rather better order than found if will take advice railsford will not venture out in evening specially leaving one in authority be sure to be taken advantage of railsford bit lip ought to be much obliged to said coldly a happens did not venture out without leaving anyone in authority if mean stafford what be name felgate ca congratulate on deputy be in fact aiding abetting disorder have sent to room a incompetent must advise to relieve of office a soon a can thank for advice said railsford whose blood be getting up will make own arrangement in own house of course dear fellow replied bicker blandly must really find two better men than there be attempt to stop disorder have be going on for hour when arrived have to castigate one of ringleader herapath by name claiming kinship with by way be not sure that ought not to report to dr ponsford be railsford must do to listen quietly to speech drawled out slowly cuttingly by rival made desperate effort to control a replied think mr bicker might with advantage go see how own house be getting on in absence mr bicker smiled happily have responsible prefect however now be back if be not going out again will say good night railsford said good night disregarding proffered hand of colleague walked moodily up to own room may be excused if be put out miserable be in wrong knew yet manner in rebuke have be administered be such a man of spirit must cheerfully endure one idea in mind be not how to punish house for disorder how to settle score with bicker for restoring order not how to admonish incompetent prefect how to justify against accuser sent for four prefect to room before bed hour ainger barnworth be plain to see have be informed of have happened be in more warlike mood even than two companion hear said railsford that there be disturbance in house while be away for short time evening ainger barnworth of course be out too must like to hear from stafford felgate what be about stafford allowed felgate to give version be like most of felgate version decidedly apocryphal there be rather row sir said among of junior of be wrestling fancy a soon a saw what be going on stafford came to stop when mr bicker turned up sent to room told have be left in charge by must not listen very annoying said master be rather humiliating to house sir said ainger if prefect be not to be allowed to deal with own fellow agree with said mark warmly have reason for doubting that can will do duty when have intended to say when be not interfered with deemed more prudent to say when occasion requires must easily have stopped row sir said stafford if have be allowed to do so have doubt of said master be glad to have have little explanation honour of house be of common interest to of week ago speech must have seemed mere commonplace exhortation under present circumstance have double meaning for present be brick said ainger a returned to study mean to back up after pay bicker out what surprise said barnworth be that stafford bull dog did not invite intruder out into square impress honour of house with two black mark on of eye be just a glad said felgate be happened must have got railsford with if if 'd done duty stopped row moment began said ainger who with jealousy for house have toleration for humbug even in prefect whose cause espoused so railsford house went to bed night in warlike mood chapter seven session of master outrage be to be feared that mark railsford moral science man though be have yet to learn art of applying philosophy to own circumstance must never have committed serious error on day following event recorded in last chapter of writing following foolish note to mr bicker february sir referring to unpleasant topic of conversation last night have since consulted prefect on matter made other inquiry a to what took place here during temporary absence at athletic meeting report have received be disposed to credit differs materially from own version in case allow to say that require assistance in management of house when do will ask for meanwhile will continue to consider interference of anyone motif a impertinence although junior master at grandcourt will have hesitation in resenting to utmost of power trust few line may obviate future misunderstanding on point about feel very strongly yours etcetera m railsford mr bicker be hardly man to neglect opportunity afforded by letter for crushing reply accordingly spend pleasant hour same afternoon in concocting following polite rejoinder february dear railsford many thanks for note just to hand can quite believe that version of yesterday proceeding be disposed to credit given by prefect two of whom be absent other two participators in disturbance differs materially from own such diversity of opinion be not uncommon in experience a to management of house assure in what did yesterday have intention of assisting in fact be not there to assist be because be not that duty to school suggested must attempt to do what must have done infinitely better be aware have be on spot under similar circumstance must do same again in face of uncomfortable knowledge that thereby must be guilty of impertinence to junior master at grandcourt be kind of to take step to make meaning quite clear on matter may suggest that refer matter to session of master if prefer to dr ponsford believe master meet to night unless hear from will conclude be a anxious a be to have matter thoroughly gone into by competent tribunal to obviate future misunderstanding on point on naturally feel strongly believe dear railsford yours very truly t bicker mark be entertaining company when uncomfortable letter arrived in person of monsieur lablache french master must be difficult to say what there be in unpopular foreigner attracted master of shell may have be touch of quixotic chivalry led to defy tradition of place offer friendship to best hated person in grandcourt may have be feeling that monsieur be hardly judged by colleague pupil however be during short time term have run two men have struck up acquaintance perplexed great many spectator displeased great many more think must be careful with lablache said grover to friend not that know anything against reputation in school be rather doubtful suppose reputation of detention master be doubtful said railsford laughing yours mine must be if have work to do man be innocent till be proved guilty in england be quite so said grover want to set against for a say know nothing of mean be that must be prepared to share little of unpopularity if take up with be will take chance of said railsford first time monsieur lablache appeared in railsford house in response to invitation from new master to come take coffee there be considerable excitement in house junior considered liberty be at stake hissed master guest down corridor shell boy presumed still further raised cry of turn out even attempted to hustle trip upon stair most curious incident of untriumphal progress be when munger cad of fifth confronted monsieur in lobby outside railsford room with shout be going to raise money on old clothes at last brutal word for monsieur be very shabbily attired be scarcely uttered when railsford door suddenly opened munger be sent reeling across lobby under blow echoed through house master of shell white with rage stood there with look on face sent few loiterer packing to den made munger only sorry wall against staggered did not open let through come here boy munger advanced scarcely le pale than master apologise to monsieur lablache here down on knee for behaving like blackguard saying what did be matter began monsieur with shrug when mark checked by gesture almost a intimidating a by have just summoned offender hear said to boy munger went down on knee repeated whatever be told must have called by still worse name have be requested did matter much to munger now tell name munger form fifth master turned on heel ushered guest into room leaving munger to rub cheek wonder to how ever came to stand being knocked about in way have be that afternoon have happened day two ago since then whatever house thought one be bold enough to molest french master publicly in railsford unless be perfectly certain mr railsford be out of way must be mistake to say two master have become devoted friend monsieur lablache chief attraction in railsford eye be that be looked down upon by other master persecuted by boy while french master be so unused to notice of kind that felt trifle suspicious that kindness of new acquaintance might be in way snare however little mutual mistrust sometimes pave way to good deal of mutual confidence after few day two men have risen considerably in one esteem when railsford on evening in question crushed mr bicker note up in hand with angry exclamation monsieur said voila mon cher railsford get always billet doux monsieur have heard of course a everyone else have of new master matrimonial prospect said railsford gloomily not always pitched mr bicker letter into grate a spoke perhaps said monsieur always write advise to not answer that letter why said railsford how do know what that letter be know think that doe need answer railsford laughed be setting up a soothsayer monsieur suppose tell that letter doe need answer quickly then say somebody else will answer better than will railsford picked crushed up letter off coal just in time to save from flame how must answer monsieur monsieur slowly unfolded paper smoothed out meester beekaire said with twist of moustache a recognised writing mean that read certainly if like frenchman read document through then pitched back into fire well said railsford well good friend seems know meester beekaire a well a others be that said railsford little nettled master meeting be to night be not so say will go of course will not be pleasant time for for will need to make speech good friend look here said railsford who be getting little impatient of enigmatical utterance fancied must give advice if ca let talk about something more pleasant do give advice say to go to meeting say did wrong will not do again what thundered mark in voice made arthur baronet in room overhead jump out of chair kind railsford be only advice have be in wrong say to a brave man make more wrong meester beekaire must help very much to make more wrong let help say unpalatable a be there be force in visitor advice railsford be bound to admit poor monsieur be not shining example of successful dealing with fellow master still out of mouth of simple one may sometimes hear home truth master session be periodical conference of grandcourt master half social half business for purpose of talking over matter of common school interest discussing point of management generally exchanging idea on be passing in little world of be controller dr ponsford rarely if ever put in appearance on such occasion have greatest faith in holding aloof from detail not making too accessible to master boy only when boy must not settle matter for master must not settle for interfered settled without argument without appeal be never pleasant when doctor have to be called in feeling against step contributed very largely to success of school self government railsford by time knew most of fellow master to speak to be first occasion on have met in corporate capacity have not be personally interested in proceeding must felt pleasant curiosity in deliberation of august body mr bicker be already there nodded in most friendly way to master of shell on arrival grover mr roe welcomed new colleague warmly began at once to compare note a to school work few minute later monsieur lablache little smarter than usual came in having bowed to company generally salute one seemed to observe subsided on retired seat railsford to regret perhaps of of friend presently walked across took seat beside meeting began before come to business began mr roe who by virtue of seniority occupied chair be sure meeting must wish to express pleasure at seeing mr railsford among for first time to offer hearty welcome to grandcourt hear hear said grover others amongst whom mr bicker voice be conspicuous railsford felt uncomfortable thus to become object of general notice coloured up a nodded acknowledgment to chairman know of scrape said monsieur cheerfully must tell about good friend before meester beekaire make little speech railsford glared round at companion felt heart thumping at prospect of task before there be one two matter began mr roe to bring before railsford rose to foot said mr roe gentleman there be dead silence at unexpected interruption broken only by encouraging cheer from mr bicker supposing new master be about to acknowledge compliment just paid by set speech mr roe put down agenda paper said mr railsford if will allow began rather breathlessly must like to refer to matter personally concern must not venture to do in way immediately after kind welcome if did not feel to be duty yesterday gentleman unfortunate incident occurred in house hear hear ' smile from mr bicker went excuse said chairman may explain to mr railsford a be new member here that practice be invariably to take up question in order of seniority of master present mr smith believe have motion on paper poor railsford subsided full of confusion stripped of good resolution abusing for folly wishing monsieur lablache advice at bottom of sea what mr smith other master who followed have to say neither heard cared determination to admit own error have oozed away resolved that if story be to be kept waiting must be none sweeter when did come for delay several topic be discussed pleasantly with view to elicit opinion of meeting on small question of policy discipline presently mr roe turned to bicker think said have question to ask mr bicker oh well yes mine hypothetical point though began mr bicker airily just wanted to ask supposing one of becomes aware of riot in neighbouring house during absence of master of house ascertains moreover that prefect on duty so far from making attempt to control disorder be participating in presume there can be question that must be duty of anyone of to interfere in such case be quite hypothetical case mind might occur certainly must say if be quite sure proper house authority be not there to enforce order said mr roe of course said grover be rather unlikely case be occurred in house last night broke in railsford hotly be at athletic union two of prefect other two be left in charge mr bicker took upon to interfere in absence have written to tell that consider action impertinent resent in reply writes private letter interposed mr bicker hurriedly evidently not relishing prospect of having effusion read be not marked private can quite understand writer must not like to hear read aloud here wish to say be that hypothetical case be more hypothetical than interference be in affair of house that if asks opinion on matter will tell must do better to mind own business railsford sat down very hot painfully conscious that have not exhibited moderation temper have promised to observe embarrassed silence ensued mr roe man of peace frowned turned inquiringly to bicker bicker stroked beard smiled said nothing do wish to say anything asked chairman by mean mr railsford have said must wish said far more eloquently than must will go on to next business mr chairman a for railsford further proceeding have interest for vanished moment meeting be over without speaking to anyone a mr bicker walked off towards house really felt little sorry for fellow master who have let down by so paltry exhibition of temper thus early in career however doubt must take to heart to night lesson do more justice in future mr bicker in fulness of heart took little round of big square on way home with double intent of giving air perchance intercepting for good of school one more youthful night bird in truant excursion be kind of sport in mr bicker be particularly successful therefore a became successful sportsman rather enjoyed to credit be said be strictly impartial in dealing whether culprit belonged to own house a often happened to be equally down upon be never known to relax penalty for most plausible excuse set up by ingenious victim to night seemed a if must return without bag at be about to resign to disappointment when quick eye detected in darkness hovering shadow moving ahead of in direction of railsford house vanished almost immediately not before master have caught faintly uttered hist betrayed that have to deal with more than one truant quickened pace little came once more in view of phantom slinking along by wall at pace be not quite run rather to mr bicker surprise fugitive passed door of railsford made straight on towards chapel slackening pace a did so decoy said knowing master to employed to draw on while rest make good retreat there be touch of generosity in decoy one be bound to admire on occasion young friend be dealing with rather too aged bird to be caught at moment have come up to door of railsford before soliloquy have be able to advance by word seemed to see spark before eye while at same moment foot went from under something be drawn over head bag whatever be be capacious for neck of descended to waist closed by magic of slip knot round mouth elbow before have presence of mind to shout throw out arm to complete misfortune a tried to raise noose be snugly cast around foot thus gagged pinioned silently rapidly dexterously mr bicker found in situation in must positively aver have never stood lain before thought did flash through sack enveloped head that assailant whoever be must have rehearsed little comedy carefully diligently for day two in order to arrive at perfection displayed in present performance also made mental calculation that three possibly four fellow being be engaged on job of whom two be strong two be small one of latter possibly being decoy whom have so lately apostrophised not syllable be uttered during ceremony victim recognising position have good sense to remain cool not waste time dignity in fruitless struggle pinioning being complete small hole being considerately opened in sack in region of nose for purpose of respiration be hauled up one two step dragged one two foot deposited on board floor of shoe cupboard after few mild irresolute kick left to own meditation last sound penetrated into sack being sharp turning of key on outside of dungeon door so soliloquised mr bicker after discovering that be unhurt though uncomfortably cramped friend railsford be having one lodger more than regulation number to night will make hypothetical case for next session of master chapter eight doctor have word two with railsford house railsford house be not famous for early riser chapel bell in winter began to ring at call over be at between two period chiefly at end most of rising in house be accomplished master simson shell fish be in for hundred yard under fourteen at sport being shy youth who did not like to practise in public have determined to rise before lark take furtive spin round school track while schoolfellow enemy slept be cold raw morning before be fully arrayed in flannel have have more than one serious idea of relapsing into bed be said to credit resisted temptation gallantly finished toilet putting on extra sweater pea jacket to boot for have seven pound to run off between now sport peered out of window be dark patter on pane showed that light sleet be falling outside if so being of frugal mind must not run in new shoe in old boot now old boot be in cupboard under staircase by front door reader understands at last why be have taken so much trouble to describe master simson movement on particular morning be so rare event for boy to be up at six o'clock on winter morning in railsford that one have ever thought about making rule to prevent early bird leaving house at hour if must succeed in getting out simson who have interest with cook believed must get exeat through kitchen window meanwhile must get boot armed with match last one in box quietly felt way along corridor down stair there be glimmer of light from under maid door a passed told be up that must not have long to wait downstairs at foot of stair turned sharp round following wall with hand came at length on familiar handle of boot box to surprise door be locked key be on outside sell if have be able to get in said to opening door now simson like cautious youth aware of frailty of match wisely resolved to penetrate a far a possible into interior of cupboard in direction in knew particular boot to be before striking light at first step tripped on something fell prostrate over human carcase emitted muffled gasp moved heavily a tumbled upon then there went up yell such a curdled blood of half railsford a lay in bed made domestic up stair cling to one in terror a if last moment have come simson with hair on head erect made frantic dive out of awful den banging door locking behind in frenzy of fright then dashed up stair plunged a white a shirt into dormitory yell signalised arrival not time joint performance of other occupant of room who sitting up with chin on knee half petrified by horror of first shriek now gave up for lost when door broke open in dark gasping something staggered into room there be bo dy be mur dered gasped simson in bo ot box everybody be on foot in moment murdered yes said simson wonderfully comforted by noise general panic got up early know to have grind on track went to get boot fell over over what bo od y whispered simson have anybody got light shouted arthur at moment light appeared at door ainger came in what be row what be matter simson say somebody be murdered in boot box replied arthur say have better go see be practical suggestion corridor be already full of half dressed inquirer moment later mr railsford door opened story be repeated to come with ainger said quietly rest of return to dormitory remain there arthur seized by noble desire not to leave future kinsman unprotected in such hour of peril elected to disregard last order accompanied by henchman followed candle at respectful distance down stair there be blood on stair observed baronet in whisper have left key in door muttered arthur hold light said railsford turning key entering prostrate on ground bound hand foot enveloped down to waist in sack lay figure of man motionless certainly not dead for sound proceeded from depth of canvas in moment railsford have knelt cut cord round prisoner foot hand while ainger drew sack from head arthur gave whistle of consternation a feature of mr bicker came to light pale stern sudden sight of medusa head must hardly have have more petrifying effect victim be first to recover stretching arm leg in relief sat up coolly said thank doe mean exclaimed railsford helping to rise for be very stiff cramped that can not say kindly reach hat ainger who have done too can not say can walk thank wo come to room have something really must said railsford taking arm mr bicker disengaged arm said coldly thank will go to own if will open door arthur at moment came up officiously with glass of water mr bicker drank eagerly then declining one last offer of assistance went slowly out towards own house railsford retired to room threw into chair in state of profound dejection mysterious a whole affair be one two thing be clear one be that house be disgraced by criminal cowardly outrage other be that situation be made ten time more difficult on account of already notorious feud between injured master high hope be once more dashed to ground time almost seemed finally mark railsford be coward yet for hour that morning wished might be well out of grandcourt for ever then having admitted cooler counsel dressed went to captain study call other prefect here ainger want to talk to senior be not far off speedily assembled first of said master who perceived at glance that be not necessary for to explain gravity of situation can of give information about disgraceful affair none sir said little nettled at master tone have talked over a far a be concerned be complete mystery have reason to suspect anybody none at sir know of need tell that credit of house be at stake in fact be gone till find offender mr bicker will naturally report matter to dr ponsford be going to doctor for same purpose wished to consult before taking step because be matter in must work together certainly sir said ainger speaking for rest what mean be that personal feeling must come between duty owe to grandcourt to see wrong put right understand yes said downright ainger none of like mr bicker must find out fellow who scragged same exactly be glad to hear say that there be one other matter two of stafford felgate recently felt specially aggrieved by something mr bicker said to must forget now remember only that duty to whole school requires that must do everything in power to help to put end to scandal of course will said felgate curtly in tone railsford did not consider particularly encouraging however having opened mind to lieutenant went away straight to doctor mr bicker be leaving just a entered railsford read in look a brushed past great encouragement to hope that thing must soon be made right mr bicker said advancing almost in front of colleague must tell how distressed be at what have occurred yes be trying for said injured master drily excuse though want breakfast be not easy to feel cordial sympathy with man like however there be nothing for to go lay case before doctor railsford entered accordingly dr ponsford be at breakfast asked visitor to take seat have come to tell that mr bicker assailant be discovered said wish must said railsford have only have time to speak to prefect two of whom be not to be trusted profess personal spite against mr bicker be just like doctor gave other people information never wanted know of course what refer to have not found reason to consider felgate stafford untrustworthy mr bicker say know what mr bicker say what do say well sir frankly feel quite sure of felgate stafford be too amiable to say ' to anybody now let hear about affair morning railsford gave careful account of discovery of mr bicker in boot box be conscious that doctor although gave little sign of be not quite blind to unfortunate position in a new master of offending house be placed have call over of house at ten o'clock mr railsford will come announcement be about a cheerful one in grandcourt a appointment made by court of inquisition must have be once upon time in spain railsford rose to go have better stop have breakfast here said doctor ringing bell for cup during meal further reference be made to event of morning railsford be drawn out a to work condition of house generally be painfully aware that doctor be making best of time to reckon up only wished must guess verdict on point received light went off presently charged with unpleasant task of summoning house to answer for at bar of head master be curious spectacle crowd of boy assembled in common room that morning at railsford be sulky resented jumbling of innocent guilty be so anxious to appear guileless gay that overdid compromised in consequence be little frightened lest round flogging must be proposed whispered mysteriously looked askance at one two fellow who have be mentioned a possibly implicated like arthur baronet with simson squeezed in between looked knowing important a though horse chariot must not drag secret out of ainger looked pale big chest went up down in manner who knew felt to be ominous stafford looked alternately solemn sneering according a turned to captain felgate barnworth alone looked comfortable apparently have not idea what excitement be about at ten o'clock railsford entered in cap gown ainger immediately began to call over roll one answered to name except maple of shell who be away at father funeral tomkins baby who have be so scared by whole affair that have turned sick during breakfast retired with dame permission to bed during call over doctor have entered seated at master desk quick eye took in boy a uttered adsum dwelling longer on than on others now then turning glance to master senior prefect when be over ainger have handed in list head master took eyeglass from eye laid list on desk before said boy be unusual unpleasant visit know object of know discredit at present lie on house on grandcourt know what duty be in matter if boy here doe not know what mean let stand up be a much a life of anybody present be worth to respond to challenge one two who must never hear good story too often must not have objected if somebody else have demanded further information for own part discretion outdid curiosity retained seat amidst dead silence very well now will put question to a body be very serious question one honest boy here if be able to answer can afford to evade great deal more depends on answer than mere expulsion of one more wrong doer boy be guardian of honour of house only honourable thing at time like be to speak truth whatever consequence question ask be be boy here concerned in outrage on mr bicker doe boy know who be will wait for two minute that may understand importance of question before call for answer dead silence boy for most part looked straight before with heightened colour watched slow progress of minute hand of clock repeat question now said doctor when allotted time have run be boy here concerned in outrage on mr bicker doe boy know who be if so let stand up silence followed be broken to by thumping of own heart one rose sense of relief came to railsford who felt spirit sink a prospect of near end to trouble receded boy here said doctor slowly denies knowledge of affair silence gave consent then continued head master more severely putting up eyeglass handing list to ainger will put question to boy separately call over list let boy come up answer ainger began by calling out own name forthwith walked up to master desk do know anything of affair asked doctor looking full in face sir said ainger returning look after fashion half defiantly next name be called owner marched up to desk uttered denial railsford a stood scanning keenly face of boy in turn felt that be watching action of strange machine first ainger clear voice then short adsum footstep up to desk then doctor stern question then quick look up half defiant sir for caught up captain tone finally retreating footstep silence preceding next name there be sign of faltering wherever secret lurked railsford saw little chance of leaking out few boy indeed a be natural gave reply after own fashion barnworth looked bored answered a though whole performance be waste of time arthur herapath be particularly knowing in tone accompanied disclaimer with embarrassing half wink at future kinsman felgate said without sir swaggered back to place with ostentatious indifference did not go unnoted baronet who be nothing if not original said nothing shook head reply to question sir thundered doctor ominously whereat sir digby losing head said thank sir retired amid confusion simson when interrogated mildly added to sir explanatory sentence except finding there when went for boot munger cad added to answer will try to find out with leer oily smile ainger felt strongly tempted to acknowledge by kick a passed back to place stafford painfully aware that be one of mentioned one looked horribly confused red a answered to name satisfied several of inexpert one present that be hardly necessary to look further for one of culprit so call over passed when once more ainger handed in list railsford seemed further than ever from seeing light through cloud enveloped doctor brow darkened a took once more glass from eye be very serious said slowly when came here be with painful feeling that house contained boy so cowardly unprincipled a to waylay defenceless man in dark to treat a mr bicker have be treated be tenfold worse to believe that contains boy cowardly enough to involve whole house in own disgrace punishment sensation will not mince matter house be deeply disgraced can not pretend to rank longer with other house who at least have good name until have yourselves made matter right rest with to retrieve credit meanwhile everybody took long breath occasion be a when judge put on black cap before passing sentence of death meanwhile house will cease to dine in hall will dine in room at one o'clock daily on saturday instead of taking half holiday in afternoon will take in morning assemble for school at twelve o'clock still trust that there may be sufficient self respect among to make change only of slight duration here doctor tone grew bitter mouth gathered sarcastically at least self interest may

about there be something mysterious in herapath manner disturbed friend be bad enough not to be backed up in own scheme to feel that chum knew something that did not be very hard on sir digby now recalled arthur have along be somewhat reserved about business have made sport of other fellow theory have never disclosed own yet be evident have own idea on subject be come to after term of confidence alliance petty secret be to come between cloud hitherto peaceful horizon of fellowship digby perhaps did not exactly put idea into poetical word matter troubled quite a much now be intention at place generously to disclose to reader what be hidden from sir digby oakshott baronet from everyone else at grandcourt namely that arthur herapath be fully persuaded in own mind that knew name of arch offender in recent outrage be resolved through thick thin to shield from detection be perfectly aware that in so doing made accessory after fact be risk be prepared to run only decided to keep knowledge to arthur be not particularly sharp boy quality be chiefly of bull dog order did not take thing in with rapidity of fellow when did get teeth into fact held on like grim death so be now in first excitement of discovery have be a much at sea a wild in conjecture a anybody after little stumbled upon piece of evidence gave serious turn have kept serious ever since on morning of discovery arthur being in neighbourhood of boot box thought must have look round there be fear of mistaking place have be there before seen mr bicker come out of sack everything be pretty much a have be left sack lay in corner where have be thrown cord except piece baronet have secured be there too on dusty floor must clearly be perceived place where mr bicker have rolled about in uncomfortable shackle during night on ledge of dim window let light into boot box from lobby still stood tumbler arthur have officiously fetched hour two ago one two thing occurred to arthur have not previously struck one be that door of boot box be very narrow one closing to by spring must either have have to be held open propped open while mr bicker be being hauled in by captor found that to hold open wide must have to get behind shut up between stair most likely hand being required for securing victim captor must have taken precaution to prop door open by mean so a to be ready for deep laid carefully prepared scheme so arthur groped about discovered twisted up wedge of paper by battered look peculiar shape have evidently be stuck at time under door to keep from closing to quietly pocketed prize on chance of being useful after possessing of sack cord two wax vesta lying on floor one of have be lit other have not prepared to quit scene a be going up stair caught sight of one other object not however on floor on ledge of cornice above door be match box of kind usually sold by street arab for halfpenny arthur tried to reach must not get at even by jumping fellow who put that there must have be over six foot said to with trouble got stick tipped box off ledge a did so occurred to that whereas dust lay quarter of inch thick on ledge whereas match box have similar coating of dust be almost clean must have be put up there recently opened box looked inside contained wax vesta with curiously coloured purple head on examination corresponded exactly with match have picked up on floor of boot box oh said arthur to very red in face here be go bolted up to room dig a happened be out not altogether to chum regret who set with somewhat curious agitation to examine booty first of all examined once more match box satisfied that there be doubt about identity of content with stray vesta have picked up result be decisive box have be placed above door very recently by someone who unless stood on form climbed on somebody else back must have be more than six foot high one put match above door by accident put there must have meant more than must have opened dropped one out inside boot box now considered astute arthur be pitch dark when bicker be collared light be out fellow thought 'd have glim handy in case of need struck one spilt one shoved box up there in case must want again say what clever chap be tall chap box belongs to did job eh expert might possibly find flaw in clue arthur be little proud of next spread out sack inspected cord there be not much to help here one must suppose yet arthur being once on good tack thought worth while to look closely at two relic sack be not ordinary type of potato sack most people associate with term more like large canvas pillow case such a article of furniture might be packed in might be used to envelop small bath content on railway journey arthur perceived that have be turned inside out took trouble to reverse be riddled with hole of to admit running cord have closed round neck elbow of unfortunate mr bicker notably that in region of nose made hastily with motive of giving captive little ventilation arthur must not help thinking a turned sack outside in that must have be nicer for mr bicker to have comparatively clean side of canvas next to face instead of very grimy travel stained surface have fallen to lot speculation gave place to other emotion a discovered two black initial painted on canvas still legible under covering of dirt grease there be mistaking arthur gave vent to whistle of consternation a deciphered mr now a arthur everybody else know mr may mean midland railway midland railway be not six foot two inch doe not carry wax vesta about drop on floor of boot box arthur gaped at initial for fully three minute then hurriedly hid sack away in cupboard have still one more point to clear up pulled wedge of paper out of pocket began nervously to unroll be frayed black where door have ground against floor on beginning to open turned out to be portion of torn newspaper be standard of february two day ago arthur whistled again turned pale a saw stamp postmark on front page read fragment of address ford esquire grandcourt settle clean muttered to say who 'd have thought then sat down went over incident of last twenty four hour last night be sad to have to record arthur have be out in big square at half past nine when must have be in bed have be over to find ball have lost during morning while playing catch with dig out of window on way back remembered now have have rather perilous time first of all have nearly run into arm of branscombe captain of bicker house who be inconveniently prowling about at time probably in search of truant of own house then in doubling to avoid danger have dimly sighted mr bicker taking starlight walk on railsford side of square finally in last bolt home have encountered railsford stalking moodily under shadow of own house too preoccupied to notice still le to challenge truant arthur remembered now carrying mind day two further back recalled mr bicker uninvited visit to house arthur have painful cause to remember railsford evident resentment of intrusion threatenings of slaughter have be bandied about between two house ever since why said arthur to be a clear a pikestaff see now bicker said be about quarter to ten when be collared fellow must be about then certainly one must know that must be passing door except marky marky must have be actually hanging about for when passed what pity did stop to see fun yes 'd got sack ready have jammed door open with paper got match handy bicker must never see till came close up then marky must have sack on in two two before must halloa eye must never have believed of marky served bicker right of course will be lesson to will be hot for marky if be found out bicker say there may have be more than one fellow on job fancy if mark have have anybody 'd have got to help because must be in family 'd be bound to keep must turn green if knew 'd twigged anyhow will keep a close a putty now help worry through very knowing of to go with candle let out morning look so struck of heap took in regularly arthur said to in tone implied that if mark have be able to take in be little to be wondered at rest of house have be hoodwinked hard luck thought condescendingly dare tell dig be such gossip must be over place

not appreciably affect arthur herapath study during present term four half month be long time to look ahead in schoolboy career a happened captain speech have suggested other matter in immediate future for time being absorbed not only arthur attention everyone else that evening list of event for house sport be exhibited on common room door with space below for name of intending competitor be noticed that list corresponded in particular with list of school sport to be held week earlier that compiler who be detected by handwriting to be barnworth have already written in bracket name of who have entered for of event in school sport one therefore in railsford must see not only what be going in for who competitor be whom be expected to beat good beginning have already be made before list came under notice of junior for high jump year for reason other have be looked forward to a one of principal event signature of barnworth stood boldly underneath dreaded name of smedley clipstone more than wake too have entered in list against great competitor entry for mile be scarcely le interesting smedley be to run for school still more formidable long legged branscombe against now appeared name of ainger stafford plucky ranger of fifth so on down list for big event prefect redoubtable fifth form mugger of railsford have set challenge heart of junior swelled big within a crowded round board to write name against lesser contest arthur baronet adopted simple modest method of entering for everything be not till maple hinted something about entrance fee mounting up to about sovereign piece that drew in horn limited ambition to long jump under fifteen junior hurdle race quarter mile under other shell fish followed suit tilbury of course put down for throwing cricket ball under fifteen indeed of admirer thought might even venture to throw against senior only felgate already have name down for event dimsdale undertook hundred yard under fifteen against several strong opponent on whole among boy of shell contrived to make strong show on list for event within reach when turn came for baby evinced equal spirit divided list among with fierceness augured ill for baby of other house whose claim challenged ainger barnworth strolled down later on to examine list now suggested few alteration baronet for instance be called upon to enter for second class of kicking football contest arthur be moved from quarter mile to half mile because good man be wanted there to beat smythe of school house whereas sherriff must very well be trusted to take care of quarter mile for railsford house mr railsford presently arrived on scene went into whole programme enthusiastically in way won friend among boy more even than reputed authorship of bicker outrage have lately done invited boy who chose during next few day to try over event in presence suggested that record of time must be carefully kept with view to ensure that trial must beat last more than that offered prize for best round record in house proposed that although be not rich enough to give prize for event boy who beat school record in competition must receive back entrance fee practical suggestion gave much satisfaction of course said to one two of round be harder to run against time than against fellow must make up mind for must advise to try to get two best in house to enter for event so a to get spur of close race time be sure to be better for boy liked for word sounded like common cause be quick to hail first symptom of such feeling in master next fortnight witnessed smart athletic fever in house of course soon spread abroad what railsford be up to school form generally improved in consequence in fact when day arrived for school sport be generally felt that grandcourt have rarely come on to ground better up to mark ala grandcourt came on to ground in two half on two different day when boy of school house roe bicker grover turned out to starting post railsford chafing like greyhound in leash turned in to penitential dinner never mind said ainger a distant shout be wafted from playing field into common room will be turn to day week chapter thirteen fly in ointment ainger prediction that house be not likely to get much backing up in new effort from felgate looked likely enough to be fulfilled while everyone else be full of athletic scholastic fervour remained listless even sulky said be because ainger have proposed great scheme felgate disdained to play second riddle even to captain others said be because must not win anything even if tried others darkly hinted that be one of author of house present disgrace others whispered that there be love lost between railsford fourth prefect in last conjecture gossip be right felgate master of shell have not hit from first day of acquaintance within last few day occurrence have taken place have brought two into violent collision railsford on leaving room one afternoon have be attracted by noise of groan weeping at far end of passage going in direction of melancholy sound discovered bateson baby with face a white a sheet huddled up of heap picture of misery tribulation what be matter inquired master sufferer did not hear at first on repetition of question looked up groaned oh be dying be so ill oh what will do railsford be alarmed boy looked so white trembled over stooped down to lift up bateson blubbered touch please oh be dying rolled over groaning be time for parleying railsford lifted up in arm looked at there be bead of perspiration on face flavour of strong tobacco about jacket bateson have be smoking master carried downstairs out into square where set on foot cool air instantly revived unhappy boy what left undone short sharp fit of sickness completed be better now said railsford when little ceremony be over bateson be fain to admit how many more cigar have got about inquired master a stalked with delinquent at heel into room closed door baby be pale time with terror not with tobacco tremblingly turned out trouser pocket produced big cigar of about quarter have be consumed that be really sir faltered railsford took cigar sniffed in old college day must not like to say have not smoked a good one very well said handing back to astonished baby now bateson sit down on chair here be match must finish cigar to end before leave room wretched bateson turned green began to howl oh please sir say that sir will kill please mr railsford railsford quietly lit match handed to boy bateson fairly went down on knee grovelled at master foot oh mr railsford will promise never to touch one again really will if will only let off must die if made oh please railsford blew out match told boy to get up never did before whimpered bateson be hardly necessary to say did know be harm felgate said must do good please mr railsford may put in fire will never touch such beastly thing again a railsford said nothing to prevent flung origin of evil into fire now go to room said master be so foolish again bateson departed marvelling that have not be thrashed for crime pretty effectually cured of ambition to renew narcotic experiment railsford have be anyone else master of house must have enjoyed little adventure a be did not like for must scarcely end where have astonished felgate that evening by visit to study felgate said wish to know reason for giving bateson cigar to smoke give bateson cigar sir do deny felgate demanded master sternly oh said prefect with forced laugh believe there be joke about cigar have great fancy to try one scornful look came into railsford face a said do really suppose felgate good be gained by not telling truth at once truth sir said felgate firing up a uncandid person always do when veracity be questioned understand sir understand perfectly said railsford know that be against rule for boy to smoke here be smoking said felgate encouraged boy to do what dared not do be hardly creditable in prefect felgate shifted ground there be nothing wrong in smoking said lot of fellow do do said railsford bluntly what have to do with matter a monitor be on honour to observe rule of school see that others observe break encourage others to break be there nothing wrong in felgate said nothing jauntily took up book put down book bring cigar tobacco have at once railsford said quietly firmly have lost shy hesitating manner with prefect now when for first time be in collision with one of number showed stronger man than felgate at rate have given credit for being prefect looked for moment a if must resist then sullenly went to locker produced case containing four cigar be have felgate nodded be confiscated by rule of school said railsford will be returned to after breaking up wish be able to return to now rely on honour not to repeat offence want back said felgate with sneer may smoke sir repented of insult before have left lip railsford however ignored quietly taking cigar from case took away with leaving case on table felgate impulse be to follow apologise for ill bred word evil genius kept back before bed time arrived not only repented of repentance reproached for not saying great deal more than have felgate have wonderful gift of self delusion knew have acted wrongly meanly yet argued smoking be crime if school rule make one doe follow be sinner if have whiff now then admits smoke doe call sinner easy enough for to be high mighty one law for for poor young bateson have sorry time of for next week in terror at prospect of having to smoke awful cigar to bitter end have scarcely known what be saying be not until felgate charged with being sneak that realised have said anything to compromise senior felgate be not one of vulgar noisy sort of bully good deal worse made wretched baby life miserable with sort of exquisite torture hounded on to break rule then caught red handed held over head threat of exposure punishment passed word round house that boy be tell tale little be mercy poor bateson got either from friend foe when became known did felgate in revengeful whim omit orthodox function of bully only took care to perform such ceremony in private for fear of mishap in precaution unluckily reckoned without host railsford after what have happened be hardly likely to consider bateson lot happy one kept sharp look out to prevent mischief coming to luckless baby on account of confession for day sign of such trouble came under master notice be beginning to congratulate that felgate have taken proper view of delinquency be taking only manly course of making amends when smouldering fire broke out unexpectedly fiercely master bateson be one of practical young gentleman who believe in having shilling worth for shilling when after day two heard called sneak from corner of house occurred to what be use of being called sneak if be not one whereupon marched off to railsford informed that felgate have twice screwed arm once made catch hold of poker at hot end proof whereof bore on hand have once made stand in corner on one foot for space of hour by clock have half dozen time threatened that unless did something wrong must accuse of theft other horrible crime to doctor by reason of ill usage threat deponent went in bodily fear of life oh please mr railsford be sure not let know told will kill railsford have uncomfortable interview with felgate after felgate a usual began by impugning junior veracity on master proposing to send for boy let repeat story there then sullenly admitted that might have played practical joke on tender person of kind suggested when railsford said matter be serious one prefect smiled deprecatingly said be not pleasant to to be spoken to in manner that if mr railsford wished to punish must be glad to have over done with railsford said that question in mind be whether must allow felgate to continue prefect of house whereupon felgate promptly changed colour dropped sneer entirely be sure said have intention of hurting may have be trifle inconsiderate did suppose did complain to so must hardly know minded can have very little confidence in prefect who act a have done felgate may depend on sir not to touch again want to depend on more than said master a prefect hold position of influence in house if influence be badly used think will have to complain more said felgate sincerely hope not for may be sure offence of kind must not possibly be passed over for present will say no more about will do best to treat with same confidence a heretofore just now need to work together for good of house school boy be sure to look to prefect to help good night felgate grimace with prefect returned salute after door closed might have convinced railsford have seen that have done no good either to house prefect by leniency a be be destined to make discovery later on felgate to appearance resumed old way in house let young bateson alone kept to feud with master even attempted to pretend languid interest in new ambition of fellow prefect at ainger request entered name for one of event in sport list railsford observed with relief that appeared to recognise force of rebuke have be administered with characteristic hopefulness be tempted to look upon incident a ended be by mean ended felgate to appearance docile penitent nursed wrath within kept eye open with keenness of sportsman to slightest opening for revenge in quiet way continued to do great deal in house to thwart spirit of enterprise be at present knitting faction together sneered in superior way at enthusiasm round succeeded in making one two of fellow little ashamed of own eagerness fund for railsford testimonial came in slowly result of fortnight hard work be only four shilling threepence to get even wretched sum arthur have made temporary enemy over house wrote urgent letter to daisy to shell out something strove to work on feeling of parent to assist to do honour to future son in law meanwhile conceived wild project of approaching prefect on subject unluckily for

must go now young 'un departed leaving arthur to pack up treasure amid misgiving lest sixpence in hand be after hardly worth secret have bought with chapter fourteen challenging record on monday before railsford sport ainger barnworth sat rather dismally conning document lay on table between be smedley report of school sport held saturday before be sufficiently alarming to dishearten ordinary reader mile race smedley branscombe time minute second whew said ainger ca beat be shortest have done in doubt if must do again fiddlestick if do in deserve to be sent home to nursery do see branscombe gave up before end be odd rather thought be better man of two branscombe seems to be down on luck altogether term said ainger fancy have very sweet time at bicker ought to have won mile for that be got longest leg in grandcourt used to have best wind gone stale said ainger growing too fast why must be a tall a railsford already be good for inch so more poor beggar what about high jump high jump smedley clipstone tie foot thank said barnworth may a well scratch at once once jumped that be in day of youth fiddlestick if clear foot deserve to be sent home to daily governess said ainger laughing by way hear wake have be jumping finely lately mind doe do for wake have better mind own business responded barnworth prefect very great person in house must greatly resent if fifth form fellow beat at jump upon word 'd give line cricket ball clipstone yard what poor throw felgate be sure to beat at rate not if can help said barnworth in fact if be must either scratch see someone else be in too to make sure of unless do lose do mean 'd throw short on purpose dear fellow be just beginning to perceive what anybody who be born simpleton must have seen for week ago ainger brow clouded will enter then said wo enter stafford stafford wo get mile will little success may keep with otherwise odds be may go over to enemy alias friend felgate ainger wrote stafford name down there then in way two friend went through list be strong record to beat if be doubtful of be still more doubtful of of junior for instance arthur if meant to win long jump under sixteen must have to clear foot inch dimsdale to secure yard under fifteen must have to do in second tilbury be safe for cricket ball in class arthur if took care might beat smith record for shell half mile most of other event be decidedly doubtful be evident week remained must need to be used well if ambitious attempt of railsford house be to succeed by mean least interested peruser of list when presently be posted up on common room door railsford for week two past have be a nearly happy a must be in congenial work of training encouraging youthful athlete of house have felt drawn to to by quite new bond of sympathy spared in nothing for common cause enthusiasm be a might be expected contagious there be one two of record will not beat said master to ainger majority of must be able to manage spoke so hopefully that ainger spirit went up decidedly final overhaul of list be made time registered compared with time on school list in one two case railsford advised that second man must be run with good start in order to force pace through one two name belonging to hopeless trifler malcontent quietly passed pencil see stafford have entered for cricket ball said a well a felgate how be that must lose cricket ball otherwise said ainger felgate may do best if someone be against wo if be only man in for have interest in sport railsford face clouded be stafford best man to enter must not barnworth go in think not sir stafford made good practice yesterday can beat school record a be during next few day spare moment at railsford house be used in preparing for great trial of saturday strange to say did school work suffer in consequence idler in shell being in way of spurt took sudden spurt of interest in class partly for fear of being excluded by detention otherwise from saturday celebration partly because healthy condition of body have begotten for time being healthier condition of mind arthur baronet actually knew syntax for two day running astounding phenomenon of perfectly empty detention room occurred on friday saturday latter event be specially satisfactory to railsford a be able to secure service of monsieur lablache a assistant judge not exactly popular appointment failing better one fellow have to make best of house rose that saturday morning with full sense of crisis be upon despite felgate sneer jealous ridicule floated in from outside on effort felt that stood face to face with great chance reputation a house be on trial be boycotted by doctor held up a warning to evil doer resolved to make warning to good evil doer alike day show doctor everyone else that spirit be not yet knocked out of half holiday at railsford a have said began under new regime immediately after breakfast ended at one o'clock so that farce of morning school did not interpose to chill ardour of combatant whole house assembled in flannel in honour of occasion weather be very much like what school have have week ago if anything ground be hardly in quite a good condition at rate be felt that a far a external went test between two day performance must be fair one true there be something little chilly about empty field usual inspiriting crowd of partisan spectator be absent junior of railsford who usually have to fight for front place felt little dismal when discovered that must occupy position liked even lady stand arthur be very angry with for not getting daisy down for occasion presence must have lent undoubted prestige to dig a well a to railsford if must have given prize afterwards must have be magnificent family affair bemoaned omission to railsford a walked down with to field however just before proceeding begun wished for excitement be supplied by three most unexpected arrival on course first be that of doctor niece who having watched school sport week ago with great interest being secretly rather sorry for misfortune have over taken railsford house saw reason why must not take accustomed place in stand to day boy be just in mood to appreciate little act of chivalry a shyly walked up to pavilion welcomed with cheer brought blush to cheek smile of half frightened pleasure to lip boy who have seen day for last three month in chapel suddenly discovered that be simply charming greeted much a mortal in distress must greet apparition of good fairy fifty champion there then be ready to do battle for only wished have chance excitement of arrival be hardly passed when figure appeared on scene hardly le important le popular be other than smedley school captain who have asked obtained special leave from mr roe to be present a representing school on occasion be still indignant at disability imposed upon rival house though by mean wished success in ambitious project of beating school record sense of fair play told that if one be on ground to represent other house must compete at disadvantage if went out that school captain have be present everyone at rate must have to admit there have be fair play opening for dispute result might be so smedley although might be to see own record beaten came down to field that morning there be little uncertainty a to reception at first for railsford be in ishmaelitish mood be ready to call everybody enemy who be on side when ainger be heard to say hurrah be regular brick to come back up like everybody jumped to correct view of smedley motif cheered scarcely le enthusiastically than have just now cheered queen of love beauty only wish be in flannel said arthur must run mile against must be something like to lick off own stride arthur be rather proud of athletic slang what meant be that must sooner see ainger win mile against smedley than against smedley time never mind be going to be judge do see say old man will have to sit up now be universal effect of captain presence perhaps hardly realised what advantage presence be conferring on rival first event on programme be baby hundred yard for friend bateson juke be entered with serious record of twenty two second to beat be little pale nervous with excitement of opening ball looked round wistfully first at railsford then at smedley where stood watch in hand at winning post then up at lady stand now youngster said railsford do very best ought of to run under twenty second be ready now off flood gate be opened now from moment till end of sport railsford kept up continual roar bateson juke have little difficulty in registering double victory for house bateson covered ground in nineteen second juke in twenty one while cheer for initial victory be in full cry third of morning apparition came upon scene be other than mr bicker at sight of whom chill fell upon assembly what did want there have done harm enough who asked to come why be making own fellow miserable instead of coming here spoiling fun mr bicker after looking round taking in scene generally walked up to lady stand fellow dropped back sullenly to make room for although one two pretended not to notice continued to stand shout bateson juke until pushed aside good morning miss violet said lifting hat did not expect to see here did mr bicker be going to see event have just run first race bateson juke have beaten boy in house who won last week have programme

room that sunday evening feeling rather more than usually comfortable have cause to be pleased house have done better than anyone expected have beaten record three without being specially conceited railsford took to credit of having done good deal to bring about satisfactory result curious said to that in probability if affair of bicker have not happened might never have risen a house indeed be almost mercy culprit have never be discovered for must have then be plunged back into current work of pulling together might never have be done be odd that a time go on there be not even hint suspicion who did there be only one boy in house be not sure of be too great coward to be ruffian well well have cricket season exam coming on if only do a well in a have done in sport will not be altogether against if mystery remains mystery little longer whereupon door opened mr bicker stepped in railsford have completely forgotten episode in field previous day scarcely recollected that mr bicker have be present at sport be delightfully oblivious to fact that railsford have slighted offended colleague wondered what be occasion of present visit secretly resolved to keep temper head if must good evening said with friendly smile be just going to have coffee wo have cup too bicker mr bicker took notice of hospitable invitation closed door behind said want few word with mr railsford certainly have nothing to do wo take seat mr bicker took seat little disconcerted by railsford determined good humour have not counted upon that last time saw be hardly so polite said with sneer when be that be very sorry if be rude have intention assure railsford began to feel little like lamb in fable wolf have evidently come bent on quarrel railsford lamb a be must have liked to oblige be quick enough to see with memory of more than one failure to warn that only chance with mr bicker be at cost not to quarrel be fortunate in short memory be most convenient gift be one at rate must like to cultivate with regard to unpleasantness there may have be between bicker said railsford be not happy speech mr bicker accepted with laugh quite so can understand that happens however have come to assist in prolonging memory with regard to unpleasantness be sorry to interfere with good intention can not be helped time really said railsford feeling patience considerably taxed be very perplexing must mind coming to point at once bicker not at when saw yesterday asked to look at letter have with oh yes remember now be greatly taken up with sport have time then felt sure must understand understood perfectly have brought letter for now held out railsford took with curiosity for mr bicker manner besides being offensive be decidedly mysterious be to read please letter be short one written in evidently disguised hand sir name of person who maltreated lately be perfectly well known in railsford house one know name better than mr railsford a house be thriving by have occurred be to nobody interest to let out secret writer of know what be speaking about where to find proof friend railsford read strange communication once twice then laughed be amusing be sneered mr bicker be absurd said railsford thought must say so said bicker taking back letter folding up for must like to know name of person referred to surely mean bicker that attach importance to ridiculous joke like attach just importance deserves railsford then must put in fire bicker mr bicker face darkened long ere now have calculated on reducing citadel of adversary good humour now that still held out felt own self possession deserting allow to tell railsford that believe what that letter state do really hope when tell that word of relates to myself be grotesque falsehood will alter opinion even must not convince said bicker railsford stared at blankly have surely misunderstood word said repeated there be tremor of excitement in voice afforded enemy keenest pleasure said that word in letter refers to be false surely believe after said repeated mr bicker with fine sneer even must not convince surely longed for explosion must come now saw railsford face flush eye flash before furious retort escaped from lip wise whisper from somewhere fell between robbed wolf of prey then said master of shell forcing lip to smile there be not much to be gained by prolonging interview be there mr bicker be deeply mortified there be nothing for now for to assume role of aggressor must so much have preferred to be aggrieved yes railsford said rising from chair standing over enemy dare to say that know suspect person who assaulted railsford felt devoutly thankful have kept head now dug hand into pocket stretched replied may very safely do that bicker be hard line for poor bicker have worked so hard to get adversary here be labour being lost be paltering snarled dare to say did not do cowardly deed railsford must not imagine how have ever be so foolish a to be in rage with fellow laughed outright at last piece of bluster bicker be now fairly beside must never have done what did struck railsford where sat blow on mouth brought blood to lip surely be last card railsford in after year never knew exactly how came about that did not fly there then at enemy throat shake a big dog shake rat may have be be too much astonished to do anything of sort may have be that stronger man of two felt sort of pity for poor bully kept back at rate good genius befriended time saved dignity moral vantage put handkerchief to lip for moment then said quietly there be two way of leaving room bicker door window advise to choose door mr bicker be too cowed by own act to keep up contest hating at moment almost a much not quite a hated enemy slunk out of door departed to own house railsford sat where be stared at door by visitor have left in state of bewildered astonishment more railsford thought matter over le liked for convinced that there be someone desirous of doing injury by mean of very master who be already predisposed to believe evil of be rather damper after glorious result of sport railsford tried to laugh off dismiss whole matter from mind at least said to if accusation come in more likely form than have seen to night can afford to disregard though bicker made fool of for once in way doe not at follow that will not return to attack may actually have to answer to grandcourt charge of precious letter be too absurd really chapter sixteen testimonial a reader may suppose sympathetic soul of miss daisy herapath be considerably moved by content of brother letter gave in last chapter naturally took interest in welfare doings of railsford house a heard quite a often from master a did from pupil be able to form pretty good round opinion on school politics arthur lively account of house sport have delighted not that understood obscure term embellished be quite enough for that house have risen above tribulation rewarded master by brilliant exploit in field when arthur passed from public to personal matter sister felt rather le at ease much disliked barefaced proposal for testimonial have told brother a much more than once on whole decided to send arthur letter enclosure to railsford confide perplexity to railsford perused dear boy florid effusion with considerable interest particularly grieve to say certain portion of if daisy have be a wise a be affectionate must have kept to herself when people put note into circulation be not fault of into whose hand come if discover in beauty unsuspected by person for whose benefit be issued railsford saw great deal more in arthur letter than daisy have even suspected certain passage have seemed mere mysterious jargon to have pretty plain meaning for especially after interview last sunday with mr bicker be jolly good job that row about bicker came on when did nobody want to find chap out now so particular be serene up to now mean to drip spoil game what must mean except arthur somehow other knew secret respecting bicker affair be keeping to presumably in interest of railsford must mysterious hint have connection with false rumour have reached bicker magnified in mind to uncomfortable extent railsford resolved to delight heart of young relative by friendly visit make reconnaissance of position have very good pretext in anxious solicitude expressed in daisy letter for health appetite of love tossed brother must make business to inquire how sufferer did waiting therefore until preternatural stillness in room above assured that dig be out of way master of shell went up stair ushered into arthur study hard at work see said railsford cheerily how be getting on serene thanks replied arthur be not very well have stuck fast in translation let look oh be not doing exercise said arthur in alarm be only

delighted to accept offer then promise to back up let see know doctor at home evening be not yet so will have time if go at once to catch before tea will wait here till come back arthur face underwent wonderful change a master quietly uttered word began by lengthening growing little pale then grew troubled then bewildered then scarlet finally when have ended relaxed into very faint smile think will wait bit said gravely very well only let hear result when do go think may a well start work for swift to night said if mind by mean boy come along to room will look through list of subject arthur before task be half over have recovered spirit advanced far in esteem of future kinsman awfully brickish of sir said must be bad score for house if got prize at exam must not at must be too confident jolly lucky be cut off from rest of chap be make sit up state of thing may end time know said master must sit up ' same oh wo come out till exam be over will how do know arthur glanced up at kinsman inwardly reflected what clever chap be to ask question in such way oh right meant be must suit book must to let out just yet be not question of what suit anyone be question of what be right if anybody in house know anything ought to speak cost there be artful card thought arthur to added aloud fancy fellow know anything marky mean mr railsford do know said master have sometimes have impression did be quite relieved to hear arthur oh need be afraid of said arthur lost in admiration for cleverness of future brother in law be safe never fear be strange mystery said railsford sooner later will know meaning of later better put in arthur with wink envy feeling of culprit whoever be for be coward a well a liar more do perhaps be too down on though never mind be safe enough for have odd way of talking arthur doe do justice a said have more than once made wonder whether be not keeping back something about wretched affair ought to know honour bright know jolly lot le about than so really need be afraid of dig safe too safe a door nail railsford be able to write home on following sunday that arthur have quite recovered appetite that low symptom to dig have darkly referred have vanished altogether indeed arthur on occasion developed that most happy of accomplishment power of utterly forgetting that have done said anything strange in offensive to others be hail fellow well met with boy have lately kicked made miserable did not know what be talking about when reminded that day two ago have behaved like cad to greatest exploit of have effrontery to charge dig with being spoon on

trying to scratch letter with pin on inner surface to arthur belonged credit of delicate suggestion that instead of writing term of endearment in vulgar english must engrave in classic greek thus chuki result be on whole satisfactory when list of contributor be emblazoned on sheet of school paper sir digby oakshott address for felgate declined invitation to make speech have be finally revised corrected prospect of ceremonial seemed very encouraging arthur dig once more completely reconciled went through farce of house tea that evening in common room with considerable trepidation have big

over form advanced on master in compact phalanx arthur dig little pale dry about lip marched at head what be inquired railsford arthur dig replied by rather ceremonious bow in deputation followed then

too why railsford know about smiley let have last term be not going to have term two other fellow have started dog on strength of smiley already there be to be clean sweep of lot oh rot ca interfere with fellow right like said felgate tell railsford gave leave repeated arthur very well said ainger unless of be packed off home by time to morrow sent down to school farm will go up to doctor settle question with rubbish said felgate until railsford shut up said captain be not talking to be hardly to be wondered at if be out of temper be having amount of extra work to do to be thus obstructed by one of own colleague be trifle too much for limited patience felgate coloured up at rebuff knowing well enough that captain must be delighted to make good word at time place might be offered remained after have gone said to arthur be what call brutal be not going to care two straw what say very well said arthur stroking puppy if sends up to pony what then bless wo send up to pony think not if thought must 'd hang on till marky come back 'd square thing of course must be bit of spite of ainger think be not quite important enough so be going to start bullying will back up thanks awfully said ductile arthur be brick 'd take advice did prevailed upon dig to do same consequence be that when next afternoon captain walked into study to see whether order have be complied with be met by unceremonious yap from smiley echoed by impertinent squeak from irreverent son have got still then said ainger very well can stay now till after have be to doctor nine o'clock sharp to morrow morning of friend turned pale not really ainger have sent up name have will send off thought a felgate said oh cad last remark be occasioned by ainger departing shutting door behind without vouchsafing further parley felt that game be up that have be done in distress waited upon felgate laid case before a be usual with gentleman of type said be very hard unjust must do quite right in resisting defying everybody round did not offer to go instead of to doctor so that general observation on situation be not particularly comforting arthur proposed telegraphing to railsford something in form ainger say smiley against rule wire allow when form be filled up ready to send chance of succeeding seemed hardly worth cost finally went down sadly after tea to school farm hired kennel arranged for board lodging of exiled pet at so much week next morning in doleful dump presented before doctor arthur must hardly help remembering how short time ago have pictured standing in very room demanding hand of miss violet now smiley minor squeaking grunting a hung by one tooth to mother tail down there in school farm be worth dozen miss violet to once expected uncle doctor dealt shortly decisively with miscreant caned for defying house captain reprimanded for imagining dog must be permitted under school roof on being told that mr railsford have known about smiley last term declined to argue matter concluded by warning of possible consequence of repetition of offence went back to place sore in body mind to be caned during first week of term be not quite in accordance with good resolution to be bereft of smiley be cruel outrage on natural affection owed to ainger mutually resolved that be cad of lowest description for that attended to injunction for next few day with wonderful punctuality decided to defer till railsford return own revenge consequent confusion altogether be getting to be time for railsford to turn up evening before first master session for term have be held doctor for wonder have be present towards end of meeting after discussion of great deal of general business mr bicker rose asked leave to make statement reader can guess what statement be begged to remind meeting grandcourt still lay under cloud of mystery enveloped assault have be made upon last term for mattered very little for honour of school considered matter must not be allowed to drop until be properly cleared up with view to assisting in result might mention that towards end of last term rumour have come to ear be not at liberty to say through what channel that secret be not quite a dead a be generally supposed have heard on what considered reliable authority that in mr railsford house house most interested in painful question name of culprit culprit be generally known at least suspected believed be not going too far in mentioning rumour that one must make better guess a to name than mr railsford here mr grover monsieur lablache rose to foot monsieur of course gave way what have meant to say be pretty much what mr grover did say wished to point out that in friend absence insinuation a just made by speaker be quite unjustifiable for own part thought great pity to revive unfortunate question at at rate in mr railsford absence must certainly oppose further reference being made to at meeting echoed monsieur be precisely opinion very well said mr bicker pleasantly what have to say will keep perfectly well until mr railsford come back whereupon meeting passed to next order of day chapter nineteen felgate champion of oppressed spoke well for railsford growing influence with boy that a soon a returned to post sign of mutiny disappeared house seemed to regain that spirit of ambition self reliance have characterised last day of previous term few knotty question a reader know be awaiting master of shell on arrival took one at time not having be involved in previous altercation respecting disposed of great deal more easily than have be expected thing have be coming to climax rather rapidly between felgate ainger not that felgate have committed unusual offence that ainger have discovered anything new about have not known before during last few week of last term opening day of present two have crossed one path frequently with increasing friction ainger be one of fellow who when mind be set on thing seem to lose sight of two person person who can help most person who can hinder most in present case ainger heart be set on making house crack house of grandcourt person who must help most be railsford person who must hinder most be felgate captain have be shy of new master of shell for long time mistrust have not be on one side a last term have worn on common cause have arisen in temporary disgrace of house master head prefect have felt drawn together in mutual confidence railsford now though still did not always realise have more loyal adherent than ainger ainger on part be quite ready to acknowledge without railsford house stood poor chance of fulfilling ambitious project barnworth have marked out for only hoped now that master might not rest on laurel of last term must help to carry through still more important exploit of great obstacle to whatever good be going on in railsford at present be felgate have nearly succeeded last term in sowing discontent among juvenile athlete have in most unmistakable manner not done best in one competition at sport for have entered that be bad enough quick tempered ainger wrote up heavy score against on two item now have begun on new line although prefect not only evinced interest in order of house at time when prefect be specially on mettle have taken pain to undermine discipline of place set authority up in antagonism to of own colleague felgate laid plan deeply cleverly ainger a knew be popular because have won mile be upright meant what said said what meant boy of whom same can be said must help being popular said felgate to there be other way of being popular have won mile anything else be not particularly upright must like to assert always say what mean mean what say still can make pleasant to parcel of kid when choose can let off of little row can help to better sport than tomfoolery about getting up crack eleven winning school prize ainger wo like fancy can sail close enough to wind not to give chance of being down on a for railsford snob if interferes well can take out of in way suspect what hypocrite fellow must be to do thing like come here smiling talk about making crack house of grandcourt bah righteous soul of felgate waxed hot within set to consider how with least risk to most mischief to everyone else must drive wedge into project of colleague make to party in railsford passed in review various rule of house to discover someone on might possibly found grievance for man who set to make party must have grievance fancied have discovered just what wanted in time honoured rule about compulsory cricket boy be obliged to show up in cricket field three time week whether liked not there be very few boy in railsford a felgate knew who did not like fancied for that must make something out of rule began by breaking knew that one must be particularly concerned on account for be indifferent player also prefect might on pinch excuse after week abstention during rather to disappointment notice be taken of defection began to talk about to one of more studious boy of house boy very keen on winning school prize at end of term for be entered sherriff of fifth be one of much a liked cricket be bemoaning one day having to turn out into field just when wanted to finish knotty problem in trigonometry go said felgate surely one have right to spoil chance of scholarship for musty old school rule ought to have be abolished century ago be not bad rule on whole fancy said sherriff come little rough on just now dear fellow be not quite slave here if doe suit to go down on knee to antiquated rule of kind then be not fellow take for if do have suited often enough have not be muff a to think twice about happened to when did turn up nothing of course must have be rather glad if something have for sake of fighting thing out be enough to make fellow loathe very name of cricket be of fellow who ca play like certainly blame if only few of must stand out 'd soon break down system be keeping from work old man will think a bad a rule say will have jolly hard fight for exam so be right to waste time result of conservation be that sherriff one of steadiest second rate bat in house be absent from practice hue cry be made after be found working hard in study really ca come to day be in for exam know will take tremendous grind to lick redgrave said stafford who be ambassador be same for of if fellow said same must be up with house cricket wanted to turn out such hot team year too come on will do work twice a well after ground just in perfect condition for batting to day sherriff be not proof against wily appeal have be effort to to break rule be effort now to decide to keep so jumped into flannel took beloved bat made long score that morning against wake bowling be happy felgate mentally abused for pusillanimity saw reason for for not turning incident to account proclaimed poor sherriff wrong to few of other malcontent be hard line said just because of wretched rule sherriff be to lose scholarship ca possibly win unless be able to read moment of time that grave reverend senior mean to allow brutal shame said munger hounding down like have mind to stick out be what sherriff said sneered felgate have to knuckle under catch knuckling under said munger stayed away next practice day much to mortification nobody took slightest notice of absence see said felgate if only one two of stand steady ca compel to play be ridiculous next day accordingly three fellow stayed away who a be three premier lout in railsford be never missed inquired after when next day number swelled to five included simson who at least knew one end of bat from other have once tipped ball to leg for two matter be no longer to be overlooked captain attention be called to fact that one fellow in fifth three in shell one baby besides felgate be not down on ground fetch then said ainger tell to look sharp will catch be envoy time duly delivered message to deserter whom rather suspiciously a seemed to found together 'd better go youngster said felgate with sneer will have to do sooner later 'd better cave in at once be hanged if go said munger fancy be safe fixture whether go not drily observed wake look sharp be coming not be not coming tell said munger more be said simson more be said of others be coming felgate demanded wake be irreverent question for fifth form boy to ask prefect felgate naturally rebuked be business of yours 'd better not be impudent can tell a happens have got work to do ca come cut away need stay wake departed cheerfully announced that whole thing be put up job a arthur must have called that felgate be at bottom of whereupon ainger face grew dark walked bat in hand to house mutineer with exception of felgate who with usual prudence of professional patriot have retired to study be loafing about common room just where wake have interviewed what be meaning of demanded captain what do mean by not turning up to cricket sending word be coming when wake came for be much easier defying ainger in absence than in presence now that stood there confronted delinquent did not quite feel hardy men of war have be five minute ago munger however tried to carry thing off with bluster see fun of being compelled to go time care about cricket besides mean to go felgate doe go why make captain put down bat munger go put on flannel at once what if asked munger ainger replied by giving thrashing there then despite howl protest that have just be going must never do again captain replied that did fancy must do again in hurry a remainder of company expressed positive impatience to go to cricket field let of with caution after seeing started walked moodily up to felgate study felgate be comfortably stretched on two chair reading novel a held book upside down ainger concluded that must not be very deeply engrossed in content be working hear said captain be that have come to tell replied felgate only most fellow when be reading even if be novel read right way up be bad for eye to do upside down felgate looked little disconcerted shut up book have missed last two week at cricket said captain have managed to get on without though one of thing looked in to say now be that if choose to stay away always be welcome think will put out be unexpected felgate be prepared to hear peremptory order to go to field have laid plan for resisting have just be seeing one two other lout down below who have turned up be glad to hear advised to go when sent wake to fetch be pity did take advice for have have to thrash munger if happen to know where can find coward who put rest up to breaking rule did dare to show face will thrash too felgate be completely disconcerted by speech gnashed teeth to find made fool of after why on earth ca get out of study go down to cricket want here snarled dare say not thought ought to know what have be doing to enforce rule what mean to do hope will tell coward spoke of what may expect look here said felgate firing up for baulked bully rarely talk in whisper may think very important person be speech felgate have prepared in case have be ordered down to cricket consider cricket rule be bad one be not surprised if fellow kick against have something better to do than to go down to field three time week will certainly sympathise with fellow who complain of try to get abolished have told so can do what like with have told what will do said captain whose temper be extinguished have told what will do be room large enough will come outside felgate stared at in consternation do mean to fight rot be not going to fight very well then give choice thrashing like gave munger just now can go put on flannel come down to field felgate hesitated have rarely be in such awkward fix knew that thrashing from captain besides being painful must mean extinction of influence ever have at grandcourt on other hand have not time to argue out ainger have already laid down bat will have own way snarled will come to field chapter twenty little sweep ainger victory over rebel have great moral effect on house there be further question a to hardship of compulsory cricket indeed everyone became so keen on prospect of turning out crack eleven if rule have required attendance of boy daily instead of thrice week fellow must have turned up prospect brightened rapidly after week two practice railsford put shoulder to wheel with usual energy must bowl bat field with equal cheerfulness if thereby might smarten up form of player however indifferent who really wanted to improve specially devoted to candidate for place in second eleven presently began to be rumoured that railsford must be able to put two eleven in field able to hold own against other two in grandcourt be rather big boast after exploit of house at sport nobody must afford to make too little of ambitious project arthur dig coterie most of safely housed already in second eleven caught regular cricket fever lived in atmosphere of cricket thought in cricket dreamed of nothing else question arose resolved into cricket match in mind be mentally played out to bring to decision ordinary talk betrayed mania even work be solaced by importation of cricket into deepest problem here for instance

thought must be wrong if felgate went in for have got stamp back sir please let off can not do that if doctor treat le severely than deserve will be because have made reparation instead of carrying out act of dishonesty have in mind to perpetrate left there proceeded with heart a heavy a have worn since came to grandcourt to felgate study chapter one naturalist field club felgate a have said have almost forgotten existence of sweep fact that have given name to venture when therefore railsford unexpectedly walked into study did not in way connect visit with trivial incident conjured up in mind possible motive master must have for interview must only think of one perceiving paper in railsford hand concluded that have discovered authorship of certain anonymous letter addressed to mr bicker have looked in for little explanation felgate be quite prepared to gratify promised cheerful quarter of hour over so congenial occupation be in consequence considerably mortified when real object of visit unfolded felgate said railsford have come to on very unpleasant business be not first time have have to caution that example in house be worthy of prefect senior boy thank sir said felgate with ostentatious indifference have better have remained silent for railsford dismissed of mildness have come armed with stood on dignity be impertinent felgate will do good want to know how come that name appears here at head of list of entry for sweepstake on horse race when a prefect know that gambling in shape form be strictly prohibited here felgate taken back by unexpected indictment looked at paper laughed really know how name come there ca be supposed to know why anybody who like must write name down on piece of paper mean to say that never entered name asked railsford beginning to feel sense of relief certainly not be asked to do so what did reply have notion probably said bother do anything like something of sort did point out that be against rule be against rule there doe seem harm in if fellow choose to do besides be for money did give six stamp stamp fancy someone came to borrow stamp of week so ago forget who be felgate said master with tone of scorn made prefect wince be hardly worth while to tell lie when can satisfy of guilt quite a easily by telling truth wo ask more question for have wish to give more opportunity of falsehood here be six stamp go to doctor ponsford to morrow at pm felgate looked blank at announcement what exclaimed go to doctor be going to tell about trifle like be trifle for prefect deliberately to break school rule encourage others to do so have said same thing to before look here mr railsford said felgate with curious mixture of cringing menace be not fair to send to doctor about thing like know have spite against can take out of without bringing into fancy if knew know 'd think twice before did railsford looked at curiously surely forget felgate that be not speaking to boy in shell know be master head of house man who ought to be everything be right good come come interrupted railsford have have enough of be excited forget to talk in foolish way quitted study what wondered must be meaning of wild outbreak on part of detected prefect what did mean by if knew know sounded like one of vague menace with arthur have be wont to garnish utterance last term what did felgate know beyond secret of own wrong doings must possibly affect master of shell flashed across railsford suddenly suggested perhaps by connection of two idea that arthur might be in peril difficulty be long since master have attempted to control secret of prospective relationship with vivacious young shell fish everybody knew about a soon a ever set foot in grandcourt daisy name be common property over house arthur have contrived to reap small advantage from connection prefect have pretty much left alone a relative of master have be tacitly winked at in many of escapade with leniency boy must not have hoped for what if now arthur must lie under shadow of peril if fell must envelop brother in law if for instance have committed capital offence if brought to light must throw on railsford terrible duty of nipping in bud school career of daisy own brother seemed only solution to felgate mysterious threat made profoundly uncomfortable felt have not done might for boy have be so scrupulously careful not to give pretext for charge of favouritism that have even neglected at time now then have have chat arthur have painful way of getting into awkward topic that such conference be usually short formal have occasionally given oversight to boy work arthur so greatly preferred to mug a called in own study opportunity for serious private coaching have be quite rare recently too difference have sprung up between arthur marky about smiley railsford felt that have not done might to smooth over bitter memory recover loyalty affection of bereaved dog fancier may have be of notion prompted master to invite young kinsman to accompany on following day being mid term holiday on expedition into country occasion have be chosen by grandcourt naturalist field club for yearly picnic club be very select by repute dry institution consisting partly of scientific boy partly of master supposed object be to explore surrounding country for geological botanical historical specimen be when found deposited in museum nobody in school on pretext ever visited member have privilege of introducing friend one took advantage of invitation except once year on occasion of annual picnic when there be always great rush severe competition to be numbered among happy participant of club hospitality be long since arthur have given up idea of joining happy party great therefore be astonishment delight when on evening before term holiday railsford put head into study said arthur must like to come to morrow to field club picnic at wellham abbey rather said arthur very well be ready at ten have ordered tandem tricycle arthur be in ecstasy if there be one kind of spree liked be picnic at abbey if there be one sort of conveyance doated on be tricycle wiped off score on mental slate against marky voted

take will do like shot be always civil to dig thought over if say yes will help polish off line right say go soon somebody else may have asked dig went to satisfaction be informed that stafford must take if promised to be steady of course did promise so between two chum polished off livy never be great historian made such mincemeat of before after then gave over to delightful anticipation of field club picnic one misgiving disturbed arthur peace of mind railsford might make base use of opportunity a partner on tricycle to corner about misdeed generally to jaw besides a dig be going too must be ever so much jollier if dig must go to wellham together let master go by must work somehow dig said arthur if go must have high old time not be let in for lot of rot about old bone fossil sort

at sky debated with whether day must hold up long enough to allow of picnic at water edge to relief other excursionist who gradually assembled took hopeful view of weather predicted that must be fine afternoon morning might be a be naturalist field club people boy supposed knew what be saying dismissed qualm in consequence wellham abbey be ten mile off most of party proposed to reach on foot mr

sir stafford asked have dig yes sir have scouted for stafford at cricket term so be asked to day have done line sir oh very well said railsford to whom temptation of walk with grover be even greater than of tete tete ride with arthur herapath can manage manage exclaimed in tone a if must scarcely believe heard aright rather sir well said master tickled with evident delight of pair to be together take care how go have better take grassen road so a to avoid hill come along grover so two artful young naturalist have own way after come on sharp said arthur get out of ruck jolly good joke telling not to go by maiden hill said digby that will be best part of lark luckily tandem tricycle of type provided for be not machine requires very specially delicate riding have be arthur dig might have be

performance be only about quarter of hour after pedestrian at abbey well here be said railsford came by grassen suppose rather rough riding be came by maiden hill after said arthur be rather rough did walk down then rode came down in pretty good time there be something matter with brake so have to let go possibly railsford have better notion of narrow escape of two hare brained young guest of club than have forgot about moment saw hamper being carried in direction of river heard mr roe announce that might a well have lunch now explore abbey afterwards hear hear whispered dig to friend eh rather said arthur be invaluable in spreading repast hastening moment when mr roe at last announced that be ready to begin be rather imposing company doctor be there niece messrs roe grover railsford one two

host let go see abbey have put together few note on history architecture thought might be useful let go first to saxon crypt be unquestionably oldest portion of structure oh lag said dig to friend be going to hear rot not if know replied arthur 'd better lie low help wash up plate when be gone can go for spin up big window so when mr roe having collected little audience round began to descant with glowing countenance on preciousness of fragment of reputed druidical font lately dug up in crypt two naturalist who must have be hanging on lip be busy polishing up plate remnant of repast at water edge watching chance for spin up ruined arch of great window window in day must have be one of finest abbey window in england still stood erect covered with ivy while around wall tower roof have crumbled into dust of slender stone framework still dropped gracefully from gothic arch at apex of there still adhered foot two of sturdy masonry of old belfry boy must look up to lofty platform standing out clear against grey sky without feeling foot tingle certainly arthur dig be not proof against fascination first part of climb up tumbled wall along ivy covered buttress be easy enough few sparrow swallow bustling out from ivy at approach have often be similarly disturbed before when reached point where great arch freeing a be of old support sprung in one clear sweep skyward difficulty began treacherous stone more than once crumbled under foot have not be for sustaining ivy must have come down with run too see said mr roe to admiring audience below work of dissolution be still rapidly going on stone have fallen from great arch since came here regular jerry builder must have have in day growled dig scrambling up last few yard did ever see such rotten wall arthur confessed have having gained top forgave builder rarely have dig be so pleased with one be genuine feat of climbing of very few must boast peril achievement bind friend together a mortar ever bind brick that window said mr roe looking up from below be considered inaccessible be said to be haunted truth be believe that be infested by owl here faint boo hoo from above bore sudden striking testimony to truth of master observation hullo said arthur peering over be going look sharp down dig will be left dig obeyed be much more difficult getting down than getting up still by dint of clinging tight hold of ivy feeling step managed to descend perilous arch get on to comparatively safe footing of buttress cut on shouted arthur from above will be down in second wait have found owl nest up here be going to collar young 'un for of tell if railsford asks where be tell be walking home can go with on tandem will be home a soon a at same moment shout from below of herapath oakshott still further hastened dig descent to terra firma come on said railsford who be already seated on tricycle be coming on to rain where herapath oh be walking home told to tell so have be scrambling about can come in tandem if be not coming can have gone on then be just getting specimen said dig hopping up on saddle resolving that marky must do work say 'd sooner walk dear here come rain said railsford turning up collar 'd better go on will get wet whichever way come home so departed a also did mr roe doctor others there be owl again said mr roe looking back at big window be wrong shout heard be from arthur not time in sport in grim earnest for having abandoned idea of capturing owl have started to descend arch have safely accomplished distance when ledge of mortar gave way under left hanging by arm to ivy felt in vain with foot for support must find none dig previous descent have knocked away most of little ledge by have come up finally by desperate effort pulled up few inch by ivy managed to get footing again there stuck must not go down further to go up must bring nearer grandcourt than be at present so be arthur shouted everyone thought owl left there in rain to spend pleasant evening on top of great window of wellham abbey chapter twenty two haunted window let see said doctor a railsford met once during day have two of boy to see evening one prefect be necessary to send up be sir if saw slightest prospect of dealing properly with must have done so be enemy to order of house a know house just now can not afford to have more enemy than have enemy be of own house said doctor sternly have expected long before that must have be possible to restore to ordinary right of grandcourt impenetrable mystery be bad thing for school be said railsford feeling uncomfortable here conservation ended railsford have not be long in room that evening when sir digby oakshott knocked at door entered with long face please sir have seen anything of herapath said be not turned up what be sure have asked others have come expect will get pretty drenched if be lost way ca have lost way be too simple what be doing at abbey when last saw going after owl said dig where on big window got to top know came down a soon a saw starting shouted that must be down in second be going to walk home be to wait say wonder if be got stuck up there come cropper dig face be pale a thought flashed across mind railsford be not bit le concerned go quickly see if mr roe have sent away trap if not keep if have gone go to jason get one directly oakshott in five minute baronet returned ca get trap anywhere said dismally have got jason to send horse will do said railsford hurrying down will do groaned dig ca go too oh mr railsford shouted a master be jumping into saddle what road will come back by maiden hill said master digging heel into horse side with heavy heart digby watched start then putting on cap determinedly followed on foot into night rain will do in two hour half said to if trot part of way what cad be to leave up there be not till bed time at railsford fellow generally became aware that master two of boy be missing railsford oakshott have be seen in school after return from picnic railsford have of course depended on boy to explain sudden absence dig have be too miserable excited to think of telling anybody a started on weary tramp first inquiry for missing one came from doctor who after interview with felgate sent messenger over to master of shell to request presence in head master study at once messenger returned to report mr railsford be not in one knew where be gone then hue cry being once raised appeared that arthur dig study be also empty that owner be nowhere to be found presently school gatekeeper reported that on coming up from town just now have seen mr railsford galloping on one of jason horse in direction of london road munger who have be out of bound reported in private because disclosure might get into trouble if came to ear of authority just a be sneaking in at gate met sir digby oakshott baronet sneaking out doctor who might never have heard of affair have not chanced to want to see railsford particularly that evening walked over to house about bed time interviewed ainger have slightest idea what mean asked head master not slightest sir said ainger shortly if have have must have spoken long ago a doctor knew must have known one be to stay up said doctor wish to take charge of order of house in mr railsford absence ainger circumstance have occurred may make necessary to remove felgate to house meanwhile have forfeited prefecture here doctor went away leaving captain of railsford with new perplexity piled up on others whereupon ainger sent house to bed threatened with sort of penalty if light be not out quiet by be sleepless night for good many in grandcourt mr roe grover sat up together in room of former anxious perplexed about missing friend mr bicker walked about room too wondered if game be to slip through finger after felgate lay awake laughed to in conviction to belonged glory of hunting scoundrel from grandcourt maple simson tilbury dimsdale in shell dormitory lay awake too strained ear at sound in court below wondered ruefully what have become of two missing comrade dig a ploughed way footsore weary through rain mud of maiden hill down have shot at glorious pace not twelve hour before thought wistfully once twice of warm dry bed in dormitory friendly voice of ally there assembled must never return there without old arthur in time of prosperity security two boy have often quarrelled often neglected one often forgotten about one casual onlooker might have said be not friend be more to one than other two boy in school ah if critic must have looked into dig heavy heart a floundered through mud night must have told different tale often enough friend seems to like ordinary friend have little tiff little reconciliation have mutual joke time honoured argument say good bye with unruffled spirit meet again with unimpassioned nod now again testing time come storm break over head thunder roll round then grip of hand tightens find that be not friend brother lightning flash reveals to what never suspected before there be something in world dearer to even than life a heart sink envy happy people who by simple trust in saviour in pervading goodness be able to face with courage life death dig stumbled on dead beat losing heart at step stopping sometimes to take breath with gasp sounded ominously like sob long hill seemed interminable there be glimmer of light anywhere to cheer clatter of horse hoof to ring hope into heart be black wet dreary what if must find abbey deserted have to walk home alone have nearly reached ruin when stumbled against two men conversing in middle of road to inexpressible relief one of be railsford mr railsford gasped boy springing upon master with suddenness made men start be that where arthur have found be all right be on top of window still ca get down till daylight be just arranging with farmer white to bring ladder dig made dash in direction of abbey gate where be going said railsford be going to hop up beside shouted dig almost beside with relief master caught firmly by arm if think of thing oakshott will get farmer white here to cart straight back to grandcourt terrible threat sobered dig at once waited impatiently till two men have made arrangement then with beating heart accompanied master to ruin be safe up where be said latter say have room to sit down back of ivy to lean against must be half drowned frozen will do good to know be here now stay where be while get on wall shout to can not hear down here dig waited listened to master scrambling up ivy feeling way on hand knee along wall to bottom of arch then heard shout arthur be there right heart leapt a shrill reply came back from height oakshott be here with shouted master be mistake about not being able to hear from level ground dig hallo what cheer dig a plainly a heard railsford what cheer howled in reply keep up pecker old man rather yelled arthur then dig begged besought railsford to allow to mount at least to where latter stood master made happy by consenting from point be easy to carry on talk there in rain through dark watch of night three have one of most profitable conversation have ever enjoyed yokel who chanced to pas hearing weird celestial voice took to heel ran mile straight off reported with ashy face trembling lip that ghost have appeared on arch of abbey a passed called to thrice have shrieked with demoniacal laughter a hurried from accursed place towards dawn rain ceased three watcher despite effort became drowsy when farmer white two of men arrived on scene with long ladder rope have to stand shout from below for minute so before railsford started into wakefulness remembered where be a for dig lay with cheek buried in wet ivy sleeping a soundly a if have be in dormitory at school be easy task to get arthur down from dizzy perch in first place be so sound asleep that be impossible to rouse from below consequently must give assistance in own rescue ladder be far too short to reach within quarter of distance of where be for long time seemed a if rope might a well have be left at home at length however by combined effort ladder be hoisted on to top of wall so elevated reached point on arch above place where stone have given way difficulty be to secure on narrow ledge in way so that must be ascended safely when finally by dint of careful adjustment rigid holding at bottom be pronounced reasonably safe dig be most eager to volunteer ascent urging that be lightest weight that four men must do more good in holding ladder lad right said farmer let go up railsford be forced to consent must have be obviously risky for heavy man to ascend rickety ladder dig rarely felt so proud happy a when skipped lightly up rung reached ivy covered masonry of arch be not difficult climb to top be a well be not for in eagerness forgot admonition of caution have received below scrambled up a recklessly a if have be ascending london tramcar heart beat a at last came upon dear old friend arthur sat sound asleep hand behind head leg hanging over edge of arch back propped in angle formed by junction of window fragment of old roof lucky for be that natural armchair for without at first fall of sleep must undoubtedly have rolled from perch into depth below dig approached gently discreetly nearly time to get up old chappie said laying hand on sleeper arm to prevent sudden start that nearly be stroke of genius have incautiously announced that chapel bell have begun to ring that must be late for call over result might have be fatal a be arthur opened eye lazily yawned serene why hullo say be that dig old man yes rather sit steady have got ladder rope marky just down there how be arthur rubbed eye teeth chattered pretty cold stiff old man how jolly of to come see mortar something slipped must get up down yelled 'd gone at last managed to get up again there have stuck how be going down now have got ladder up just below if can manage to get down so far arthur began to move stiff limb one by one by way of judging what must do dig meanwhile shouted down that be safe up arthur be right not time for try at owl said latter getting one foot up trying to rise owl be hanged said dig helping friend gingerly to foot feel like poker said arthur must care to run mile just now nobody want to what have got to do be to dig hold of ivy with hand let down will go first take care of foot awfully brickish of dig said arthur be sorry be such lout feel a if joint want oiling come on said dig descent be slow for poor arthur painful thanks to ivy dig steady steering be in due time accomplished safely top of ladder reached now then one at time shouted farmer ca go alone called dig be too stiff wo bear of unanimous opinion below be that must not even dig weight a went up have be a much a must manage finally railsford suggested that rope must be thrown up dig must tie round arthur body so support from above a came down plan be good one arthur contrived by help to lower down step into arm of rescuer dig be not long in following five minute later party be standing safe sound thankful on greensward of abbey floor farmer insisted on taking to house comforting soul body with hot breakfast in front of blazing fire after ordered out trap drove up to grandcourt first getting up bell be ringing a drove into quadrangle at sound of wheel dozen anxious watcher darted out to welcome return still more shouted down greeting from dormitory window arthur dig have be in mood for lionising might have have head turned by excitement reappearance seemed to produce be of in mood for anything going to bed for after excitement of night morning reaction have set in head ached body be done out even resisted railsford recommendation of hot bath took possession of dormitory curled up to sleep leaving fate anyone else to explain absence for next few hour to authority below a for railsford after seeing young charge stowed away in berth shook together took cold bath walked over to breakfast with grover none worse for fatigue exposure of eventful night have seen doctor yet inquired grover when meal be over suppose not be asking for particularly last night what for do know be wondering if did for imagine from manner be something important oh know have to report one of prefect yesterday for gambling doubt be in connection with perhaps know seems great pity bicker hit so badly bicker seems to have preposterous notion in head that be in way responsible for what happened to last term even wanted to bring matter up in last session of master in absence when stopped promised to return to at next oh bicker said railsford scornfully be really tired of grover be greatest pity be allowed to say what have to say at meeting will never be happy till have off mind surely must be necessary for to take notice of rhodomontade be glad be so little concerned about be afraid might be worrying railsford smiled have plenty in own house to do thanks ask be to keep peace with bicker have nothing to do with may then say anything like well suppose have better go over to doctor now report doctor received railsford coldly required full account of strange adventure of preceding night railsford felt little hurt at evident want of sympathy in story be beginning to look out for chance of escaping when doctor ponsford said wanted to see last night about felgate prefect have very unsatisfactory interview with appears to lack principle a said not to recognise responsibility in house tried to shift blame for gambling business wholly upon mill who by way flogged must not be brought to see that there be anything wrong in conduct unbecoming in senior boy think may be well to remove next term either into house mr roe meanwhile understands that doe not retain prefecture in yours be thankful for such arrangement said railsford that however be only part of what have to say to before left brought most extraordinary charge against must certainly have disregarded have not coincided strangely with similar charge made elsewhere only repeat to in order to give opportunity of repudiating have relation to outrage be committed on mr bicker last term for house still lie in disgrace stated that knew more about mystery than anyone else at grandcourt indeed gave impression from language used that actually considers be perpetrator of outrage that of course be mere wild talk of revengeful ill doer railsford laughed short uneasy laugh have doctor worded question in slightly different form might have be difficult to answer a decisively a must now be if be here to hear must say that be a absolutely wickedly false a emphatically a say to sir be sorry indeed that must have thought necessary to put question there be never anything lost said doctor drily by giving calumniated person opportunity of denying charge of sort however preposterous be perfectly satisfied to take word that have part in affair have knowledge a to who culprit be railsford coloured bit lip doctor have now put question in very form have dreaded if must only have held peace matter must be at end perhaps never to revive again must honest man hold peace excuse said in undisguised confusion what said be that imputation have anything to do with outrage myself be utterly entirely false said doctor incisively be tantamount to admitting that imputation that be sheltering real culprit be well founded at risk of being grievously misunderstood doctor ponsford replied railsford slowly nervously yet firmly must decline to answer question very well sir said doctor briskly conversation be at end for present chapter twenty three after thanks to youth strong constitution arthur dig escaped very serious consequence from night exposure at wellham abbey slept like dormouse from eight in morning to six in afternoon woke desperately hungry with shocking cold in head with inclination to get up prepare work for following day doctor came felt pulse looked at tongue listened to cough sneeze said be well out of still a assured with loud catarrhic emphasis that felt rather bad still very shaky gave leave to remain in bed for rest of day petrified where lay by suggestion of mustard poultice piece protested solemnly that malady from suffered be mental rather than physical required only rest quiet to cure whereat doctor grinned said very well have leave to stay a be till morning then if be not recovered must try mustard poultice to consternation horror after have gone suddenly remembered that to night be night appointed for first grand rehearsal of performance proposed to be given by comedian of house on eve of speech day at end of term comedian be time honoured institution at grandcourt casual visitor to school from about middle of april onwards might at time have be startled horrified by finding suddenly face to face in retired corner with youthful form undergoing most extraordinary contortion of voice countenance railsford used to be fond of recounting first experience of phenomenon be going down early one morning to field when on shady side of quadrangle encountered boy whom recognised after little scrutiny to be sir digby oakshott baronet reason why did not immediately grasp identity of so familiar personage be because sir digby body be thrown back arm be behind back leg be spread out head be thrown into air with expression master of shell have never seen there before never saw again there be one conclusion to come to baronet have gone mad must never be standing thus in public quadrangle at seven o'clock in morning supposition be immediately confirmed by beholding patient face break slowly into horrible leer mouth assume diagonal slant a brought one hand in front index finger close to nose addressed lamp post a follows when abednego jinks say thing tommy boy may take alfred david there be more in than there be in head railsford in alarm be about to hasten for professional assistance for what considered very bad case when dig catching sight of relieved inexpressibly by dropping at once into ordinary sane manner saying with blush of confusion oh mr railsford did know be there be mugging up part for comedian know be abednego jinks not much of part only can get in little gag now then railsford after what have witnessed be prepared to admit left disciple of dramatic muse to lamp post secretly hoped when performance of comedian came off might get order for stall although grandcourt house comedian be old institution have not always be equally flourishing at railsford for instance in past year have decidedly languished performance have possibly be comic be due to actor not author for scene chosen be usually stock selection from tragedy of shakespeare such for instance a death of king lear ghost scene in hamlet conspirator scene in julius caesar banquet in macbeth a soon a irrepressible wake got hold of rein a of course did old order changed with startling rapidity new director made clean sweep of shakespeare work what be fun of doing roman citizen in eton jacket white choker said sending everybody to sleep let give change make laugh a if everybody have laughed for year at roman citizen in eton jacket so hunted about made inquiry of friend who be supposed to know finally submitted to company certain screaming farce entitled after with so description informed two funny old gentleman one low comedian two funny old lady one maid of work besides few walking gentleman others sounded promising perusal of piece showed that be very amusing can not describe complication be magnificent two old gentleman one very irascible other very meek be of course enamoured of two old lady one very meek other very irascible low comedian be of course victim plague of couple took revenge by usual expedient of siding with against other being appointed heir to walking gentleman be need be said disappointed heir maid of work a be manner of such person did everybody work own part be allotted with due care discrimination two funny old gentleman be undertaken by sherriff ranger two funny old lady by dimsdale maple low comedian by sir digby oakshott maid of work by arthur herapath a for walking gentleman cabman detective et hoc genus omne be doled out to anyone who chose to take there have be no regular rehearsal yet private preparation of hole corner kind have described have be going on for week so actor have be looking forward with eagerness not to say trepidation to first rehearsal be appointed to take place evening in fourth class room in presence of wake stafford few other formidable critic of upper school great therefore be dismay when be rumoured that low comedian maid of work be on sick list with doctor certificate first impulse be to postpone date on wake representing that there be evening for ten day on must get use of room be resolved to do best must with part have read missing speech from book although house generally be excluded from rehearsal fourth form boy managed to scramble in on strength of class room in performance be to take place being own besides invited guest named above be frequently found at end of performance when gas be turned up that room be fuller of junior baby than have be when curtain rose on present occasion not being full dress rehearsal there be curtain be there anything to distinguish actor from hearer save importance of face evident nervousness with awaited signal to begin here let give reader piece of information screaming farce be ever so much more difficult to act than tragedy of shakespeare well duffer can act brutus richard third ghost of banquo be reserved only to few to be able to do justice to part of bartholomew bumblebee miss anastatia acidrop when one come to compare paltry exploit dull observation of old tragedy hero with noble wit sublime action of modern rival be not to be wondered at so happened on present occasion after be far too ambitious flight for comedian at railsford have far better have stuck to king lear in first place none of character seemed to understand what be expected of sherriff funny irascible old gentleman skulked about in back of scene tapped finger lightly on top of hat stamped foot gently with most amiable of smile on countenance one idea of irascible humour seemed to be to start few moment to leave room then stop short half way to door utter few additional remark over

by delirium at grandcourt during last two term might write to branscombe tell dilemma beseech to make confession yet what right have to take advantage of boy unconscious confession to put pressure on to make public other person le fastidious might do railsford must not alternative of course be that must in probability have to leave grandcourt if matter have rested only between doctor might have made private communication under pledge of secrecy so induced principal to let matter drop matter did not rest solely between doctor mr bicker felgate by mean be unable to fathom appeared to have learned secret be not likely to let drop indeed be evident that so far from that must like if possible to fix charge of actual complicity in outrage on railsford laughed contemptuously at notion a

acting in farce in fourth class room culprit regarded one with look of consternation did see then asked arthur see marky mr railsford mean 'd promised to want explanation arthur have business to get up then have business not to get up now shamming be honourable ought to be reason enough why oakshott must drop after delinquent dressed in silence followed master down to class room where ironical welcome of fellow by mean tended to smooth ruffled plumage however a be down cold recovered in ample time to allow of taking part in cricket practice in afternoon exercise have wonderful effect in reconciling to compulsory convalescence be sitting half working half humbugging in study at preparation time when railsford again looked in herapath said if bring cicero down to room presently will show passage marked for swift exhibition in due time arthur presented digby between have smelt rat be going to jaw bet said baronet look like wonder why always pick on for jawing why ca give other

that master have ulterior reason in inviting arthur to study did want to jaw not in manner have anticipated after going through cicero marking portion requiring special getting up for examination railsford put down pen sat back in chair arthur said there be something must like to ask be coming knew said arthur to do remember arthur last term have talk one evening about what happened to mr

have more connection with affair than father arthur be duly impressed by asseveration be precious rum thing then about thing know looked awfully fishy against what thing understand perhaps 'd better not tell said boy getting puzzled ca force to tell when know be matter of great importance to to know how anybody came to suspect thing of think will do arthur thereupon proceeded to narrate history of finding of match box sack wedge of paper with reader be already familiar considerably astonished worthy listener by business like way in appeared to have put two two together to have laid crime at railsford door nothing must satisfy boy now to go up fetch down incriminating article display in presence of late criminal to wrath amazement when went to cupboard found what have be lot of certain classical personage to find before that cupboard be bare article be nowhere to be seen dig on being charged with abstraction protested that have never set eye on when arthur told purpose for be wanted

be got to second motion something about fine art arthur laughed will try bit of fine art on vote come on old man will have look round room for trap so sallied out after peeping into forum on way to ascertain that man be safely there marched boldly up stair to study if have not be for righteousness of cause boy might have thought twice before entering anyone room in absence arthur in present temper have cast to wind scruple regarding merely a robbed lioness searching for whelp must have liked to meet man who must tell have perfect right to be where be dig for part be not prepared to raise such awkward question boy instinct have told right for one of first thing beheld on corner of window sill apparently put there hurriedly before starting for forum be brown paper parcel corresponding exactly with missing bundle be carefully tied up under string be thrust envelope addressed to mr bicker arthur whistled dig ran forward to capture lost property steady said former warily perhaps be just dodge to catch see how lie in case have to put back took necessary bearing with precaution then hurried back with prize to own study how long before forum up demanded arthur depositing parcel on table twenty minute said dig serene thing have evidently be recently tied up with new string in fresh brown paper wedge of paper match box being rolled up in middle of sack seems right said arthur now let see letter carefully slid pen holder under fold of envelope so a to open without breaking extracted letter ran a follows dear sir send three thing told of sack have initial on paper belongs to a will see be only man in house who must reach up to put match box on ledge please mention name only reason be to get justice done yours truly tf oh cad be joint exclamation of two reader a perused treacherous epistle look alive now said arthur cut down a fast a ever can fetch one of turf lying on corner of grass know what be for asked dig who felt quite out of running never mind cut away there be time to lose let anyone see dig obeyed selected one of turf in question clandestinely conveyed up to room now lend hand to wrap up said arthur see will make parcel just about size weight of sack mind how tie up double knot not bow dig began to perceive what sport be at last grinned complacently a tied up new parcel into exact counterfeit of old arthur overhauled critically pronounced right now said will write letter sat down dashed off following dig nudging vehement approval of content from behind sir be cad liar thief believe word say can tell anyone like most of know already yours truly jerry sneak be ripping exclaimed admiring dig a elegant epistle be carefully folded into original envelope after being gummed down be thrust under string of counterfeit parcel oh wish must be there to see opened may get into row for said arthur care will show up be real leg up for marky look alive now come put back in room so sallied up once more carefully replaced parcel exactly where have found then rejoicing exceedingly dodged down again seemed to politic thing just to look in at forum on way down to witness end of debate take part in division have not slightest idea what debate be about made prominent among ays cheered loudly when motion be declared to be carried by two vote felgate nodded to a passed out little guessing real meaning of affectionate smile with returned greeting so cold better youngster said to arthur look like replied arthur felgate first glance a entered room be towards corner in have left parcel have just be cording up that evening when suddenly remembered engagement at forum in hurry of discovery have carelessly left out instead of a have intended locking up however thought to be safe a happens wo send over to bicker till to morrow afternoon just before master session will be far more effective if open in brute presence after care twopenny piece if know come from not cad have mind to open letter tell mr bicker to mention name if chose just a be about to do so munger came in to see so abandoned idea locked parcel up safely in drawer felgate have a reader may have judged come to conclusion that be time to play trump card against enemy railsford reporting of to doctor have be to mix metaphor little last straw break patient camel back have have very warm uncomfortable quarter of hour with head master a know have defended on plea railsford being malefactor be not competent to judge of conduct of boy doctor have severely silenced covert accusation although taking note of sufficiently to suggest very awkward string of question put following morning to unlucky master of shell felgate however have impression that statement to doctor have missed fire being determined not wholly to cast trump card away have walked across sought interview with mr bicker estimable gentleman be considerably impressed by discovering first of that boy be author of mysterious letter last term secondly that possessed such satisfactory evidence of strange story accepted felgate statement that sole motive be credit of grandcourt relief of own conscience without too particularly inquiring into value undertook not to mention informer name in use might have to make of information to end suggested must be better for to have evidence to produce when required felgate promised to send over to next day if must suit mr bicker said must suit admirably there be to be master meeting in evening when doubt question must come up if felgate preferred not to appear might send mr bicker thing there with letter master promised to read without disclosing name of writer seemed satisfactory plan felgate hoped that in return for what be doing mr bicker must intercede with doctor to restore to prefecture mr bicker said must do interview ended felgate have not much difficulty in possessing of article arthur have exhibited to last term remembered corner of locker in have lain probably arthur have never looked at since must be very unlikely to miss now even if did felgate did care securing be easy enough for on particular evening arthur dig be roosting on big arch of wellham abbey in condition to interfere if worldly good have be ransacked remainder reader know that eventful evening be to witness one more solemnity before order for light out cut short brief career arthur dig having returned to study held grave consultation over sack match box wedge of paper 'd better hide said dig where ca find again not safe said arthur 'd better burn burn said dig astounded by audacious proposition then give up evidence good job too better for marky have done good so far be true dig having turned matter over said be game conspirator therefore locked door piled up fire be long since study have glowed with cheerful blaze resin wheel flared crackled spat a if be in jest be enjoying flame blazed up chimney a though be racing who must be first to carry joke outside match box paper wedge vanished almost instantaneously old bone dry sack rose grandly to occasion flared away merrily inch by inch until quarter of hour after illumination have begun last glowing vestige of have skipped up after spark boy be sitting complacently contemplating glorious finale when loud knock came at door shout in ainger voice of let in what be row cried arthur shovelling ash under grate while dig with wonderful presence of mind whipped out toasting fork stuck half loaf on end of open door cried ainger accompanying demand with kick made timber creak chimney on fire arthur rushed opened door while dig once more with wonderful presence of mind seized up bath bucket emptied on fire young idiot shouted ainger a rushed in half blinded with smoke raised by dig coup de theatre will have house on fire bring jug with of up to roof snatched up jug with pale countenance followed captain up to skylight a emerged on to roof be horrified to see chimney belching forth spark smoke with unmistakable fierceness fortunately roof be flat chimney pot accessible content of three jug rapidly damped ardour of rising flame in five minute after ainger first knock at door danger be over luckily happened to see from smedley room opposite said captain have be cooking for supper laughed be evident captain be not going to visit misadventure severely on head something good said arthur guess will be little overdone now thanks awfully ainger for helping out might have got into jolly row if have be for might dig departed peacefully to bed leaving ainger to wonder what be use of being captain of house when main occupation be to put out fire kindled by junior be patted on back by in return chapter five blow fall good friend said monsieur lablache be in great trouble be sorry for monsieur have looked in a sometimes did to breakfast in friend study two men one strong other weak still clung to one in odd sort of friendship railsford protection have improved monsieur position in school not little boy of own house be more tolerant of foreign peculiarity of other master taking to heart chivalrous example of junior colleague have begun to think better of unpopular detention master to recognise good quality in to hitherto have be blind if monsieur must only have got out of head that be born diplomatist there must not have be more harmless master in grandcourt be sorry for good friend repeated will be brave really lablache give man appetite for breakfast thing look very cheerful know what special cause for lamentation have bad lie will be told of at master meeting to night said frenchman take courage mon ami will be there have idea what lie be to be asked railsford who perhaps be not a jubilant a might have be at last cheering promise meester beekaire so have heard desire to accuse of having assaulted be absurd overhear say to meester rogers in master hall that have evidence have evidence ho ho be absurd railsford have not much difficulty after talk with arthur last night in guessing where evidence be likely to be whence proceeded if be whole of trouble have to face must have afforded to laugh with monsieur doctor question still rang in ear that must not get round avoid bicker doubt belief be right said a say monsieur be absurd wish have be allowed to say what wanted at last meeting when be there ami must be unfair let say to face stand up say to to face be one what call one very big lie well will do best said railsford smiling be wretched business altogether be strange be secret still have thought often friend railsford sometimes think of boy sometimes of boy have even said to myself why do look only in meester railsford house why must not be for see boy of house why must not be perhaps one of meester beekaire own boy hate wish branscombe must come back think if did must ask railsford shifted chair uneasily suddenly changed conversation how be little girl asked poor monsieur be easy to turn from subject by question like eye glistened at mere mention of name a sat there talked about with portrait lying on breakfast table before mr bicker branscombe even railsford vanished out of sight world held nothing just three little absent girl of far away in beloved france railsford be tempted more than once during day to absent boldly from master meeting in evening allow matter to take course chose in absence after said to fatal question will be put sooner later then must go down probably said bolder spirit within keep foot railsford brave fellow a long a can so braced up to ordeal walked across at appointed time calm collected determined to die game if die must be full meeting to everybody surprise most of railsford dr ponsford be not present head master a have said have greatest belief in holding aloof from settlement of question must possibly be settled without one might have supposed that present question be one must require particular handling ultimately must no doubt meanwhile must let lieutenant sift various issue raised send up to only last point for adjudication railsford be disappointed on whole for one wish be to have matter settled once for to know worst before went to bed that night mr roe grover one two more of friend came forward to greet a entered a if nothing be about to take place did not feel actor enough to keep up farce retired to back seat at first opportunity waited impatiently for meeting to begin usual routine business seemed interminable little question of procedure discipline be brought up talked over have very little interest to once when found opinion be being directly invited on matter have with confusion to admit that have not gathered what question be at last mr roe said turning over agenda paper disposes of ordinary business only other matter be personal question adjourned from last meeting whereupon everyone settled in place expectantly mr bicker rose briskly made speech mr roe gentleman said be sorry once again to trouble meeting with affair of so very unimportant person a myself can only repeat what have said before have right to take credit for only motive in doing so be clear duty to grandcourt removal from large number of innocent boy of stigma under at present suffer here someone said hear hear everybody agreed that mr bicker have begun well in february last continued be unfortunate enough to meet with personal violence while passing door of adjoining house in dark be seized from behind enveloped in sack be tied over head shoulder in manner gagged rendered powerless to move arm foot be also tied together in condition be dragged into cupboard under stair there left for night impression be that two three strong person be engaged in outrage although pinioning be performed by only one be released in morning by colleague in whose house have be attacked who with senior boy untied hand expressed a greatly astonished indignant at what have befallen fully believed at time protestation on colleague part be sincere here mr bicker be beginning to get aggressive back of one two of railsford friend particularly monsieur back went up that same morning gentleman doctor came challenged house to produce offender offender boy in house be called over questioned separately said one denied not only that have done that have knowledge of who have member of house except master of house be thus questioned master be not challenged house be disgraced by doctor from time to secret have be carefully kept capital have be made out of supposed misfortune of house to set on foot several ambitious scheme depended for success on continued isolation of house from rest of school master of house be prime mover in scheme in consequence decidedly interested in preserving new state of affair now gentleman may ask why make preamble hear hear from monsieur order order from chairman do so because feel have right to take for granted that know what be nevertheless notorious fact in grandcourt now gentleman appears that colleague acquiescence in disgrace of house be not shared by of boy certainly not by one whose name be not at liberty to mention whom can speak of honourably a being actuated by disinterested motif in securing justice to myself be matter of small moment in removing slur from good name of grandcourt boy took trouble to make inquiry shortly after event succeeded in getting together evidence when produce think will convince little doubt remains a to identity of real culprit must have preferred if informant might have be present here to state own case be naturally reluctant to come forward have however described to what nature of evidence be have full authority for making use of information now in first place claim to have found sack in be enveloped be left on floor of cupboard where have be imprisoned after release sack tell bear initial mr correspond with initial of midland railway dryly observed grover amid smile roused mr bicker considerably sir initial mr correspond with name of master of house in be assaulted belong to mark railsford railsford sat with lip drawn contemptuously during announcement failed to make impression on meeting generally speaker have expected went on in second place found that door close by when not propped open have be held open by twisted piece of paper on being unrolled be found to be part of newspaper addressed to mark railsford esquire grandcourt made rather more impression than last except on railsford who still faced accuser scornfully in third place match box be discovered on ledge above door placed there to judge by freedom from dust very recently ask to notice three thing in connection with gentleman match be struck while be being dragged into cupboard match found on floor that morning corresponds exactly with match in box placed up on ledge finally height of ledge from ground show that must only have be placed there by someone over six foot high only person of height in house be master mr mark railsford dead silence followed master present wondered how railsford must still sit so indifferent unmoved now gentleman continued mr bicker after having allowed due interval for last shot to go home must not be justified in repeating assertion unless be also prepared to lay before proof on assertion be based therefore requested informant to let have have done parcel here took up brown paper parcel from seat beside containing article have mentioned be placed in hand just a came to meeting have not even examined so that be sure will do credit of believing that when place just a be in hand mr chairman can not be charged with having tampered with evidence in way here handed parcel up to mr roe amid dead silence have not better open asked chairman who evidently did not like business sir request will do so that mr railsford will confront content first in hand not mine there be letter here addressed to said mr roe please read that also said mr bicker declining to take roe knitted brow tore open envelope brow went up with start a eye fell on opening word read letter through then turning to mr bicker said letter be not intended for reading aloud mr bicker yes be insist on reading mr chairman if insist will do think must be wiser to put in pocket read mr chairman repeated mr bicker excitedly mr roe accordingly read in voice betrayed emotion sir be cad liar thief believe word say can tell anyone like most of know already yours truly jerry sneak ' effect of letter may be more easily imagined than expressed audience received first with astonishment then with consternation finally a light dawned in on mind with laughter railsford alone looked serious bewildered a for mr bicker face turned white looked for moment a if must spring at mr roe throat snatched letter from chairman hand looked at then stared round on amused face of colleague have be hoaxed fear said mr roe mr bicker said nothing pointed to parcel be to open asked chairman yes yes said master hoarsely mr roe obeyed disclosed turf amid general laugh in railsford mr bicker joined latter have by time lost self control glared round like baited animal then rounding suddenly on railsford exclaimed be doing be at bottom of railsford vouchsafed reply contemptuous shrug be in humour to see joke disgust be one sensation order please said chairman meeting if be to be of value must be conducted without quarrelling mr bicker may consider unpleasant affair now at end no shouted mr bicker have be insulted care by whom matter be not at end not till have received answer from railsford here to question let get up like man say did not attack like coward last term allow blame suspicion to fall on others let even get up declare that doe not know anything about affair defy to do dare not silence followed violent tirade everyone turned to railsford sat motionless pale with eye on accuser have anything to say mr railsford will consider matter at end have nothing to say said master of shell sitting except refuse to answer question very good quite right said monsieur springing to foot when meester beekaire can speak like gentleman here chairman interrupted addressed question to mr railsford said can understand decline under present circumstance to make reply to accusation may suggest must be most unfortunate if have to adjourn disagreeable question again hear hear imagine can be very easily terminated to night be ready be sure to make allowance for gentleman who be suffering from irritation of practical joke question be undoubtedly offensively put mr railsford a say be entitled to refuse to answer ask in order to close painful controversy finally to allow a chairman of meeting to repeat question myself so that may have opportunity a doubt desire of formally placing on record denial of charge have be brought against railsford gasped inwardly long expected blow be coming felt be use to run from longer question resolve to two first be there foundation for charge that committed in way participated in assault on mr bicker last term second be there truth in statement that know who culprit culprit be mr bicker have stated question correctly yes growled mr bicker let answer if can one now turned to railsford who rose slowly to foot fixed eye full on chairman friend thought have rarely seen finer looking man than appeared at moment looked forward with pleasure to applauding denial greeting a finally clear of odious suspicion under have laboured for so long reply be brief clear mr roe gentleman first question answer with emphatic negative second question answer at bombshell exploding in hall must not have caused greater consternation astonishment than avowal grover monsieur other friend turned pale wondered if be dreaming others frowned mr bicker smiled knew said knew mr roe said can hardly have heard question properly mr railsford may repeat heard perfectly well said railsford be aware of very serious nature of reply do give reason for refusal none at think said mr grover rising gallantly to protect friend must be well if meeting adjourned submit there be further business before oppose said mr bicker who have recovered calmness rapidly propose mr chairman that meeting adjourn for five minute while head master be invited to come assist decision be seconded if may be allowed said railsford must like to support proposal after of course be agreed to for five minute meeting stood suspended railsford friend utilised interval by begging to reconsider position if possible put right by stating knew thanked said be impossible finally withdrew again to own seat waited anxiously for doctor arrival in due time head master arrived with tolerable notion of object of unusual summons mr roe briefly explained what have taken place reported circumstance under head master authority be now invited for once doctor looked genuinely distressed despite rebuff have for week looked upon master of shell a one of most promising men on staff deplored infatuation now promised to bring connection with grandcourt to abrupt end there be alternative mr railsford said have heard mr roe statement be correct quite correct sir persist in refusal to say whether have knowledge a to who person be who assaulted mr bicker can not answer question know that inference from such refusal be that know name refuse to give up in other word that be shielding evil doer can not answer question on subject doctor ponsford be aware of position feel have course open to place resignation in hand once more poor monsieur started up oh no have good reason be not bad must not leave doctor motioned to be silent then addressing railsford said resignation of course follows a natural consequence of position adopt be better that must offer than must have to ask for will take week to consider duty in matter meeting be now at end chapter twenty six thing go well with mr

better do be to get up whacking petition to pony said have got right to do if fellow will sign ca well let go question arose who be to write petition after discussion be resolved to call amiable stafford into council at once suggested that if petition be to be of weight must come from entire house with captain name at head of list deputation be told off forthwith to wait upon ainger be not very encouraging said there must be harm in trying undertook to draw up petition sign name first underneath petition be short business like to dr ponsford sir boy of mr railsford house have heard with great sorrow that be to leave grandcourt consider have done more for house than other master feel must be greatest loss to of if be to go doe not know be sending hope will have favourable consideration make possible for to stay among in two day document received signature of boy in house except felgate munger who contrived to evade ainger took trouble to press for signature indeed

head boy in form represented in house to convey petition to doctor arthur not being head shell boy in house felt very sore to be left out prophesied sort of failure to undertaking in consequence however be consoled vastly by fight with tilbury same afternoon tilbury though signatory to petition be unlucky enough to brag in hearing of comrade that one reason have signed be because believed railsford have have something to do with paying out of mr bicker last term be friend to house in consequence whereupon arthur crimson in face requested to step outside receive biggest hiding have ever have in life tilbury obeyed although combat be not quite so decided a arthur have boasted disposed of libel have originated made clear to house that who knew best at rate be now a firmly resolved to defend master innocence a last term have be to glory in guilt doctor received deputation politely allowed ainger to read petition list of name without interruption when ceremony be over said quietly only fault have to find with be that have presented petition to instead of to mr railsford be perfectly open for mr railsford to with draw resignation in case must fall to to settle question of remaining here must be time for to present petition be not very consoling doctor manner discouraged further explanation ainger therefore left petition lying on table withdrew men to report doubtful success of mission to comrade week wore on in two day railsford short reprieve must be up have already begun to get together of thing preparatory to packing up have written out careful paper of memoranda for use of successor have allowed work of house to be a little a possible disturbed by coming event have even hurt monsieur feeling by peremptory manner in discouraged representation being made by master with view to avert departure have of course sent plain unvarnished account of position to special correspondent happily reached at same time a highly coloured decidedly alarming

in shielding evil doer must remain same now letter might spoil everything must at rate postpone railsford departure might give opportunity of reinstating for good at grandcourt mr bicker be in quandary be by nature vindictive jealous fussy man with low opinion of everybody extreme obstinacy in own opinion be not naturally dishonest man be only when other passion rushed out strongly in one direction integrity stood on other side that honour suffered shipwreck went by board did so now for mr bicker having thought over situation deliberately put letter into pocket went about usual avocation a if nothing have happened amount of excuse rushed in to assistance after there have be three culprit one of belonged to accused house railsford doubt be shielding own boy branscombe

did railsford made remark on unequal conflict did what must to assist sufferer reduce countenance to normal dimension arthur be far le concerned at wound than at moral injury have suffered in being so completely punished in encounter feared railsford must entertain lower opinion of in consequence if 'd have only known be coming must have made hotter for said only got head in chancery early though lashed out must took out of marky do mind feeling if rib be right sort of fancied one of have gone rib however be there badly a be bruised railsford be able to pronounce that bone be broken greatly relieved boy master helped wounded warrior to undress then assisted up to dormitory where after carefully tucking up advising dig to turn in too left returned to room impulse be immediately to summon felgate mete out to exemplary chastisement for dastardly act on second thought remembered that be rather must be to morrow no longer master of house besides much a chastisement might have relieved own feeling must leave house everyone in in much same position a heretofore putting everything together decided that last official act must be to report matter to doctor next morning leave to deal with having come to conclusion strapped up portmanteau sent order to jason for cab to morrow be meditating early retirement to bed when knock sounded at door three prefect entered seemed long while since

railsford a uttered word seemed to forget how soon must have to say instead of have hardly realised yet what that meant will try hard said ainger what wanted to say besides letting know how sorry be be to ask if be really necessary for to go be there way of getting out of none at can see said railsford fellow say know who be assaulted mr bicker last term wo tell perhaps be to save fellow in house from being expelled dear fellow said railsford let spoil last evening by talking about miserable affair ca tell anything at can only ask to believe have good reason for what be doing ought to be good reason if price have to pay be to leave grandcourt of be evidently use trying to draw further a first bed bell sounded shortly afterwards withdrew after cordial dismal farewell will see again in morning before go said prefect walked away abstracted downcast be very well for to say keep work up when be gone how be to do be pivot on work have be turning without what chance be there of keeping house together for day come in here minute fellow said ainger a reached captain door must do something to stop be very feeble observation to make said barnworth be that what want to come in here for hang barnworth there be time for chaff at present what want to say be have tried possible mean of finding out who scragged bicker last term think so said stafford one in house have denied if be one of fellow be probably biggest liar among mean felgate said ainger munger said barnworth be not felgate said ainger for have burnt finger in trying to fix on railsford be real culprit may depend on 'd have kept very quiet munger have kept quiet said barnworth munger why be fool coward must never have done thing let ask will tell why mentioned never thought of now other day happened to be saying at dinner to somebody that affair be going to be cleared up at last that doctor have be in consultation with bicker railsford about evening before know be what be told must probably come across be embellishment of own with policeman point fellow out munger be sitting opposite when began to speak have just filled tumbler with water be going to drink half way through suddenly stopped put tumbler down with such crack on table that spilt water on to cloth did think anything of at time occurs to now well said ainger be off chance staff do mind bringing one thing to do said barnworth while messenger be gone be to frighten out of nothing else will do well said ainger if think so must back up though after long interval stafford returned to say that munger be in bed refused to get up good said barnworth like now staff amiable old boy will kindly go to again say that prefect be waiting for in captain study that if be not here in five minute will have to do without fancy be true be added appealing to colleague let see if doe draw if doe depend upon there be something in tumbler barnworth be right in le than five minute munger appeared half dressed decidedly uneasy in manner what do want for demanded with attempt at bluster what do mean by not coming when sent for when know perfectly well what be wanted for what be wanted for asked munger glancing nervously round know well enough munger how do know till tell snarled boy if doe know said barnworth to ainger significantly must do a proposed will go get paper be ready for in minute meaningless speech have remarkable effect on munger stared first at one prefect then at other when barnworth rose a if to leave room said wait do what be want to ask know that a well a do be going to say what know not know how got to know anything about began munger be plot against want said ainger sternly what want to know be did do if not who else be in of course must do must strong a be helped then have nothing to do with scragging said munger oh say ainger be going to get expelled surely do let off time be not head master will have to ask that only chance be to make clean breast of at once what be did only opened door of boot box helped drag in have nothing to do with scragging branscombe did clipstone hung to leg needed self control of three prefect to refrain from exclamation of astonishment at wonderful disclosure be telling truth demanded ainger be swear never even knew what meant to do till hour before be clipstone idea owed money for betting have pull on made do swear never touched bicker except to help pull in now one question more be there anyone else in just three nobody a sure a stand here very well can go now will have to tell doctor of course there be knowing what will do be be best chance to make clean breast of while have opportunity wretched munger departed to bed not to sleep must not conceive how railsford first then three prefect must have discovered deeply hidden secret not word about have escaped own lip branscombe be away clipstone scarcely anyone in railsford house ever saw secret be out what kept munger awake night be shame remorse fear lest must be expelled perhaps worse arrested three prefect sat late talking over wonderful discovery be good a far a go said barnworth doe clear up question how railsford got to hear of what motive have be in shielding criminal ca have be on munger account for two have be at war term suppose since affair have exchanged two word with branscombe clipstone think said captain now do know about might go ask be brilliant suggestion went railsford be in bed asleep visitor important a be business have not hardihood to arouse be reluctantly obliged to postpone explanation till morning even then seemed destined to be thwarted for railsford have gone for bathe in river only returned in time for call over when of course there be opportunity for private conference a soon a breakfast be over determined to catch in room put end to suspense there then ala not five minute before arrived railsford have gone out time a cooke informed to doctor seemed fatality who be to say whether next move might be to quit grandcourt without even giving chance only thing to do be to go catch at doctor said ainger have right to go at least have to report munger serene said barnworth better for to go alone must only put pony back up if went for once in life ainger felt that there be dignity connected with captaincy of house for once in life must have liked to transfer dignity to shoulder own put bold face on marched across to doctor perhaps will only make worse for railsford said to pony will think precious rum of to have let two term go by without finding secret out then when suit to find getting hold of in hour so be precious rum if railsford have known name along kept quiet be not likely to make thing better for that have discovered on own account anyhow be bound to report thing like at once be barely possible may turn something up for railsford a crossed quadrangle cab drove in set down tall elderly gentleman who after looking about advanced towards prefect said can direct to head master house yes sir said ainger be going there myself be way be often stranger made so early call at grandcourt fine old building said gentleman how many house be there eight said ainger whose do belong to railsford be behind be mr bicker must be father of one of bicker fellow thought ainger that one next to ours replied gentleman looked up at house in interested way then relapsed into silence walked gravely with guide to doctor doctor waiting room be not infrequently tenanted by more than one caller on business at hour of morning for between nine ten be at home to master prefect ill conducted boy not few of latter knew by painful experience that good deal of serious business be often crowded into short space of time morning however there be only one occupant when ainger gentleman be ushered in occupant be railsford why ainger said master scarcely noticing stranger did not expect here what be come for to report boy one for what be bad case be munger sir for being one of party who assaulted bicker last term railsford started be odd thing that gentleman although back be turned did so too how did discover said master ainger briefly explained gentleman evidently disturbed in mind walked to window when conference between other two have ended latter turned abruptly said excuse accidentally overheard just now mention matter in be very much interested in fact be about that be here to see dr ponsford at present at moment doctor entered room other two naturally gave way to visitor who accordingly advanced greeted head master allow to introduce dr ponsford dare say remember name be branscombe know of course painful business on have come hope mr branscombe son be worse must be sorry to lose looked upon a promising boy gentleman looked hard at doctor surely say to spare feeling dr ponsford of course understand son can never return here be that so be truly sorry must be last to wish to return to school in name have be so disgraced be doctor turn to look astonished disgraced branscombe be always one of model boy until last term said father understand said doctor surely dr ponsford know by time son offence attempt to excuse voluntarily took only right step to take in position by confessing pardon said doctor still understand what confession do refer to have not mr bicker communicated content of son letter to written two day ago must have received yesterday morning in boy confessed that assisted by two others have be author of outrage on mr bicker last term be deeply repentant wish by confession to put right mischief have resulted from act surely mr bicker have shown letter have shown mentioned be possible boy be so anxious restless about affair promised to come down see fully expecting that long before now must have be made acquainted with everything must trouble to send for mr bicker certainly said doctor then turning to ainger railsford said must two come again later on on way ainger will ask mr bicker to come here excuse doctor said mr branscombe must much prefer if two gentleman remained believe in fact that although know have come to see on same business have perhaps railsford began doctor when visitor broke in railsford be railsford why to be sure now look at how ungrateful must have thought slipped away so suddenly that day when mr branscombe arrived that in excitement anxiety scarcely have time to look at much le to thank indeed be only lately son told how devotedly have tended break heart now to think that of person have suffered almost more than anybody by what did surely sir mr bicker showed letter have not seen heard of said railsford know what say son have now confessed have known since time of illness dr ponsford be at liberty now to explain may do so certainly said doctor sternly railsford thereupon gave account of boy sudden illness of accidental manner in have learned from boy delirious talk of own guilt guilt of confederate must not regard secret so acquired a sacred said even though by keeping be actually shielding criminal must have be greater traitor to betray than to shield may say sir put in ainger at point that prefect in house last night received confession from munger corresponds exactly with what mr branscombe say except did not mention name of other two culprit said mr branscombe son did not even name to munger be not so particular say clipstone suggested affair assisted branscombe to carry out while held light helped drag mr bicker into boot box be what have come to report to now sir added to head master dr ponsford looked half stunned with cascade of revelation explanation then went up to railsford took hand be thankful indeed that have happened now in time few hour more must have come too late to prevent great injustice to railsford ainger go for mr bicker come back with mr bicker have tolerable inkling of what awaited when found confronted with overwhelming evidence be crowded that morning into doctor waiting room hauled down colour without even coming to close quarter yes said sullenly did keep back letter considered better for grandcourt everyone mr railsford must go than old affair must be settled after be person chiefly interested in if did choose to do what must vindicate have right to do so opinion be that there will be peace at grandcourt while mr railsford be here if be now to remain will consider duty to resign hope not mr bicker said railsford now that unhappy secret be cleared up why must forget past work together for future promise for myself house to do best thank said mr bicker dryly offer be tempting one be not good enough good morning late afternoon mr bicker drove away in cab have come to take mr railsford be occasion for rejoicing to nobody for everybody agreed with railsford that must have be possible even yet to make fresh start work together for good of school a mr bicker thought otherwise one complained of for leaving cab came on following day for clipstone whose departure be witnessed with rather more regret because be good cricketer not quite a bad fellow a often tried to make out expulsion be salutary warning to one two who have looked up to a model amongst to munger who transferred with heavy bad mark against name to mr roe house thought over former way tried a well a cad of temper can do to improve in future jason surely be making fortune fast for very next day yet one more cab drove into square after
