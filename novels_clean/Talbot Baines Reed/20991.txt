adopt stronger measure than mere persuasion in order to clear of embarrassment dropping rein flinging arm vehemently back managed to dislodge assailant though not without dislodging at same time long somewhat painful creditor meeting down in waggonette be consequence mare whose patience have be gradually evaporating during strange journey conscious of riot behind feeling rein dropping loosely over tail took whole matter very much to heart showed disapproval of whole proceeding by taking to heel bolting straight away business meeting inside stood forthwith adjourned with scared face boy struggled to foot holding on to rail of box seat peered over to ascertain cause of alarming diversion be bolt said richardson only one of three who retained wit enough to think speak hang on fellow will try get rein help up a well a swaying of vehicle must allow helped hoist up on to box for long time effort to catch rein be in vain once twice seemed a if nothing must save from being pitched off

said be right if can only guide chapter two how hero fall out yet remain friend mountjoy house have narrow escape that afternoon of losing three of most promising pupil boy by mean realised peril of situation indeed after first alarm finding that by clinging tightly to rail of box seat must support on foot on floor of swinging vehicle heathcote coote began almost to enjoy be rather sorry one two of templeton boy be not at hand to see how mountjoy did thing richardson however with rein in hand utterly powerless to check headlong career of mare to do anything guide took more serious view of situation heartily wished drive be at end be flat road way to mountjoy steep hill to breathe runaway ploughed field to curb ardour be narrow road too so narrow that for two vehicle to pas one be necessary for one of two to draw up carefully at very verge a verge in present case meant edge of rather steep embankment prospect be not altogether cheering one for inexperienced boy who if knew very little about driving knew quite well that everything depended on own nerve coolness richardson not only have head knew how to keep with rein tightly clutched in hand with foot firmly pressed against footboard with sharp eye out over mare ear grim twitch on determined mouth went over chance in own mind if go on like will get to mountjoy in hour what pace be bound to smash up before get there perhaps fellow have better try jump for hallo lucky did go over stone wonder if must pull up if got on back might kick up smash trap wonder if will pull up go over bank what tom tom will have to run

something on road be in for now either smash over bank hallo there be gate open last inward exclamation be caused by sight of open gate distance ahead through rough cart track branched off from road towards sand hill on left richardson with instinct of desperation seized upon a only way of escape from peril threatened look out fellow cried hang on tight on right side while turn jump well out if go over watched breathlessly a came towards gate vehicle be meeting own be about equal distance from place be clear fate must be settled in le than minute richardson waved to driver of approaching cart to pull up at same time edged mare a far a must on to off side of road so a to give wide turn in now for said to pulling left rein if do will give up driving mare perhaps weary perhaps perplexed at sight of cart in front perhaps ready for new diversion obeyed lead swerved off at gate for moment waggonette tottered on left wheel for weight of two passenger on other side must have caught gate post shattered to atom in narrow passage a be cleared peril by inch then plunging on to soft rough track capsized gently mare landing three occupant yard two off with nose in mud be undignified end to heroic drive richardson a picked up cleared mud from eye felt half disappointed that bone be broken joint dislocated after coote did certainly contribute grain of consolation by announcing that believed one of leg be broken even hope of glory be short lived for young hero finding one at leisure to assist to foot rose by walked distance to grass bank where must sit down examine for extent of injury wal young squire said voice at dick side a young gentleman found eyesight enough to look about have done time owner of voice be driver of cart tone look with made remark be anything

rattling bone of rider by mild attempt at trot otherwise showing sign of renewing former more energetic protest in manner after weary not altogether refreshing journey three jaded tightly packed hero came to standstill at door of mountjoy house where one after other slid sadly from perch addressed to satisfying of mr ashford natural curiosity only hoping interview must not be protracted so defer for long supper to eagerly looked forward why what be said matron where be waggonette tom chimed in mr ashford appearing at same moment please sir said dick did wait for tom drove home there be little

mr ashford a supper be no longer pending a night rest have intervened boy be rather more disposed to enter into detail failed to satisfy mr ashford that be not to blame for what have occurred be le

lost must in justice to other boy punish under circumstance will not cane till end of term must of lose hour play between twelve one mr ashford paused perhaps expected outburst of gratitude perhaps did exactly know what to say next in case found have made mistake boy with instinct not certainly of self righteousness of common justice felt that have have punishment enough already for sin mr ashford took account of few second when waggonette be dashing through gate reeling to fall reckoned a nothing weary jolt home indignity of supper last night suspense of early morning made allowance

chance be be snob for doing if doe unconsciously a dick did here then misfortune of master by mean mean bliss of boy dick felt anything blissful a stalked moodily to schoolroom that morning growled injury to ally mr ashford a soon a first burst of temper have evaporated like honest sensible man sat down reviewed situation occurred to on reviewing that have made mistake be of course extremely painful humiliating to have to acknowledge once acknowledged must have be far more humiliating to mr ashford sense of honour to persist in summoned boy once more to presence trooped in like three prisoner brought up on remand to hear final sentence master mouth twitched nervously half repented of ordeal have set before said just now richardson that punishment proposed to inflict on be not fair yes sir think so replied dick simply think so too said mr ashford equally simply will say no more about now can go boy gaped at in mingled admiration bewilderment can go repeated master richardson took hasty survey of companion countenance said will cane instead please sir richardson must not be fair richardson made one more effort please sir think deserve something people always get desert in

bother that rope said never saw say be rather small one for big boat be be said dick walking round to stern of boat in question hallo say georgie look here georgie looked in direction of dick finger read word thomas white templeton on stern of boat boy whistled then dick marched resolutely up to bow over thwart in anchor rope be hitched in loop tom white must have be drunk when anchored boat said dick will never hold if wind get up good job too said heathcote so think said dick thoughtfully say georgie added with finger playing on end of loop tom white frightful cad be rather thief too must think so must serve jolly well right if lost boat deserve to have boat at knot said dick slipping loop must hold against single lurch why come undone in fellow hand end dropped idly on floor of boat a spoke heathcote nodded think of cad having robbed two junior like collared mother photograph too brute said dick taking friend arm walking on talked longer of thomas white admired moonlight wondered how soon tide must be up speculated a to whether there be breeze getting up off land once turned back glanced at black hull lying still aground with tide yard away yet then thought trot must warm up

lay awake felt heathcote hand nudging say dick said latter wind got up do hear shut up georgie be just asleep nemesis handed in last cheque to hero after chapel next morning in doctor study will spare reader harrowing detail of serious interview suffice to say that dormitory fag be right mr partlett be spared trouble of packing up two young gentleman wardrobe emerged from study wiser sadder men knew more about property of certain flexible wood than have ever dreamed of before also felt marked men in high quarter with blot on new boy scutcheon must take heap of virtue to efface by george said dick afternoon got hot too hot georgie think winter might have let down rather easier said georgie there be pause be windy last night asked dick rather said georgie anything new down town must hear anything hum wonder what that beast done with mother photograph say georgie what howling brute be be deserves anything strange if so that neither of young hero went to police station informed against man on contrary went up on to cliff after school scanned bay from headland to headland doubtless lost in wonder of deep wishing very much must tell what wild wave be saying a to whereabouts of martha chapter thirteen scylla charybdis perhaps epoch of schoolboy life be more critical especially if be of open hearted nature of dick heathcote than immediately follows first punishment at hand of law on one hand have sense of disgrace attends personal chastisement a well a discomfort of forfeited good name feeling of being down on black book of school authority generally on other hand be sure to meet with certain number of companion who if exactly admire what have done sympathise with in what have suffered sympathy at time be sweet seducing little too much sympathy will make feel martyr little martyrdom will make feel hero once hero on account of misdeed need stout heart steady head to keep from going one step further becoming professional evil doer ending fool own worst enemy dick heathcote ran serious risk of being shunted on to road to ruin after escapade of grandcourt match former discovered that popularity with den be by mean impaired by adversity in fact jumped at one bound to hero stage of ordeal be boy of flesh blood sympathy be sweet salve for smarting flesh blood after first burst of contrition pleased to hear fellow say hard line on old man not in hundred must have cheeked way did pleased too to see boy smaller than look round a passed whisper something made companion turn round too dick grew fond of small boy a term went on pleased still more to be taken notice of by few bigger boy to find claimed by hooker duffield a crony to be bantered by aesthetic wrangham patronised by stout bull made go over adventure of memorable day often in mind think that after be bad day sport that though said so who must have managed thing fairly well got money worth money worth however reminded of lost half sovereign mother photograph reflection usually pulled up short in reminiscence heathcote in more philosophical dismal way have peril pledge gave help through difficulty on contrary encouraged growing discontent dismals again said one evening cane of winter must be stiff one if cut up like winter always doe lay on thick to kid though said wrangham who happened to be present licking be in inverse ratio to size of licked did comfort heathcote to hear case discussed in such learned mathematical term be consolation got dick be in far too exalted frame of mind to give much assistance what doe matter said recklessly mean to fret so matter ended for present two friend be bearing ordeal in two such different way that might almost have parted company have there not be common interest of still greater importance to bind together one day heathcote came up from tub at canter caught friend at chapel door dick said be out bill be sticking on one of post by pier be wet so took off dick read l reward lost stolen from mooring on templeton strand on th inst lugger rigged sailing boat named martha one giving information leading to recovery of boat if stolen to conviction of thief will receive above reward police station templeton dick handed ominous paper back with long face here take did pull off post for thought 'd like to see said heathcote putting despised document into pocket so did thanks georgie did steal boat did rather not not like what did to money be downright robbery with violence added heathcote of course be really tom white fault boat got adrift be so carelessly anchored yes puff of wind must have slipped that knot there be pause be plain doe guess anything said dick not likely be not likely to say anything about if doe of course not must mean transportation for after one may have gone off with boat ca tell be there all right when saw be dick looked at friend must delude up to certain point plea must quite wash most likely will find may have drifted round to birkens place like that will be right georgie thought of unlucky boat haunted peace that tom white have only got desert never questioned must have be more comfortable if loop have slipped day went on still tidings reached bill faced wherever went once a passed boat house with crowd of other fellow received shock by seeing tom white sitting smoking on bench looking contemplatingly out to sea there be tom white said one of group say shouted have found boat tom tom looked up scanned group hero heart be in boot a eye met to relief did not know half tipsy man on dark night be not good hand at remembering face found be young gentleman said hard line hope will get back said boy say do think one stole may be may be not replied boatman jolly rum thing about boat said spokesman of party a boy continued walk expect got adrift somehow said know said first be speaking to bobby about say think be stolen fancy have got clue to fellow heathcote stumbled for apparent reason at particular moment be quite amusing to see concern on dick face a went to rescue jolly low trick continued boy who appeared to interest so deeply in tom loss if one really took boat away tom will be ruined who do think went off with asked say be rather good at running thing down be police do recollect way bowled out fellow who tried to burn boat house last year got six month police gossip be so alarming to two hero that gave up taking walk along beach retired to privacy of school boundary where there be lack of occupation indoor out to relieve monotony of life week after grandcourt match boy called braider came up to dick asked to speak to braider be in fourth dick knew of a racketty roystering sort of fellow very popular with own set thought something of by den on account of recent offence against monitorial authority say said to dick confidentially what do say to belonging to club what club asked dick scenting new distinction getting light headed in consequence will promise not to go telling everybody said braider be called beociables be jolly enough lot only twenty of have supper concert once week thing be be awfully select job to get into name be mentioned other day fancy 'd get in suppose georgie heathcote be in said dick rather not said other mistaking meaning 'd have chance be not bad fellow said dick must mind if be on well there be two vacancy what do say for one do know other fellow most of braider repeated string of name among be of few well known hero of fifth fourth be jolly fellow said braider back up one like one o'clock be plucky show up at grandcourt made think of having if join will just be in time for next concert what do say dick

be always close run do think there must be chance for young heathcote doubt might try when be in ta ta old man mum word dick spent troubled week be uncomfortable with heathcote in whom be bursting to confide be uneasy too in meeting few member of sociable whom knew felt that be watching critically with view to election next thursday be vindictive in presence of culver whose possible rivalry regarded a little short of insult indeed effect of suspense on be bad round for having somehow picked up notion from braider hint that spirit be leading qualification for aspiring member of club be very nearly increasing that qualification notoriously before week be out by row with headquarters purposely shirked work behaved disorderly in class in order to show patron what be made of be worse egged unsuspecting georgie on to similar excess by example georgie a far a spirit went stood better qualified for membership of club at week end than did real candidate for while latter escaped punishment former be dropped upon to tune of three hundred line of virgil for throwing book across room during class just luck said defiantly to leader afterwards everybody down on be bound to catch so may a well have fling did have fling georgie caught too georgie be too out of humour to notice jest catch caring twopence about though said tone belied valiant word dick looked curiously at troubled harried face why georgie said be down on luck old man blow luck said georgie perhaps be down on serf worse than yours dick did say anything more just then perhaps because have nothing to say did like new state of thing in friend georgie be being spoiled must have to be looked after dick be not only templetonian who have made brilliant discovery ponty have dropped casual eye on now then so have mansfield captain be captain be to be liked look of thing be going way of pledgelings said ponty ca stop mansfield if be captain of templeton 'd try old man replied other really mansfield frighten when look so solemn what can do do take away from where be to begin with on what ground pledge have done anything must take hold of if kid be going to dog ca connect with pledge more than can with winter ponty yawned wished mansfield must not look a if somebody wanted hanging be curious at rate said mansfield that pledge fag must begin to go to dog while chum who fag for cresswell be quite a racketty must keep right do call young richardson right asked ponty must say friend be in same boat be holding tiller be pretty 'cute for lazy one like ponty well said mansfield who with earnestness felt really baffled over problem thing must go on a be surely certainly not dear boy if can make better see what be to be done 'd bless if must put thing right put foot upon chair in front took up novel mansfield took hint did misunderstand indolent friend ponty indolence be all laziness be sometimes cloak for perplexity captain to be a said good night guessed shrewdly that not many page of novel must be skimmed that evening ponty did in fact wake up bit last few week of term rambled down once twice to junior tennis court terrified small fry there by sprawling at full length on grass within sight of play be crowded corner of field noisy one if captain went there for nap have queer notion of snug berth if however went there to see life knew what be about saw aspinall there toughening day working up screwy service patiently doggedly till one two of knowing one found worth while to get on other side of net play against culver be there big of bone bragging blustering a ever keeping colour in cheek with healthy sport gosse be there forgetting to make nuisance for one hour in twenty four globular cazenove be there melting with heat proclaiming that even big body short leg can do good by help of true eye patient spirit twenty others be there getting good one of atoning time scored point hit out rally for something healthy le profitable scored elsewhere ponty a lay there blinking in sun moralised on matter came to conclusion that there be hope for boy a long a love to don flannel roll up shirt sleeve stand up with head in air to face rival like man even culver may look gentleman a rush down to corner save match with left hander may appear formidable when a stand up to serve foeman pull cap down retreat with lengthened face across service line where be dick heathcote for whole week ponty took siesta in junior corner blinking now at cricket now at tennis strolling sometimes into gymnasium sometimes to five court nowhere did basil son of richard meet eye nowhere be heathcote pledgeling one day did find latter wandering like ghost in quadrangle saw bolt like rat to hole at sight of monitor once saw dick striding at head of phalanx of junior with coat off face very much on one side mark of battle on eye lip ponty sheered off before triumphal army reached shrugged shoulder afternoon encountered hero arm in arm in quadrangle hailed obeyed summons uneasily go put on flannel of said captain come back here will wait for in trepidation obeyed went while ponty looked about for cozy seat on to stretch in five minute returned presented ponty eyed calmly then roused began to walk to field tennis be in full swing in junior corner where sort of play good bad indifferent be going on at net ponty followed by two bewildered champion strolled about till came upon indifferent set being played by gosse cazenove against raggles boy called wade stop game for bit youngster said captain two of be best think raggles be said gosse with usual modesty oh then can sit out give racket to two be going to play against cazenove wade dick heart sank within a took gosse racket glanced up at captain face be rather out of practice faltered come be ready will umpire said captain be melancholy exhibition scratch match more melancholy that other court gradually emptied ring of junior formed who stared silently now at player then round at pontifex wondered what on earth found to interest in miserable show like for hero mulled everything two fault be not enough for hole in racket be legion leg never went way wanted den blushed a looked on heard ponty call game after game love forty of course two wretched boy be scared ponty knew well enough so be cazenove wade yet cazenove wade managed to keep wind get over net one must say have le to be scared at than opponent at length doleful spectacle be over one six be score in game must be proud of one game said ponty strolling off hero watched go felt be hard hit be use pretending not to understand captain meaning not to notice still lingering blush of spectator on account so withdrew sadly from field of battle chastened in spirit yet not without dawning ambition to make ponty change mind concerning before term be quite run out chapter fourteen how dick have one latin exercise more than bargained for dick did not often feel ashamed of have knack of keeping head above water even in revers usually stood in good stead after mournful scratch match with cazenove wade certainly did feel ashamed be said to credit of honesty that blamed right offender ponty have be rough on be ponty fault cazenove wade have knocked chum into cocked hat be cazenove wade fault heathcote have mulled game dreadfully done nothing to save match be heathcote fault basil son of richard be guilty man basil son of richard kicked called fool not publicly though in den despite blush tennis have caused did best to keep up swagger restore confidence by few act of special audacity den be forgiving on whole did feel sore for day showed gradually came back to allegiance made excuse for hero of own accord if truth must be told dick be far more concerned a to possible effect of public humiliation on election at sociable be now only day off braider told with rather long face that chance have be rather shaken by affair that there be again talk of pushing culver against alarming news drove immediate project of virtue out of dick head not that membership of club be one ideal of bliss being candidate must not bear idea of being defeated particularly by young ruffian like culver so indulged in sort of extravagance on last day of probation led heathcote on to very verge of further punishment in order to recover of ground have lost with select twenty after school must settle to nothing till knew fate dragged unsuspecting heathcote up down great quadrangle under pretext of discussing tom white boat really in order to keep eye on door behind select sociable sat in congress heathcote saw there be secret somewhere feeling out of departed somewhat moodily to pledge study dick however continued walk heedless if friend on earth deserted so long a culver must not be preferred before behind door be getting tired of solitary promenade beginning to wonder whether select sociable have fallen asleep in act of voting for when ball pitched suddenly on to pavement between foot must tell where came from probably from window above for one just then be about in quadrangle stooped down to pick up pitch back into first open window when greatly to surprise saw name written across discovered that ball be not tennis ball at round paper box came in two a held dick be not superstitious have scoffed at templeton ghost when first heard of made up mind long since be bogey kept for benefit of new boy certainly gave start to find at late period of term when have almost forgotten ever be new boy pitched upon a recipient of one of mysterious missive letter inside be written in printed character like addressed to heathcote dick began hallo thought dick to rather cheek of ghost to call fellow by christian name be dick be fool be fine fellow when came what be now let fellow lead astray can be fine fellow without being bad one let beociables alone will teach to be cad if care for think of heathcote who only need encouragement to make worse failure than have made already save from pledge then will be fine fellow with vengeance real friend junius p translate 'dominat qui in se dominatur ' first thing struck dick about extraordinary epistle be that be odd ghost must write letter on templeton exercise paper then occurred to that be rather rough to put through pace in latin idiom at time like must ghost get dictionary ask senior find out for then occurred to who on earth be who have written to like one who knew be certain almost fancied must be one who liked for fellow must take trouble to tell be fine fellow at beginning of term sort of thing unless have fancy for what did mean by what be now sounded a if meant be not fine fellow now rather personal remark what be got to do with what be now reflected dick digging hand into pocket resuming promenade what doe mean by fellow leading astray like to catch one trying on be like to catch for matter of for howling cheek dick sat down on one of stone bench pulled out letter for perusal 'let sociable alone oh ah most likely be be blackballed like one to humph wonder if be shady lot not what doe mean by saying will teach to be cad who will teach to be cad not muff like braider at moment door opened at end of corridor voice shouted richardson be braider voice dick knew crumpled letter up in hand colour came went from cheek richardson where be called braider again for be dusk hero seat be screened from view dick coloured again bit lip finally got up from bench strolled off in opposite direction richardson do hear once more shouted invisible braider dick walked on in dusk wondering to whether braider must get into row for kicking up uproar in quad at last after one final shout heard door slam then quickened pace made for cresswell study on staircase met aspinall heard one calling out in quad said small boy did replied dick wonder who can have be be cresswell in study serene come back with have done swot yes did lesson hour ago oh said dick strode on followed somewhat dubiously by young protege shut door said dick sternly a entered study be going to happen to ejaculated small boy inwardly a obeyed dick have never spoken to like before have offended unwittingly have be disloyal to sovereignty dick walked to fireplace pulling letter from pocket read through twice apparently heedless of subject presence then looked up suddenly crushing paper viciously back into pocket stared hard at perturbed companion young aspinall said sharply do say be fool oh replied boy staggered by very suggestion must never think of saying such thing must say be blackguard indeed dick one must say that hero face brightened there be warmth in aspinall voice touched most sensitive side of nature dick must have liked ghost to be near to hear must say have let be led astray made mess of here at templeton dick think so said boy what do mean think have have not demanded dick be delicate position for timorous small boy have have misgiving about dick seen change in not a thought for better idea of telling so to face be a much a peace be worth yet must either tell truth lie when came to that aspinall must not help be best friend have got said nervously 'd give anything to be a brave a well wire in said dick tearing to bit one of cresswell quill pen with teeth what be so good natured said aspinall fellow make do thing must do of own accord who make do thing demanded dick sternly know pleaded boy feeling that sort of tight rope dancing be not in line perhaps of friend in fourth fifth may be wrong what do make do said dick make said aspinall feeling that be use trying to keep balance longer that might a well throw down pole tumble into net make break rule get into row dick because see go down with cheer for must do of own accord how do know that think must said boy if one have told aspinall ten minute ago must be talking to dick in strain must have scouted idea a bit of chaff a be must hardly believe have said a much a have waited in uncomfortable sort of way for dick next remark oh be what think be please be angry pleaded boy asked what about heathcote demanded dick abruptly after pause what do mean dick mean be making mess of too oh dick never said be making mess of well then be heathcote being led astray know seems different talk funnily about thing doe what never heard georgie talk funnily about thing have known good bit who be leading astray be poor aspinall be on tight rope again at most ticklish part for did think dick be running heathcote into mischief unintentionally doubt still unmistakably be repeated dick rounding on man fixing with eye heathcote be not so strong minded a be dick when see doing thing fancy think can do too ca pull up like so get into row oh said dick returning to quill pen completing demolition then pulled out letter read to again time instead of returning to pocket twisted up into spill lit gas with must say be english of 'dominat qui in se dominatur young 'un asked casually when operation be complete why be one of motto in quad said aspinall wondering what on earth have to do with heathcote row always fancied meant rule best who know how to rule ' be word for best asked dick critically rather pleased to have found flaw in motto oh suppose be understood said aspinall why must say what meant straight out said dick waxing wondrous wroth at motto maker there be plenty of room in quad for extra word aspinall quite blushed at small explosion somehow felt personally implicated in defect of motto perhaps be wrong said perhaps mean fellow ca rule at unless can rule wo wash said dick profoundly where be 'nisi never

at day must either anchor where be for six hour with risk of rope not holding in race else let current take out to open then make long row back outside sprit clear of fiddle bank decided on latter somewhat gloomily rested on oar watched backward sweep of boat on tide seaward square tower of templeton have become mere speck on coast line before felt tide under relax knew be out of race then manned oar began long pull home fortunately water still remained quiet breeze did not freshen after about mile have be made sprit rock seemed only midway between shore peril still more serious overtook sky became overcast sea mist springing from nowhere came down on breeze blotting out first horizon then rock finally coast leaving virtually blindfolded in mid ocean may a well anchor wait till clear said cresswell think might go on slowly said freckleton if keep breeze on left dick look sharp out in front be bound to come either on sprit shore try for bit so tried rowing gingerly steering by breeze on cheek while dick ahead strained eye into soaking mist may have made mile still mist wrapped round have idea where be might be close to rock might have drifted down coast might be coming on to race again still anything seemed better than lying idle paddled steadily on hoping against hope for single glimpse of daylight through veil suddenly dick held hand above head shouted easy

triumphant face beaming over parapet side by side with rosy countenance of coote be enough in two minute den knew what be going on georgie coote be hero of hour moved by desire to afford spectator entertainment worthy of applause proceeded to make round of quadrangle at smart though not always steady pace for attention be so much divided between gutter before upturned face below that be once twice decidedly close on heel of luckless fitch once when came to comparatively broad landing varied entertainment by swarming little way up tile sliding gracefully down again regardless of tailor bill when spectator got tired of treated to little horse play by pelting with bit of plaster finally with coote hat even highest class of entertainment can not thrill for ever after quarter of hour of edifying exhibition den found have have enough of began to saunter off much to amazement of two performer may a well cut down said heathcote when at quad be deserted nothing seemed likely to be gained by remaining coote be quite ready to obey have enjoyed outing pretty well be rather tired of standing with one foot in front of other keeping eye on georgie be nearest to trap door have already crouched through when heathcote perceiving that one of den have come back for look decided in kindness of heart to take one last turn round before retiring have accomplished journey be glancing down rather anxiously to see if boy be enjoying when second floor window on opposite side suddenly opened mansfield looked out apparition nearly sent georgie headlong over parapet saved by dropping on hand knee be sure whether captain have seen not if have be in for if have not why on earth did stand there at window georgie performance ended in humiliating wriggle back along gutter to trap door dared not show so much a whisker above parapet a parapet be only high enough to conceal a lay full length on face return journey be painful tedious at last reached door where faithful coote anxiously awaited wondering what have kept not sure whether peculiar manner in advanced to door be to be regarded a joke feat of agility a heathcote did not gratify curiosity on point received hero with smile of mingled humour admiration then followed in precipitate descent to lower world at bottom of staircase duffield be comfortably lounging hullo kid said have got down then what mess be in mansfield

be interfered with by holy monitor when once took to walking on roof why where must expect to go to when descended to such depth of wickedness a heathcote spend miserable afternoon letting misfortune pledge word rankle in breast till hated very name of dick goodness in due time three fisher returned that evening tired with hard day work bronzed with sun breeze dick looked serious anxious a followed senior into quadrangle carrying ulster empty luncheon basket ah thought heathcote a watched from retired nook be ashamed of well may be two senior turned in at westover door leaving dick to continue walk alone now be heathcote time emerging from corner put hand carelessly in pocket advanced to meet former friend whistling jaunty tune be half afraid dick might not see dick have quick eye for friend hailed half across quadrangle hullo georgie old man said running up so awfully sorry must come on spree too what be matter what indeed georgie with elaborate air of unconsciousness of voice presence of comrade walked on looking straight in front of whistling more jauntily than ever dick stood for moment aghast must fain have believed chum have not seen be joking sinking at heart told otherwise rush of anger told that whatever reason might be be unjust one so checked inclination to pursue friend demand explanation there then strolled on whistling heathcote pursued dignified walk until concluded might safely stop whistling venture to peep round when did so be dismayed to see dick walking arm in arm across quadrangle with coote laughing at narration that pliable young gentleman be giving poor georgie be hardest blow of if dick have appeared crushed if have even looked hurt said one word of regret georgie heart must have be comforted wrath abated to have elaborate

way proved credit to school still more important step be voluntary disbanding of old club for purpose of placing new rule before meeting of whole school be not easy thing to accomplish for old member knew most of that qualification be reverse of must make eligible for membership according to new rule therefore clung tenaciously to hold be not until freckleton compromised matter by promising to hold eligible for election to new club exempt from condition other fellow must have to fulfil to become eligible that finally gave way be great day when by virtue of personal invitation to boy in hermit name templeton met together in great hall to put new club on foot be remarked at meeting that sixth took place a ordinary templetonians in body of hall not on dais that den usually herded

into valley by waly bottom bardie farm through pleasant village of steg over railway along fringe of swilford wood to open heath beyond how hunt be out of before went up other side of valley scattered gravel on top of welkin beacon how who be left dropped thence suddenly on lowhouse swam gurgle mile above ford how from lowhouse swerved eastward caught railway again at norton cutting how lost scent in durdon copse found again where wood gravel pit met how six who stayed in blistered foot after on gritty high road till cresswell hallooed over hedge showed scent down winding bank of babrook once again how dived into queer hamlet of little maddick saw very loaf round of cheese off hare have snatched hasty meal not five minute before how mansfield cresswell made vow to taste meat drink till have run quarry down how ever diminishing pack sighted hare just out of maddick going up bengle hill over bengle hill down into valley beyond up shoulder of blackarch ridge how toiled struggled till

caught gloriously mile from home after one of fastest run templeton have ever recorded muse must curb wing descend from poetry to prose in order to narrate particular adventure of three modest hero for first half mile be said to glory led hunt being convinced that only hope be to get good start shake off field from very beginning dashed to front on cresswell cry of forward at rate of ten mile hour for five minute showed templeton way then occurred one of lamentable disaster so often befall youthful runner on exhaustion of first wind coote shoe lace came undone be sole reason for pulling up to say that be blown that pace be hard on be adding insult to calamity doubtless redness of countenance a knelt down to make fast truant lace be solely due to indignation at possibility of such suggestion dick heathcote a stood one on side of really thankful for pause professed to be highly impatient at delay come on said dick here come what brutal time take to do up beastly lace cried georgie might have be in next field by time think will hold now said coote rising slowly to foot a pack came up in full cry blown already youngster asked cresswell better go home be not blown at said dick trotting on abreast of whipper in coote lace came undone be yes must have be in next field if have said owner of luckless lace harrier smiled for minute two pack swung in even line across field then coote anxious not to crowd anyone let dozen so of fifth go in front dick georgie generously considering that must be rather low to leave short winded comrade in lurch dropped behind leading rank in order to be nearer in minute more anxiety coote may have felt a to crowding one be at end be yard two in rear of last man with stitch in side beginning in inmost soul to wonder whether new sociable club be such very good thing after dick georgie a gradually sacrificed prospect of being in at death fell back to support of ally waxed very contemptuous of stitch in fellow side knew what meant be pity coote have started if be liable to sort of thing stitch have cost firm whole field already however be not selfish must back up even if meant coming in at tail of hunt though to be sure pace mansfield cresswell few others be going at be one must be kept up firm a soon a stitch be out might be in running after by dint of persuasion threat imputation coote stitch did come out before be gone last of pack be seen going over ridge be out of said georgie despondently not bit of said dick who be getting second wind felt like holding on be bound to pull up on if coote only keep up so held on gallantly must not long keep up fiction of being in hunt amount of self deception must persuade when end of straggling line of fellow going up ridge be clear half mile ahead that be in still minute held on felt more like staying when reflected that be possible to run through hunt without being in at death took comfort determined templeton must not say have turned tail will have to follow scent now said dick when pack suddenly disappeared to view over ridge thank goodness be white paper plenty of come on fellow will run through yet feel quite fresh said coote mopping head with handkerchief how far do think have gone six mile six have not done mile half yet coote put away handkerchief gave buckle of running drawer hitch firm settled down to business having once found out pace got second

saw hare close to 'd go for matter what scent be very well ca do to day not if want to get on list said dick have taken sharp turn though at bottom trotting down steep hill be not one of joy of chase hero by time got to level bottom felt a bruised shaken a if have be in railway accident however mile on flat pulled together again plodded on by bardie farm where scent became sparse on to steg where for first time since leaving templeton came upon trace of fellow man worthy inhabitant of steg particularly junior portion of hailed three hero with demonstration of friendly interest have turned out fully hour ago to see main body of hunt go by just a be returning regretfully to ordinary occupation cry of three more of 'em came a welcome reprieve brought back into highway in full force fond of

long trot along springy turf outside swilford wood once twice scent turned in got doubtful among underwood came out again just a often presently turned off on to heath hero ploughed honestly through bracken gorse tangled foot scratched bare shin at step mile over heath be most trying yet hare seemed to have picked out very cruellest track must find when presently firm caught sight of ruthless little patch of paper going straight up side of welkin beacon coote fairly cried for quarter announced must sit down companion though must not have liked to make suggestion be by mean inexorable to appeal why have hardly started yet said dick throwing down on ground be nice fellow to begin to want rest only just started gasped coote never ran so far in life came that last bit pretty well considering ground said anxious to make halt a justifiable a possible wonder where hare be now said dick rather pensively back at templeton perhaps said heathcote having iced ginger beer turning into 'tub shut up georgie said dick with wince what be use of talking about iced ginger beer out here lay minute dreading first suggestion to move coote feigned to have dropped asleep heathcote became intensely interested in anatomy of thistle dick be only one who must not honestly settle down dreaded summons when at last came came in voice lazy beggar cried starting up get up ca come on rip van winkle never slept more profoundly than did coote at moment ala rip have longer nap of two unceremonious application of leader toe threat to go on alone brought firm to foot in double quick time started up steep side of beacon hill demoralised by halt fared badly up slope have not be for dick almost vicious resolution kept going overcame own frequent inclination to yield to lazier motion of companion might never have done dick saw that effort be critical be inexorable even georgie thought unkind coote positively hated up that slope oh never ending ridge one above other seeming to be top discovering beyond more odious than more than once felt have just enough left in to make peak faced then when be reached endurance have to stretch stretch until seemed that point of breaking must come at step if nothing else have ever done deserved reward of virtuous that honest pull up side of welkin beacon did freckleton have seen making last scramble must have put name down on list without further probation cairn stood before at last a rushed to planted on topmost point where still few scrap of scent lingered fatigue labour be forgotten in exhilarating sense of triumph achievement
