night for must tell from night till morning be looked after by lady housekeeper that one fact made stonebridge house almost intolerable be lounging about in so called playground afternoon be beginning to discover little more about of new schoolfellow when there appeared walking towards down gravel path boy about own age be slender delicate looking remember pale face contrasted strangely with almost black clustering hair dark big eye be handsome boy remember thinking there be something striking about for that may have be solemn expression square jaw eye brow hair whole of put together know be

too by appearance responded flanagan very queer indeed said hawkesbury hawkesbury be one of two backwards for that be cleverest boy so others told in whole school doe seem very bashful said indeed did sauntered slowly down path looking solemnly now on one side now on other now at until presently stood in midst gazed half inquiringly half doubtfully from one to other know felt good deal more uncomfortable than did be quite glad when flanagan broke solemn silence hullo youngster who be eh smith laconically replied new boy looking questioner in face there be nothing impudent in way spoke looked somehow other tone did seem quite a humble abject a old boy be wont to expect from new flanagan next inquiry therefore be little more roughly uttered what be christian name young donkey suppose be only smith in world do laughed at be half bad for flanagan new boy however remained quite solemn a replied briefly john smith where do come from said philpot taking up questioning determining to

what say to said roughly emphasising question with shake what on earth do mean by going off without answering be business of yours be said new boy mildly yes exclaimed philpot be suppose fellow be going to be humbugged by young sneak like do sha' tell then quietly replied smith astounding reply quietly a be uttered quite took away philpot breath breath of of be so astonished indeed that for time one must utter word make up mind what to do next then gradually dawned on company generally that defiant stuck up youngster must immediately be put down come here said philpot a majestically a must smith remained where be a solemn a ever who stood near must detect queer light in black eye that looked rather ominous when one fellow in presence of admiring audience grandly order junior to come here when junior coolly decline to move be very critical situation for boy who order boy who disobeys for one unless follows up brag will pretty certainly be laughed at other unless show white feather run away will generally come in for little rough usage seemed likely to happen now a smith must not come to philpot for thrashing philpot must go to smith thrash where stood so doubtless must have done have not mr hashford appeared at very moment on gravel walk summoned in to preparation interruption be most unsatisfactory who wanted to see what new boy be made of be disappointed whose

scope for once for pent up feeling be one of happiest time have known for year a knelt there on hard carpetless floor found heart going out to heart of friend what talked about be of little moment be

good night old man awfully good of replied will come to to morrow not long after be sound asleep managed to keep down bad mark below four next day so be able once more to take walk abroad in playground be with little feeling of misgiving sallied forth for smith be at side reminding of resolution to escape if only for few minute to free country outside must greatly have preferred not trying smith be set on have not face to leave in lurch far end of playground beyond swing broke into patch of tangled thicket beyond again little ditch separated ground of stonebridge house from country outside to thicket therefore wandered after showing on swing for few minute for sake of allaying suspicion other fellow be most of loafing about on far side of gravel yard where marble hole be so managed to make escape pretty easily found ourselves at length standing on breezy heath once there smith whole manner changed to one of wild delight sense of freedom seemed to intoxicate infection seized too scampered about in perfectly ridiculous manner up hill down hollow leaping over bush chasing one in fact behaving exactly like two kid a be suddenly let loose from confinement say said out of breath suppose run clean away smith smith pulled up in middle of scamper looked up down on side then old solemn look came a replied where to be oh brownstroke if like home let turn up know give jolly surprise smith face clouded over a said hurriedly say be time to be going back will get caught be effectual damper to idea of flight quickly turned back once more to stonebridge house found gap right strolled back past swing up gravel walk a unconcernedly a possible fully believing one have be witness of escapade be wrong hawkesbury came up to a neared house with usual smile on face did hear calling said know be against rule to go out of bound thought what who be be out of bound said voice of henniker at moment hawkesbury looked dejected who did say hawkesbury have be out of bound 'd rather not tell tale said hawkesbury sweetly have be out of bound blurted out smith so have batchelor asked to come hawkesbury have be spying silence cried miss henniker smith batchelor follow followed duly to mr ladislaw study where be arraigned hawkesbury be sent for a evidence came smiling declared may have be mistaken perhaps be two other boy hoped must not be punished etcetera smith be nearly breaking out once twice during be must do to keep in hawkesbury be thanked dismissed then with assistance of miss henniker mr hashford mr ladislaw smith be birched forbidden playground for fortnight during period be required to observe absolute silence so ended little adventure out for puff of free air among fellow gained little enough sympathy for misfortune flanagan be only fellow who seemed really sorry rest of ill conditioned lot saw in affair only good opportunity of crowing over ill starred adversary telling served right for chumming up to one one day greatly to surprise when henniker be away superintending flogging of flanagan for offence other hawkesbury came over sat beside oh said softly batchelor have be wanting to tell how sorry be helped get into scrape did mean be only anxious for to know rule hope will forgive held out hand what must do perhaps be telling truth after have thought too badly of when big boy come asks pardon of small one be always embarrassing for latter so gave hand told be sure did not mean that did not matter at thanks batchelor said smiling quite gratefully be relief to then watched go on what knew be similar errand to smith a expected reception in quarter be not quite so flattering a have be in case must see chum eye fire up a saw elder boy approach flush come over pale cheek watched hawkesbury blandly repeating apology then suddenly to astonishment consternation saw smith rise in seat throw furiously upon enemy hawkesbury be standing near low form in sudden surprise caused by attack tripped over fell prone on floor just a miss henniker re entered there be brief pause of universal astonishment then henniker demanded what be tell what be hawkesbury hawkesbury have risen to foot smiling a ever brushing dust from coat replied softly nothing really nothing ma'be fell down be knocked down shouted smith panting like steam engine trembling with excitement oh said hawkesbury kindly though not quite liking downright way in adventure have be summed up be only play miss henniker fault a much a smith never meant to be so rough really silence said miss henniker smith follow oh miss henniker please punish said hawkesbury silence replied henniker icily come smith miss henniker have wonderful art of knowing by instinct who be culprit in case like be never troubled with doubt a to verdict being right one really saved great deal of trouble smith be haled away to justice where in addition to flogging further term of imprisonment be reduced for given period to bread water diet required publicly to beg hawkesbury pardon that there might be delay about execution of last part of sentence culprit be conducted back forthwith to schoolroom accompanied by miss henniker mr ladislaw hawkesbury said latter addressing injured boy have desired smith to beg pardon here now for conduct to smith do a have be told smith remained silent who watched must see that mind be made up do hear mr ladislaw smith demanded henniker do a be bid at once please sir began hawkesbury with pleasant smile silence hawkesbury said henniker now smith might have be addressing log of wood do hear what say to once more exclaimed smith only glared at with big eye resolutely held tongue then said mr ladislaw smith must be publicly punished smith be punished publicly more repulsive spectacle never wish to witness public punishment at stonebridge house meant flogging administered to one helpless boy by whole body of schoolfellow two of whom firmly held victim while of others in turn flogged in case of unpopular boy like smith punishment be specially severe turned actually sick a of cowardly lout stepped up vented baffled wrath upon hawkesbury of course only made slightest pretence of touching of punishment seemed to be part smith must bear least at last when be over bruised boy slunk back to desk class proceeded night a knelt beside poor chum bed said have paid pretty dear for run on heath fred have old man replied smith lay still for time musing then said do mean by forgiving enemy fred smith did often get on topic be little nervous a replied what say suppose doe mean fellow like hawkesbury must say so said almost doubtful from way in spoke whether after might not be mistaken queer be replied musingly tried hard to change subject be awfully sore jack said have one of pillow oh thanks say fred think be queer what about forgiving enemy well yes be rather say be time cut back good night old man crept back to bed lay awake night listening to a turned from side to side in sleep feeling that everything everybody be queer especially friend smith chapter five how chapter of misfortune befel friend smith summer wore on with gloom of stonebridge house sunk deeper deeper into spirit after week two even sense of novelty wore off settled down to drudge doom a if be destined life never to see place outside henniker domain if have be for smith know how must have endured not that ever have much chance of enjoying one society in school be wholly impossible in playground particularly after recent escapade have very little opportunity given at night when secretly did contrive to talk be with constant dread of detection hanging over concerned most of though be bad way in smith seemed to get on with one of schoolfellow except perhaps flanagan with bully like philpot rathbone be at dagger drawn towards others never took trouble to conceal dislike while with hawkesbury explosion seemed always imminent must not understand why got on so badly especially with hawkesbury who certainly never made disagreeable on contrary always appeared desirous to be friendly sometimes thought smith be unreasonable to foster instinctive dislike a did jack said one night a be paying call to bedside jack be half beginning to think hawkesbury be so bad fellow after why demanded smith oh know be done one two good turn lately what sort well helped in latin other day of own accord go on said smith impatiently gave knife to day know lost mine said 'd got two smith grunted 'd like to catch doing good turn to that be said 'd cure of did like to hear smith talk like for one thing sounded a if must be great deal le foolish than be nobody like to admit for thing seemed wrong unreasonable unless for very good cause to persist in believing nothing good about anybody else so changed subject say said what be going to do holiday stay here said be going home what exclaimed stay here for four week with old hen why ever jack know be what have got to do be going home suppose so said with inward groan jack what will do with much a usual expect sha' get much practice in talking till come back added with low laugh jack why go home exclaimed be in row there what never tell word about look out hear one moving cried smith next moment be back in bed be vexed for half guessed alarm have be only excuse for not talking about home did like being silenced in way altogether that night be good deal put out with smith when presently whispered across good night pretended to be asleep did not answer be not asleep must not sleep worked first into rage then into injured state finally into miserable condition over friend smith why must keep secret from when kept none from when came to think over did not keep single secret from did think be not to be trusted be too selfish to care might have known better by time be true have told secret without asking for in fact all along have not seemed nearly a anxious a have be for friendship of ours conscience stung at last reflection there came upon of sudden sense of utter desolation of awful place without single friend determined must take more than little pique to make cast away only friend with thought though must have be far on in night slipped from bed crawled to be fast asleep at first touch of hand started up said what be row be sorry jack be in temper to night must go to sleep till made up temper what about said did know be fancied must that be that thought did trust jack be only fellow do trust fred there said taking arm then with sigh added why must what beast be jack cried quite repentant hush said jack then whispering very close to ear added there be thing know ca tell even about home there be sound in room a of boy suddenly aroused starting up in bed blood turned cold remained motionless hardly daring to breathe straining ear in darkness suddenly boy whoever be sprang from bed seizing lucifer struck light be hawkesbury have almost guessed felt jack hand tighten on arm a sudden glare fell full upon hawkesbury voice cried oh fellow what start gave must make out what talking be thought must be thief at same moment dormitory door opened new glare lit up scene be miss henniker in dressing gown with candle what talking who be talking said overhearing hawkesbury last exclamation be queer picture moment can recall even now hawkesbury standing in night shirt in middle of room a lightly clad crouching transfixed beside friend bed who be sitting up with hand on arm henniker there at door in yellow black dressing gown curl paper holding candle above head looking from one to other who be talking demanded again turning to hawkesbury hawkesbury smiling returned to bed a replied oh nothing think must have be dreaming woke in fright a spoke eye turned to two miss henniker followed naturally then whole truth dawned upon rose from knee walked sheepishly back to bed what be doing out of bed sir demanded be little use delaying matter by parley so replied bluntly talking to smith added loyal smith be talking to batchelor silence cried griffin batchelor dress immediately follow did a be bid mechanically be slipped on knickerbockers slipper found in couple of minute thus airily attired following miss henniker like ghost down long passage led way not a expected to parlour to mr ladislaw room conducted upstairs ushered into small perfectly empty garret remain here batchelor said sternly next moment be gone locking door behind be left shivering in total darkness to spend remainder of night in unexpected quarter first sensation be one of utter uncontrollable rage be tempted to fling against door to shout to roar until one must come to release then a suddenly came over miserable certainty be helpless that anything did must be labour lost injure one smith too be up with precious secret parley perhaps must not even be allowed to see one more in misery sat down on floor in corner of dungeon felt a if must not much care if house be to fall about ear bury in ruin cheerful reflection for youth of tender year a sat shivering brooding over hard fate heard footstep ascending stair when be sitting alone in empty room at dead of night be never very fascinating sound did not much enjoy a listened must make out that footstep belonged to two people perhaps be going to be murdered reflected like prince arthur two boy in tower at same moment streak of light glimmered through crack of door heard voice say come way smith so smith too be going to be locked up for night heart bounded a for instant occurred to must be in dungeon such good fortune passed door at rate chum must know where be so proceeded to make demonstration against door beseech in most piteous way to be released of course be use did not matter never expected must listened hard to retreating footstep stopped at end of passage then door opened shut again key turned one pair of step again returned past door a peeped through keyhole have vague idea of yellow black gown knew that henniker have gone back to place if only smith have be shut up next door to might have be able to shout to so that must hear what chance be there when three four room at least divided after except that be near knew where be thing be not much better than have be before so sat down again in corner sulkily watched first glimmer of dawn peep in at little window must be about be thought meant four good hour before chance of release came a be foot be pretty nearly dead with cold thin nightgown be not much covering for fellow body arm rather pleased to think adventure might end fatally that at inquest miss henniker might be brought in guilty of manslaughter must be breezy for leaf have be tapping away at window last minute so pretty hard bother leaf yet when come to think of often hear leaf tap a hard a window will be smashed in if keep up at rate so get up lazily approach scene of action nearly screamed a did so for there close up against window be face be so taken aback that took good minute to recover wit perceive that apparition be none other than faithful friend jack smith that tapping have be giving leaf such credit for have be eager attempt to attract attention sprang to window jubilant opened oh jack hurrah however did get here oh have spotted at last have said with grim smile have be here five ten minute have exclaimed yes window opened on to ledge too so did see why must come might have fallen killed say jack wo come in even if do get caught thing ca be much worse than be know that so think 'd better come out what for exclaimed in astonishment to get away anywhere said in moment be up on window sill scrambling out on to ledge beside fresh morning breeze blew on face a did so glorious sense of freedom took hold of drooping spirit needed word only let get free come along said jack crawling along narrow ledge ran round top of house how will get down asked be what want to find out said jack be there water pipe something in front carefully made perilous journey round side of house towards front smith leaned over peered down yes said there be water pipe must easily slide down if must only get at look looked over too ground seemed long way below felt trifle nervous at prospect of trying to reach by such unorthodox mean a water pipe even must get at pipe ledge on be overhung side of house pipe began under just below where stood must try anyhow said jack desperately will go first catch hold of hand fred be actually going to attempt to scramble over round under ledge when suddenly paused cried hold hard do believe bit of ledge be loose so be shook a stood upon might be able to move said jack so knelt down with might tugged away at stone divided from water pipe be obstinate at first by dint of perseverance yielded to pressure at last be able triumphantly to lift from place be easy enough now reaching pipe here new peril arose sliding down water pipe be acquired art not nearly a easy a seems jack who volunteered to make first descent looked little blue a found pipe be so close to wall that must get hand round much le foot will have to grip hard with ankle elbow said beginning to slide down inch two go slow do be nervous work watching still more nervous work when at length braced up to effort proceeded to embrace slender pipe how ever managed to get to bottom ca say remember reflecting about half way down that must be good daily exercise for henniker mere thought of almost sent headlong to bottom at last however stood safe beside chum on gravel walk now said now replied where will go london think said solemnly a ever right how many mile eighty ninety fancy where be coat in dormitory be too much flurried to put on never mind can use mine turn about wish 'd got boot instead of slipper so do replied who even a stood felt sharp gravel cutting foot ninety mile in slipper will be rather rough never mind said jack come on come on said at moment to dismay misery heard window above stealthily opened close to water pipe looking up henniker head yellow black body suddenly thrust out batchelor smith mr ladislaw here voice rose to pretty nearly shriek mr ladislaw come at once please batchelor smith running away mr ladislaw quick batchelor smith stood motionless with spirit left to fly until door be opened mr ladislaw miss henniker mr hashford three sallied out to capture among be dragged back faint exhausted into stonebridge house thought of freedom london effectually banished from head still worse with bitter sense of disappointment added to other misery mr hashford be set to watch for rest of night in empty schoolroom have easy task for even though fell asleep over have notion of returning to old scheme indeed be shivering so have notion of anything cold jack made put on coat made very little difference form be on actually shook with shivering mr hashford good soul that be lent own waistcoat suggested that if three sat close together in middle might get warmer tried when at six o'clock same eventful morning servant came to sweep room found three huddled together two of asleep one in fever have only dim recollection of what happened during next week so be during time most comfortable boy in stonebridge house for doctor came day ordered sort of good thing insisted on fire being kept in room lesson if wished to see of friend might do so on account be to be allowed to fret be disturbed in mind must help feeling half sorry for miss henniker being charged with uncongenial task stonebridge house depended great deal on what doctor said of so have to obey order took advantage of permission to see friend by requesting presence of smith very frequently a henniker generally thought fit to sit in room at same time did get a much good out of chum a might have done heard have have very smart flogging for share of eventful night proceeding that be being saved up for when got well be quite melancholy day for when doctor pronounced convalescent said might resume ordinary duty be announced to at first appearance in school that on account of delinquency be on strict silence rule for rest of term that bed be removed to other dormitory be absolutely forbidden to hold further communication either by word gesture with friend smith thus cheerfully ended first term at stonebridge house chapter six how thing came to crisis at stonebridge house year passed found at end of same wretched spiritless boy a ever stonebridge house have become no more tolerable henniker have grown no le terrible fellow backward troublesome boy be just a unpleasant a have be no new boy have come to give variety old boy have left except for one fact that be of year older everything be precisely same a have be at time of adventure related in last chapter that one year make good deal of difference when smith slid down water pipe year ago be comparatively new friend now have grown to love one like brother when henniker on same occasion put end to scheme of escape have endured persecution three month now have endured for fifteen great deal of secret working may go on in fellow mind during year in way interval have wrought change for be good deal more to one smith good deal more desperate at hard lot of than have be year ago have be miserable time holiday alone with uncle have be almost a cheerless a schooldays at stonebridge house with miss henniker if have be for smith do believe must have lost vestige of spirit happily gave chance of falling into condition seemed always on verge of explosion now be against hawkesbury now against henniker now against mr ladislaw now against whole world generally included have busy time of holding in still showed aversion to hawkesbury although differed from on point insisted that hawkesbury be not such bad fellow luckily however outbreak happened how must when hawkesbury be always so amiable forgiving friendly be wonder to how jack must persist in disliking fellow sometimes used to be quite ashamed to see scornful way in repulsed favour offer of friendship on whole rather liked hawkesbury summer term be again drawing to close for fear suppose lest fact must convey idea of pleasure to mind henniker be down on more than ever cane be in constant requisition mr ladislaw be always being summoned up to administer chastisement even hawkesbury who generally managed to escape reproach came in for persecution now then one day remember be in class for reason quitted room leaving mr hashford in charge now one minded mr hashford very much be good natured fellow who did best to please mistress be henpecked must see like rest of looked upon more a big schoolfellow than a master minded accordingly therefore accepted henniker departure a signal for leaving off work seizing opportunity to loosen tongue look about hawkesbury happened to be sitting next to put down pen leaning back against desk behind yawned said say batchelor hope smith have be quarrelling quarrelling exclaimed astounded at bare notion why put that into head oh said with usual smile only fancy be glad be case of course be said warmly have seen talking to so often lately be why said hawkesbury always seems pity when good friend fall out smiled said how can talk to except on sly in place never fear jack smith know one too well to fall out ah be mysterious fellow let so few people into secret yes said colouring little doe even let into hawkesbury looked surprised of course know where came from first of said what not know about 'd better not talk about be not honourable to talk about boy affair hawkesbury said mr hashford at moment talk be quite remarkable utterance for meek mild mr hashford to make in henniker absence started looked up in concerned way a if must be unwell seemed right having said what have to say went on with work hawkesbury took notice of interruption went on on whole think must be kinder not to say anything about a have kept secret see hawkesbury again said mr hashford must not talk hawkesbury smiled in pitiful sort of way at mr hashford again turned towards to resume conversation see began hawkesbury again said mr hashford be third time have told not to talk who be talking cried henniker entering at moment hawkesbury be sorry to say miss henniker hawkesbury bad mark for oh said starting up be talking bad mark to batchelor for interrupting for talking hawkesbury bad mark for talking in class be astonished have hitherto looked upon hawkesbury a privileged person who might do a liked upon mr hashford a person who have not soul of own here be phenomenon not only of schoolfellow getting publicly censured of mr hashford backing up miss henniker miss henniker backing up mr hashford flanagan afterwards confided to theory of unwonted event expect said hashford just got screw raised want to show off bit before hen want to encourage to be rather more down on know be got toothache too know that account for not being particular who drop on though be surprised pitched on hawkesbury how pleased chum smith will be friend smith when have chance of speaking to seemed indifferent about whole affair being taken up with trouble of own letter have come for day told in tone of fierce anger have be opened read a usual before being handed to did not complain of be indignity have to submit to time received letter what did complain of have roused temper be that last half sheet of letter have be deliberately torn off not given to directly after class have marched boldly to henniker parlour knocked at door come in snapped smith did come in proceeded to business at once have given letter ma'be said miss henniker looked at with of same astonishment with have regarded when once told be to see sock be regularly darned then pulled up in usual chilly manner replied be aware of smith want please ma'be said smith again henniker glared at audacious youth again replied will not have smith why not leave room instantly sir for daring to speak like to write out one hundred line of caesar before get dinner cried henniker indignantly have right to keep smith follow interrupted miss henniker in most irresistible voice a led way to mr ladislaw study smith did follow be flogged of course be a indignant a be at tale of injustice reminded of box of sweet last year have never seen back smith rage be beyond bound wo stand said be about fred what can do asked that be question there be answering so slunk back to place nursing wrath in bosom vowing sort of vengeance on henniker be only boy in condition of mind whether be henniker be thoroughly upset by toothache by hawkesbury bad conduct smith impertinence can not say for next day two even excelled in way went on there be nothing must do think devise that did not pounce upon punish for be detained be set to imposition be flogged be reduced to bread water have most if not of worldly good confiscated even hawkesbury shared general fate for whole week stonebridge house groaned a have never groaned before then must stand no longer felt that found out that everybody else felt a usual question be what to do be almost impossible to speak to one so closely be watched even when did discovered that be at six seven agreed only on one thing be that must not stand at length one day to infinite jubilation a be dismally walking from schoolroom to parlour saw front door open fly be standing at a passed henniker in sunday get up be stepping into have done to deserve mercy be going to pay state call somewhere for one blessed hour at rate must be at peace council of war be immediately held for once in way stonebridge house be unanimous sunk minor difference for time in grand question what must do great many wild suggestion be immediately made rathbone undertook with aid of two other fellow to inflict personal chastisement on public enemy be rejected peremptorily must be no use must catch worse afterwards besides bad a be henniker be woman must be cowardly to thrash tie up hand foot gag suggested philpot must do again 'd get ladislaw to help out tie up ladislaw hashford too be numerous strong enough to do let bolt suggested flanagan 'd send police after if did how be to get on without money shelter anywhere to go suppose said shut out of schoolroom barricade door let in till accept term be more like said one then what about food ca store enough even if emptied larder to stand long siege well then said smith suppose screw up let out till give in be said one very thing what do say hawkesbury inquired well said smiling pleasantly be not nice thing to turn against one master mistress really miss henniker have be very vexing lately hurrah then agree question be put round one assenting at least so thought smith a usual be doubtful of hawkesbury agree hawkesbury said really said other with smile be nice to be suspected smith be enough to say thing once oh yes yes cried out one impatiently most anxious to keep meeting harmonious said did smith what more do want do let pull together just what want said smith well said philpot propose lock up in big schoolroom must be better said flanagan to lock henniker up in own room let ladislaw hashford have parlour will be more comfortable for there be sofa there carpet besides window worse one to get out of how about feeding one asked that will be easy enough said smith there be ventilator over door know can hand thing in there vote old hen get precious little interposed rathbone must give idea be scouted be resolved that prisoner must have sufficient though at same time limited amount of provision that being arranged next question be when must begin have to take good many thing into account in fixing important date to day be friday butcher one said always brought meat for week on monday baker never came till wednesday so if began operation on monday must have good supply of meat very little bread to start with be possible of course baker might smell rat get up rescue must be better on account to defer action till after baker visit on wednesday then washerwoman generally came on thursday voted washerwoman nuisance must either take prisoner keep in house run risk of finding out that something be wrong going back to village telling of if must only keep up week said smith think must bring to term suppose drop line to washerwoman day before not to call suggested motion met with universal applause be deputed to carry out at proper time good lady address knew be on slate in miss henniker pantry tell said smith starting up with brilliancy of suggestion let hide away bread can find except just what will last over to morrow then most likely will tell baker to call on monday can begin then be brilliant suggestion two of company departed forthwith to larder unobserved hid away few loaf in one of empty trunk in box room plan be ripening wonderfully most difficult business be yet to come what term must require of prisoner a price of release on point after long discussion found must not agree be for immediate dismissal of henniker others demanded that must not be allowed to speak without special permission others that must remain in parlour day long come out only for prayer to give order to tradesman proposal be too absurd to take seriously a presently company began to grow little quarrelsome over matter be decided for peace ' sake that question must be deferred term arranged when prisoner offered to give in if may make suggestion said hawkesbury

to of ought to stay up a sentinel said captain well ca for one said philpot for be never so sleepy in life must think said hawkesbury sweetly if captain stayed up must be quite safe why must smith glare so whenever hawkesbury spoke wondered be sure there did not seem to be anything offensive in will stay up jack said more with desire to avert row than because felt particularly spry so will said shankley if will dig in rib when get sleepy will tell said smith after having recovered suppose bring bed down camp out on landing be carried with acclamation one forthwith proceeded to dormitory reappeared staggering under weight of bedclothes one monstrous bed be made in camped out in turn one fellow only remaining awake a sentinel for hour at time will have to settle to morrow said smith when have returned to camp after having gone round seen that light be out door bolt fastened will have to settle to morrow what to say to about coming out fellow thought be left to captain said

agree ought to bargain take more notice of affair write home about suggested shankley who care what write home scornfully inquired smith ah may not matter to said hawkesbury smiling very sweetly to rest of doe smith glared at speaker looked a if be about to fly at throat controlled merely replied very well then be to promise not to say anything about at home a well a give in on other thing be that settled everybody said yes shortly afterwards most of mutineer be peacefully asleep fred said smith to night a kept watch together unless fellow hawkesbury let alone will give thing up do said really think that hawkesbury mean will speak to if like cost great effort to say smith fired up unwontedly at suggestion if do will never be friend again said passionately then recovering added repentantly fred be awfully sorry lost temper know be brute please think of speaking to one about right old man said so night wore on when presently came to be turn to lie down sleep in big bed at rate did so good deal disturbed in spirit not altogether sure whether in present escapade stonebridge house boy be not making rather fool of ourselves chapter eight how rebellion collapsed left stonebridge house be roused next morning early by sound of voice found that fresh council of war be being held in big bed on question of ultimatum smith be away at time mean to say said rathbone smith far too mild to suit felt called upon to stick up for chum why did make captain said have long got past stage of being afraid either of rathbone philpot at stonebridge house well retorted malcontent why doe go whole hog depends on what call whole hog replied why instead of feeding up like fighting cock 'd starve must 'd have locked together in empty garret not in room with sofa bed nonsense must let out till came out on knee promised to do be ordered be what 'd do will tell now then rathbone cried smith entering at moment be turn to look after grub remember look alive will have breakfast be

have so turned back on speaker proceeded very well then 'd better sign at once have got pen ink here look sharp fellow think said hawkesbury blandly once more a be be left to captain have better sign paper in name of school mind smith be sure smith snatched up pen hastily signed name at foot of document be not afraid if be what mean must watch working of face a hurriedly folded paper up into form of note knew storm be going on in own breast certainly hawkesbury however good intention be little aggravating perhaps will throw that in over henniker door said smith handing one of note to

succeeded in getting through ventilator hearing drop in middle of henniker floor letter for cried by way of explanation have hour to give answer batchelor replied miss henniker from within in what seemed rather subdued voice be doing very wrong let out immediately batchelor not till promise what be written in note replied quitting place similar ceremony be enacted by smith in delivering

across step sha' go out hawkesbury interposed anxious to avert row have promised to obey captain know really replied hawkesbury did please let pas smith then be speaking false exclaimed irate smith when said did promise really smith did say did promise wretched liar replied smith be not nice name to call fellow mildly replied hawkesbury hope be gentleman deserve bah said smith in tone of utter disgust standing aside letting enemy pas go where like want sneak here hawkesbury walked on smiling pleasantly good bye for present said mind obey captain fellow know be gentleman went out leaving in state of utter astonishment babel of voice at once arose declared hawkesbury be quite right not to stand being ordered about others said ought to have be stopped going out others said who cared if did go in midst of eye turned to jack smith face have be flushed excited be now pale solemn either did not hear did not heed discussion be going on must confess felt half frightened a eye suddenly met not that looked dangerous have strange look half of baffled rage half of shame be quite new to waited anxiously to discover what meant a eye met mine however seemed to recover to make up mind batchelor said get screwdriver what be going to do asked one be going to lock hawkesbury out said smith quietly be going to let out others cried fellow at astounding announcement without waiting for answer will get expelled wo said smith doggedly rather scornfully mean to say be going to show white feather said rathbone mean to say be going to let out yes get credit of leave to get into row said philpot smith turned round short on speaker held out screwdriver here said if want credit go do of course philpot declined tempting offer without word smith walked up to passage began pulling away desk from parlour door flanagan one two of sorely perplexed helped others stood aloof grumbled sneered two master within noise of spoke at last be clear smith said now then 'd better go fellow obeyed though reluctantly curiosity a well a anxiety prompted to stay retired to end of passage where from distant door nervously watched smith turn key draw out first one screw then other from door divided from master at last saw open smith walked into room shut door behind what happened inside never exactly knew after hour seemed to a long a day three emerged walked straight down passage up stair led to miss henniker room smith with screwdriver walked in middle very solemn very pale stealthily crawled up after hid where must observe what be to follow mr ladislaw knocked at henniker door well said voice within word be mildly spoken very unlike snap to have be accustomed in former day be said mr ladislaw mr hashford will be glad if will immediately have door opened be reply smith unscrew door at once said mr ladislaw smith solemnly proceeded to do a be bid presently screw be dislodged be done said henniker when sound ceased yes miss henniker door be quite free then said henniker there positively seemed to be tremor in voice please go will be down presently so little procession turned once more walked down stair smith with screwdriver still walking solemnly in middle who be in hiding be torn by conflicting desire first impulse be to remain enjoy spectacle of crestfallen henniker marching forth from late prison somehow rough boy a be not much given to chivalric scruple sound of tremble in henniker voice with recollection of part have taken in punishment made feel a if after best thing must do be not to remain to follow others down stair a be doing so ten o'clock bell rang for morning class naturally sought schoolroom where with mr hashford in desk school be assembled just a if nothing have happened hawkesbury be only absentee certainly admired mr hashford on occasion appeared to be only person in room who be not thoroughly uncomfortable indeed a went on with work almost pleasantly entered into with felt getting comfortable too must hardly believe that usher now instructing have hour ago be prisoner that so recently have be shouting word of mutiny defiance over school be like dream after not very nice dream be recalled to ourselves when presently along passage outside door there resounded footstep instinct told belonged to henniker not much chance of feeling comfortable with sound in one ear to surprise comfort passed on descended stair be like reprieve to convicted felon class went on clock be getting on to twelve usual hour for break when door opened mr ladislaw put in head said smith will step down to study mr hashford mid day bell will not ring till one to day smith solemnly followed master from room for hour worked in class one of at rate feeling very anxious not little uneasy when bell did ring went down stair not knowing exactly what be to become of first thought be what have become of smith be not in playground where wandered about listlessly for quarter of hour before dinner be to be seen when presently assembled in memorable parlour for mid day repast be not very grand meal dinner partook of cold remains of joint one of have made woeful attempt to cook day before now tasted anything delicious miss henniker be in usual place a sat with eye rigidly fixed on plate before be conscious of glancing once twice towards one of then turning away to speak to mr ladislaw who be also present except for whispered conversation of two not word be uttered during meal even flanagan when in reaching salt knocked over water did not receive expected bad mark be left silently to mop up spill a best must be terrible meal anxiety about friend smith made worse dinner be over be descending to afternoon class in mr ladislaw study when front door opened hawkesbury entered must see be taken aback utterly astonished to see mr ladislaw miss henniker at liberty once more at old task for moment face looked concerned doubtful then suddenly changing broke out into smile a ran up to mr ladislaw oh mr ladislaw cried miss henniker be so glad really must bear to be in school while be treating so shamefully where have be hawkesbury said mr ladislaw oh went out in hope of being able to have told one of what have occurred said mr ladislaw sternly oh said smiling hawkesbury really went out because must bear to be in school be unable to do anything for miss henniker be so glad have got out none of have spirit to protest must see that hawkesbury statement expressed joy at liberation have gone down with mr ladislaw miss henniker at expense too yet dared not expostulate do justice afternoon school went on still smith appeared be locked up in coal hole in one of attic up stair wondered have be given into custody what solution came to mystery afternoon evening worked silently on conscious that henniker eye be upon aware that spoke interfered with bedtime came at last in strange trouble anxiety went up almost made up mind to ask mr hashford mr ladislaw what have become of smith must not screw courage up to pitch a be undressing hawkesbury came near whispered where be smith vouchsafed reply have be used to give hawkesbury credit for good intention have have confidence shaken by day event be cross with batchelor said really deserve why did desert leave in lurch growled did not mean to do said very meekly really when woke morning felt be doing wrong batchelor must not bear to stay in stand by while mr ladislaw miss henniker be kept shut up be really reason thought must be kinder of to keep out of way not spoil fun smith quite misunderstood did really why did say must join before began asked why because know be in bad frame of mind then be angry tried hard to forgive blame very much that even seemed to agree must think too hardly of batchelor said nothing went on undressing more perplexed than ever to know what to think hawkesbury after warm good night left be thankful at rate for prospect of few hour sleep forgetfulness be just getting into bed have turned back clothes to do so when suddenly caught sight of scrap of paper appearing from under pillow first supposed must be remnant of last night sport on taking out found that be note carefully rolled up addressed to in smith well known hand with eager haste unfolded read be expelled good bye write j ' post office packworth expelled sent off at hour notice without even word of good bye first sensation be selfish a curled up in bed with note fast in hand felt utterly wretched to know only friend only comfort have at stonebridge house have be taken away what must do without expelled where have gone to then packworth knew be large town about ten mile from brownstroke where uncle now then went on business did jack live there then if did why have never told at rate must get over see in holiday write to how be that possible here unless indeed unless must smuggle letter into post poor jack expelled why must be expelled more than of except hawkesbury what fury have be in with hawkesbury very morning certainly hawkesbury be aggravating strange that friend smith hawkesbury that friend jack jack hawk here in piteous muddle of mind spirit fell asleep remained year at stonebridge house after jack smith have be expelled did not get single holiday during period so that scheme of walking over from brownstroke finding out at packworth never came off only contrived to write to once be first time sunday after have left when henniker saw dropping letter into post after be closely watched need hardly say if jack ever wrote to never got letter still cherished memory of friend even when stonebridge house be most desolate found consolation in feeling pretty sure have friend somewhere be more than one can say made steady progress with arithmetic other study during year thanks to mr hashford who good fellow that be took special pain with so at end of year be pronounced competent to take situation a office boy junior clerk like post to amiable uncle might destine be not sorry to leave stonebridge house a may guess during last year certainly thing be better than have be reference be made on occasion either in public in private to great rebellion of summer henniker never quite got over shake have have when rose in arm against mr ladislaw appeared proportionately subdued so on whole thing be rather more tolerable for lack of lost friend managed to improve acquaintance of good natured flanagan besides retaining favour of smiling hawkesbury so passed year at end of found wiser sadder boy with back turned at length on stonebridge house face towards wide wide world chapter nine how replied to advertisement waited for answer day that witnessed departure from stonebridge house found be bound to confess very little improved by year two residence under dull roof blame on school even on miss henniker depressing a be there be reason why even at school for backward troublesome boy fellow must improve if gave mind to be just where failed did give mind to in fact made up mind be use trying to improve therefore did try consequence be that after jack smith left cast in lot with rest of backward troublesome boy lost ambition to be much better than rest of flanagan fellow liked best be always good humoured lively be not sure that must have be called boy of good principle at rate never professed to be particularly ambitious in such way in respect be very different from hawkesbury who by time left stonebridge house six month before to go to big public school have quite impressed with worth of character be digression a be saying left stonebridge house good deal wilder more rackety more sophisticated than have entered two year before however left also with considerably more knowledge of addition subtraction multiplication division that in uncle eye appeared to be of far more moment than moral condition fred said to day after have got home after have returned from triumphant march through brownstroke to show off to old comrade generally cad prog in particular fred said uncle be going to send to london to london cried not knowing exactly whether to be delighted astonished alarmed three to london yes must get situation do something to earn living ruminated over announcement uncle continued be old enough to provide for expect to do so there be pause at end of for lack of better remark said sooner start better continued uncle have marked few advertisement in pile of newspaper added pointing to dozen so of paper on table have better take look through tell if see anything must suit whereat uncle resumed writing with paper in arm walked off in rather muddled state of mind to bedroom half way up stair sudden thought occurred to caused to drop burden hurry back to uncle room uncle do know smith of packworth uncle looked up crossly have learned more sense at school sir than that know there be hundred of smith at packworth be crusher meekly departed picking up paper where have dropped completed journey to room have be cherished idea of mine first day got home to make inquiry about friend smith have never occurred to before smith be such very common name now dawned slowly on that to find smith in packworth must be about a simple a to find needle in bottle of hay anyhow must write to now without fear be comfort so turned to newspaper began to read through few of advertisement uncle have considerately marked result be not absolutely exhilarating uncle evidently be not ambitious on account sharp lad wanted to look after shop be first caught sight of next be equally promising page wanted by professional gentleman must be clean well behaved make useful in house attend to boot coal window etcetera good character indispensable be almost grateful to feel that one must give good character by stretch of imagination so at rate be safe from fastidious professional gentleman then came news boy wanted must have good voice apply clerk great central railway station even did not tempt might be noble sphere of life to strive to make voice heard above dozen shrieking engine day long did quite fancy idea in fact a read on on became more more convinced that splendid talent must be simply wasted in london nothing uncle have marked tempted muffin boy work might be pleasant for week till noise of bell have lost novelty boy to learn art of making button hole in brace might perhaps be promising opening printer boy might be very well none of accorded with own idea still le with opinion of own value be getting rather hopeless wondering what on earth must say to uncle when brilliant idea occurred to of looking at of other advertisement uncle have marked of be most tempting junior partner wanted in old established firm whose profit be l year must bring l capital into concern there if only have l fortune must be made at once wanted companion for nobleman son about to travel abroad there again why must try for what must nobleman son require more in companion than be to be found in so travelled on beginning at top of ladder sliding gently down gradually losing not only hope of finding situation to suit also relinquishing previous strong faith in own wonderful merit be ready to give up a bad job go tell uncle must decline kind suggestion when in obscure corner of one paper eye caught following junior clerkship intelligent lad respectable quick at figure wanted in merchant office wage shilling week to commence apply by letter to merrett barnacle company hawk street london jumped up a if have be shot rushed headlong with paper to uncle study look at uncle will do say read please uncle read gravely then pushed paper from absurd must not do at be not one of marked be be awful say uncle let try for uncle stared at looked anxiously at uncle fred said sternly be sorry to see making fool of however be affair not mine uncle be pretty quick at figure said intelligent respectable too suppose added uncle looking at over glass well do a choose will be angry inquired tut tut said uncle rising will do have better write by next post if be bent on doing can write at desk so saying departed leaving very perplexed good deal out of humour with wonderful advertisement however sat down answered six of uncle sheet of paper be torn up before got first sentence to satisfaction six more before letter be done never wrote letter cost agony of labour how feverishly read re read what have written what panic got into about spelling of situation number of l in ability how carefully rubbed out pencil line have ruled how many time repented have not put most before obediently many letter like thought must shorten life perceptibly at last be done when uncle came in showed to with fear trembling watched face anxiously a read humph said looking at suppose do get place wo stick to oh yes will said will work hard get on 'd better said uncle for will have only to depend on posted letter next few day seemed interminable whenever spoke about subject to uncle took care not to encourage over much yet fancied gruff a be be not wholly displeased at cheek in answering merrett barnacle company advertisement successful growled why there will be score of other boy after place expect letter best of lot do besides 'd never have boy up from country when there be so many in london ready for place who be used to work mark word will hear no more about so seemed likely to be day after day went by post brought letter be beginning to think must have to settle down a newspaper boy page after at end of week be so disheartened that must stay in house no longer sallied out cared not whither for day in fresh air a be sauntering along road cart overtook covered baker cart with name painted outside walker baker packworth brilliant idea seized a read legend making sign to youth in charge to stop ran up asked say what must give lift for to packworth what for s'pose say fifty pun note be facetious reply must do with fifty pun note pretty comfortable oh really how much want to go to packworth awfully be such long way to walk what do weigh eh know about seven stone think if be eight stun must take there hop up next moment found bowling merrily along in baker cart among loaf flour bag to packworth jovial driver

daly field marshal there to meet old schoolfellow flanagan have looked forward not little to meeting be secretly glad that must find one of set represented by such respectable flourishing person a doubleday daly when fortnight before smith have hunted up down street to find knew nothing of what be what compared with what did now be determined to make impression on old schoolfellow therefore a have said trimmed up end of trouser with mr nash scissors invested in new cheap necktie carefully doctored seam under armpit with ink blacking thus decorated hurried off to host lodging first thing saw a entered door filled with mortification be flanagan dressed in loud check suit with stick up collar horseshoe scarf pin with cloth spat over boot cuff projected at least two inch from end of coat sleeve felt so shabby disreputable be tempted to turn tail escape have along hoped that flanagan must be got up in style must keep in countenance make feel rather more at home than did among other stylish fellow of set so far from that being case here be most howling swell of before must recover from surprise disappointment felt have seen advanced with old noisy frankness hullo here be how be batchelor here be again eh rather better than henniker parlour eh forgot disappointment for moment in pleasure of meeting in voice manner at least be flanagan of old day why must dress rather more quietly daly be there in glory field marshal a lank cadaverous a ever besides ourselves there be whipcord with straw in mouth one two other fellow belonging to host particular set supper be quite a elaborate good deal more noisy than at doubleday sat next to flanagan hoped to be able to get talk with about old day found be far too much taken up with fun be going on to be very attentive listener so felt more than ever extinguished out of fond hope of making impression on old schoolfellow speedily vanished what be going to do said whipcord when meal be over care said daly card if like oh bother card be reply let have ramble out of door for change hullo whip how be be down on card said field marshal thought always won there be something not very nice in tone of cadaverous man of war roused ire of virtuous whipcord what do mean who say always win at card generally win when be playing against said field marshal look here said whipcord very red in face chewing straw in agitated manner do mean to insinuate cheat at card eh never said anything of kind replied field marshal said generally won be what be use of making as of began to perceive by time mr whipcord be excited by something more than field marshal talk fact be have drunk too much that being so be worse than useless to reason with who say generally win at card shouted will fight one say so if like will take lot of laugh greeted valiant challenge only enraged excited youth more broke out into language seemed to be only too ready to lip again shouted will teach to call cheat will will teach to call blackleg so will will teach to call howling jackass put in field marshal whose chief vocation seemed to be to goad on irate guest yes will teach to call howling jackass cried whipcord turning short round on catching by throat never called howling jackass cried in astonishment alarm yes did young liar heard be cried appealing to company in general sounded precious like voice said one of fellow who a have scarcely opened mouth whole evening must have have rather vivid imagination yes know be knew along said whipcord shifting straw from side to side of mouth glaring at stupidly ferociously be indeed said feeling very uncomfortable never said word whipcord laughed a let go throat began to take off coat watched in amazement surely be not going to make fight looked round beseechingly on company must get comfort out of laughter merriment whipcord divested of coat then of waistcoat then took off necktie collar then let down brace tied handkerchief round waist in manner of belt finally proceeded to roll up shirt sleeve above elbow now then said advancing towards in boxing attitude will teach to call thief be so utterly taken aback by must scarcely believe be not dreaming really did call thief said mean to say wo fight cried adversary sparring up at hold hard cried daly before must answer of course be going to fight give time to peel man look alive batchelor off with coat be not going to fight indeed said in utter bewilderment yes be said flanagan wo be first go in old man will back one two of fellow pulled off coat poor seedy coat remember even then feeling ashamed of worn flannel shirt out at elbow be below have little expected one evening to see will have waistcoat off said daly replied better said flanagan collar too be awful collar be paper one pinned on to shirt in two place cried in desperation at officious offer let alone please oh serene be got pull of perhaps if have have clean linen shirt on with stud down front might have be more tractable in matter of peeling have by time gradually dawned on be in for fight that there be getting out of adversary be bigger than be evidently far more at home with custom of prize ring must fain have escaped what must do meanwhile table be hurriedly pushed into corner of room chair piled up in heap now then cried field marshal who in miraculous manner now appeared a backer to fellow with whom few minute ago have be quarrelling now then be ready there yes said flanagan rolling up shirt sleeve ready now then old man straight out from shoulder know keep toe straight guard forward now then there be in for then being in for only thing be to go through with determined to do adversary advanced towards half prancing with hand high elbow out face red straw jerking about like steam engine might be showy form thought from very little knew of boxing be not good closer approached more convinced of be more hope seemed to have of coming out of affair creditably now reader whoever be before go further ask to remember that be recording in book not what ought to have done what did do will very likely have own opinion a to what must have done under circumstance may think must at cost have declined to fight may think must have summoned police may think must have stood with hand behind back till face be size of football about same colour may think be right in standing up to hit man doing knew to demolish let embarrass judgment duty just now be merely to tell did happen a expected whipcord idea seemed to be to knock out of time at very beginning of encounter therefore during first round found needed effort to frustrate little design without attempting on part to take offensive a be did not altogether succeed for whipcord being taller than must not help coming in for one two downward blow however thanks to hard head seemed more formidable to spectator than really be not half bad be flanagan encouraging comment when in due time retired to side for short breathing space never thought 'd be so well up to be much damaged said well 'd best play steady next round too said second ca hold out long with elbow height if like can have quiet shot two at breastplate just to get hand in for next round advice now quite warmed up to emergency adopted whipcord returned to sledge hammer tactic a carelessly a ever too for more than once got in under guard once amid terrific plaudit got home so flanagan called on chin in manner flattered fairly astonished now then whip what be thinking about cried field marshal be going to let young lick surely time cried daly before bruised one must reply so ended round two from retired covered with dust glory felt very elated be quite pleased with now that have stood up to man seemed perfectly plain have battle in own hand so inwardly resolved if possible to bring affair to end in next round let man off easy conceited as be to amazement consternation whipcord came up to scratch on time being called in entirely new light instead of being careless slogger have taken for went to work now in most deliberate scientific manner gradually dawned on have be played with so far that man be only now beginning to give mind to business as have be poor wretch be before round have well begun be reeling about like ninepin little knowledge of pugilism have thought have be like child play against deliberate downright assault of practised hand did what must be very little laughter of opponent gibe of backer tended to flurry lose head let draw veil over scene opponent be not one of sort to give quarter have have blow of mine on chin in last round have heard laughter cheer greeted be turn now took turn a long a must stand up before seemed a if time must never be called be faint sick face ah that last be finishing stroke must keep foot no longer fell back into flanagan arm amidst perfect roar of laughter applause at moment shame be almost more bitter to than pain then be result of high living be what have got by turning up nose at lot in beadle square aspiring to associate with better be manner in be to make impression on old schoolfellow improve footing with new friend wonder felt ashamed 'd better invest in little raw beefsteak said flanagan be what will do most good be comfort got fight being over everybody lost interest in opponent a if nothing have happened proceeded to re discus question of playing card taking walk be left to put on poor shabby coat without help one noticed a slunk from room even flanagan from whom have at least expected sympathy be too much taken up with others to heed a walked slowly unsteadily that night along london street felt for first time since came to great city utterly friendless miserable when returned to beadle square one have gone to bed except one boy who be sitting up whistling merrily over postage stamp album into be delightedly sticking recent acquisition must not help thinking bitterly how frame of mind contrasted at moment with mine be nice boy lately come kept diary of everything did wrote heard from home week fellow despised called pious young prig because said prayer at night went to chapel on sunday prig not be a happy a king over stamp sight made knew not why tenfold more miserable hullo said stopping whistling a came in there be letter for say if get foreign stamp at office wish 'd save for will look here be jolly brazil one got what be matter heard not word of

young lady be better if johnny dy must read more excitement injury of evening added to sudden terrible news of only friend be too much for exactly know what happened to have idea young larkins be not able to get on with postage stamp much more that evening chapter sixteen how experienced of down ups of fortune reader will hardly accuse of painting in too flattering colour only wish must promise that record of folly must end here ala if have patience to read story to end will find that frederick batchelor folly be too inveterate to be chased away by two black eye piece of bad news for time being be fairly cowed a lay awake that next morning after night of feverish tossing dreaming must think of nothing friend smith ill perhaps dying in hospital at packworth must hing to help might not even go near who must tell if ever must see again then came memory of cowardly refusal to stand up for in absence when be being insulted mocked behind back wonder despised hated life in london without got out of bed determined at cost to turn over new leaf show one be ashamed of what have done a did so became faint sick be obliged to crawl back to bed have time nearly forgotten bruise injury of previous evening be painfully reminded of now gradually misery of exploit returned along with new alarm if smith have caught smallpox from wretched little street boy be not possible nay probable might be beginning with too be not pleasant thought bare suggestion be enough to convince be really becoming ill say be going to get up said young larkins at bedside presently evidently having come to see how be getting on after last night sensation be queer still be very queer said ca get up think be going to be ill larkins must mind calling at hawk street telling there all right said larkins what be matter with be not quite sure be afraid have got spot coming out on face eh face be black blue there be big bump on one cheek be there then must be so larkins 'd better not stand too near be afraid have smallpox larkins face grew alarmed jaw dropped what smallpox oh say batchelor hope not look more like a if 'd be fighting be smallpox coming on said mournfully be sure perhaps 'd better go said larkins making for door will tell at office with bolted suddenly rather pleased to imagine sensation news must occasion not only down stair among mr nash lodger also at office must hear sound of eager voice below followed by what fancied be hurried stampede of company from house then presently mr nash foot sounded on stair opened door have have mr nash cried a appeared made answer walked up straight to bed what be nonsense about demanded be afraid be smallpox be so sorry on account said quite meekly sort of felt coming on day added quite convinced in own mind have be so to astonishment good lady expressed surprise sympathy fiddlestick said come get up get up cried in astonishment ca possibly mr nash tried just now must stand stuff nonsense ought to be ashamed of going fighting with parcel of young rough over night then shamming illness in morning because dare show black eye to governor come get round with of nonsense up get will start sweep out room before be dressed be in vain protested pleaded have to rise dizzy sick a felt to huddle on clothes go down stair utterly horrified at such inhuman treatment mr nash even expected now be up must go to office positively declared must not do be therefore permitted to make a comfortable a must in cheerless parlour there wait for further development of malady towards mid day began to feel hungry dared not ask mr nash for anything must be so unlike invalid rang bell implored to send for doctor finally promised to do in interval began to feel more more like be very aggravating to be sure unless came quickly doctor must hardly think ill at yet must be ill even though cost effort when doctor did arrive did best by putting on pained expression of countenance by breathing rather hard closing eye occasionally to make feel have not come for nothing somehow did quite succeed smiled pleasantly a just touched pulse gave single glance at protruded tongue there be nothing wrong with except black eye so fighting suppose boy will be boy send to bed early to night mr nash will be right in morning what about about smallpox inquired forgetting that during last speech have be lying with eye closed apparently unconscious doctor laughed noisily mr nash joined in chorus will see about when catch young fighting cock replied then went then have really got nice fool have made of larkins have of course announced to lodger at mr nash to employer fellow clerk here be while a right a trivet with nothing bruised face empty stomach afflicting be ever luck like mine took care to be in bed before fellow got home that evening

must have seen how blue looked what sell will be when turn up serene be pleasant 'd better not be too sure said still clinging to ailment may be after doctor said be to go to bed early to night keep quite quiet 'd advise not to stay in room larkins oh right good night said larkins going to door heard whistling merrily down stair felt still more uncomfortable however merciful sleep ended trouble for season slept like top night woke next morning a fresh well a have ever be in life only thing wrong with be colour of face be certainly rather brilliant have to endure regular broadside of quizzing from fellow lodger that morning at breakfast certainly did not tend to cheer up in prospect of presenting shortly at hawk street must fain have be spared that ceremony there arrived a be starting out hurried line from mr shield announcing that jack be much same of course meant be still very ill poor jack have be so taken up with own fancied ailment have scarcely thought of a be must hardly realise that be so very ill little have imagined that evening when caught up half murdered urchin in arm carried to lodging what result of act must be to one of yet if be to do again fancied friend smith must do again whatever cost to think of being so ill possibly losing life for graceless young vagabond who clean ' e boot do y hear clean e boot sir looking towards sound saw very object of thought in

passing yielded eventually to youth solicitation therefore resumed walk to office with good deal more to think of than have when started if have desired to make sensation at hawk street must hardly have done better than turn up morning a usual be picture to see fellow face of alarm bewilderment astonishment finally of merriment have heard be laid up with smallpox a friend smith be also ill of same malady considered a natural on part highly proper have in fact faced prospect of getting on without be quite prepared to exist accordingly partner too have talked matter over come to decision of advertising again without delay for new clerk to take place very morning be intending to draw up advertisement send to paper under circumstance appeared unexpectedly just a usual on hawk street horizon not just a usual have appeared just a usual might have be easier for company generally to believe be really sound when face presented brilliant combination of most of colour of rainbow effect be rather sensational why if be not batchelor exclaimed doubleday not however advancing open armed to meet edging towards far end of desk dexterously insinuating crow wallop between precious person why heard have smallpox so thought yesterday said gravely half aggravated still that have be defrauded of distinction oh did did said doubleday gradually working back to own seat well have got something on face to show for have wallop look a if 'd be painting up for south sea island observed wallop be rather showy tint of yellow down left cheek said crow very fashionable colour just now did lay on said doubleday did get one to help oh said in a off hand manner a must be having little box with whipcord up at field marshal be there by way doubleday whipcord rather good hand be said doubleday laughing exuberantly with wallop crow a chorus must never have supposed that by face now must fellow strike got big box instead of smallpox eh have have wonder at whipcord standing up to said crow be such quiet fellow doe know in least what to do with hand have best of said well know doe do to trust to appearance if did one might suppose have rather hope will ask up when have return match did see much fun in witticism however appeared to afford great merriment to company generally so much so that when mr barnacle presently opened door caught whole counting house laughing what tomfoolery be demanded looking angrily round seem to forget of that come here to work not to play if want to play can go somewhere else there so saying passed into private room slamming door ill temperedly behind be not encouraging for who of course have to report contradict rumour regarding illness gave quartet of hour so to quiet down partly in hope that mr merrett might meanwhile arrive a event did not happen a doubleday informed that advertisement for new clerk be to be sent out that morning made up mind there be nothing to be gained by further delay therefore made venture found anything comfortable a stood before mr barnacle desk stammeringly began statement please sir why what be sir demanded mr barnacle sternly be told yesterday be ill so be sir believed be going to have smallpox doctor say be not doe account for face being in state pray sir got that boxing be fighting most discreditable conduct be that have to say yes sir be sorry be away yesterday well now listen to what have to say said mr barnacle laying down pen leaning forward in chair have not be doing well lately batchelor have watched have watched work like be mistaken in sir be idle sir unless improve sha' keep week mind indeed sir began hold tongue sir said mr barnacle have room in office for boy of kind unless change must go somewhere else have played fool quite enough here must fain have replied to justify in junior partner present temper attempt must have be hazardous so said nothing returned to work determined for own credit a well a in own interest to show mr barnacle that have judged harshly how worked that week refused invitation after invitation stayed late after one else have gone to get ahead with work during office hour steadily abstracted from what be going on round determined that nothing must draw from task even volunteered for undertook work not strictly own greatly to amazement of everybody especially wallop who began to think there really must be something in rumour be not well while most assiduously doctored face gradually came to resume normal complexion must see that burst of industry be having due effect in high quarter mr barnacle who after lecture have treated gruffly abruptly for day began again to treat civilly mr merrett bestowed once twice special commendation on industry in due time so far from feeling repentant idler have grown to consider one of most virtuous industrious well principled clerk in london in proportion a conviction got hold of application to work relaxed one event especially completed self satisfaction about three week after interview with mr barnacle be summoned into partner room there informed that having now be eight month in service proving useful in situation salary must henceforth be twelve shilling week must hardly believe ear why be just half a much again a what have be receiving on eight shilling week have lived economically not so badly now what might not do with twelve shilling week doubleday insisted on coming up to lodging that evening to celebrate joyful event with quiet supper invitation accepted first for nearly month in view of occasion spent first extra four shilling in anticipation on coloured oxford shirt grandly requested with air of moneyed man to be put down to account found quite hero of party that evening one be there have affecting reconciliation with whipcord forgot about flanagan desertion daly indifference in hour of tribulation discoursed condescendingly with field marshal about hopeless attachment promised to go for row up river one saturday with twin time of supper be mentally calculating cost of doubleday entertainment wondering whether must venture to give party in fact be so much taken up with own good fortune new rise in life must think of nothing else forgot former warning humiliation forgot that even with twelve shilling week have barely enough to clothe respectably forgot that one of fellow be in habit of laughing at behind back forgot good resolution to live steadily till jack came back forgot about poor jack now so letter have told convalescent slowly recovering health still lying lonely weary in packworth hospital indeed that evening name only twice crossed mind once when doubleday crow be laughing over prospect of bull eye turning up with face deeply marked with late disease once when walking back to beadle square full of new plan of extravagance chanced to pas small boy curled up on doorstep with head resting on shoeblack box light of neighbouring lamp shining full on sleeping face then remembered how not very long ago have seen that same head lying side by side with jack head on pillow at mr nash a stood for moment to look must almost have believed that sleeping figure there with vulgarity dishonesty have a good title to call jack smith friend a have chapter seventeen how gave little supper to of friend idea of giving party of own to new friend in return for hospitality to be not by mean new one have be simmering in mind for week past indeed ever since began to be invited out thought must not return compliment have always be drawback to pleasure there have always be two obstacle in way of carrying out wish first be lack of fund second be mr nash on eight shilling week have come to conclusion be out of question to dream of giving party to eight person by most modest calculation must possibly do thing decently under shilling head be true have uncle half sovereign in pocket still might reflected borrow that pay back by weekly instalment somehow did like idea quite never brought to point of carrying into effect now however with sudden rise in fortune recorded in last chapter financial obstacle to hospitality be quite swept away have only to take extra four shilling week for two week thing be done so idea no longer simmered in mind boiled be determined for once in way to astonish friend though one obstacle have vanished other remained what must mr nash say for much a disliked be forced to face fact that party if gave must have to come off in beadle square have half thought of borrowing flanagan room for occasion did like to ask besides if did must have to be party half mine be at idea then occurred to must take lodging for week give there no must cost too much even for twelve shilling week uncle if heard of might stop keep at mr nash suppose hired room at hotel for evening asked fellow there be bad idea must probably only cost week wage worst of be if ask fellow to dine with at hotel be sure to come expecting grand turn out doubted talent to provide anything grand besides hotel people must be sure to want to supply thing ask for money in advance if did humour must to certainty turn crusty critical spoil party for only thing be to make best of beadle square to end determined to tackle mr nash at once may fancy good woman surprise scorn when propounded to ambitious scheme give party fiddlestick will hing of sort please mr nash pleaded will be very quiet one promise where do expect to have wonder said in coal cellar suppose be only spot in house ai occupied oh replied thinking judicious to laugh at facetious suggestion 'd like parlour for evening if must manage mr nash what be going to ask fellow here to party then oh must let know parlour engaged for evening just for once know 'd pay something dare say must 'd pay anything must what be going to give to eat eh oh will see to said be unfortunate reply of mine mr nash a happened be inclined to enter into scheme have only known must have offered to take trouble to help answer of mine offended sorely oh very well said loftily want can see be just a glad in vain protested implored not to be vexed have meant at must possibly do without be beast to say what have so on most must get out of be vague promise might have room on evening in question a for entertainment washed hand of whole affair be inclined to give up not that have ever imagined must help to have downright unfriendly at time must knew ruin thing totally for day must listen to nothing at on subject be look out said to appeal let see what sort of hand will make of beauty be in despair longed to issue invitation till mr nash be squared be out of question to name happy day be evidently useless to argue matter best thing must do be to let alone allow to imagine scheme have be abandoned in calculation be correct day afterwards happening to be in parlour with after breakfast said when grand party a call coming off mr batchelor started up in rapture at question then will help mr nash cried running up to taking for granted first looked amazed then angry finally smiled never said so be sight too independent for taste be ai goin ' to put finger into where ai wanted be wanted will be brick know cried almost hugging in eagerness battle be won that morning went down to office positively jubilant party be fixed for thursday felt particularly important when time came for inviting doubleday crow to festive assembly have rehearsed a walked along very word tone must use on account must suppose giving of party be momentous event really proved by way doubleday said in a off hand manner a must assume after preliminary talk on different matter by way must come up to supper on thursday just usual lot know must have kicked for way blushed stammered a be delivering short oration doubleday gazed at curiously half perplexed eh supper oh rather where be to be mansion house guildhall did like be what have expected oh up at place know beadle square said at doubleday fairly laughed supper at place at black beadle square oh rather will come will come too crow eh young un got supper on on thursday oh rather put down for old man must anything have be more mortifying most invitation be received politely graciously what there be to laugh at about mine must understand oh yes crow coming said meekly at least hope so oh rather said crow beaming must miss for lot be evening dress what be too much disconcerted crestfallen to answer question avoided two prospective guest for rest of day already be half repenting venture there be drawing back now letter message came from rest of usual lot twin flanagan field marshal daly whipcord one of saying 'd be there yes there be nothing left to go through with next two day be two of most anxious day ever spent be running about one afternoon when ought to have be delivering bill of lading inquiring price of lobster pork pie orange other delicacy arranging for hire of cup saucer ordering butter egg jam other such arduous delicate duty then spent evening in discussing with momentous question whether must lay in tea cake penny bun whether need have brown bread a well a white whether mr nash tea must be good enough whether must help great dish eel pie trust to one of company to do similar momentous matter engaged thought began to dawn on further that financial estimate have be greatly out that supper must cost nearer pound than ten shilling never mind after be not worth twelve shilling week need trouble about expense besides pastrycook have agreed to give credit so that really must have comparatively little to pay down far more serious anxiety be mr nash required constant most assiduous attention to keep in good temper nearer time came more touchy got if suggested anything took a personal slight to herself if be bold enough to differ from be mortally offended if ventured to express slightest impatience turned crusty threatened to let shift for affair too naturally got wind amongst fellow lodger who one avowed that must not give up right to parlour indulged in manner of witticism at cost cost of party pacified a best must by promising reversion of feast took meekly gibe jest when begged to be allowed to come in to dessert hear speech volunteered to come hand round champagne clear away turtle soup so on nearer fatal day came more dejected nervous got mr nash parlour be really disreputable sort of room after have have experience of supper be positive must not know what to do when time came have flow of conversation of doubleday store of story of daly whipcord sporting gossip twin self possessed humour if guest must turn critical be lost man knew how wished be safe on other side of awful thursday day came at last hurried home a hard a must after business to make final preparation eel pie be arriving a got there heart be comforted by sight something at least be ready joy be short lived for mr nash be in temper fact be have unconsciously neglected piece of advice of hers in matter of very eel pie have said have hot have told pastrycook to deliver cold therefore mr nash just at critical moment deserted with feeling of desperation laid own tablecloth not very good one arranged a best must plate dish time be getting short be use wasting time on crabby landlady yet what must do without who be to lend kettle saucepan for egg toasting fork for matter of of material of war be clear must at hazard regain mr nash next half hour be spent in frantic appeal to emotion possessed to drawing of abject picture of own helplessness to profuse apology compliment coaxing never worked so hard in life a did that half hour happily be not in vain consented at rate to look after one two of matter in be most helpless be duly infinitely thankful in due time be ready hour arrived terror returned felt tempted to bolt from house leave guest to entertain hated beadle square there of course just when must have liked thing to be at best there be three four cat setting up most hideous concert in yard chimney in parlour beginning to smoke must have torn hair with rage vexation seized tongs be kneeling down vigorously pushing up chimney to ascertain cause of last misfortune when loud double knock at door startled nearly out of sens have never realised what be in for till now horror of horror who be to open door mr nash have never settled while stood trembling amid smoke eel pie half boiled knock be repeated time so long loud that must have be heard over square must hear voice laughter outside one asked be shop voice said see name on door then terrified lest must perpetrate solo on knocker rushed out opened door just a mr nash with face scarlet sleeve tucked up above elbow also appeared in passage be there have come down in body oh how shabby felt a saw there with fine clothes free easy manner hullo here be said doubleday found out then at last have be way for age knew at once by cat hullo be mother how do mr batchelor glad to see allow to introduce be not mother cried with suppressed groan pulling arm eh not mother aunt perhaps how do whispered relation not be pity be tidy looking old body too say where do stick hat eh bag door handle hang yours on key crow come on in fellow here be spree must anything be more distressing humiliating mr nash too indignant for word have vanished to own kitchen shutting door behind with ominous slam here be hall chock full of staring giggling fellow with not place to hang hat doubleday already self constituted master of ceremony mildly suggested have better bring hat inside insisted on stacking a field marshal called in pyramid form on hall floor let have way come in faltered presently when little diversion appeared to be ended a led way into parlour heart be in boot mistake entered coughing very much at smoke what seedy disreputable hole mr nash parlour appeared at moment be chimney smoking said wo sit down invitation know why seemed only to add to amusement of party daly proceeded to sit down on floor chair being

harnessing of horse when be done sought for hawkesbury do think be safe for whipcord to drive in state be in oh yes with horse like too be pretending to be great deal worse than be just to horrify seemed age before actually started whipcord in most quarrelsome humour have to be dragged almost by force from bar hawkesbury at last moment discovered that be going without paying bill while masham having once made comfortable in bar parlour flatly refused to be moved have finally to be left behind only consolation in be have tail of dogcart to myself be infinitely preferable to odious society of masham be nearly six when finally started from windsor turned horse head homeward have be day enjoyment chapter twenty six how fell badly be picked up in way little expected delightful picnic to have looked forward with such satisfaction have certainly not come off a expected be not yet over for drive home under conduct of mr whipcord promised to be most exciting portion of whole day a long a be in country road unsteadiness of jehu did not so much matter for be sober enough to keep horse upon road though hardly fit to steer past other vehicle however be marvellous how did get on what hairbreadth escape have be useless attempting to remonstrate with fellow be in quarrelsome mischievous humour must brook protest once very soon after starting in passing country cart a nearly a possible upset against misadventure whipcord immediately set down a deliberate insult intended for nothing must satisfy to avenge then there leaped down off dogcart heedless of what became of horse throwing off coat shouted to countryman to come on invitation countryman answered with crack of whip made doughty hero leap a high into air a have ever done in life a might be expected incident did not tend to pacify outraged feeling of tipsy whipcord who disappointed of vengeance on countryman be most pressing in invitation to hawkesbury of to dismount have out indeed be so eager for satisfaction that pulled off seat on to road must have done so quite have not horse given start at moment put out of reach nearly upset in dust thing certainly did not look promising for nice quiet drive home with difficulty coaxed back into trap where at once began to vent spleen on horse in manner put that animal temper to grand test further insisted on pulling up at wayside inn for refreshment until became quite evident if ever reached london at must certainly not do so till nearly midnight held hurried consultation with hawkesbury a to what ought to be done think suggested have almost better go on by ourselves leave behind oh said hawkesbury must never do must be honourable occurred to must not be much le honourable than inviting fellow to quiet picnic letting in for expedition like well said suppose let drive home go back other way forget be responsible for trap 'd better go on a be have not come to grief so far perhaps though said 'd sooner drive what be about sooner drive shouted whipcord coming up at moment who 'd sooner drive young batchelor right off with coat threw on in pugilistic attitude after long delay got once more under way vehicle travelling more unsteadily than ever misgiving a to ever reaching london becoming momentarily more numerous how ever got back ca imagine unless be that after time whipcord finally dropped rein allowed horse to find own way home certainly thought be driving fancy truth be that one of ostler on road seeing condition have cunningly looped rein round front rail of trap so drive must must not do much more harm than if be sitting idle at lateness of hour frequent light announced that london must be near be fortunate be so late must certainly have come to grief in first crowded street a be whipcord have already got command of rein again a sudden jerk shy of horse testified impulse be to avoid danger by quietly jumping down from seat leaving other two to proceed alone somehow seemed shabby proceeding to leave hawkesbury in lurch besides even if have overcome that scruple seat be so high that at unsteady rate be going must run considerable risk by jumping so determined to hold on hope for best got safely down oxford street thanks to emptiness be just proceeding towards holborn when whipcord gave horse sudden turn down side street to right where be going cried be straight on pulled up immediately bidding hawkesbury hold rein pulled off coat for twentieth time invited to come have out on pavement be fool said hawkesbury drive on now there be good fellow what doe want to tell way to drive for demanded outraged charioteer did mean to offend did batchelor drive on now whipcord get out of narrow street with much persuasion whipcord resumed coat seized rein think know way to drive growled will teach have be standing up adding endeavour to hawkesbury to pacify companion when suddenly lashed furiously at horse wretched animal already irritated beyond endurance gave wild bound forward threw off foot before must put out hand to save pitched backwards into road be conscious of falling with heavy crash against kerb with arm under of seeing dogcart tearing down street then everything seemed dark remember nothing more when did recover consciousness be lying in strange room on strange bed took effort to remember what have occurred dull pain over reminded gradually more

now said putting note into hand will help to square account with hawkesbury of others mind pay back do hear before must even turn to speak to have bolted round corner vanished chapter thirty how paid off score made rather awkward discovery stood staring at five pound note flanagan have left in hand in state of utter bewilderment first impulse be to give chase to benefactor compel to take back money second be to hing of sort rejoice with thankfulness over help thus unexpectedly sent be little enough have done to deserve one kindness be only too reasonable to expect to have to get out of own trouble here like good fairy old irish schoolfellow have stepped on to scene sent trouble to right about with single turn of hand what rejoicing jack have that night over good fortune what careful plan made for systematic repayment of loan how jubilantly looked forward to handing hawkesbury back thirty shilling in morning since have received that letter of wrath have somewhat abated towards

appearance very clever man there be honest ring about said made feel have only known in month past might have be spared many of folly trouble at last there be step in hall outside door opened what be amazement consternation when beheld in edward good clergyman son hawkesbury consternation however hardly exceeded on seeing who father visitor be a for clergyman sight of mutual astonishment fairly took aback be minute at least before one must sufficiently recover surprise to speak during interval great fear be how smith must act knew detested hawkesbury believed to be hypocrite deceiver knew too that be rarely able to contain when face to face with fellow how must behave now guest in father house must not imagine fool be be always doubting friend why how be said mr hawkesbury seem to know one yes said hawkesbury here be at merrett barnacle company with smith how very curious said clergyman to be sure knew name mine well a know one need introduce father said hawkesbury standing still at door want to speak to moment please yes presently come in now edward be waiting to begin supper now what odd coincidence to come across in way want to speak to father again said hawkesbury father looked vexed a turned towards son smith rose at same moment said holding out hand to mr hawkesbury think if will excuse have better go sir what before supper why how be think son must rather not have here said jack solemnly father looked in amazement first at then at son who once more asked to speak to father good man in evident bewilderment begged to excuse for moment jack taking arm once more said before host must leave room good night sir thank very much for kindness before well knew where be be standing out in street chapter thirty one how made still more important discovery few evening after awkward discovery recorded in last chapter mr hawkesbury called at lodging looked troubled constrained a kind a usual came to tell how sorry be to have be deprived of company that evening to offer sort of apology for son conduct fear from what tell that get on very happily together at office be so sorry for must have liked to be friend be hardly possible to tell father frankly what thought of son so replied vaguely get on very well be sorry to say fact be said jack never have be friend told so greatly to sorrow suppose also told why asked jack glancing sharply at clergyman latter looked disturbed trifle confused a replied did tell something told be convict son said jack quietly what exclaimed clergyman with involuntary start what did tell that poor boy never told that be quietly said jack be amazed at composure with said looked visitor in face a did so face be full of pity sympathy not shade of horror crossed for be hawkesbury father liked more than ever do mind telling what did say about asked jack presently will not talk about said clergyman jack looked disposed for moment to persevere in demand father troubled face disarmed poor edward have have great disadvantage began in half apologetic half melancholy way often fear be to blame have thought too much of work out of door too little of duty to have not be to that father must be said more in way of talking to than of addressing saw jack colour up at last reference hastened to change subject felt quite sorry for when rose to go evidently knew son failing only too well with father love tried to cover must see how in said be almost pleading with to befriend boy to be more than painful to hear talk thus to speak to a if be paragon of virtue to apologise to for defect of own son be more than must endure when started to go asked if might walk with gladly assented then poured into ear whole story of folly struggle trouble in london will never forget kind way in listened still kinder way in talked when have heard be not going to repeat talk here reader may guess for what simple christian minister must have to say to one in case how must say neither preached lectured broke out into exclamation have done so must probably have be flurried frightened away talked to a father to son rather a big brother to young one entering into trouble difficulty even claiming share in be long time since have have talk with one did good uneventful week two followed occasionally saw mr hawkesbury at lodging for smith must never bring to point of again visiting rectory indeed be now so busily engaged in evening preparing for coming examination that have time for nothing even education of lively billy temporarily devolved on be not till after regular battle royal that young gentleman must be brought to submit to be larned by one own special bloke even when did yield under threat of actual expulsion from school made point of comparing everything did said with far superior manner in smith did said that for time be rather uphill work at length however quieted down displayed small aptitude for instruction be decidedly encouraging at office hawkesbury ever since uncomfortable meeting at father have be very constrained in manner to jack attempting no longer to force society on indeed relapsing into almost mysterious reserve surprised more of who knew than two self a doubleday said who have never quite got over sense of injury have shut up with petty cash left to get on best must without smith must both for father sake have liked if possible to befriend do good turn seemed studiously to avoid giving opportunity be now a distant to a have once be to however in other respect life at hawk street proceeded pleasantly enough not least pleasant thing being further rise in salary event enabled to set aside so much more week to repay flanagan generous loan a well a to clear finally of debt thing be going on thus smoothly be beginning to seem a if tide of life be

mr smith in hoarse otherwise composed voice good night said jack wish 'd get rid of cold night work must be bad for mr smith shook hand with in silence quitted room heard footstep go strangely down stair door shut behind in room below did feel comfortable be afraid be ill more ill than wished of to suspect be only way in must account for spasm preluded that last fit of coughing if be so must be naturally anxious to conceal fact from jack on eve of examination must account for abrupt interruption of question however have examination to morrow be determined if possible to know truth about friend very evening sat by while jack wrote letter thinking interminable wondering what must have to say to fill two sheet when be done insisted on taking to post be after ten now said really ought to

to be one bristling with difficulty on hand day sense of coming ordeal haunted even custody of petty cash must not wholly divert mind be therefore quite relieved that evening on returning to lodging to hear a ascended stair voice speaking in room to find jack have visitor must at least get time to recover wit near approach of ordeal have scattered for moment wondered whether jack visitor must be mr smith be man voice unless be mr smith mr hawkesbury be at loss to guess who must be to astonishment found on entering room that visitor be other than uncle have brought here jack looked a if tete tete have not be very cheerful one for jumped up at arrival with evident joy cried oh here be at last here uncle fred come to see be afraid must have to go before got back at least be comfort uncle be

appeared to be addressed to jack allowed to answer for well said uncle after few more similar inquiry have be satisfactorily answered hope what tell be true may seem a if did not care much what became of fred a long a went on in way did more did have chosen friend might get on best must with now if have done what say have given up at moment there be sudden tumult on stair outside made start be sound of scuffling laughter shouting in midst of uncle voice be drowned whoever visitor be appeared not to be quite sure of quarter for be trying door came to on way up at length came nearer voice tone of be only too familiar shouted come on fellow will smoke out batchelor ahoy there wonder if life on roof be whipcord voice whom have not seen since accident who now have fixed on evening of others to come with friend pay visit be whipcord said to jack must come in let barricade door anything to keep out jack who looked fully a alarmed a did be quite ready to agree uncle who have hitherto be astounded witness of interruption interfered said will come in be of reformed friend suppose mr fred 'd like to see let come in oh uncle cried in agitation must come in indeed must be a shouting outside increased twofold at same moment door be flung open whipcord crow field marshal twin daly masham burst into room be wonder if a looked first at then at uncle feeling of utter despair took possession of be evidently in highly festive state of mind ready for diversion here be cried whipcord who appeared to be leader of party here be batch boy got address at police station came to look up oh say what glorious old codger last note of admiration be directed to uncle who sat sternly back in chair gazing at intruder with mingled wrath astonishment say introduce batch said field marshal to other aristocrat too will why be bull eye cried crow know twin fellow told about who be oh be botany bay hero be cried masham must shake hand with one doe get chance of saying how d 'ye do to real gaol bird day how be treadmill jack whose face be very pale whose eye flashed fiercely remained motionless with evident effort a masham held out hand what think be good enough for doe said masham so used to handcuff said abel doe know how to use hand be know yet who old weathercock be cried whipcord turning again to uncle what do call at home old stick in mud nudged in rib by way of emphasis be time interposed hitherto in sheer helplessness have stood by watched invasion with silent despair now however that uncle seemed to be in danger of rough handling something must be done if fellow have pretence to be called gentleman shouted in tone choked with mingled shame anger will leave jack room mine jack who be jack be old pawnbroker called jack then oh say fellow cried whipcord dropping on chair nearly choking with fit of laughter oh fellow have got at last have got jack know who be who be cried others why ca guess yelled whipcord who jack ketch new idea be taken up with utmost rapture uncle be forthwith dubbed with fresh title three cheer for uncle ketch fellow shouted whipcord cheer be given with great hubbub then uncle be called upon for speech a declined proposal be made to compel up to time protest a well a resistance have seemed worse than useless jack be only two against seven visitor be hardly in condition to give fair play even if did come to blow wrath have be gradually approaching boiling point now time seemed to have come to brave consequence assert whipcord masham have seized one of uncle arm with view to carry out threat when by mutual impulse jack assumed defensive rushed into fray adversary be of course utterly unprepared for such demonstration in consequence before must either of take in state of affair be sprawling at full length on floor whole action be so rapidly executed that be not for moment two that rest of party took in fact that affair be something more than joke when however did so general engagement ensued in jack even with unlooked for gallant aid of uncle must do very little against superior number what upshot might have be whether must have be eventually ejected from own lodging whether invader must presently have wearied of sport made off of own accord can not say just a thing be looking at worst for opportune diversion occurred turned tide of battle be none other than simultaneous arrival of billy flanagan latter recollected have promised to look in during evening to see how jack have fared at examination in general confusion new comer entered room almost unnoticed unexpected scene met eye in usually quiet quarter naturally alarmed be second more before in midst of riot must make out what be matter billy be first to recover sight of jack smith being attacked by masham be quite enough for with cry of do hear let be sprang upon patron assailant like young tiger poor gallant billy masham taken aback to find thus attacked by small boy who seemed to come from nowhere recoiled for instant before vigorous onslaught be only for instant stepping back leaving others to engage jack seized boy by arm dealing blow on side of head flung savagely to floor adding brutal kick a lay there stunned senseless at foot sight of outrage be be wanted to rouse to one desperate effort to rid ourselves of cowardly invader jack closed in instant with masham by sheer force carried to door literally flung from room others one by one followed half ashamed at whole proceeding slunk away of own accord others seeing worsted lost spirit made slight resistance to united assault now vigorously reinforced by flanagan last to leave be whipcord who endeavoured to carry thing off with usual swagger to last well ta ta batch said just looked in to see how be be thanks for jolly evening by bye old jack ketch here in consequence of sudden forward movement from flanagan hurriedly withdrew left for first time that evening with leisure to look about be time however for asking question giving explanation exclamation from jack turned attention to billy who lay still unconscious a white a sheet where have fallen jack gently raised laid on bed open window somebody said air seemed to revive boy somewhat for opened eye looked vacantly round fit of sickness followed partial recovery again swooned jack face be nearly a pale a boy a looked up said fetch doctor quick flanagan darted off almost before word be out of lip there be nothing for who be left behind to do to watch with painful anxiety poor little sufferer who lay mostly unconscious still at interval violently sick masham ruffianly blow kick have evidently done far more damage than one supposed a waited in silence for doctor to come alarm increased even seemed doubtful whether a stood there be not destined to see terrible end to evening proceeding have boy father mother whispered uncle to jack who sat with sufferer head on arm heard question said hurriedly yes must fetch mother fred there be such tone of alarm in voice have billy mother be wild beast must hardly have disobeyed darted off on unenviable quest meeting doctor on stair knew house in court by time be well known to inmate woman be not at home have not be home since morning one knew where be left message apprising of what have happened telling to come at once to lodging then with much foreboding hastened back to drury lane evening have be strangely different one from have expected be to have broken news to jack of father discovery instead of here be rushing frantically about trying to find unhappy woman summon to what for knew might be death bed of son found when returned that billy have somewhat revived be lying back very white still apparently unconscious told doctor have given hope of recovery that fit of sickness have stopped left stronger uncle whose concern for poor boy be scarcely le than ours have relieved jack at patient bedside jack who now that imminent anxiety be over have given way to natural reaction be must see in terrible state of misery rage if dy muttered to will what meant to say know stopped short flung in empty seat by window trembling over have never known before how fond be of poor boy what about mother said presently turning to must find hear of anywhere said left message for just then uncle beckoned with hand billy have opened eye be looking about have done so once twice before always in vacant stupid sort of way now to intense joy there be glimmer of something like old life in pale face especially when catching sight of jack who sprang to side in moment feature broke into faint smile uncle came quietly to across room will go now said more kindly than have ever heard speak will stay in town to night will look in in morning so saying went mr smith accompanied to door a be returning up stair one called after turned saw that new comer be billy mother chapter thirty four how got rid of petty cash of mr smith secret billy mother be for first time in experience sober stayed behind for on stair while mr smith retired to own room saying must come up see in morning wished must have stayed countenanced in interview with unhappy woman what be mister said a came up once possibly billy mother might have be handsome even attractive woman drink have defaced beauty once have have degraded terribly a always doe in body mind billy have be badly hurt said thought ought to come who hurt demanded there be sympathy even concern in tone spoke like person to whom world be enemy in league to do wrong there be struggle said man be hitting mr smith mr smith exclaimed fiercely who be who be mr smith why

of way let go to what must do have right to keep mother from son yet be to carry out threat one must say what result to boy might not be in dilemma thought of mr smith conducted intractable visitor to room in hope that might be able to dissuade from carrying out threat nothing must do say must bring to reason appeared to be persuaded in own mind that whole affair be conspiracy to do wrong that being so entreaty threat even bribe must not put off idea of taking billy away with come now said after ineffectual parley have gone on for time be not going to be made fool of by two more where billy where be hiding be use trying to impose on with gammon be upstairs said feeling that further resistance be worse than useless will run up tell jack be coming billy may be asleep woman caught roughly by arm said want none of scheme plot can go up without help mister so saying broke away from went up stair follow said mr smith fewer up there better jack will manage so spent anxious half hour listening to voice sound of foot above wondering how interview be going on evidently began with altercation once billy shrill treble joined in in way sounded very familiar eventually angry tone of woman ceased presently returned to quiet in manner though still hunted looking mistrustful to relief be alone be coming for in morning said a passed must never make out how jack have subdued put off when asked said simply begged to wait little at rate till boy be better have then promised to bring home night shared mr smith room rather occupied during absence leaving jack billy in possession upstairs reflection during night be not pleasant if have not be for folly sin in time past calamity of evening must never have happened friend of former day be not to be shaken off a easily a have be picked up meanwhile be not who be made to suffer jack billy who have never be guilty of folly sin more than felt burden of mr smith secret still hanging unrelieved on mind how be to get rid of tell jack while anxiety about billy lasted in early morning mr smith returned confided to trouble be very sympathetic agreed with that present be hardly time to tell jack secret yet be plain to see be in terrible suspense till must be over did not sleep much that night in morning hastened to room above to relief found billy much better be even grinning a usual a entered greeted in very like old familiar way what cheer said feebly cheerily be got dose off that there mashing do give yer topper come hush billy said jack pleasantly did tell not to talk yaas said boy relapsing abruptly into silence mother a rather anticipated did not put in appearance uncle did after ascertaining that be going on well went off leaving greatly to astonishment not little to gratification sovereign in hand a said good bye there be something kindly about uncle after leaving mr smith in charge jack went down to office that morning with lighter heart than have expected to have crow be waiting for outside office with anxious face say said a came up not heeding jack wrathful look be true what hear that boy be killed last night who told so demanded jack heard from daly masham have bolted be true then said jack thanks to be coward crow have evidently be too much frightened by news have heard to resent hard name answered meekly be glad be not true be ashamed of affair last night there be harm in telling so be good deal to come from fellow like crow did not reply entered office there for few hour at least hard work drove away other care at dinner time jack rushed home brought back further good report of patient whom doctor have seen pronounced to be making satisfactory progress a for stayed at office made up for lost time of evening before part of work be grand balancing up of petty cash a hawkesbury be due back next morning must then have to be prepared to hand over be small satisfaction to find that account be right to penny to know in fair copy of account drew up ingenuity patience must be able to discover error indeed be so particular that having made minute blot in first fair copy went to trouble of writing out absolutely faultless preserving other in desk a occasional feast to own eye in self satisfied moment that evening be strongly tempted to unburden secret to jack a walked home must not bring up to point at least must not do so till got to door of lodging then be too late for jack have rushed to billy bedside be hopeless to get to think of anything else so have to wait on once more to endure sight of mr smith anxious frightened face following morning brought letter from uncle addressed not to to jack smith contained five pound note said might be useful when billy doctor bill have to be paid anything be over might go to buy boy suit of clothes uncle be certainly coming out in new light be like writing to jack instead of thought nothing of for to send five pound note for benefit of little stranger be certainly novelty surprised a much a encouraged about relative money a happened be very opportune for of be very flush of cash at time billy who be now steadily recovering from shock of blow pleaded very hard to be allowed to get up only jack express command must keep in bed ga on governor said let get up ai getting copper for there penny bang more ai ai larnin nothink knew only too well whom meant may be up to manner of lark not know nothink about will get up soon when be better be jack reply be better governor yes wo be unless lie still for day two more do what be told said jack firmly whereat boy subsided hawkesbury turned up at place at office in benevolent frame of mind received over petty cash beautiful copy of account accompanied with utmost condescension be extremely obliged to said for taking charge of account during absence have doubt must find everything correct when went through figure hoped have not given much extra work that during absence have be in enjoyment of good health spirit gush accepted with due gratitude wondering inwardly whether have be actually made partner since last saw be so very gracious by way said when ceremony be at end feeling little mischievously inclined a well a being anxious to vent feeling on point by way particular friend masham came to lodging other evening ah did said hawkesbury blandly be glad called wanted to see again took rather fancy to that day know did said think be rather sorry called though why why because smith gave thrashing deserved thrashing be not likely to forget in hurry understand said hawkesbury what have smith to do with friend masham just what have to do with other blackguard retorted warming up batchelor be forgetting think said hawkesbury hope what be saying be not true if mean about masham being blackguard said be a true a that be friend really know what mean said hawkesbury haughtily must ask masham be afraid wo find said nearly murdered boy who be with at time a report went out that child be actually dead be prudently keeping out of way for present be sure will be excuse batchelor said hawkesbury interrupting really have time to talk now kindly get on with work will do same may not have derived much good by edifying conversation have at least satisfaction of feeling that hawkesbury now knew what thought of friend jack said that evening thought be pity have said a much a have further reflection made think same however must be helped now anything made clear estimation in held masham be on whole bad thing that evening when got back found mr smith at home have come said to insist on taking jack place with billy for night jack protested in vain that felt quite fresh that be not in least sleepy so on mr smith be inexorable for once so have finally to retire together to room downstairs leave in possession a said good night gave look well understood be awful nonsense said jack making out want sleep why have slept most of night have be up there be sure more than have think good deal about jack fancy said anxious to steer talk round in required direction jack nodded went opened window be awfully close to night said stood leaning out of window for minute watching few passenger in street below saying nothing what jack be thinking about must not tell what be passing through mind knew well enough how do think seems asked after long pause who billy be getting on wonderfully did mean billy said meant mr smith oh ought to know better than do really have hardly seen last few day have not heard cough so much though be not be at last few day said wonder said jack that night work be enough to upset anybody oh mean in way said feeling hopeless a to ever getting out secret though be sure be very much concerned about billy seems to have other thing on mind too have work too hard be what be not

secret a happens mr smith be anxious for to tell story be reason believe why have insisted on leaving together to night have launched ship now jack looked at in puzzled way want to tell story repeated yes why have reason think have better hear jack jack be fool have wit enough to tell by time that in mysterious blundering talk of mine there be after something more serious than commonplace tittle tattle face tone must have proved if nothing else did remained leaning out of window by side a told that story in word a near of mr smith a must recall interrupted by start exclamation remained silent with head on hand till very end indeed be so still after be told that for moment felt uneasy lest be taken ill presently looked up with face very pale said can scarcely believe fred there be nothing in tone look to say whether disclosure came to a good news bad longed to know dared not ask long silence followed sat down on chair with face turned from felt that to say word must be rude disturbance after while rose said in voice very low trembling will go up stair fred said taking arm gently leading back to chair will go up old boy look after billy to night did not resist hastened up mr smith met at door with anxious face well inquired in voice trembled a much a jack have done know said yes be downstairs expecting said with sigh very like sob mr smith left went down stair long night a sat beside billy watched fitful sleep must hear sound of voice in room below what said to one never knew never inquired next morning when jack came summoned to breakfast happy face mr smith quiet smile answered far more eloquently than word question must possibly have asked about strange sacred meeting between lost father lost son chapter thirty five how jack talked louder than need have done about week after experience narrated in last chapter friend smith went down one morning early to hawk street usually took short walk on way when happened to be early exactly know why did not do so time certain be that instead of reaching office at half past nine found there few minute before nine housekeeper be sweeping stair shaking mat on pavement a arrived naturally looked surprised to see said have office yet to sweep out have better take walk being lazily disposed declined invitation determined to brave dust go up office be certainly not very tempting for work window be wide open din of omnibus other traffic from street below be almost deafening stool chair be stacked together in middle of floor waste paper of yesterday littered whole place even own desk be thick with dust under depressing circumstance be forced to admit that possibly housekeeper be right that have better take walk be nuisance said for have to leave one two thing unfinished yesterday have good mind to try said jack unless can catch up work will have to stay late to night want to do a father be going to try to get away early so dusted desk a best must shut window to keep out noise recovered stool from assortment in middle prepared to make best of do know jack said a be getting out paper be so queer to hear talking of mr smith a father can hardly realise yet more can often said jack though be getting more used to idea when be going to take to packworth asked be not quite sure think can get week at end of month will try to get partner to let take holiday at same time hope will be able to manage so do poor father be in very low spirit at prospect of meeting mary think know will have to tell everything will be necessary oh yes at least father say be if be to hear of story from other

will still live with mr shield at packworth oh yes for present there be place to bring to in london till get little better off hope that wo be very long said be afraid father situation on staff of banner be not very hush exclaimed suddenly have remained so far in undisturbed possession of office there be chance of new comer entering without knowing while jack be speaking thought sound not on stair outside in partner room opened out of counting house suppose one of partner have be there while heard have said jack stopped dead in talk with pale face looked inquiringly at thought heard noise in there said pointing to door what said jack with gasp same thought be evidently crossing mind have crossed mine ca be either of partner whispered at hour 'd better see said may be thief went quietly to door be silent a listened yet felt must not have be mistaken about noise door be closed to not fastened jack opened softly there sitting at partner table with head on hand apparently absorbed in work unconscious of everything else sat hawkesbury spectre must not have startled horrified more at first did not seem to be aware of presence be not till jack advanced step involuntarily exclaimed hawkesbury that looked up in flurried way why smith exclaimed batchelor what start gave what be doing here at hour in room have be here quarter of hour said jack solemnly have how quiet have be at rate be relief must hardly have heard conversation what be doing in here added in important voice must know room be private not for clerk heard noise said did not know who be here hawkesbury smiled incredulously can say be said hope be not in habit of coming in here when be by yourselves in office kindly leave now be busy have lot of paper spread out on table before be gathering together in hand while spoke whether be account letter what must not tell a there be nothing more to be said withdrew to counting house followed out in about five minute carrying paper to desk then informing housekeeper in audible voice that must just go get breakfast left to ourselves what mercy said doe seem to have heard what be talking about jack smiled bitterly unless be mistaken be heard word surely jack exclaimed stunned by very idea mean that be sure of feeling during remainder of day may be more easily imagined than expressed if there be one person in world more than must have wished not to hear what have be said be hawkesbury thanks to folly meanness have known far too much a be before trouble have fallen on jack in consequence now if jack surmise be true to what use might not put

nuisance to nobody first feeling on reading be one of devout thankfulness for providence have kept from falling into hand for be designed wrath soon drove out other feeling wrath ten time more fierce because be helpless must hing might go attempt to thrash masham might thrash hawkesbury who be equally to blame if not more what good must do must only make bad worse jack secret instead of being private property of few must become common talk must be unable to bring positive proof of charge even if must must only be putting in wrong by using force to redress wrong after only punishment be to take notice of affair to let two blackguard flatter plot have succeeded to leave to find out a best must that have failed so kept hand resolutely in pocket when next met hawkesbury consoled by

went to desk be evident despite assumed displeasure be very much put out about something that something must not help thinking must be presence fidgeted about uneasily looking now at clock now at now opening desk now shutting now scribbling on paper before now tearing up saw a tried to proceed steadily with work at last brought envelope have just addressed said in rather more persuasive manner than have yet assumed batchelor must kindly take note round to hodge company be very important must have have yesterday hodge be never open till ten said oh yes indeed be at least expect letter by

without leave be quite welcome to know of catching smith going into private room where found replied laughing busy at nobody know what looked at hard a drew bow at venture then said must know batchelor have right to sit in room when choose added dropping voice to whisper looking at in most significant way if door happens to be open if smith happen to talk secret there be chance of being

clock that have better take letter at once batchelor if if friend smith will smart for before must make up mind what to do whether to feign alarm take letter leaving to suppose still have whip hand over whether to undeceive at once defy point blank before must reply at door suddenly opened masham entered if anything be still wanted to decide sufficed felt certain now that there be mischief on foot somewhere appearance of bird of ill omen be sufficient to account for hawkesbury eagerness to get out of way what must have brought two to arrange meeting here at office at hour when in ordinary course of thing one else must be present determined to stay where be at risk masham on seeing started looked inquiringly at hawkesbury what be doing here said very sound of voice made blood boil be going to take letter to borough for said hawkesbury bestowing meaning glance on be not going to take said what exclaimed hawkesbury in sudden fury be not going to take be going to stay where be know consequence muttered between teeth yes know what mean for friend smith yes looked perplexed a well might must defy in face of threat against jack smith be last thing have expected batchelor said altering tone suddenly to one of entreaty have very important business to arrange with masham must mind leaving for hour must not ask only will get into awful trouble if ca talk to alone for little passed comprehension how after threatening with jack ruin must now turn round with appeal put on beseeching manner that in midst of wrath half pitied however be not to be moved if want to see so privately a said take up to sample room one will disturb there gave one look of hatred menace then said to masham must fix time masham ca go into matter now eh said masham who have hitherto stood by in silence what do say if ca do now wo do at boy hawkesbury went up to whispered something oh will soon settle said other laughing wo go wo will help be whereabouts be coal hole so saying made grab at arm before must resist hawkesbury have secured other struggled must unavailingly between be dragged up stair to sample room into be ignominiously thrust door locked behind at first rage indignation be too great to allow to think of anything kicking at door shouting to captor to release soon discovered be fruitless in due time gave up resolved to wait time make best of lot that mischief be afoot now felt certain whatever be felt equally sure be being enacted during imprisonment yet what must do must only listen to sound of voice below speculate a to what be going on suddenly however flashed across that room in be be not over office over partner room that therefore sound heard must proceed from thence what must be up to heard door open shut noise of what might have be key followed by heavy slamming to of something for thud gave might have be iron safe felt very uncomfortable be forced to remain chafing where be for nearly hour when lock of prison turned two entered room seized a before now can come down said masham not till promise to say nothing about said hawkesbury know what to expect if doe said masham after said hawkesbury did mean to hurt masham only wanted to settle

hawkesbury then added come down now take advice batchelor ruin ruin cried with scornful laugh see how letting partner know going on must ruin will see be reply doubtless considered threat enough knowing a did that jack have told partner everything hawkesbury must possibly tell must afford to treat with contempt masham took departure returned with hawkesbury to counting house where be soon joined by fellow clerk be very uncomfortable hardly knew how to act that be duty to tell partner what have happened have doubt how much to tell when must not make up mind determined to take doubleday into confidence get advantage of good advice clear head be easier said than done almost a soon a came in doubleday have to go down to dock opportunity of consulting be thus delayed moment passed felt more more uneasy mr barnacle have already arrived mr merrett be due in few minute what right have to delay even for moment matter affected credit of whole house yet suppose after have found mare nest suppose hawkesbury explanation of what have occurred must by chance have be correct suppose sound heard during confinement have not be caused by two at by housekeeper sweeping out room putting in order if be so what fool must make of resolved for difference must make must wait till must consult doubleday hawkesbury be very busy that morning be constantly fidgeting in out of little box giving vague direction to one clerk keeping special eye on did when mr merrett arrived went a usual to say good morning to uncle a usual followed into partner room to receive such letter a might require answering wished doubleday have not be called down to dock morning of others must have told in moment ought to do came to same thing what must have done in place anything must be better than suspense be tempted even then to break in upon partner tell have happened what suspicion be must not do while hawkesbury be there when came out by way what unconscionable lot of letter there must be to keep in there time be usually there about five minute morning have be hour at very least thought suddenly occurred to must be telling partner about jack smith antecedent in midst of uneasiness almost smiled to think how sold must be when discovered have heard already ah here be at last be mr merrett who appeared at door with extremely long face looking round office fixed eye on said batchelor come in here obeyed instead of going in a usual before waited till have entered then followed closing door behind what on earth doe mean mr barnacle sat looking straight before through spectacle hawkesbury also sat at table twisting quill pen backwards forward with finger hawkesbury said mr merrett a re entered might leave please will call when be wanted hawkesbury without looking at rose to obey a reached door mr merrett stepped after whispered something at ordinary time must not have heard what whispered thought of listening for there be such silence in room nerve be strung up to such pitch distinctly caught word what heard be fetch policeman chapter thirty seven how hawkesbury spent morning in partner room fetch policeman truth flashed across a heard word instead of standing here accuser stood accused hawkesbury have be before with vengeance very shock of discovery called back presence of mind on first summons have almost lost be determined at least that nothing must do say must lend colour to false charge against batchelor said mr merrett after hawkesbury have gone door be locked batchelor have sent for here under very painful circumstance doubtless know why must ask to tell sir replied respectfully with tremble in voice must have given anything to conceal will tell said mr merrett when have first told mr barnacle what have be doing since eight o'clock morning let advise said mr barnacle looking up to tell truth certainly will tell truth began what possessed unlucky voice of mine to quaver in way did few word be convinced must tell more against than most circumstantial narrative clutched hold of back of chair near made desperate effort to steady a proceeded gave exact account of everything have happened since entered office that morning omitting nothing glossing over nothing shirking nothing listened attentively eyeing keenly time betraying sign in face whether believed not then mean to say said mr merrett when be done that be not in room at yes never entered be ever in room without knowledge yes fortnight ago smith be here early hearing noise inside opened door came in to see what be what did find hawkesbury working at table where mr barnacle be now sitting what occurred related precisely what have occurred repeating a nearly a must very word have be used there be silence then mr merrett in most solemn tone said now batchelor answer question say be here before one else arrived morning yes sir have be here about five minute before hawkesbury came what be doing during time be working at desk be quite sure perfectly said cheek burning heart swelling within to be thus spoken to by whom with fault have never once so much a dreamt of deceiving did not enter room mr merrett touched bell hawkesbury appeared scarcely wondered must try to avoid eye a stood at table waiting hawkesbury repeat once more in batchelor hearing what have already told kept head down face averted from a said arrived here at quarter to nine morning noticed door of room open when came to see who be there saw batchelor in act of shutting safe did not notice at first not until be coming out of room asked what be doing here seemed very much disconcerted said have be looking for paper have left on mr barnacle table day before asked what have be doing with safe where have got key to open got into great state begged to say nothing about said be bound to tell have seen then flew into rage told 'd serve out told must prevent doing what be right then left office did come back till quarter to ten hawkesbury repeated glibly hurriedly in low voice to who stood by heard be cowardly lie from beginning to end to employer felt must sound businesslike straightforward quite a straightforward feared a own equally exact tremblingly spoken story hear what hawkesbury say said mr merrett turning to roused with effort answered quietly yes sir what have to say to that be false from beginning to end deny in fact ever having be at safe in room most certainly looked grave mr merrett said solemnly be sorry to hear deny batchelor if have made full confession must have be disposed to deal more leniently with never did be false cried suddenly losing self control know be false be plot to ruin jack silence sir said mr merrett sternly wo be silent shouted never deceived yet go believe what miserable mr merrett touched bell angrily before one answered mr barnacle have looked up junior partner have be silent time attentive impassive listener to have passed once twice during hawkesbury story have darted quick glance at speaker once twice during indignant protest brow have knit a seemed in anger mr barnacle have always have reputation of being sterner of two partner now a abruptly joined in conversation felt a if boded very little good for one moment said to mr merrett there be few more question must ask think batchelor be doing good by noise added turning to be right saw quieted down with effort wondered what be coming next wallop appeared at door in answer to bell be told be not wanted then mr barnacle turned to hawkesbury asked what brought here so early a quarter to nine hawkesbury question surprised hawkesbury a much a delighted hardly expected to have cross examination in favour conducted by mr barnacle came to do work said hawkesbury what work have several thing to catch up what invoice letter account have petty cash to balance be supposed to be done day be not yes have got rather behind how many day behind said mr barnacle really ca quite say said hawkesbury who did not seem used to being driven into corner journey north threw out of then have not balanced petty cash since before went north nearly three week ago be to understand yes said hawkesbury be first morning have come here early have be once twice be only time found batchelor here about fortnight ago be here with smith found in room be doing be writing something at table be in great rage with when came in be safe open at time hawkesbury have got past stage of sticking at trifle yes said when came in be made rush turned out of room locked door then when came in again be shut did mention to anybody why pray hawkesbury be taken aback by sudden question be evident must not make story square at four corner hoped might be mistaken said uncomfortably in fact meant to mention affair forgot oh said mr barnacle in way made witness writhe hope doubt word said hawkesbury attempting to assume lofty air of virtuous indignation mr barnacle vouchsafed reply what desire said mr merrett be to come at truth of matter can only say that must be much better if culprit be to make full confession here now looked hard at a spoke did best to stand look a innocent man must cheque for eight pound have be missed continued mr merrett be only drawn yesterday left in safe ask batchelor do know anything of sir replied do said mr barnacle to hawkesbury hawkesbury flushed a replied never expected to be asked question mr barnacle know nothing about mr merrett evidently disliked partner persistency in putting to hawkesbury same question a have be put to must hardly complain turned to nephew said did fetch policeman hawkesbury be just going when called in here mr merrett touched bell crow appeared be doubleday in asked senior partner sir a soon a come in tell be wanted crow took eyeful of a stood there evidently dying of curiosity to know what meant then retired two have better go to work for present said mr barnacle understand that be of at liberty to leave office merrett will go down to bank do said mr merrett so first painful interview ended feeling on finding once more at desk among fellow clerk may be more easily imagined than described indignation sense of injury must scarcely allow to think calmly on position that employer must be ready on testimony of such fellow a hawkesbury to believe charge like against be simply unbearable own helplessness to prove innocence only added tenfold to trouble oh if jack be only here might get light hurriedly dashed off note to telling begging to come yet what be use of writing when be not allowed to leave office to post letter only wished mr barnacle must come back from bank that might know worst a for hawkesbury have shut up in glass box be invisible presently not little to comfort doubleday returned fortunately crow be in part of office at time so that before delivered message have time for hurried consultation doubleday said in whisper be accused of stealing cheque can help out guilty not guilty inquired doubleday taking practical view of case at once be pleasant be time to be particular be lie from beginning to end invented by hawkesbury to shield from similar charge oh be be be coming out in line have hurriedly narrated morning adventure greatly to astonishment wrath took in situation at once jolly awkward fix said seen cheque mr barnacle be down at bank now doubleday said crow entering at moment governor want sharp be going to send for policeman said if anything happens doubleday will please telegraph to smith at mr shield packworth tell to come to also find out billy shoeblack say want to see doubleday looked at with something like amazement a made request however promised to fulfil then waited on mr merrett in partner room however returned almost immediately said be to wait until mr barnacle came back seemed age before event happened meanwhile doubleday advised not to be seen talking to anybody to go to desk keep own counsel be good advice took mr barnacle returned presently accompanied by man who fancied must be connected with bank two partner stranger be closeted together for time in inner room then doubleday be summoned after what seemed century emerged beckoned to to go in be wanted said must gather comfort hope from face a stood to let pas come when ring said mr merrett to once more stood before employer stranger be still in room eyed a entered in manner made feel a if be ought to be guilty person matter batchelor began mr merrett solemnly be more serious than imagined not only have cheque be stolen have be tampered with look here so saying held out cheque be dated previous day payable to bearer amount instead of being eight pound be eighty alteration have be neatly made one who did not know original amount drawn for must have suspected that l be not proper sum cheque said mr merrett be presented at bank morning at ten o'clock cashed made reply being determined to say a little a must be here at hour believe continued mr merrett have left office between sir have not left office since arrived at half past eight mr merrett touched bell send hawkesbury here said to doubleday hawkesbury appeared at mr merrett bidding after being shown cheque repeated once more story in hearing of stranger did not vary from former version included statement have quitted office at time alleged did leave office at inquired mr barnacle said hawkesbury not at said so replied one came to see here friend masham did not hawkesbury much offended to be thus catechised made reply mr barnacle coolly repeated question no did not what be doing time be working yes what particular work be engaged in told be balancing petty cash did finish nearly mr barnacle touched bell doubleday appeared doubleday go to hawkesbury desk bring petty cash book box hawkesbury turned pale broke out into rage what be for mr barnacle be not going to stand right have to suspect give doubleday key repeated mr barnacle exclaimed hawkesbury in white heat will not will fetch book doe know where to find have business to go to desk remain where be hawkesbury said mr barnacle what right have to search desk have private thing in uncle merrett be going to allow mr barnacle have perfect right to see petty cash account said mr merrett looking however by mean pleased why examine desk said hawkesbury pointing to be one to suspect not why search desk have objection to desk being searched said feeling good deal concerned however at thought of mess that receptacle be in be only fair said mr barnacle gentleman will search dare say doubleday show gentleman desk be long uncomfortable interval ensued hawkesbury breaking out in periodical protest against desk being examined wondering where how to look for help partner meanwhile stood talked together in whisper at window at gentleman who have dawned on be not bank official detective returned with doubleday who carried in hand few book paper petty cash book box be first delivered over without examination consigned to safe letter be in same desk said detective laying down paper on table appeared to be letter in address of top one instantly recognised handwriting of letter sent to mary smith still have in pocket hawkesbury made angry grasp at paper be private letter exclaimed give up what right have to touch hawkesbury said mr barnacle in case like be better for to submit quietly to what have be done nothing in paper doe not concern matter in hand be likely to tell against be that officer be in desk said detective in other young gentleman desk only thing besides business paper litter be key key what key must be be first have seen of let look at said mr merrett suddenly a detective laid on table be handed to face changed a took turned for moment to show to mr barnacle whisper something then said be key of safe left last night in pocket of office coat in room chapter thirty eight how ended day more comfortably than have expected misfortune have now fairly reached climax seemed useless to struggle against circumstance more of course must see a soon a stunned sens recovered sufficiently to enable to perceive anything that same false hand have pointed out a thief have also placed that key in desk a part of wicked plot remembered that when be conveyed up to sample room that morning desk have be open nothing therefore must have be more simple than to secrete key there during absence so lay up against silent accuser must be far harder to gainsay than talking one be use of explaining when evidently fortune have decreed must become victim after be not better to give in at once let fate do worst be key of safe said mr merrett eye turned on nothing must say be clear must do good therefore gaped stupidly at key said nothing how came in desk batchelor asked mr barnacle did know therefore must say consequently said nothing have explanation to offer repeated mr barnacle replied then officer said mr merrett must give in charge bare idea of being walked off to police station be enough to drive sullenness reserve to four wind suddenly finding tongue cried oh please please can explain for mercy sake be cruel send to prison be innocent mr merrett mr barnacle can explain please have locked up in confusion panic turned round addressed last word to hawkesbury who received with smile in there be more of triumph than pity false coward exclaimed suddenly seeing who be did put key in desk while be locked up stair really batchelor replied in sweetest tone be afraid hardly know what be saying understand do said understand how helpless be to defend masham did work well morning at rate retorted firing up gave lesson for impudence mr merrett have be speaking with detective did not hear dialogue mr barnacle did happily for then said turning short round to hawkesbury masham be here morning hawkesbury thus suddenly cornered turned first red then white tried to mumble out evasion mr barnacle be not man to be put off in way then be here morning demanded again hawkesbury have retreat saw just called in for moment said sullenly be oh said mr barnacle can go to desk hawkesbury for present hawkesbury looking anything triumphant obeyed mr barnacle who evidently suspected real truth more than partner did turned to batchelor do still decline to offer explanation of discovery of key in desk can only say replied that must have be put there for never touched who must put there hawkesbury suppose when friend dragged up stair desk be left open can describe masham must did description said detective tally exactly with given at bank of person who presented cheque do know writing know what believe to be writing said be that inquired mr barnacle showing envelope addressed to hawkesbury be not handwriting believe to be be that showing be that time be envelope have already recognised yes be how be able to recognise by said producing letter to mary smith from pocket handwriting on two envelope be compared found to be alike further to correspond with signature at back of cheque clerk seemed being little doubtful of person who presented cheque have required to write name on back fictitious signature robinson be accordingly given in masham hand seems clear said detective see said mr barnacle looking again at envelope have given letter be addressed to place where smith life be masham friend of smith family must mind reading letter sir said will answer question better than can mr barnacle did so mr merrett also in midst of trouble be at least satisfaction to see look of disgust came into face a perused content dastardly letter said mr merrett how came masham to know of smith private affair hawkesbury overheard smith talking of on first occasion that found here must have told masham who have grudge against smith heard of course hawkesbury included smith a well a in accusation yes did wish be here to confirm denial of what happened be yes said mr barnacle need not go into again answer one more question batchelor be acquainted with masham slightly once be introduced to by hawkesbury spent day with have reason to believe be swindler know of nothing must warrant in saying so replied do know whether hawkesbury owes money yes at least have be told so by whom by boy shoeblack who shoeblack exclaimed mr merrett be that only authority believe be honest said overheard conversation between masham friend in masham mentioned that hawkesbury owed l really said mr merrett be almost absurd to take such testimony a that must be amiss to see boy though said mr barnacle great deal depends on whether hawkesbury owed money to masham where be boy to be found oh must fetch at once know where work said said mr barnacle must stay here doubleday can go touched bell doubleday said when youth entered want to bring here shoeblack yes sir said doubleday artlessly will one do said mr barnacle boy wish to see be where be batchelor work at top of style street said will know place by writing over flagstone on side with lucid direction doubleday started in meanwhile be left to go on with usual work most of fellow be away at dinner hawkesbury a before be invisible so have place pretty much to myself be spared for time at rate good deal of unwelcome questioning in due time there be sound of scuffling protest on stair outside doubleday reappeared dragging in billy youthful hero evidently doubting import of strange summons be in highly indignant frame of mind at
