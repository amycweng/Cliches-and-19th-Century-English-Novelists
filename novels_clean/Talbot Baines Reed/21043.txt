short connection with new business if have known all must have counted two for mr durfy finding in mood to wreak wrath on one summoned ill favoured barber to sweep out back case room gave order so viciously that barber felt distinctly aggrieved jumping to conclusion that reginald have somehow contrived to turn table on registered secret vow there then that must on first opportunity on subsequent opportunity be square with luckless youth caring very little about who hated who liked reginald wandered forth to intercept faithful horace with now unnecessary water two boy finding very little to occupy during rest of day remained in comparative seclusion until seven o'clock bell rang when walked home possibly wiser certainly sadder for first day with rocket newspaper company limited

be impressing hearer with sense of importance cheering heart by promise of favour protection with unlucky reginald meanwhile fared far le comfortably jemima dear said mr shuckleford who in domestic confidence to mr cruden kept sharp eye on family jemima dear think reggie must like to show album electric shock must not have startled confused hero more be bad enough to hear called reggie be

never mind if be secret nice be mr cruden to see young people such good friend so soon must be going now child added will soon see friend in own 'ouse tender leave taking ensued for while a retreating footstep of visitor gradually died away on stair little family stood motionless a though slightest sound might recall when at last street door slammed below reginald flung into chair groaned mother ca stay here must leave to morrow horace must not help laughing why reg said seemed to be enjoying end shut up horace be nothing to laugh about dear boy said mr cruden think far more about than need after seem kindly disposed person think must be unfriendly be very well said reg if there be jemima in question must say be very well said horace if there be sam in question though dare say mean to be

how many ship fought at salami when even know how many ounce can send by post for twopence at least good night old man horace really scarcely le miserable at heart than brother buried nose in dull street pillow tried to go to sleep chapter six reginald prospect develop be in anything exuberant spirit that two crudens presented on following morning at workman entrance of rocket newspaper company limited bell be beginning to sound a did so enemy timekeeper looked a though must fain discover pretext for pouncing on giving specimen of importance even ingenuity failed in respect a horace passed with good humoured nod have much against will to nod back forego amiable intention brother naturally turned step to room presided over by mr durfy magnate have not yet arrived much to relief consoled in absence by standing at table watching fellow workman a crowded in proceeded with more le alacrity to settle down to day work among who displayed unseemly haste in applying to task be barber who with dust of back case room still in mind equally on countenance considered present opportunity of squaring up account with reginald too good to be neglected for reason best known to mr barber determined that victim flagellation must be moral rather than physical must have liked to punch reginald head better still to have knocked reginald horace head together saw reason for denying that pleasure fell back on more ethereal weapon of own wit hullo puddin ' began be pa ma to day find old bailey 'ealthy place reginald favoured speaker by way of answer with stare of mingled scorn wrath greatly elevated that gentleman spirit long be have got seven year ai eye wo know when come out will be so growed wrath slowly faded from reginald face a speaker proceeded leaving only scorn to testify to interest took in intellectual display horace delighted to see there be prospect of flare up smiled began almost to enjoy say continued barber just little disappointed to find that exquisite humour be not a electrical in effect a must have be on one le dense than crudens 'ow be ai got clean collar on to day scent on 'andkerchers eh be getting feeble even mr barber felt for continued in more lively tone glad ai got many of sickening sort 'ere snivelling school boy brat be what be tired of pickin ' pocket think be goin ' to show manner yah if be such dirty ugly pair of puppy dog 'd stick under pump so must reginald yawned walked off to watch compositor picking up type out of case horace on other hand appeared to be deeply interested in mr barber eloquent observation inquired quite artlessly with twinkle in eye be pump near here be looking for everywhere yesterday be mr barber turn to stare have not expected did not like especially when one two of men boy near who have failed to be convulsed by wit laughed at horace question after moral flagellation doe not always answer when one of victim yawn other asks matter of fact question be disconcerting even to accomplished operator however barber gallantly determined on one more effort ugh trying to be funny be mr snubnose best try be honest if can mealy mug brother will be 'ard work know to keep 'ands in own pocket 'd best do do 'ear pair of psalm singin ' twopenny have'penny puppy dog picturesque peroration certainly deserved recognition might possibly have received have not mr durfy entrance at particular moment sent idler back suddenly to case reginald heedless of unconcerned at new arrival remained listlessly watching operation of compositor near act of audacity highly exasperated overseer furnished key note for day entertainment for mr durfy to use expressive term have got out of bed wrong side morning for matter of after blowing up about back case room have got into wrong side last night so that be doubly perturbed in spirit short conversation have just have with manager below have not tended to compose durfy said that brusque official a overseer passed open door come in what about two lad sent up to yesterday be good not bit growled mr durfy fool of be bigger fool old one then keep for put to composing send other one down here send at once durfy do hear with considerately worded injunction in ear be hardly to be wondered at mr durfy be not all smile a entered domain owned sway eye naturally lit on reginald a most suitable object on to relieve feeling now then there called out what do mean by interfering with men in work be not interfering with anybody said reginald looking up with glowing cheek be watching man come out of do hear why go about own work have be waiting here ten minute for look here said mr durfy tone getting lower a passion rose if think be going to keep here to give of impudence be mistaken so can tell be bad enough to have big fool put into place for charity without of nonsense if have way 'd give beggarly eighteen shilling week to keep away go to work reginald eye blazed out for moment on speaker in way made horace who heard saw tremble overcame with mighty effort said where mr durfy glanced round room young gedge called out boy answered summons clear that rack between barber put up pair of case for fool here look after off go off go added rounding on reginald if make hot for among be precious mistaken be proud moment certainly for cock of fifth at wilderham to find following meekly at heel of youngster like gedge who have be commissioned to put to work look after reginald be too sick at heart disgusted to care what became of a long a mr durfy odious voice ceased to torment ear only thing did care about be what be to become of horace be to be put in charge of one too be to remain printer devil mr durfy soon answered that question what be standing there for demanded turning round on younger brother a soon a have disposed of elder go down to manager room at once be not wanted here so be to be separated there be only time to exchange one glance of mutual commiseration then horace slowly left room with sad foreboding more on brother account than own feeling that a far a helping one be concerned might a well be doomed to serve time at opposite end of london gedge under whose imposing auspex reginald be to begin typographical career be diminutive youth who to outward appearance be somewhere about tender age of fourteen instead of a be really case being almost a old a reginald be facetiously styled magog by shopmates in allusion to small stature required assistance of good sized box under foot to enable to reach upper case face be not unpleasant one voice still retained boyish treble be agreeable contrast to of most of gentleman of case in mr durfy department for reginald considered much outraged by being put in charge of chit of child glowered down on much a mastiff might glower on terrier who presumed to do honour of back yard for benefit however terrier in case be not at disheartened by reception said cheerily a began to clear frame seem to fancy say wonder never mind sha lick unless make thanks said reginald drily scarcely able to conceal smile at magnanimous declaration magog worked busily away putting away case in rack dusting frame down with apron whistling softly to thanks for helping said after time a reginald still stood by doing nothing must never have done by reginald blushed little at broad hint proceeded to lift down case nearly upset in doing so greatly to companion horror 'd better rest said will be fagged out here let do there be now be ready to start have good mind to go get old tacker to ring up big bell let know be just going to begin reginald must hardly be offended at good natured banter a gedge be after decent looking boy aspirated h did not smell of onion began to think that if be doomed to drudge in place might have be saddled with more offensive companion be pity to put tacker to trouble young 'un said will probably ring when be going to leave off that will do a well that be not bad for said gedge approvingly not half bad go on like will make joke in about fortnight look here said reginald smiling at last will either have to punch head begin work 'd better decide 'd like best well a durfy be looking way said gedge suppose 'd better begin work stick that pair of empty case up there one with big hole below other one above need stick upside down though unless particularly want to look quite a well right way now then 'd better watch fill see what box sort go in lark now here go for m ' so saying mr magog proceeded to fill up one box with type of letter m box distance off with with b so on till presently lower of two case be nearly full reginald watched with something like admiration inwardly wondering if must ever be able to find way about labyrinth of box strongly of opinion that only muff like printer must think of arranging alphabet in such absurdly haphazard manner lower case being full up gedge meekly suggested that a be yet several foot from full size might a well lift upper case down while be being filled done same process be repeated only with more apparent regularity case having be finally tilted up on frame above lower case operator turned round with pleased expression said what do think of why think be very ridiculous not to put capital j ' next to capital said reginald gedge laughed go tell durfy that 'd like to hear reginald however denied pleasure of entertaining mr durfy on occasion occupied with picking up type inspecting trying to learn geography of case now said magog mounting box taking composing stick in hand keep eye on young fellow will know about proceeded to set up paragraph for newspaper from manuscript in front of at speed bewildered reginald baffled attempt on part to follow movement of operator hand among box watched for several minute in silence until gedge considering have exhibited agility sufficiently halted in work with passing shade across face turned to companion said say be beastly place there be something in voice manner struck reginald be unlike common workman still more unlike boy of gedge size age be beastly said be awfully sorry for know continued gedge in half whisper going on with work at same time because guess be not what be used to be not used to said reginald be when came old screw of uncle took into head to apprentice here because 'd be apprentice once did see why must start higher up ladder than did be apprentice no not that know of said reginald not knowing exactly what be lucky beggar be booked here for nobody know how much longer 'd have cut long ago if must say what be name cruden well cruden be precious glad have

may be sure there be something in wind whatever be mr durfy kept own counsel though reginald looked up now then caught scowling viciously in direction made attempt at hostility rather appeared to ignore altogether even when be giving out copy sent reginald by boy instead of a be usually practice calling up to table to receive be copy on occasion consisted of number of advertisement class of work not nearly a easy far le interesting than paragraph of news generally fell to share however attacked boldly unattractive a be contrived to get occupation from for mind a well a hand here for

be muff here be of different sort j come back to afflicted mother will be forgiven heigho suppose j have got mother like mr cruden what brute must be to cut away what have be doing to robbing bullying what reginald worked into state of wrath over prodigal very nearly persuaded to leave out promise of forgiveness altogether if young gentleman who dropped envelope in putney omnibus on evening of th instant will apply to b at grip street may hear of something to advantage how people be born to luck think of making fortune by dropping envelope in putney omnibus how gladly must pave floor of omnibus rode in with envelope if only must thereby hear anything to advantage have great mind to stroll round by number grip street that evening to see who mysterious b must be to intelligent young

hullo reginald laid down composing stick read advertisement over again after that read again word by word most carefully l year why be a much again a present income without risk interfering with present work too well present work might be past work to morrow even so with l year must be worse off of course must get something else to do a well by way of ordinary work if only must bring in l year to meagre family store what little luxury might not procure for mother what difference might make in dreary poky dull street parlour where sat day if decided not to spend save up think of pound week ready against rainy day reginald used to have loose enough idea of value of money last few week have taught lesson one of be that pound week must work wonder apply confidentially yes of course else duffer might snatch at prize be considerate too to put way for of course must be awkward for one in situation to apply unless must do confidentially quite right too to enclose stamp for reply one who be in earnest must do so thus must keep out fellow who applied out of mere idle curiosity none respectable intelligent young men need apply humph reginald conscience told be respectable hoped be also moderately intelligent though opinion might differ on point omega that sounded well man knew greek possibly be classical scholar therefore sure to be gentleman oh what contrast to cad durfy liverpool ah there be one drawback yet of course did not follow l year be to be earned in liverpool otherwise how must fail to interfere with ordinary business besides why must advertise in rocket unless meant to get application from londoner altogether reginald be pleased with advertisement liked way be put condition imposed indeed be so much taken up with study of that almost forgot to set up

party broke up crudens went home chapter ten will walk into parlour said spider to fly two day followed despatch of letter to omega be long anxious one for reginald cruden must have be great relief to have felt free to talk matter over with horace somehow that word confidential in advertisement deterred for that made point of leaving paper containing in brother way if by chance invitation to additional l year might meet eye have done so be doubtful whether reginald must have be pleased for knew that if came to selecting one of two horace must probably pas for quite a respectable considerably more intelligent young man than still have right to stand in brother way if fate ordained that too must be attracted by advertisement therefore left paper lying conspicuously about with advertisement sheet turned toward beholder horace however have too much of rocket in business hour to crave for further perusal of during leisure kicked unceremoniously out of way first time encountered when reginald saw next be in mangled condition under stair in suspicious company of servant girl cinder shovel on second morning when arrived at work letter lay on case with liverpool

con of question true still knew very little about new duty have yet to make acquaintance of bishop of s other director on other hand have seen mr medlock heard what have to say be quite satisfied in

take round than have last term have football club be doing well again asked old boy oh middling by way fellow growled rather when only sent sov instead of sov reginald coloured up little comrade knew what that half sovereign have cost relapsed into silence have to derive what compensation must from fast talk in other three engaged apparently heedless of presence in due time meal ended blandford called for bill until moment reginald have never imagined for moment that have be dining a old schoolfellow guest have understood blandford request of company a invitation a invitation have accepted a invitation have repented of what then be embarrassment to find bill for six shilling sixpence laid down before a share of entertainment for moment flush of relief passed across face be glad not to

waiter will settle bill how much be said reginald laying down three shilling if can lend three sixpence be want bosh said blandford pitching sovereign to waiter take out of coffee too come along into smoking room fellow reginald must fain have escaped horrid dread of being suspected of caring more about dinner than company deterred followed dejectedly to luxurious smoking room of shade positively refused to touch coffee cigar even though blandford took care to remind have be paid for except when spoken to must bring to open lip take part in general talk blandford however who ever since incident of bill seemed to consider entitled to play patronising part towards schoolfellow continued to keep from lapsing into obscurity where be brother living asked presently be in town too said reginald mother live together where 'd like to call on mother live in dull street said reginald beginning in sheer desperation to pluck up heart hang out no more false colour dull street be rather shady locality be said mr pillans reginald rounded on blandford might have right to catechise what business be of numbskull where lived be not obliged to go there said with curl of lip unless like mr shanklin smiled at sally demonstration considerably incensed not too amiable mr pillans will take precious care said latter reginald said thanks drily in way so cutting that mr shanklin blandford

be looking up round for precious confederate with reginald to supply with honesty with easy going spendthrift like blandford pillans to supply with money with cad like durfy to do dirty work for be in a comfortable hopeful way a promoter of such enterprise must reasonably hope to be trio at shade soon forgot reginald in delight of one sweet society played billiards at mr shanklin won also played

worker before starting reginald be to copy out address master love whose appetite be always good be to fold insert circular lick up envelope being decided work went on briskly quietly reginald have leisure to notice one two little point a went on though trivial in still interested observed for one thing that largest proportion of name marked in directory be lady clergyman most of residing in south of england very few of appeared to reside in large town to prefer rural retreat far from madding crowd where doubtless letter even on business of corporation must be welcome diversion to monotony of existence a to clergy doubtless name have be suggested by good bishop of s who must be in position to introduce considerable connection to fellow director reginald also noticed that only one name have be marked in village doubtless being assumed that one in place being on intimate term with neighbour be unnecessary to waste stamp paper in making corporation known to two people where one must answer same purpose be curious enough to read one of circular be on whole pleased with content be a follows select agency corporation shy street liverpool reverend sir for lady there be other circular headed dear madam approach of winter with hardship bitter season entail on whom providence have not blessed with sufficient mean induces to call attention to unusual opportunity for providing

envellups do mean to say lot of circular have be sent already 'undreds of grillions on replied boy of course be use after delaying so reginald finished off task not little vexed at mistake determined to have put right without delay be cause of irritation most likely prevented dwelling too critically on substance of circular so affectionately dedicated to poor country clergy beyond vaguely wondering where corporation kept bankrupt stock of clothing how by unaided light of nature be to decide whether applicant be stout lean tall short dismissed matter from mind for time being made a short work a possible of remainder of task then wrote short line home announcing arrival in a cheerful word a must muster walked out to post pavement be thronged with crowd of jostling men woman returning home from day work among boy felt more lonely than have be sole inhabitant of liverpool nobody knew nobody looked at nobody cared two straw about so dropped letter dismally into box turned

something to read well waterford recovered in few day from first reverse decided to have shot so be rather glad of quiet evening at office to make new attempt half thought of writing piece between decided 'd better go on own hook after a style be not yet broken in to one agreed have better time write on subject knew something about waterford accordingly selected day in sub sub editor life ' a topic really must claim to be familiar with while pitched upon early rising ' branch of science in flatter old man be not competent to tell whether excel not battle be done when have fixed on subject so a soon a one be gone poked up fire made ourselves snug settled down to work plodded on steadily till heard half past nine letter dropped into box then occurred to have better turn down light give office a deserted look a must be rather slow work sitting in dark for couple of hour not speaking word daring to move toe fire got low dared not make up of course have awful desire to sneeze cough always do at such time half killed in effort to smother must hear cab omnibus in fleet street keeping up regular roar footstep came near except once when telegraph boy a guessed by shrill whistling smart step came dropped telegram into box assure click flap of letter box made that moment although knew what be why be made heart beat like steam engine be beginning to get rather slow when twelve came still nothing to disturb might have be forging ahead with writing time if have only known presently waterford whispered wo try to night now just a spoke heard creak on stair outside have heard lot of creak already somehow one startled instinctively picked up ruler from table waterford took arm motioned close to wall beside creak came presently then evidently one be coming down stair cautiously in dark too for saw glimmer of light through partly opened door be behind so that if opened must be quite hidden unless fellow groped round down came slowly there be mistake now about being human being not ghost for heard clearing throat very quietly snuffling a reached bottom step can tell be rather exciting even for fellow of dull nerve waterford nudged to creep little nearer gas ready to turn up at moment notice while kept at door to prevent man getting out after be once in presently door opened very quietly did not fling wide open luckily be bound to spot behind opened just enough to squeeze in then feeling way round by wall made straight for letter box although be dark seemed to know way pretty well in few second heard stop fumble with key in lock in second two have opened then crouching down began cautiously to rub match on floor light be too dim to see anything crouching figure of man bending over box examining address of one two of letter in match went out before have found what wanted be hard work to keep from giving little unexpected light for finger itched to turn up gas however be evidently better to wait little longer see what really be up to before be down on lit match time seemed to find what wanted for saw put one letter in pocket drop others back into box blowing out match a did so now be time felt nudge from waterford turned gas full on while quietly closed door turned key felt quite sorry for poor scared beggar a knelt there turned white face to light unable to move speak do anything will have guessed who be so mr durfy ' said waterford leaning up against door folding arm be be ' culprit glared at then at rose to foot with forced laugh look like ' said so doe ' said waterford taking key out of door putting in pocket very like look

make ' caved in after be rather glad have to go to extreme have better get letter whispered 'd better fork out to granville ' said waterford be wrong for once a will hear durfy slunk off sat down on chair in far corner of room swearing to not venturing to raise voice above growl be now about half past twelve have lively prospect of waiting at least eight hour before granville turned up bother to stay ' said waterford can look after ' scouted idea said nothing must induce to go very well then ' said may a well get on with writing ' so pulled chair up to table with full view of durfy in corner tried to continue lucubration when be sitting up at dead of night with prisoner in corner of room cursing gnashing teeth at be not easy to grow eloquent on subject of day in sub sub editor life ' early rising ' so found gave up presently made up fire chatted together in whisper once twice durfy broke silence be hungry ' growled about two o'clock so be ' said waterford well go get something be

support fly at countenance of somebody else formidable visitor spared reginald trouble of inquiring to what fortunate circumstance be indebted for honour of so unlooked for visit now sir said panting little after ascent of stair very emphatic same observation be not one left much scope for argument reginald did not exactly know what to reply at last however summoned up resolution enough to say politely now madam can be of service inoffensive a observation be have effect of greatly irritating lady none of sauce young gentleman said putting down bag umbrella folding arm defiantly have not come here to take of impertinence reginald impertinence have never be rude to lady in life except once penance have paid for sin have be bitter enough a reader can testify need pretend not to know

comfortable to be standing still unless unless name be love love screamed outraged venus will love young gentleman before have done with love indeed impudent sauce box beg pardon began reginald love indeed 'd like to scratch so must cried lady with gesture so ominously like suiting action to word that reginald fairly deserted post retreated two full pace be getting critical lady be mad have mistaken reginald for one else in case felt utterly powerless to deal with difficulty so like prudent man decided to hold tongue let lady explain love indeed said for third time saucy jackanapes sir

might have frozen one le heated than reginald suppose have come way from dorsetshire to get that for answer do be mistaken sir leave place till get money thing so now then said reginald feeling case desperate pushing chair in direction perhaps 'd better sit down glared round at indignantly perhaps be sight of haggard troubled face faint suspicion that after might be more honest than employer reflection that must get right better out of place than in reason be changed mind will hear of again sir said mind that love indeed whereupon bounced out of office slammed door behind reginald sat with eye on door for full two minute before must sufficiently collect wit to know where be what have happened then sense of indignation overpowered other feeling not against mr wrigley against mr medlock for leaving in position where must be even in remotest degree open to so unpleasant charge a that have just listened to why must not be trusted with sufficient money control over operation of corporation to enable to meet so unfounded charge must bishop of s other director think if heard that lady have come way from dorsetshire to tell be set of swindler thief if have have sending off of

compunction felt for running to earth scoundrel be going to hing in hurry s be not man to dish by showing card till be sure have all in hand possibly cruden be not alone in swindle might have accomplice even mother brother who can answer for duplicity of human nature might know more of operation than professed to know might have confederate among old companion at rocket even among old school acquaintance yes there be plenty to go into before samuel put down foot who knew better how to go into than s so kept own counsel except for cautioning mother sister to draw off from undesirable connection intimidating maid of work at number dull street by most horrible threat of penalty of law to detain give to letter bearing liverpool postmark must from time forward come to house matter to whom addressed for in zeal be easy to forget that by proceeding be sailing uncommonly close to wind showed sign of taking immediate step either in other matter have be aware that one sniff of liverpool detective police have day ago arrived by series of independent far more artistic investigation at a much knowledge a possessed of doings of corporation samuel must probably have be content to make most of card held before chance of using at have slipped by be doubtful however whether in case must have succeeded in forestalling wary mr sniff that gentleman have discovered in few hour what have taken samuel day of patient grubbing to unearth discovery must have decidedly astonished self complacent little practitioner must have be astonished for instance to hear that liverpool post office have received instruction from home office to hand over letter addressed to cruden reginald shy street to police must also have be astonished if have known that detective in plain clothes dined evening at shade near to table occupied by mr durfy friend that hall porter of weaver hotel be representative of police in disguise representative of police have called on business at rocket office have brushed up against blandford at street corner have even taken trouble to follow samuel shuckleford here there in evening perambulation yes small job a be in mr sniff estimation knew way to go about have very good notion what be right scent to go on what wrong one thing did put out at first be reginald absolutely truthful reply to pleasant clergyman question really did bother mr sniff for when swindler be face to face with victim very last thing expect of be straightforward honesty so when reginald have talked about weaver hotel mr john smith have mentioned number of order have arrived account of money have accompanied have even confided amount of own salary mr sniff have closed one of mental eye said to yes know about when turned out that so far from such statement being fabrication to delude be simply true when letter reginald have written to mr medlock very evening lay in hand corroborated have said when followed poor fellow hour two later on errand of mercy stood beside a spent that precious sixpence over robinson crusoe pilgrim progress mr sniff did feel for moment disconcerted unusual a be made bold venture of jumping to conviction of reginald innocence that theory once started everything went beautifully on evening following mr cruden sudden illness mr durfy strolled down in rather disconsolate frame of mind towards shade since expulsion from rocket office thing have not be going pleasantly with for day two have deemed expedient to keep in retirement when at last did venture forth in vague hope of picking up employment worthy of talent took care to keep clear of haunt of former confederate whom after last failure rather dreaded meeting have be during period that have made acquaintance of shuckleford prospect of revenge that intimacy opened to be welcome diversion to monotony of existence prospect of revenge fill empty stomach durfy at end of week began to discover that there might be end even to private resource of late overseer of evening newspaper part proprietor of agency corporation be in fact getting hard up therefore putting pride in empty pocket strolled down moodily to shade determined at rate to have supper at somebody else

encouragingly much better to come quietly look better look here young fellow added rather more confidentially first question will be asked be whether be guilty not take advice make clean breast of will say not guilty will be truth mr sniff a reader have be told have already come to same conclusion still being rule of profession always to assume man to be guilty till can prove innocent felt be business of to assist magistrate in coming to decision by stating what thought all have to do be to state what knew meanwhile if prisoner choose to simplify matter by pleading guilty well why must please about have made entry jones van will be here directly see later on added nodding to reginald reginald waited there for van like man in dream people came in out spoke laughed looked about even mentioned name seemed part of curious pageant of formed not least unreal portion mind wandered off on hundred little insignificant topic snatch of pilgrim progress came into mind half forgotten air of music crossed memory vision of young gedge a last saw fleeted before eye tried in vain to collect thought be hopelessly astray leaving for time barely conscious wholly uninterested in what be taking place around van came at last vehicle have often eyed curiously a rumbled past in street little have ever dreamed of riding one day inside usual knot of lounger waited at door of police court to see van disgorge freight sometimes have be rewarded for patience by glimpse of real murderer wife kicker burglar sometimes have have bit of fun over tough customer who if must travel at majesty expense be

hum of voice above shuffling of foot a of people taking momentary relaxation in interval of performance then loud voice cried silence order in court sit down gentleman there fell unearthly stillness on place to right said policeman coming beside taking arm a if to direct be conscious of score of curious face turned on of one on bench folding up newspaper adjusting glass of man at table throwing aside quill pen taking of click of latch closing behind of row of spike in front of then found alone what followed scarcely must tell be vaguely aware of one with mr sniff voice making statement in reginald own name occurred voice from bench breaking in now then yet voice from table talking too accompanied by squeaking of pen across paper then constable who have arrested said something after constable one else then followed dialogue in undertone between bench table once more mr sniff voice at last voice from bench gruff unsympathetic voice said now sir what have got to say for question roused be intended for awoke to consciousness that after have interest in what be going on raised head said be not guilty reserve defence then tell yes said policeman yes sir very well then will remand for three day bring up again on friday magistrate took up newspaper clerk at table laying down pen bustle shuffling of foot filled room in moment reginald be down staircase voice have heard before called remand three day now then grinder up go in conjecture a to what might befall possibility of being actually sent to prison have never entered reginald head that must be suspected arrested taken to police station finally brought before magistrate have foreseen be bad enough have steeled resolution to pitch of going through with sure that clearing of character must follow inquiry into case to be lodged for three day a common felon in police cell be fate have not once realised when full meaning broke upon crushed spirit out of made resistance no protest no complaint a hustled back

evidence that be aware that concern be fraudulent a doe not appear to have appropriated of money advise dismissing case real offender be in custody have practically admitted guilt magistrate looked very ill tempered offended did not like being told what be told especially by police have righteous horror of case being withdrawn from authority held snappish consultation with clerk by mean tended to pacify for functionary whispered opinion that a case have be withdrawn there be nothing for for worship to dismiss case somebody at rate must smart for injured feeling a did not know law enough to abuse mr sniff have not pretext sufficient to abuse clerk gathered for castigation of prisoner must not only serve a caution to youth for future guidance must also relieve own magisterial mind now

comment criticism even one of old familiar tirade against enemy of new hero room grew darker still reginald went on when at last light have gone boy hand stole outside blanket sought that of protector held till story came to end then seemed to drop into fitful sleep reginald with hand still on sat motionless listening to hard breathing living over in thought day since heaven in mercy joined life to

presently about one two in morning thought hard breathing ceased turn of head on pillow told sleeper be awake gov'nor there whispered boy yes old fellow be dark be most afeared reginald lay on bed beside put arm round boy became more easy after seemed to settle once more to sleep breathing be shorter more laboured little brow rested against watcher cheek grew cold damp for hour more feeble

calling come there too gov'nor head sank back on pillow reginald a turned lip to forehead knew that little valiant soul have fought way into beautiful palace at last be already hearing music of voice within a welcomed to hero reward chapter twenty five there be place like home be strange how often fortune misfortune be so apt to suppose depend on own success failure turn out to have fallen into hand least expected to have be depending on train of circumstance utterly beyond range of imagination who for instance must have guessed that meeting of dozen business men in first floor room of new york office must have bearing on fate of cruden family that accident to major lambert horse while clearing fence at one of shire hunt must also affect prospect in life so be while reginald tenderly nursed by old school friend be slowly recovering from illness in liverpool while mr cruden horace in shabby london lodging be breaking into last hundred pound wondering how even with boy improved wage promise of literary success must be able to keep comfortable home for scattered shortly to be reunited family at very time few of leading creditor of wishwash longstop railway assembled in old office

dull street family for among english creditor of same wishwash longstop railway mr cruden have be one of most considerable so considerable that share held in have amounted to about fortune when division of proceeds of sale of railway came to be divided turned out that mr cruden administrator heir assigns be entitled to about third of value of gentleman share in other word something like sixth of old property little windfall after good deal of wandering about search for owner came finally under notice of mr richmond successor who in turn passed over to mr cruden with very neat little note of congratulation on good fortune have made son joint proprietor of snug little income of from l to l year of course sagacious reader will remark on that be only natural that towards end of story something of sort must happen in order to finish up with remark that lived happily ever after opinion of will fear be considerably lowered when find that instead of reginald dying in smallpox hospital mr cruden horace ending day in workhouse thing looked up little for towards finish promised rather more comfortable future than one have be led to expect be sad of course to lose one good esteem a thing really did look up for crudens a reginald really did recover a mr cruden horace really did not go to workhouse a grand roundabout railway really be spirited enough to buy up wishwash longstop railway at half price can not help saying so whatever consequence may be several week before mr richmond successor announced windfall to client accident to major lambert horse have resulted in comfort to crudens of kind if truth must be told expected quite a little valued quite a much that worthy nimrod once acquaintance neighbour of garden vale family in day of prosperity be never known to miss

turned out badly who young what be name reginald ca believe always seemed one of right sort bit of prig perhaps straight enough what have be up to 'd better see for major said lady extracting
