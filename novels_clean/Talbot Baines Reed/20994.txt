too much for courage of juno who feeling head free only light weight on back gave wild plunge next moment be away at gallop out of yard gate down avenue be time for halting mare must be caught before must reach cliff to certainty rider be doomed martin stood with hand on paddy mane gaping after runaway with sudden spring dashed aside vaulted into saddle before must expostulate guess what have happened be away in full chase even in terror of moment must not help laughing to myself at thought of poor martin tumbling across stable yard finding out of hunt after that must at least deign to recognise barry gallagher though scarcely minute have elapsed juno precious burden be at end of long avenue before be at beginning of paddy amazed at excitement lost second in plunging before must induce to lay out for pursuit then to do justice needed little coaxing from if only wind be a long a stride hue cry might prove holiday freak if not be moment of keen suspense when at last got clear of avenue looked round in search of fugitive there be light figure thrown back a strained at rein face turned to upland ahead just beyond knockowen on south side be long stretch of smooth turf lying along cliff top for mile more then suddenly cut short by deep chasm in coast into water of lough pour tumultuously even in fair weather in foul rage boil a if in caldron be favourite sport of miss kit to gallop along tempting stretch of grass juno knew way only too well a came into open must see that in spite of rider effort mare be making straight for dangerous cliff in few short minute unless miracle happened unless must reach spot first mad career be likely to end in way made sick to contemplate stood in stirrup gave loud halloo must see miss kit turn head for moment then settle down again to task of keeping seat pulling frantically at rein while aiming direct for point of danger put paddy in straight line across country be desperate race between mad high mettled mare canny raw boned hunter happily have boy light weight to carry for moment two lost sight of runaway then a cleared rise saw quarter of mile away on right course closing on one at yard presently with sickening

nobly never broke stride a settled down for few remaining yard of great race have won only just have barely time to rein up at safe distance from edge turn to meet oncomers when there be juno finding way suddenly obstructed flung up head swerved inland before must gather have leaned across lifted panting burden in arm juno might go now for a for paddy one know how much at critical moment owed to steady help little lady looked up with half smile a set before on saddle then head fell back on shoulder in faint have sweetest for walked whole way shortest ride home ever knew be with sore heart

will sail where be said so with very heavy heart found one of crew of arrow chapter thirteen guard house at brest captain cochin for so commander of arrow styled though always have doubt whether have right to one title other be too well aware of value of cargo to risk in pursuing ordinary calling of pirate on present voyage so stood well out to sea ostentatiously flying english flag giving friendly salute to chance vessel came in course parbleu said england owes one debt for taking gun away from who must have used against selling to poor countryman who will use against one there be gratitude in england if want payment must help not voyage by by a for joy must have felt at finding free at sea be damped by news of loss of cigale with of father tim hope of seeing tim again have kept in heart during many trouble danger now felt more alone than ever in whole world except con dog there be left one friend if ever thought of did so a of one below already dead be young clung hard to life must a soon have dropped over side of arrow a anywhere else so ended bad business of little history in day two however a wind freshened great atlantic wave pitched arrow like plaything from one to other spirit began to rise once more cloud on mind gave way before cheery influence of seaman life one of first thing discovered be that knew far le about seamanship than gave credit for sailing arrow be very different business from sailing honour lumbering tub across lough swilly have to own have great deal to learn very little to teach before must call complete sailor still be handy not afraid to lend hand at anything from holding helm to cooking mate dinner so before many day be over have taken place without much ado a one of crew for ship of size engaged in such trade crew of thirty men be small enough most of be foreigner few like irish rest english one thing kept from quarrelling be hope of plunder be easy to guess that in matter of stolen gun although credit of achievement belonged to captain cochin alone men must not have agreed on peaceable journey to france if have not be promised share in fruit of cargo when sold captain cochin found out that be a hard to avoid enemy ship when want a be to fall in with when do have be out nearly week beating about against fitful wind down west coast of ireland when one evening just before nightfall sighted land on weather bow between sail bearing down way a far a must make out stranger be cruiser in probability one of government vessel at time stationed off bantry bay on look out for of foreign smuggler privateer made hunting ground light fell too suddenly to enable to see more captain cochin flew english colour at mast head held on course until night hid completely then put out into wind ran for

armed carrying great spread of sail to surprise flew not english french colour on seeing captain cochin quickly hauled down english flag ran up that of own country disregarded stranger signal to come to held on with breath of wind must get into canvas set thief to catch thief say so french privateer suspecting french pirate to have good reason for running away pressed on sail gave full chase what surprised most be to see that be fast coming up on have never contemplated thing a arrow being caught by anything on water have to admit now be wrong if arrow be hare frenchman be greyhound however there be time to speculate on question of speed question be must show fight lie to explain there be hope of ship like ours so slenderly manned being able to capture even disable heavily armed pursuer on other hand to surrender meant losing booty possibly ship into bargain for french when suited purpose be ready enough to take advantage of chance of pressing smart craft like arrow into own service especially a bore english name be known to have preyed pretty impartially on friend foe alike eager consultation took place on deck urging one course while proposed to throw cargo overboard one two to scuttle ship however a good luck must have there be fifth way out of difficulty have little dreamed of sail on weather quarter suddenly shouted watch captain mate went aloft to view presently reported english frigate in full sail bearing down in direction seemed to be coming fast across wind by look of be regular line of battle ship with double row of gun snarling from port that settle said captain cochin rapidly recovering spirit while lion tiger fight mister fox slip off with booty way there keep a go master good day to monsieur spoke truth frenchman a soon a caught sight of english frigate altered course abruptly instead of being hunter became hunted so for hour more of held own way englishman closing on frenchman arrow sailing clear of towards afternoon distant sound of gun behind told battle have already begun before two be doubt at broadside to broadside after gave land wide berth met nothing need fear till at last with french flag flying sailed merrily into brest harbour safe sound without scratch on hull hole in canvas here captain cochin good luck suddenly deserted for sooner be berthed with sail stowed anchor out than discovered that french merchantman next be none other than vessel on last voyage out have attempted to board in mid channel for sudden squall must have captured plundered captain of merchantman have already reported wrong to authority now finding cheek by jowl with offender lost not moment in taking revenge so just a be about to lower boat for jaunt on shore to refresh after voyage port admiral sent off galley to board summon to attend on shore in iron show cause why must not one of be hanged by neck be pretty end to jaunt so suddenly done that there be nothing for to surrender follow where be bidden doubt smart craft like arrow with cargo of gun be good enough excuse for french admiral quite apart from delinquency at time like when france lived under reign of terror only excuse needed for act just unjust be force to perform may imagine out of hang dog prisoner who marched day through street of brest felt most ill used for have sailed in arrow by will of own have taken part in act of violence against frenchman dead alive yet because chanced to be among crew be to be hung by neck knew well enough from what have heard of french justice that excuse must be breath wasted indeed a one of few english of party must probably be spared even farce of trial only hope be that captain cochin who have not be unkind to so far must speak word in favour be marched to dismal white washed guard house on edge of town be there locked up by half dozen till suited admiral convenience to consider case be not till next day cell in five of shipmate be confined be small underground cellar reeking with damp foul smell lit only by narrow

of crew of merchantman be present told grievance with large sweep of assumption swore that be a bad a other judge demanded what captain cochin have to say cut short before have well opened mouth made feeble effort to put right not so much in hope of moving tribunal a of reminding captain cochin of claim on good office be too savage perturbed to take hint then came out that be bringing arm into

ireland be to rob friend of france to whom be arm about to be sold to must buy none enemy of france needed arm son be armed already therefore traffic be not only wicked treasonable for treason there

little coaxing next minute be out of casement in little courtyard one two window overlooked be too high for one to look from there be one to look if there be attraction of ghastly scene going on at other side took other way to same attraction doubt be due fact that sentry be patrolling back of prison succeeded by mean of rubbish heap in scaling wall before leaping down on other side thought occurred to that if must hide somewhere near till night must have better chance of escaping with pursuer ahead of than behind by following line of wall found must reach corner of prison where there be blank wall up gutter pipe ran to rambling gabled roof where if must only reach must hardly be looked for clamber be perilous one especially a heavy rain rendered iron pipe more than usually slippery be sailor enough to understand how to grip with hand foot succeeded with great difficulty in reaching top hiding away in deep angle of roof not safe indeed with time at least to breathe consider what

of wall before doubled on step have doubt have fled either towards open country to harbour where possibly might succeed in smuggling on board ship so instead of increasing sentry round house actually reduced in order to reinforce pursuing party policy be to get away while coast be comparatively unprotected trust to night good angel to get clear of place so when excitement have subsided little

be abundant england be at mercy of whom up till now have treated a veritable slave so on greatly troubled for from what knew of crew of zebra such seditious stuff furnished just fuel required to set spirit of men in blaze other missive thrown on board doubt containing same similar matter have pretty certainly fallen into hand of who must read call to mutiny with different eye from mine if so mischief be already far gone hastened with paper to lieutenant adrian who glanced over contemptuously bunkum wind said pitching into corner have heard sort of thing before if be true sir ventured to say that ship at nore have mutinied have better give wide berth for be catching thing pooh there be more in than cat noose two at yard arm can cure said however keep eye open mr gallagher report first

officer like lieutenant adrian so flagrant that have be fairly stated fairly met nothing good must have come of put forward a be likely to be by crew like ours encouraged fomented by agitator such a who have drawn up proclamation what issue be probable one of desperate struggle probably bloodshed be plainly seen when hand be piped next morning that temper of men have changed for worse a strolled indolently up on deck glanced up at well set sail saw bow pointing due north a eye fell on bright pistol side arm at officer belt be evident be in doubt a to what course to pursue talked together in
