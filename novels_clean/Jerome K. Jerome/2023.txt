unworthy of well principled white lady posing a friend benefactress of mankind for merely refusing to dance with at midnight by shore of mountain lake time place calculated to appeal to elderly gentleman suffering possibly from rheumatism on one occasion transformed eminently respectable proprietor of tin mine into nightingale necessitating change of habit to business man must have be singularly irritating on occasion quite important queen having have misfortune to quarrel with malvina over absurd point of etiquette in connection with lizard seems on waking next morning to have

wedding seems to have surpassed into what particular shape form altered wretched prince gerbot into what shape form persuaded that have be altered really so far a moral responsibility of malvina be concerned seems to be immaterial chronicle doe not state evidently something too indelicate for self respecting chronicler to even hint at a judging from other passage in book squeamishness doe not seem to have be author literary failing sensitive reader can feel only grateful for omission must have be altogether too harrowing have of course from malvina point of view desired effect princess berchta appears to have given one look then to have fallen fainting into arm of attendant marriage be postponed indefinitely malvina one sadly suspect chortled triumph be short lived unfortunately for king heremon have always be patron of art science of period among friend be to be reckoned magician genius nine korrigans fay of brittany sort of party capable of exerting influence a event proved

known to sleep so soundly a not to be disturbed by human footstep if wounded so unable to escape must not be breathing with quiet soft regularity contrasting so strangely with stillness silence round possibly owl nest young owlet make that sort of noise snorer so country people call young raffleton threw away cigar went down upon knee to grope among shadow doing so touched something warm soft yielding be owl must have touched very lightly for even then did not wake lay there with head upon arm now close to eye growing used to shadow saw quite plainly wonder of parted lip gleam of white limb beneath flimsy covering of course what ought to have done be to have risen gently moved away then must have coughed if did not wake might have touched lightly say on shoulder have called to first

cousin christopher description doubt suggesting to malvina friendly magician must have to go away for little while must return did not seem to matter to malvina minor detail be evident idea in mind that have be appointed to whether a master servant be le easy to conjecture probably mixture of with preference towards latter mentioned again that must not be away for longer than must help there be necessity for repetition be doubting weymouth with bathing machine gasometer faded away king rufus be out hunting a passed over new forest from salisbury plain a looked down pixy waved hand laughed

relieved to meet young arthur raffleton coming towards evidently sound in wind limb then began to wonder why devil have be frightened out of bed at six o'clock in morning if nothing be matter something clearly be before speaking arthur raffleton looked carefully about in manner suggestive of mystery if not of crime still without word taking cousin christopher by arm led way to farther end of orchard there on fallen branch beneath walnut tree cousin christopher saw apparently khaki coat with nothing in a approached rose up did not rise very high back of coat be towards collar stood out against sky line there be head standing upright turned round peeping out of fold cousin christopher saw child face then looking closer saw that be child then be quite sure what be so that coming to sudden halt in front of cousin christopher stared at with round wide eye then at flight commander raffleton be to malvina flight commander raffleton addressed said be professor littlecherry cousin christopher about whom told be obvious that malvina regarded professor a person of importance evidently intention be to curtsy operation hampered by trailing yard of clinging khaki might prove so flashed upon professor not only difficult dangerous allow said professor idea be to help malvina out of commander raffleton coat malvina be preparing to assist commander raffleton be only just in time think said commander raffleton if mind think 'd better leave for mr muldoon professor let go coat malvina appeared shade disappointed one opines that not unreasonably may have thought to make better

late for london train faint odour of egg bacon came wafted through garden mingled with scent of lavender pink for commander raffleton maybe there be excuse story so far a have gone have tried to make clear professor ought to have exploded in burst of homeric laughter else to have shaken head at warned where little girl go to who do sort of thing instead of stared from commander raffleton to malvina from malvina back to commander raffleton with eye so astonishingly round that might have be drawn with compass god bless soul said professor be most extraordinary be there king heremon of ireland asked commander raffleton professor be well known authority on matter of course there be king heremon of ireland answered professor quite petulantly a if commander have wanted to know if there have ever be julius caesar napoleon so there be queen harbundia malvina be always spoken of in connection with what did do inquired commander raffleton of seemed to be oblivious of malvina presence forget for moment confessed professor must look up something if remember rightly in connection with daughter of king dancrat founded norman dynasty william conqueror that lot good lord must mind staying with for time until can make arrangement suggested commander raffleton 'd be awfully obliged if must what professor answer might have be have be allowed to exercise such stock of wit a

of course knew of coming in probability be under guidance of god who have arranged whole sequence of event there remained only to tender gratitude did not wait for professor reply coat little hindered on other hand added perhaps appealing touch of own taking wise learned christopher hand in own knelt kissed in quaint archaic french of hers long study of chronicle of froissart enabled professor to understand thank said for noble courtesy hospitality in mysterious way whole affair have suddenly become imbued with dignity of historical event professor have sudden impression indeed never altogether left so long a malvina remained that be great powerful personage sister potentate incidentally though of course in high politics such point be immaterial most bewilderingly beautiful being have ever seen have graciously consented to become guest professor with bow might have be acquired at court of king rene expressed sense of honour done to what else must self respecting potentate do incident be closed flight commander raffleton seems to have done nothing in direction of re opening on contrary appears to have used precise moment for explaining to professor how absolutely necessary be that must depart for farnborough without moment loss of time commander raffleton added that must look up again first afternoon must get away be sure that if professor must get malvina to speak slowly must soon find french easy to understand did occur to professor to ask commander raffleton where have found malvina be if remembered also what be going to do about be if happened to know

gentleman have time for pudding rest might sit enjoy at leisure not so mr arlington somebody have to see to thing be if be not to be allowed to go to rack ruin if other people must not be relied upon to do duty so that everything inside house out of be thrown upon one pair of shoulder then followed a natural consequence that pair of shoulder must not spare necessary time to properly finish meal be be at root of decay of english farming when farmer wife to say nothing of son daughter old enough one might imagine to be anxious to do something in repayment for money care lavished upon have put shoulder to wheel then english farming have prospered when on other hand other people shirked fair share of labour responsibility leaving to one pair of hand be eldest arlington girl quite audible remark that pa must have eaten two helping of pudding while have be talking that caused mr arlington to lose thread of discourse to put quite bluntly what mr arlington meant to say be have never wanted to be farmer at least not in beginning other men in position having acquired competency by year of self sacrificing labour must have retired to well earned leisure having yielded to persuasion taken on job be going to see through everybody else be going to do share there must be trouble mr arlington swallowing remains of glass in single gulp spoilt dignified exit by violently hiccoughing mr arlington rang bell furiously for parlourmaid to clear away pudding passed untouched from before very eye of twin be black currant pudding with brown sugar night mr arlington appears to have confided in twin partly for own relief partly for moral benefit if mr arlington have enjoyed blessing in disguise of le indulgent mother might have be well by nature mr arlington have be endowed with active

child encouraged by mother example organisation be what be wanted day mapped out to hour appointed task then instead of morning being gone before must turn round confusion made worse confounded by leaving off what be doing trying to do six thing at once that must remember whether have done whether have here mr arlington appears to have dissolved into tear generally speaking be placid smiling most amiable lady quite delightful to have about house provided demanded of be pleasant look sunny disposition twin appear to have joined tear to hers tucked in left to one imago problem being discussed with grave seriousness much whispered conversation then slept upon morning bringing with idea result being that next evening between high tea supper mr muldoon answering knock at door found twin figure standing hand in hand on professor step asked if fairy be in v how be told to mr marigold there be need of proverbial feather mr muldoon made grab at settle missed caught at chair gave way be floor finally stopped be so sorry apologised victor thought knew ought to have said mademoiselle malvina mr muldoon regained foot without answering walked straight into study want to know said mr muldoon if fairy in professor with back to window be reading light in room be somewhat faint who want to know demanded professor twin from manor house explained mr muldoon what who began professor will say 'not at home ' suggested mr muldoon have better see show in directed professor came in looking little scared still holding one by hand wished professor good evening when rose backed away from professor shook hand with did not let go so that victoria gave right hand victor left then at professor invitation sat down on extreme edge of sofa hope disturb said victor wanted to see mademoiselle malvina why do want to see mademoiselle malvina inquired professor be something very private said victor wanted to ask great favour said victoria be sorry said professor be in at least think so professor never be quite sure slip in out making more noise than wind driven rose leaf be mr muldoon explanation have better tell leave to put to looked at one must never do to offend wise learned christopher besides magician be to be assumed have more way than one of learning what people be thinking be about mamma explained victoria wondered if malvina must mind changing professor have be reading up malvina flashed across that have always be speciality changing people how have arlington twin discovered why did want mother changed what did want changed into be shocking when come to think of professor became suddenly so stern that if twin must have seen expression owing to fading light must must have be too frightened to answer why do want mother changed demanded professor even a be voice alarmed be for own good faltered victoria of course mean into anything explained victor only inside added victoria thought that malvina might be able to improve completed victor be still very disgraceful what be coming to when child went about clamouring for mother to be improved atmosphere be charged with indignation twin felt want to be persisted victoria want to be energetic to get up early in morning do thing see added victor be never properly brought up professor maintains stoutly that only intention be joke be not even a if anything objectionable have be suggested professor have on occasion be made confidant of best woman that ever lived if only one must graft little energy upon sense of time too easy going idea of keeping people up to mark so mr arlington over nut wine be pure laziness oh yes be friend say be so bestful ' be proper explanation of born laziness yet try have idea professor littlecherry how much try so mr arlington laughingly while admiring professor rose besides how absurd to believe that malvina must possibly change anybody way back when human brain be yet in process of evolution such thing may have be possible hypnotic suggestion mesmeric influence dormant brain cell quickened into activity by magnetic vibration have be lost be day of george fifth not of king heremon what professor be really after be how must malvina receive proposal of course must try to get out of dear little thing must sane man professor of mathematics malvina be standing beside one have remarked entrance eye of twin have be glued upon wise learned christopher professor when be thinking never saw anything still be rather startling must never change what good god have once fashioned said malvina spoke very gravely childishness seemed to have fallen from did always think so said professor nettled professor that idea of being good joke have departed with sound of malvina voice have way with made little gesture conveyed to professor that remark have not be altogether in good taste speak a one who have learned said malvina beg pardon said professor ought not to have said that malvina accepted professor apology with bow be something very different continued professor quite interest have taken hold of professor be easy enough to summon dame commonsense to one aid when malvina be not present before strange eye good lady have habit of sneaking away suppose of course idea be ridiculous suppose something did happen a psychological experiment be not one justified be beginning of science applied curiosity malvina might be able willing to explain how be done be if anything did happen of course must so much better thing have got to be ended must be using gift not for one own purpose to help others urged professor see urged victor mamma really want to be changed papa want too urged victoria seems to if may so express added professor really must be in nature of making amends for well for for youthful folly concluded professor little nervously malvina eye be fixed on professor in dim light of low ceilinged room eye seemed of be visible wish said malvina be not at all fair a professor told afterwards laying responsibility on if really be original malvina lady in waiting to queen harbundia then be quite old enough to have decided for from professor calculation must now be about three thousand eight hundred professor be not

twin to door for reason professor must not have explained three walked out on tiptoe old mr brent postman be passing twin ran after took hand malvina be still standing where professor have left be very absurd professor felt frightened went into kitchen where be light cheerful started mr muldoon on home rule when returned to parlour malvina be gone twin did not talk that night decided next morning not to say word just to ask mother to come for evening walk with fear be that might demand reason quite oddly consented without question seemed to twin that be mr arlington who took pathway leading past cave when reached cross stone sat down apparently have forgotten existence stole away without noticing did not quite know what to do with ran for mile till came to wood there remained awhile careful not to venture within then crept back found mother sitting just a have left thought be asleep eye be wide open be tremendously relieved though what have feared never knew sat down one on side of took hand in spite of eye being open be quite time before seemed conscious of return rose slowly looked about a did so church clock struck nine must not at first believe be so late convinced by looking at watch there be just light enough for to see became at once more angry than twin have ever known for first time in life experienced sensation of having ear boxed nine o'clock be proper time for supper be hour from home be fault did not take hour took twenty minute mr arlington striding ahead twin panting breathless behind mr arlington have not yet returned came in five minute

strenuous life seeing to that everybody else lead strenuous life doe not go with unmixed amiability particularly in beginning new born zeal must expect to outrun discretion doe not do to discourage modification to be suggested later taken round mr arlington view be that thing must be regarded almost a answer to prayer mr arlington eye on way to higher level appear to have be arrested by church clock decided mr arlington to resume homeward way without further loss of time at bend of lane professor looking back observed that mr arlington have broken into trot seems to have be end of professor regarded a sane intelligent member of modern society have not be sure at time be now revealed to that when have urged malvina to test strength so to express on unfortunate mr arlington be with conviction that result must restore to mental equilibrium that malvina with wave of wand whatever hocus pocus may have be must be able to transform hitherto incorrigibly indolent easy going mr arlington into sort of feminine lloyd george have not really entered into calculation forgetting lunch must have wandered aimlessly about not returning home until late in afternoon during dinner appears to have be rather restless nervous jumpy according to evidence of little serving maid once sprang out of chair a if shot when little serving maid accidentally let fall table spoon twice upset salt be at mealtime that a rule professor found attitude towards malvina most sceptical fairy who must put away quite respectable cut from joint followed by two helping of pie doe take bit of believing in to night professor found difficulty white lady have never be averse to accepting mortal hospitality there must always have be certain adaptability malvina since fateful night of banishment have one supposes passed through varied experience for present purpose have assumed form of jeune fille of twentieth century anno domini appreciation of mr muldoon excellent cooking together with glass of light sound claret must naturally go with one take that must not for moment get mr arlington out of mind more than once stealing covert glance across table seemed to that malvina be regarding with mocking smile impish spirit must have be have prompted for thousand of year malvina have led at event so far a be known reformed blameless existence have subdued put behind that fatal passion of hers for change in other people what madness to have revived queen harbundia handy now to keep in check professor have distinct sensation while peeling pear that be being turned into guinea pig curious feeling of shrinking about leg so vivid be impression involuntarily professor jumped off chair ran to look at in mirror over sideboard be not fully relieved even then may have be mirror be very old one of thing with little gilt ball round looked to professor a if nose be growing straight out of face malvina trusting have not be taken suddenly ill asked if there be anything must do for seems to have earnestly begged not to think of professor have taught malvina cribbage usually of evening played hand two to night professor be not in mood malvina have contented with book

history of own encounter with proprietor of tin mine elderly gentleman disliking late hour whom have turned into nightingale occurred to professor prior to arlington case recalling of incident must have brought to shame remorse now seemed to think funny silly trick commented professor spoke quite heatedly one have right to go about changing people muddling up thing understand right malvina looked up gave little sigh not for one own pleasure revenge made answer tone be filled with meekness have touch of self reproach be very wrong of course changing for own good at least not changing

together be sorry said marigold rising did know agreed with who said agreed with snapped professor be in very awkward position suppose said marigold be hesitating with door in hand must be of use seeing believe said professor that be fond of neighbourhood of cross stone towards sundown can choose for if be must think twice about be wondering said marigold whether if put to a personal favour might not be willing to see edith again persuade that be only joking light began to break upon professor what do think have happened asked well explained marigold take that young foreign friend have met wife talked politics to have happened be result must be young person of extraordinary ability must be only losing one convert must make up to in in other way spoke with unconscious pathos rather touched professor might mean said professor be assuming that can be done at mr marigold returning to former self entirely taking further interest in politics must be so very grateful answered professor have mislaid spectacle think there be tear in marigold eye will do what can said professor of course must count on may be easier to start woman thinking than to stop even for professor

to be sawn through before must get off a to story about having be caught by mr dawson aunt kissing housemaid behind waterbutt a doctor admits be bit of bad luck might have happened to anyone whether there be really evidence connecting with dolly calthorpe unaccountable missing of last train home be of course more serious matter mr dawson handsome high spirited woman may have found dawson a originally fashioned trying to nerve though even then question arises why have married there be difference a mr dawson have pointed out between husband who have enough of natural man in husband who have deal too much be difficult to regulate matter altogether taking outside estimate doctor opinion be that there may have be dozen who with malvina assistance succeeded in hypnotising into temporary insanity when malvina little disappointed yielding quite sweetly own judgment to of wise learned christopher consented to restore explanation be that having spent burst of ill acquired energy fell back at first suggestion to former self mr arlington doe not agree with doctor have be trying to reform for quite long time have miserably failed there be something about might almost be described a aroma prompted that evening to take twin into confidence sort of intuition that in way must help remained with next day when twin returned in evening in company with postman knew instinctively that have be about business be same intuitive desire drew to down be confident must have taken walk to cross stone even if twin have not proposed indeed according to own account be not aware that twin have accompanied there be something about stone sense a of presence knew when reached that have arrived at appointed place when there appeared to coming from where must not tell diminutive figure seemed in

ceaseless struggle activity contention a now end aim of existence at first did not recollect where be strange colourless light be around strange singing a of myriad of bird then clock struck nine life came back to with rush with still that conviction that must seize hold of herself everybody else get thing done immediate expression a already have be mentioned be experienced by twin when after talk with professor aided abetted by mr arlington eldest arlington girl consented to pay second visit to stone be with very different sensation that climbed grass grown path little lady have met a before

ending with contest effort seemed to pas into sleep when opened eye be again alone feeling little chilly unreasonably tired walked slowly home not being hungry retired supperless to bed quite unable to explain why seems to have cried to sleep one supposes that something of similar nature may have occurred to others with exception of mr marigold be case of mr marigold a doctor grudgingly admits went far to weaken hypothesis mr marigold having emerged be spreading much to own satisfaction have discarded wedding ring a relic of barbarism of day when woman be mere good chattel have made first speech at meeting in favour of marriage reform subterfuge in case have to be resorted to malvina have tearfully consented marigold mp be to bring mr marigold to cross stone same evening there leave

chiming of clock recalled to professor appointment with mr marigold will only just have time said gently seeking to release will promise to keep till come back a malvina did not seem to understand reminded still made movement save for little gesture of hand a if be seeking to lay hold of something unseen then dropped arm looked from one of to other professor did not think of at time remembered

beginning of story name of man buried in highgate cemetery be hepworth after not michael alex elder brother from boyhood have be violent brutal unscrupulous judging from ellenby story be difficult to accept a product of modern civilisation rather must seem to have be throwback to savage buccaneering ancestor to expect to work while must live in vicious idleness at somebody else expense be found to be hopeless debt be paid for about third fourth time be shipped off to colony unfortunately there be mean of keeping there so soon a money provided have be squandered returned demanding more by menace threat meeting with unexpected firmness seems to have regarded theft forgery a only alternative left to to save from punishment family name from disgrace parent saving be sacrificed be grief shame according to ellenby killed within few month of one deprived by blow of what doubt have come to consider natural mean of support sister fortunately for herself being well out of reach next fixed upon brother michael a stay by michael weak timid not perhaps without remains of boyish affection for strong handsome elder brother foolishly yielded demand of course increased until in end came almost a relief when man vicious life led to getting mixed up with crime of particularly odious nature be anxious now for own sake to get away michael with little enough to spare for provided with mean on solemn understanding that must never return worry misery of have left young michael broken man unable to concentrate mind longer upon profession craving be to get away from old association to make fresh start in life be ellenby who suggested london ship furnishing business where michael small remaining capital must be of service name of hepworth must be valuable in shipping circle ellenby arguing consideration chiefly with hope of giving young michael more interest in business have insisted that firm must be hepworth co have not be started year before man returned a usual demanding more money michael acting under ellenby guidance refused in term convinced brother that game of bullying be up waited while then wrote pathetically that be ill starving if only for sake of young wife must not michael come see be first have heard of marriage there be just faint hope that might have effected change michael against ellenby advice decided to go in miserable lodging house in east end found young wife not brother who did not return till be on point of leaving in interval girl seems to have confided story to michael have be singer engaged at music hall in rotterdam there alex hepworth calling charlie martin have met made love to when chose must be agreeable enough doubt youth beauty have given to protestation for time being genuine ring of admiration desire be to escape from surroundings more than anything else that have consented be little more than child anything seemed preferable to nightly horror to life exposed have never married at least be belief at time during first drunken bout have flung in face that form have gone through be mere bunkum unfortunately for be lie have always be coolly calculating be probably with idea of safe investment that have

to earn money for on street have tried to cut throat now that have got back to england intended to leave if followed killed did not care be for sake that young hepworth eventually offered to help brother again on condition that must go away by to other agreed seems to have given short display of remorse there must have be grin on face a turned away cunning eye have foreseen what be likely to happen idea of blackmail be doubt in mind from beginning with charge of bigamy a weapon in hand might rely for rest of life upon steady increasing income michael saw brother off a second class passenger on ship bound for cape of course there be little chance of keeping word there be always chance of getting knocked on head in brawl anyhow must be out of way for season girl lola must be left month later married four month after received letter from brother containing message to mr martin from loving husband charlie who hoped before long to have pleasure of seeing again inquiry through english consul in rotterdam proved that threat be mere bluff marriage have be legal binding what happened on night of murder be very much a friend have reconstructed ellenby reaching office at usual time next morning have found hepworth waiting for there have remained in hiding until one morning with dyed hair slight moustache have ventured forth have man death be brought about by other mean ellenby must have counselled coming forward facing trial a be anxious to do viewed in conjunction with relief man death must have be to of loaded revolver be too suggestive of premeditation isolation of house conveniently near pond must look a if thought of beforehand even if pleading extreme provocation michael escaped rope long term of penal servitude must be inevitable be certain that even then woman must go free murdered man must still by strange freak be husband murderer in eye of law lover passionate will have prevailed young hepworth have sailed for america there have difficulty in
