with that be never feeling better in life that did not require medicine sir did one single scintilla of thought of kind occur to in connection with matter jimmy from beginning to end sir people who never met jimmy disbelieve story argue that premise be in disaccord with known law governing human nature that detail square with average of probability people who have seen conversed with jimmy accept with simple faith advent of jephson trust reader have not entirely forgotten cheered up considerably jephson be always at best when other thing be at worst be not that struggled in mark tapley fashion to appear most cheerful when most depressed be that petty misfortune mishap genuinely amused inspirited most of can recall unpleasant experience with amused affection jephson possessed robuster philosophy enabled to enjoy during actual progress arrived drenched to skin chuckling hugely at idea of having come down on visit to houseboat in such weather under warming influence hard line on face thawed by supper time be a englishman woman who wish to enjoy life must be independent of weather later on a if disheartened by indifference rain ceased took chair out on deck sat watching lightning still played incessantly then not unnaturally talk drifted into sombre channel began recounting story dealing with gloomy mysterious side of life of be worth remembering be not one left strongest impression on mind be tale jephson told have be relating somewhat curious experience of own met man in strand one day knew very well a thought though have not seen for year walked together to charing cross there shook hand parted next morning spoke of meeting to mutual friend then learnt for first time that man have died six month before natural inference be that have mistaken one man for error that not having good memory for face frequently fall into what be remarkable about matter however be that throughout walk have conversed with man under impression that be that other dead man whether by coincidence not reply have never once suggested to mistake a soon a finished jephson who have be listening very thoughtfully asked if believed in spiritualism to fullest extent be rather large question answered what do mean by bepiritualism to fullest extent ' well do believe that spirit of dead have not only power of revisiting earth at will that when here have power of action rather of exciting to action let put definite case spiritualist friend of mine sensible by mean imaginative man once told that table through medium of spirit of friend have be in habit of communicating with came slowly across room towards of own accord one night a sat alone pinioned against wall now can of believe that ca must brown took upon to reply before doing so must wish for introduction to friend who told story speaking generally continued seems to that difference between what call natural supernatural be merely difference between frequency rarity of occurrence having regard to phenomenon be compelled to admit think illogical to disbelieve anything be unable to disprove for part remarked macshaughnassy can believe in ability of spirit friend to give quaint entertainment credited to much easier than can in desire to do so mean added jephson that can not understand why spirit not compelled a be by exigency of society must care to spend evening carrying on laboured childish conversation with room full of abnormally uninteresting people be precisely what can not understand macshaughnassy agreed said jephson be thinking of something very different altogether suppose man died with dearest wish of heart unfulfilled do believe that spirit might have power to return to earth complete interrupted work well answered macshaughnassy if one admits possibility of spirit retaining interest in affair of world at be certainly more reasonable to imagine engaged upon task such a suggest than to believe that occupy with performance of mere drawing room trick what be leading up to why to replied jephson seating straddle legged across chair leaning arm upon back be told story morning at hospital by old french doctor actual fact be few simple be known can be read in paris police record of sixty two year ago most important part of case however be part be not known never will be known story begin with great wrong done by one man unto man what
