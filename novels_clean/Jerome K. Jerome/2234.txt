given name of witch cauldron be from spot that have first watched mivanway coming to from sea took pipe from mouth leaning against rock whose rugged outline seemed fashioned into face of old friend gazed down narrow pathway now growing indistinct in dim light a gazed figure of mivanway came slowly up pathway from sea paused before felt fear have half expected coming be complement of dream looked older graver than remembered for that face be sweeter wondered if must speak to only looked at with sad eye stood there in shadow of rock without moving passed on into twilight have on return cared to discus subject with landlord have even shown ready listener for old man loved to gossip might have learnt that young widow lady named mr charles seabohn accompanied by unmarried sister have lately come to reside in neighbourhood having upon death of former tenant taken lease of small farmhouse sheltered in valley mile beyond village that favourite evening walk be to sea back by steep footway leading past witch cauldron have followed figure of mivanway into valley must have known out of sight of witch cauldron took to running fast till reached welcome door fell panting into arm of figure have hastened out to meet dear said elder woman be trembling like leaf have happened have seen answered mivanway seen whom charles charles repeated other looking at mivanway a though thought mad spirit mean explained mivanway in awed voice be standing in shadow of rock in exact spot where first met looked older more careworn oh margaret so sad reproachful dear said sister leading in be overwrought wish have never come back to house oh be not frightened answered mivanway have be expecting evening be so glad came perhaps will come again can ask to forgive so next night mivanway though much against sister wish advice persisted in usual walk charles at same twilight hour started from inn again mivanway saw standing in shadow of rock charles have made up mind that if thing happened again must speak when silent figure of mivanway clothed in fading light stopped gazed at will failed that be spirit of mivanway standing before have not faintest doubt one may dismiss other people ghost a phantasy of weak brain one know one own to be reality charles for last five year have mingled with people whose dead dwell about once drawing courage around made to speak a did so figure of mivanway shrank from only sigh escaped lip hearing that figure of mivanway turned again passed down path into valley leaving charles gazing after third night arrived at trysting spot with determination screwed up to sticking point charles be first to speak a figure of mivanway came towards with eye fixed sadly on moved from shadow of rock stood before mivanway said charles replied figure of mivanway spoke in awed whisper suitable to circumstance stood gazing sorrowfully upon other be happy asked mivanway question strike one a somewhat farcical must be remembered that mivanway be daughter of gospeller of old school have be brought up to belief be not then out of date a happy a deserve to be be sad reply answer inference be not complimentary to charles desert struck chill to mivanway heart how must be happy having lost went on voice of charles now speech fell very pleasantly upon mivanway ear in first place relieved of despair regarding charles future doubt present suffering be keen there be hope for secondly be decidedly pretty speech for ghost be not at sure that mivanway be kind of woman to be averse to little mild flirtation with spirit of charles can forgive asked mivanway forgive replied charles in tone of awed astonishment can forgive be brute fool be not worthy to love most gentlemanly spirit seemed to be mivanway forgot to be afraid of be to blame answered mivanway time there be le submission in tone be most at fault be petulant child did not know how deeply loved loved repeated voice of charles voice lingered over word a though found

jerked from breast pocket charles following mivanway eye saw also memory of prohibition against smoking came back to without stopping to consider futility of action nay direct confession implied thereby instinctively grabbed at pipe rammed back into pocket then avalanche of mingled understanding bewilderment fear joy swept mivanway brain before felt must do one of two thing laugh scream go on screaming laughed peal after peal of laughter sent echoing among rock charles springing to foot be just in time to catch a fell forward dead weight into arm ten minute later eldest miss evans hearing heavy footstep went to door saw what took to be spirit of charles seabohn staggering under weight of lifeless body of mivanway sight not unnaturally alarmed charles suggestion of brandy however sounded human urgent need of attending to mivanway kept mind from dwelling upon problem tending towards insanity charles carried mivanway to room laid upon bed will leave with whispered to eldest miss evans will be better for not to see until be quite recovered have have shock charles waited in dark parlour for what seemed to exceedingly long time at last eldest miss evans returned be right now be

long night cried saying trusted in spoken word broke meat with put faith in in god passed beneath shadow of cross to enter door let god make answer be there silence till dawn then abbot rose from where knelt called to god saying thou hast heard o god make answer there came great sound from sea a though tongue have be given to deep so that monk fell upon knee in fear abbot answered be voice of god speaking through water hath made answer that winter mighty storm arose like of man have known before for sea be piled upon dry land until highest tower of town of seven tower be not more high

circling gull weary cry of sea that god anger be not everlasting that evil that there be in men will be blotted out who doubt may also learn from wisdom of simple fisher folk who dwell about border of marsh land for will tell on stormy night there speaks deep voice from sea calling dead monk to rise from forgotten graf chant mass for soul of men of town of seven tower clothed in long glittering white move with slowly pacing foot around abbey grass grown aisle music of prayer be heard above screaming of storm to also can bear witness for have seen passing of shrouded form behind blackness of shattered shaft have heard sweet sad singing above wailing of wind thus for many age have dead monk prayed that men of town of seven tower may be forgiven thus for many age yet will so pray till day come when of once fair abbey not single stone will stand upon fellow in day will be known that anger of god against men of town of seven tower have passed away in day foot of water will move back town of seven tower will stand again upon dry land there be know who say that be legend who will tell that shadowy shape that may see with own eye on stormy night waving gleaming arm behind ruined buttress be of phosphorescent foam tossed by raging wave above cliff that sweet sad harmony cleaving trouble of night be aeolian music of wind such be of blind who see only with eye for see white robed monk hear chanting of mass for soul of sinful men of town of seven tower for have be said that when evil deed be done prayer be born to follow through time into eternity plead for thus be whole world
