then must protest against harris having bath at said there must be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food for harris up against stream a be urged upon george however how much pleasanter must be to have harris clean fresh about boat even if did have to take few more hundredweight of provision got to see in light withdrew opposition to harris bath agreed finally that must take three bath towel so a not to keep other waiting for clothes george said two suit of flannel must be sufficient a must wash in river when got dirty asked if have ever tried washing flannel in river replied not

in lonely field under blasted oak took awful oath have be swearing for whole week about thing in ordinary middle class way be swell affairan awful oath never to take paraffine oil with in boat again except of course in case of sickness therefore in present instance confined to methylated spirit even be bad enough get methylated pie methylated cake methylated spirit be more wholesome when taken

people who never did harm honestly imago that have given treat say will sing comic song after supper speaking of comic song party reminds of rather curious incident at once assisted a throw much light upon inner mental working of human nature in general ought think to be recorded in page be fashionable highly cultured party have on best clothes talked pretty be very happyall except two young fellow student just returned from germany commonplace young men who seemed restless uncomfortable a if found proceeding slow truth be be too clever for brilliant polished conversation high class taste be beyond be out of place among never ought to have be there at everybody agreed upon later on played morceau from old german master discussed philosophy ethic flirted with graceful dignity be even humorousin high class way somebody recited french poem after supper said be beautiful then lady sang sentimental ballad in spanish made one two of be so pathetic then two young men got up asked if have ever heard herr slossenn boschen who have just arrived be then down in supper room sing great german comic song none of have heard that must remember young men said be funniest song have ever be written that if liked must get herr slossenn boschen whom knew very well to sing said be so funny that when herr slossenn boschen have sung once before german emperor german emperor have have to be carried off to bed said nobody must sing like herr slossenn boschen be so intensely serious through that might fancy be reciting tragedy that of course made funnier said never once suggested by tone manner that be singing anything funnythat must spoil be air of seriousness almost of pathos that made so irresistibly amusing said yearned to hear that wanted good laugh went downstairs fetched herr slossenn boschen appeared to be quite pleased to sing for came up at once sat down to piano without word oh will amuse will laugh whispered two young men a passed through room took up unobtrusive position behind professor back herr slossenn boschen accompanied prelude did not suggest comic song exactly be weird soulful air quite made one flesh creep murmured to one that be german method prepared to enjoy dont understand german learned at school forgot word of two year after have left have felt much better ever since still did not want people there to guess ignorance so hit upon what thought to be rather good idea kept eye on two young student followed when tittered tittered when roared roared also threw in little snigger by now then a if have seen bit of humour have escaped others considered particularly artful on part noticed a song progressed that good many other people seemed to have eye fixed on two young men a well a other people also tittered when young men tittered roared when young men roared a two young men tittered roared exploded with laughter pretty continuously through song went exceedingly well yet german professor did not seem happy at first when began to laugh expression of face be one of intense surprise a if laughter be very last thing have expected to be greeted with thought very funny said earnest manner be humour slightest hint on part that knew how funny be must have completely ruined all a continued to laugh surprise gave way to air of annoyance indignation scowled fiercely round upon except upon two young men who being behind must not see that sent into convulsion told other that must be death of thing word alone said be enough to send into fit added to mock seriousnessoh be too much in last verse surpassed glowered round upon with look of such concentrated ferocity for being forewarned a to german method of comic singing must have be nervous threw wailing note of agony into weird music that if have not known be funny song might have wept finished amid perfect shriek of laughter said be funniest thing have ever heard in life said how strange be that in face of thing like there must be popular notion that german hadnt sense of humour asked professor why didnt translate song into english so that common people must understand hear what real comic song be like then herr slossenn boschen got up went on awful swore at in german must judge to be singularly effective language for purpose danced shook fist called english knew said have never be so insulted in life appeared that song be not comic song at be about young girl who lived in hartz mountain who have given up life to save lover soul died met spirit in air then in last verse jilted spirit went on with spiritim not quite sure of detail be something very sad know herr boschen said have sung once before german emperor german emperor have sobbed like little child herr boschen said be generally acknowledged to be one of most tragic pathetic song in german language be trying situation for usvery trying there seemed to be answer looked around for two young men who have done thing have left house in unostentatious manner immediately after end of song be end of party never saw party break up so quietly with so little fuss never said good night even to one came downstairs one at time walking softly keeping shady side asked servant for hat coat in whisper opened door for ourselves slipped out got round corner quickly avoiding other a much a possible have never taken much interest in german song since then reached

ready while harris towed because getting tea be such worrying work harris looked tired only reply made to however be to pas over tow line took stepped out picture dog wrapped in tow line there be something very strange unaccountable about tow line roll up with a much patience care a must take to fold up new pair of trouser five minute afterwards when pick up be one ghastly soul revolting

boveney one rather windy morning be pulling down stream a came round bend noticed couple of men on bank be looking at other with a bewildered helplessly miserable expression a have ever witnessed on human countenance before since held long tow line between be clear that something have happened so eased up asked be matter why boat gone off replied in indignant tone just got out to disentangle tow line when looked round be gone seemed hurt at what evidently regarded a mean ungrateful act on part of boat found truant for mile further down held by rush brought back to bet did not give that boat chance for week will never forget picture of two men walking up down bank with tow line looking for boat one see good many funny incident up river in connection with towing one of most common be sight of couple of tower walking briskly along deep in animated discussion while man in boat hundred yard behind be vainly shrieking to to stop making frantic sign of distress with scull something have gone wrong rudder have come off boat hook have slipped overboard hat have dropped into water be floating rapidly down stream call to to stop quite gently politely at first picture hat in water hi stop

face curse everything know small boy on bank stop jeer at pitch stone at a be pulled along past at rate of four mile hour cant get out much of sort of trouble must be saved if who be towing must keep remembering that be towing give pretty frequent look round to see how man be getting on be best to let one person tow when two be doing get chattering forget boat offering a doe little resistance be of real service in reminding of fact a example of how utterly oblivious pair of tower can be to work george told later on in evening when be discussing subject after supper of very curious instance picture two people towing boat adrift three other men so said be sculling very heavily laden boat up from maidenhead one evening little above cookham lock noticed fellow girl walking along towpath deep in apparently interesting absorbing conversation be carrying boat hook between attached to boat hook be tow line trailed behind end in water boat be near boat be in sight there must have be boat attached to tow line at time other be certain what have become of ghastly fate have overtaken who have be left in be buried in mystery whatever accident may have be however have in way disturbed young lady gentleman who be towing have boat hook have line seemed to be that thought necessary to work george be about to call out wake up at moment bright idea flashed across didnt got hitcher instead reached over drew in end of tow line made loop in put over mast then tidied up scull went sat down in stern lit pipe that young man young woman towed four hulking chap heavy boat up to marlow george said never saw so much thoughtful sadness concentrated into one glance before a when at lock that young couple grasped idea for last two mile have be towing wrong boat george fancied that if have not be for restraining influence of sweet woman at side young man might have given way to violent language maiden be first to recover from surprise when did clasped hand said wildly oh henry then where be auntie did ever recover old lady asked harris george replied did not know example of dangerous want of sympathy between tower towed be witnessed by george once up near walton be where tow path shelf gently down into water be camping on opposite bank noticing thing in general by by small boat came in sight towed through water at tremendous pace by powerful barge horse on sat very small boy scattered about boat in dreamy reposeful attitude lay five fellow man who be steering having particularly restful appearance must like to see pull wrong line murmured george a passed at precise moment man did boat rushed up bank with noise like ripping up of forty thousand linen sheet two men hamper three oar immediately left boat on larboard side reclined on bank one half moment afterwards two other men disembarked from starboard sat down among boat hook sail carpet bag bottle last man went on twenty yard further then got out on head seemed to sort of lighten boat went on much easier small boy shouting at top of voice urging steed into gallop fellow sat up stared at one be second before realised what have happened to when did began to shout lustily for boy to stop however be too much occupied with horse to hear watched flying after until distance hid from view can not say be sorry at mishap indeed only wish that young fool who have boat towed in fashionand plenty docould meet with similar misfortune besides risk run become danger annoyance to other boat pas going at pace do be impossible for to get out of anybody el way for anybody else to get out of line get hitched across mast overturn catch somebody in boat throw into water cut face open best plan be to stand ground be prepared to keep off with butt end of mast of experience in connection with towing most exciting be being towed by girl be sensation that nobody ought to miss take three girl to tow always two hold rope other one run round round giggle generally begin by getting tied up get line round leg have to sit down on path undo other then twist round neck be nearly strangled fix straight however at last start off at run pulling boat along at quite dangerous pace at end of hundred yard be naturally breathless suddenly stop sit down on grass laugh boat drift out to mid stream turn round before know what have happened can get hold of scull then stand up be surprised oh look say he gone right out into middle picture lady pinning up frock pull on pretty steadily for bit after then at once occurs to one of that will pin up frock ease up for purpose boat run aground jump up push off shout to not

haul up in have originally intended to go on to magna charta island sweetly pretty part of river where wind through soft green valley to camp in one of many picturesque inlet to be found round tiny shore somehow did not feel that yearned for picturesque nearly so much now a have earlier in day bit of water between coal barge gas work must have quite satisfied for night did not want scenery wanted to have supper go to bed however did pull up to pointpicnic point be calledand dropped into very pleasant nook under great elm tree to spreading root of fastened boat then thought be going to have supper have dispensed with tea so a to save time george said that have better get canvas up first before got quite dark while must see what be doing then said work must be done must sit down to eat with easy mind canvas wanted more putting up than think of have bargained for looked so simple in abstract took five iron arch like gigantic croquet hoop fitted up over boat then stretched canvas over fastened down must take quite ten minute thought be under estimate took up hoop began to drop into socket placed for must not imagine to be dangerous work looking back now wonder to be that of be alive to tell tale be not hoop be demon first must not fit into socket at have to jump on kick hammer at with boat hook when be in turned out that be wrong hoop for particular socket have to come out

to arrange covering over george unrolled fastened one end over nose of boat harris stood in middle to take from george roll on to kept by stern to receive be long time coming down to george did part right be new work to harris bungled how managed know must not explain by mysterious process other succeeded after ten minute of superhuman effort in getting completely rolled up in be so firmly wrapped round tucked in folded over that must not get out of course made frantic struggle for freedomthe birthright of englishmanand in doing so learned afterwards knocked over george then george swearing at harris began to struggle too got entangled rolled up picture watching waiting knew nothing about at time did not understand business at have be told to stand where be wait till canvas came to montmorency stood there waited a good a gold must see canvas being violently jerked tossed about pretty considerably supposed be part of method did not interfere also heard much smothered language coming from underneath guessed that be finding job rather troublesome concluded that must wait until thing have got little simpler before joined in waited time matter seemed to get only more more involved until at last george head came wriggling out over side of boat spoke up said give hand here cant cuckoo standing there like stuffed mummy when see be being suffocated dummy never must withstand appeal for help so went undid not before be time for harris be nearly black in face took hour hard labour after before be properly up then cleared deck got out supper put kettle on to boil

insteadteas so indigestible upon kettle boil over put stove out adopted harmless bit of trickery result be that by time everything else be ready tea be waiting then lit lantern squatted down to supper wanted that supper for five thirty minute not sound be heard throughout length breadth of boat save clank of cutlery crockery steady grinding of four set of molar at end of five thirty minute harris said ah took left leg out from under put right one there instead five minute afterwards george said ah too threw plate out on bank three minute later than montmorency gave first sign of contentment have exhibited since have started rolled over on side spread leg out then said ah bent head back bumped against one of hoop did not mind did not even swear how good one feel when one be fullhow

a be said steady old man ware wheat harris instead of merely observing in most unpleasant tone that fellow must hardly help treading on bit of george foot if have to move about at within ten yard of where george be sitting suggesting that george never ought to come into ordinary sized boat with foot length advising to hang over side a must have done before supper now said oh im so sorry old chap hope havent hurt picture smoking pipe george said not at that be fault harris said be be quite pretty to hear lit pipe sat looking out on quiet night talked george said why must not be always like thisaway from world with sin temptation leading sober peaceful life doing good said be sort of thing have often longed for discussed possibility of going away four to handy well fitted desert island living there in wood harris said that danger about desert island a far a have heard be that be so damp george said not if properly drained then got on to drain that put george in mind of very funny thing happened to father once said father be travelling with fellow through wale one night stopped at little inn where there be other fellow joined other fellow spent evening with have very jolly

got on well to tell truth man chucked out so mine say dont think much of inn do be name of inn said pig whistle said george why ah then isnt same replied harris what do mean queried george why so curious murmured harris precisely very same thing happened to father once at country inn ive often heard tell tale thought might have be same inn turned in at ten night thought must sleep well being tired didnt a rule undress put head on pillow then somebody bang at door say be half past eight to night everything seemed against novelty of hardness of boat cramped position be lying with foot under one seat head on sound of lapping water round boat wind among branch kept restless disturbed did get to sleep for few hour then part of boat seemed to have grown up in nightfor certainly be not there when started have disappeared by morningkept digging into spine slept through for while dreaming have swallowed sovereign that be cutting hole in back with gimlet so a to try get out thought very unkind of told must owe money must have at end of month must not hear of said must be much better if have then because otherwise interest must accumulate so got quite cross with after bit told what thought of then gave gimlet excruciating wrench woke up boat seemed stuffy head ached so thought must step out into cool night air slipped on what clothes must find aboutsome of own of george harrissand crept under canvas on to bank be glorious night moon have sunk left quiet earth alone with star seemed a if in silence hush while child slept be talking with sisterconversing of mighty mystery in voice too vast deep for childish human ear to catch sound awe strange star so cold so clear be a child whose small foot have strayed into dim lit temple of god have be taught to worship know not standing where echoing dome span long vista of shadowy light glance up half hoping half afraid to see awful vision hovering there yet seems so full of comfort of strength night in great presence small sorrow creep away ashamed day have be so full of fret care heart have be so full of evil of bitter thought world have seemed so hard wrong to then night like great loving mother gently lay hand upon fevered head turn little tear stained face up to hers smile though doe not speak know what must say lay hot flushed cheek against bosom pain be gone sometimes pain be very deep real

tore flesh of that lost way therein leaf of tree grew in wood be very dark thick so that ray of light came through branch to lighten gloom sadness a passed by dark wood one knight of rode missing comrade wandered far away returned to more sorely grieving rode on without mourning a one dead now when reached fair castle towards have be journeying stayed there many day made merry one night a sat in cheerful ease around log burned in great hall drank loving measure there came comrade have lost greeted clothes be ragged like beggar many sad wound be on sweet flesh upon face there shone great radiance of deep joy questioned asking what have befallen told how in dark wood have lost way have wandered many day night till torn bleeding have lain down to die then when be nigh unto death lo through savage gloom there came to stately maiden took by hand led on through devious path unknown to man until upon darkness of wood there dawned light such a light of day be unto a little lamp unto sun in wondrous light way worn knight saw a in dream vision so glorious so fair vision seemed that of bleeding wound thought no more stood a one entranced whose joy be deep a be sea whereof man can

knight saw therein may not speak tell chapter xi how george once upon time got up early in morninggeorge harris montmorency like look of cold waterheroism determination on part of jgeorge shirt story with moralharris a cookhistorical retrospect specially inserted for use of school woke at six next morning found george awake too turned round tried to go to sleep again must not have there be particular reason why must not have gone to sleep again have got up dressed then there must have dropped off while be looking at watch have slept till ten a there be earthly necessity for getting up under two hour at very least getting up at time be utter absurdity be only in keeping with natural cussedness of thing in general that must feel that lying down for five minute more must be death to george said that same kind of thing only worse have happened to eighteen month ago when be lodging by in house of certain mr gippings said watch went wrong one evening stopped at quarter past eight did not know at time because for reason other forgot to wind up when went to bed unusual occurrence with hung up over pillow without ever looking at thing be in winter when happened very near shortest day week of fog into bargain so fact that be still very dark when george woke in morning be guide to a to time reached up hauled down watch be quarter past eight angel minister of grace defend exclaimed george here have got to be in city by nine why didnt somebody call oh be shame flung watch down sprang out of bed have cold bath washed dressed shaved in cold water because there be not time to wait for hot then rushed have look at watch whether shaking have received in being thrown down on bed have started how be george must not say certain be that from quarter past eight have begun to go now pointed to twenty minute to nine george snatched up rushed downstairs in sitting room be dark silent there be fire breakfast george said be wicked shame of mr g made up mind to tell what thought of when came home in evening then dashed on great coat hat seizing umbrella made for front door door be not even unbolted george anathematized mr g for lazy old woman thought be very strange that people must not get up at decent respectable time unlocked unbolted door ran out ran hard for quarter of mile at end of distance began to be borne in upon a strange curious thing that there be so few people about that there be shop open be certainly very dark foggy morning still seemed unusual course to stop business on account have to go to business why must other people stop in bed merely because be dark foggy at length reached not shutter be down not bus be about there be three men in sight one of whom be policeman market cart full of cabbage dilapidated looking cab george pulled out watch looked at be five minute to nine stood still counted pulse stooped down felt leg then with watch still in hand went up to policeman asked if knew what time be picture george policeman whats time said man eyeing george up down with evident suspicion why if listen will hear strike george listened neighbouring clock immediately obliged only gone three said george in injured tone when have finished well how many did want to go replied constable why nine said george showing watch do know where live said guardian of public order severely george thought gave address oh thats where be be replied man well take advice go there quietly take watch of yours with dont let have more of george went home again musing a walked along let in at first when got in determined to undress go to bed again when thought of redressing re washing having of bath determined must not must sit up go to sleep in easy chair must not get to sleep never felt more wakeful in life so lit lamp got out chess board played game of chess even did not enliven seemed slow somehow so gave chess up tried to read did not seem able to take sort of interest in reading so put on coat again went out for walk be horribly lonesome dismal policeman met regarded with undisguised suspicion turned lantern on followed about have such effect upon at last that began to feel a if really have done something got to slinking down by street hiding in dark doorway when heard regulation flip flop approaching of course conduct made force only more distrustful of than ever must come rout out ask what be doing there when answered nothing have merely come out for stroll be then four oclock in morning looked a though did not believe two plain clothes constable came home with to see if really did live where have said did saw go in with key then took up position opposite watched house thought must light fire when got inside make breakfast just to pas away time did not seem able to handle anything from scuttleful of coal to teaspoon without dropping falling over making such noise that be in mortal fear that must wake mr g up that must think be burglar open window call police then two detective must rush in handcuff march off to police court be in morbidly nervous state by time pictured trial trying to explain circumstance to jury nobody believing being sentenced to twenty year penal servitude mother dying of broken heart so gave up trying to get breakfast wrapped up in overcoat sat in easy chair till mr g came down at half past seven said have never got up too early since morning have be warning to have be sitting huddled up in rug while george have be telling true story on finishing set to work to wake up harris with scull third prod did turned over on other side said must be down in minute that must have lace up boot soon let know where be however by aid of hitcher sat up suddenly sending montmorency who have be sleeping sleep of just right on middle of chest sprawling across boat then pulled up canvas four of poked head out over off side looked down at water shivered idea overnight have be that must get up early in morning fling off rug shawl throwing back canvas spring into river with joyous shout revel in long delicious swim somehow now morning have come notion seemed le tempting water looked damp chilly wind felt cold well who going to be first in said harris at last there be rush for precedence george settled matter so far a be concerned by retiring into boat pulling on sock montmorency gave vent to involuntary howl a if merely thinking of thing have given horror harris said must be so difficult to get into boat again went back sorted out trouser did not altogether like to give in though did not relish plunge there might be snag about weed thought meant to compromise matter by going down to edge just throwing water over so took towel crept out on bank wormed way along on to branch of tree dipped down into water picture in thames be bitterly cold wind cut like knife thought must not throw water over after must go back into boat dress turned to do so a turned silly branch gave way towel went in together with tremendous splash be out mid stream with gallon of thames water inside before knew what have happened by jove old j gone in heard harris say a came blowing to surface didnt think hed have pluck to do did be all right sung out george lovely spluttered back be duffer not to come in wouldnt have missed for world why wont try only want little determination must not persuade rather amusing thing happened while dressing that morning be very cold when got back into boat in hurry to get shirt on accidentally jerked into water made awfully wild especially a george burst out laughing must not see anything to laugh at told george so only laughed more never saw man laugh so much quite lost temper with at last pointed out to what drivelling maniac of imbecile idiot be only roared louder then just a be landing shirt noticed that be not shirt at george have mistaken for mine whereupon humour of thing struck for first time began to laugh more looked from george wet shirt to george roaring with laughter more be amused laughed so much that have to let shirt fall back into water again arnt youyougoing to get out said george between shriek must not answer at for while be laughing so at last between peal managed to jerk out isnt shirtits yours never saw man face change from lively to severe so suddenly in life before what yelled springing up silly cuckoo why cant be more careful what youre doing why deuce dont go dress on bank youre not fit to be in boat youre not gim hitcher tried to make see fun of thing must not george be very dense at seeing joke sometimes harris proposed that must have scrambled egg for breakfast said must cook seemed from account that be very good at doing scrambled egg often did at picnic when out on yacht be quite famous for people who have once tasted scrambled egg so gathered from conversation never cared for other food afterwards pined away died when must not get made mouth water to hear talk about thing handed out stove frying pan egg have not smashed gone over everything in hamper begged to begin have trouble in breaking eggsor rather not so much trouble in breaking exactly a in getting into frying pan when broken keeping off trouser preventing from running up sleeve fixed dozen into pan at last then squatted down by side of stove chivied about with fork seemed harassing work so far a george must judge whenever went near pan burned then must drop everything dance round stove flicking finger about cursing thing indeed time george looked round at be sure to be performing feat thought at first that be necessary part of culinary arrangement did not know what scrambled egg be fancied that must be red indian sandwich island sort of dish required dance incantation for proper cooking montmorency went put nose over once fat spluttered up scalded then began dancing cursing altogether be one of most interesting exciting operation have ever witnessed george be quite sorry when be over result be not altogether success that harris have anticipated there seemed so little to show for business six egg have gone into frying pan came out be teaspoonful of burnt unappetizing looking mess harris said be fault of frying pan thought must have gone better if have have fish kettle gas stove decided not to attempt dish again until have aid to housekeeping by sun have got more powerful by time have finished breakfast wind have dropped be a lovely morning a

opposite first island there be response so went to second tried there obtained same result oh remember now said george be third one ran on hopefully to third one hallooed answer case be becoming serious be now past midnight hotel at skiplake henley must be crammed must not go round knocking up cottager householder in middle of night to know if let apartment george suggested walking back to henley assaulting policeman so getting night lodging in station house then there be thought suppose only hit back refuse to lock up must not pas whole night fighting policeman besides did not want to overdo thing get six month despairingly tried what seemed in darkness to be fourth island met with better success rain be coming down fast now evidently meant to last be wet to skin cold miserable began to wonder whether there be only four island more whether be near island at whether be anywhere within mile of where ought to be in wrong part of river altogether everything looked so strange different in darkness began to understand suffering of babe in wood just when have given up hopeyes know be always time thing do happen in novel tale cant help resolved when began to write book must be strictly truthful in thing so will be even if have to employ hackneyed phrase for purpose be just when have given up hope must therefore say so just when have given up hope then suddenly caught sight little way below of strange weird sort of glimmer flickering among tree on opposite bank for instant thought of ghost be such shadowy mysterious light next moment flashed across that be boat sent up such yell across water made night seem to shake in bed waited breathless for minute thenoh divinest music of darknesswe heard answering bark of montmorency shouted back loud enough to wake seven sleepersi never must understand why must take more noise to wake seven sleeper than oneand after what seemed hour what be really suppose about five minute saw lighted boat creeping slowly over blackness heard harris sleepy voice asking where be there be unaccountable strangeness about harris be something more than mere ordinary tiredness pulled boat against part of bank from be quite impossible for to get into immediately went to sleep took immense amount of screaming roaring to wake up again put sense into succeeded at last got safely on board harris have sad expression on so noticed when got into boat gave idea of man who have be through trouble asked if anything have happened said picture swan swan seemed have moored close to swan nest soon after george have gone female swan came back kicked up row about harris have chivied off have gone away fetched up old man harris said have have quite fight with two swan courage skill have prevailed in end have defeated hour afterwards returned with eighteen other swan must have be fearful battle so far a must understand harris account of swan have tried to drag montmorency out of boat drown have defended like hero for four hour have killed lot have paddled away to die how many swan did say there be asked george thirty two replied harris sleepily said eighteen just now said george didnt grunted harris said twelve think cant count be real fact about swan never found out questioned harris on subject in morning said what swan seemed to think that george have be dreaming oh how delightful be to be safe in boat after trial fear ate hearty supper george must have have toddy after if must have found whisky must not examined harris a to what have done with did not seem to know what meant by whisky what be talking about at montmorency looked a if knew something said nothing slept well that night must have slept better if have not be for harris have vague recollection of having be woke up at least dozen time during night by harris wandering about boat with lantern looking for clothes seemed to be worrying about clothes night twice routed up george to see if be lying on trouser george got quite wild second time what thunder do want trouser for in middle of night asked indignantly why dont lie down go to sleep found in trouble next time awoke because must not find sock last hazy remembrance be of being rolled over on side of hearing harris muttering something about being extraordinary thing where umbrella must have got to chapter xv household dutieslove of workthe old river hand what doe what tell have donescepticism of new generationearly boating recollectionsraftinggeorge doe thing in stylethe old boatman methodso calm so full of peacethe beginnerpuntinga sad accidentpleasures of friendshipsailing first experiencepossible reason why be not drowned picture woman at housework woke late next morning at harris earnest desire partook of plain breakfast with non dainty then cleaned up put everything straight continual labour be beginning to afford pretty clear insight into question have often posed menamely how woman with work of only one house on hand manages to pas away time at about ten set out on what have determined must be good day journey agreed that must pull morning a change from towing harris thought best arrangement must be that george must scull steer did not chime in with idea at said thought harris must have be showing more proper spirit if have suggested that george must work let rest bit seemed to that be doing more than fair share of work on trip be beginning to feel strongly on subject always doe seem to that be doing more work than must do be not that object to work mind like work fascinates can sit look at for hour love to keep by idea of getting rid of nearly break heart can not give too much work to accumulate work have almost become passion with study be so full of now that there be hardly inch of room for more will have to throw out wing soon be careful of work too why of work have by now have be in possession for year year there isnt finger mark on take great pride in work take down now then dust man keep work in better state of preservation than do though crave for work still like to be fair ask for more than proper share get without asking for itat least so appears to meand worry george say doe not think need trouble myself on subject think be only over scrupulous nature make fear be having more than due that a matter of fact dont have half a much a ought expect only say to comfort in boat have always noticed that be fixed idea of member of crew that be doing everything harris notion be that be alone who have be working that george have be imposing upon george on other hand ridiculed idea of harris having done anything more than eat sleep have cast iron opinion that be hegeorge himselfwho have done labour worth speaking of said have never be out with couple of lazily skulks a harris amused harris fancy old george talking about work laughed why about hour of must kill have ever seen george work added turning to agreed with harris never hadmost certainly not since have started on trip well dont see how can know much about one way other george retorted on harris for im blest if havent be asleep time have ever seen harris fully awake except at meal time asked george addressing truth compelled to support george harris have be very little good in boat so far a helping be concerned from beginning well hang ive done more than old j anyhow rejoined harris well couldnt very well have done le added george suppose j think be passenger continued harris be gratitude to for having brought wretched old boat way up from kingston for having superintended managed everything for taken care of slaved for be way of world settled present difficulty by arranging that harris george must scull up past reading must tow boat on from there pulling heavy boat against strong stream have few attraction for now there be time long ago when used to clamour for hard work now like to give youngster chance notice that most of old river hand be similarly retiring whenever there be stiff pulling

story founded to certain extent on true episode have actually happened in modified degree year ago to friend of oursa story that mere child must have believed without injuring much that young man mocked at wanted to repeat feat then there to bet ten to one that didnt got to chatting about rowing experience morning to recounting story of first effort in art of oarsmanship own earliest boating recollection be of five of contributing threepence taking out curiously constructed craft on regent park lake drying subsequently in park keeper lodge after having acquired taste for water did good deal of rafting in various suburban brickfieldsan exercise providing more interest excitement than might be imagined especially when be in middle of pond proprietor of material of raft be constructed suddenly appears on bank with big stick in hand first sensation on seeing gentleman be that somehow other dont feel equal to company conversation that if must do so without appearing rude must rather avoid meeting object be therefore to get off on opposite side of pond to be to go home quietly quickly pretending not to see on contrary be yearning to take by hand talk to appears that know father be intimately acquainted with doe not draw towards say hell teach to take board make raft of seeing that know how to do pretty well already offer though doubtless kindly meant seems superfluous one on part be reluctant to put to trouble by accepting anxiety to meet however be proof against coolness energetic manner in dodge up down pond so a to be on spot to greet when land be really quite flattering if be of stout short winded build can easily avoid advance when be of youthful long legged type meeting be inevitable interview be however extremely brief most of conversation being on part remark being mostly of exclamatory mono syllabic order a soon a can tear away do so devoted three month to rafting being then a proficient a there be need to be at branch of art determined to go in for rowing proper joined one of lea boating club being out in boat on river lea especially on saturday afternoon soon make smart at handling craft spry at escaping being run down by rough swamped by barge also affords plenty of opportunity for acquiring most prompt graceful method of lying down flat at bottom of boat so a to avoid being chucked out into river by passing tow line doe not give style be not till came to thames got style style of rowing be very much admired now people say be so quaint george never went near water until be sixteen then eight other gentleman of about same age went down in body to kew one saturday with idea of hiring boat there pulling to richmond back one of number shock headed youth named joskins who have once twice taken out boat on serpentine told be jolly fun boating tide be running out pretty rapidly when reached landing stage there be stiff breeze blowing across river did not trouble at proceeded to select boat there be eight oared racing outrigger drawn up on stage be one took fancy said theyd have one please boatman be away only boy be in charge boy tried to damp ardour for outrigger showed two three very comfortable looking boat of family party build must not do at outrigger be boat thought must look best in so boy launched took off coat prepared to take seat boy suggested that george who even in day be always heavy man of party must be number four george said must be happy to be number four promptly stepped into bow place sat down with back to stern got into proper position at last then others followed particularly nervous boy be appointed cox steering principle explained to by joskins joskins took stroke told others that be simple enough have to do be to follow said be ready boy on landing stage took boat hook shoved off what then followed george be unable to describe in detail have confused recollection of having immediately on starting received violent blow in small of back from butt end of number five scull at same time that own seat seemed to disappear from under by magic leave sitting on board also noticed a curious circumstance that number two be at same instant lying on back at bottom of boat with leg in air apparently in fit passed under kew bridge broadside at rate of eight mile hour joskins being only one who be rowing george on recovering seat tried to help on dipping oar into water immediately to intense surprise disappeared under boat nearly took with then cox threw rudder line over board burst into tear how got back george never knew took just forty minute dense crowd watched entertainment from kew bridge with much interest everybody shouted out to different direction three time managed to get boat back through arch three time be carried under again time cox looked up saw bridge above broke out into renewed sob george said little thought that afternoon that must ever come to really like boating harris be more accustomed to sea rowing than to river work say that a exercise prefers dont remember taking small boat out at eastbourne last summer used to do good deal of sea rowing year ago thought must be right found have forgotten art entirely when one scull be deep down underneath water other must be flourishing wildly about in air to get grip of water with at same time have to stand up parade be crowded with nobility gentry have to pull past in ridiculous fashion landed half way down beach secured service of old boatman to take back like to watch old boatman rowing especially one who have be hired by hour there be something so beautifully calm restful about method be so free from fretful haste vehement striving be day becoming more more bane of nineteenth century life be not for ever straining to pas other boat if boat overtakes pass doe not annoy a matter of fact do overtake pas himall be going way must trouble irritate people sublime equanimity of hired boatman under ordeal affords beautiful lesson against ambition uppishness plain practical rowing of get boat along order be not very difficult art to acquire take good deal of practice before man feel comfortable when rowing past girl be time worry youngster jolly funny say a for twentieth time within five minute disentangles scull from yours can get on right when im by to see two novice try to keep time with one be very amusing bow find impossible to keep pace with stroke because stroke row in such extraordinary fashion stroke be intensely indignant at explains that what have be endeavouring to do for last ten minute be to adapt method to bow limited capacity bow in turn then becomes insulted request stroke not to trouble head about bow to devote mind to setting sensible stroke picture two novice in boat will take stroke add with evident idea that must at once put whole matter right splash along for hundred yard with still moderate success then whole secret of trouble burst upon stroke like flash of inspiration tell what be youve got scull cry turning to bow pas yours over well do know ive be wondering how be couldnt get on with answer bow quite brightening up most willingly assisting in exchange now will be right be notnot even then stroke have to stretch arm nearly out of socket to reach scull now while bow pair at recovery hit violent blow in chest so change back again come to conclusion that man have given wrong set altogether over mutual abuse of man become quite friendly sympathetic george said have often longed to take to punting for change punting be not a easy a look a in rowing soon learn how to get along handle craft take long practice before can do with dignity without getting water up sleeve one young man knew have very sad accident happen to first time went punting have be getting on so well that have grown quite cheeky over business be walking up down punt working pole with careless grace be quite fascinating to watch up must march to head of punt plant pole then run along right to other end just like old punter oh be grand picture man pole must have gone on being grand if have not unfortunately while looking round to enjoy scenery taken just one step more than there be necessity for walked off punt altogether pole be firmly fixed in mud be left clinging to while punt drifted away be undignified position for rude boy on bank immediately yelled out to lagging chum to hurry up see real monkey on stick must not go to assistance because a ill luck must have have not taken proper precaution to bring out spare pole with must only sit look at expression a pole slowly sank with will never forget there be so much thought in watched gently let down into water saw scramble out sad wet must not help laughing looked ridiculous figure continued to chuckle to about for time then be suddenly forced in upon that really have got very little to laugh at when came to think of here be alone in punt without pole drifting helplessly down mid streampossibly towards weir began to feel very indignant with friend for having stepped overboard gone off in way might at event have left pole drifted on for about quarter of mile then came in sight of fishing punt moored in mid stream in sat two old fisherman saw bearing down upon called out to to keep out of way cant shouted back dont try answered explained matter to when got nearer caught lent pole weir be just fifty yard below be glad happened to be there first time went punting be in company with three other fellow be going to show how to do must not all start together so said must go down first get out punt then must potter about practice bit until came must not get punt out that afternoon be engaged so have nothing else to do to sit down on bank watching river waiting for friend have not be sitting there long before attention became attracted to man in punt who noticed with surprise wore jacket cap exactly like mine be evidently novice at punting performance be most interesting never knew what be going to happen when put pole in evidently did not know sometimes shot up stream sometimes shot down stream at other time simply spun round came up other side of pole with result seemed equally surprised annoyed people about river began to get quite absorbed in after while to make bet with one a to what must be outcome of next push in course of time friend arrived on opposite bank stopped watched too back be towards only saw jacket cap from immediately jumped to conclusion that be beloved companion who be making exhibition of delight knew bound commenced to chaff unmercifully did not grasp mistake at first thought how rude of to go on like with perfect stranger too before must call out reprove explanation of matter occurred to withdrew behind tree oh how enjoyed ridiculing that young man for five good minute stood there shouting ribaldry at deriding mocking jeering at peppered with stale joke even made few new one threw at hurled at private family joke belonging to set must have be perfectly unintelligible to then unable to stand brutal jibe longer turned round on saw face be glad to notice that have sufficient decency left in to look very foolish explained to that have thought be one knew said hoped must not deem capable of so insulting one except personal friend of own picture bathing of course having mistaken for friend excused remember harris telling once of bathing experience have at boulogne be swimming about there near beach when felt suddenly seized by neck from behind forcibly plunged under water struggled violently whoever have got hold of seemed to be perfect hercules in strength effort to escape be unavailing have given up kicking be trying to turn thought upon solemn thing when captor released regained foot looked round for must be murderer assassin be standing close by laughing heartily moment caught sight of harris face a emerged from water started back seemed quite concerned really beg pardon stammered confusedly took for friend of mine harris thought be lucky for man have not mistaken for relation must probably have be drowned outright sailing be thing want knowledge practice toothough a boy did not think so have idea came natural to body like rounder touch knew boy who held view likewise so one windy day thought must try sport be stopping down at yarmouth decided must go for trip up yare hired sailing boat at yard by bridge started off rather rough day said man to a put off better take in reef luff sharp when get round bend said must make point of left with cheery good morning wondering to ourselves how luffed where be to get reef from what be to do with when have got rowed until be out of sight of town then with wide stretch of water in front of wind blowing perfect hurricane across felt that time have come to commence operation hectori think be namewent on pulling while unrolled sail seemed complicated job accomplished at length then came question be top end by sort of natural instinct of course eventually decided that bottom be top set to work to fix upside down be long time before must get up way other way impression on mind of sail seemed to be that be playing at funeral be corpse be winding sheet when found that be not idea hit over head with boom refused to do anything wet said hector drop over get wet said people in ship always wetted sail before put up so wetted that only made matter worse than be before dry sail clinging to leg wrapping round head be not pleasant when sail be sopping wet becomes quite vexing did get thing up at last two of together fixed not exactly upside downmore sideways likeand tied up to mast with painter cut off for purpose that boat did not upset simply state a fact why did not upset be unable to offer reason have often thought about matter since have never succeeded in arriving at satisfactory explanation of phenomenon possibly result may have be brought about by natural obstinacy of thing in world boat may possibly have come to conclusion judging from cursory view of behaviour that have come out for morning suicide have thereupon determined to disappoint be only suggestion can offer by clinging like grim death to gunwale just managed to keep inside boat be exhausting work hector said that pirate other seafaring people generally lashed rudder to something other hauled in main top jib during severe squall thought ought to try to do something of kind be for letting have head to wind a advice be by far easiest to follow ended by adopting contrived to embrace gunwale give head boat travelled up stream for about mile at pace have never sailed at since dont want to again then at bend heeled over till half sail be under water then righted by miracle flew for long low bank of soft mud that mud bank saved boat ploughed way into middle of then stuck finding that be once more able to move according to idea instead of being pitched thrown about like pea in bladder crept forward cut down sail have have enough sailing did not want to overdo thing get surfeit of have have saila good round exciting interesting sailand now thought must have row just for change like took scull tried to push boat off mud in doing so broke one of scull after proceeded with great caution be wretched old pair second one cracked almost easier than first left helpless mud stretched out for about hundred yard in front of behind be water only thing to be done be to sit wait until someone came by be not sort of day to attract people out on river be three hour before soul came in sight be old fisherman who with immense difficulty at last rescued be towed back in ignominious fashion to boat

laziness be sure must never make anything of fisherman have not got sufficient imagination said that a poet shilling shocker reporter anything of kind might be satisfactory to gain position a thames angler must require more play of fancy more power of invention than appeared to posse people be under impression that be required to make good fisherman be ability to tell lie easily without blushing be mistake mere bald fabrication be useless veriest tyro can manage that be in circumstantial detail embellishing touch of probability general air of scrupulousalmost of pedanticveracity that experienced angler be seen anybody can come in say oh caught fifteen dozen perch yesterday evening last monday landed gudgeon weighing eighteen pound measuring three foot from tip to tail there be art skill required for sort of thing show pluck be accomplished angler must scorn to tell lie way method be study in come in quietly with hat on appropriates most comfortable chair light pipe commences to puff in silence let youngster brag away for while then during momentary lull remove pipe from mouth remark a knock ash out against bar well have haul on tuesday evening that not much good telling anybody about oh why that ask because dont expect anybody must believe if did reply old fellow calmly without even tinge of bitterness in tone a refill pipe request landlord to bring three of scotch cold there be pause after nobody feeling sufficiently sure of to contradict old gentleman so have to go on by without encouragement no continues thoughtfully shouldnt believe if anybody told to fact for have be sitting there afternoon have caught literally nothingexcept few dozen dace score of jack be just about giving up a bad job when suddenly felt rather smart pull at line thought be little one went to jerk up hang if must move rod took hourhalf hour sirto land that fish moment thought line be going to snap reached at last what do think be sturgeon forty pound sturgeon taken on line sir yes may well look surprisedill have three of scotch landlord please then go on to tell of astonishment of everybody who saw what wife said when got home of what joe buggles thought about asked landlord of inn up river once if did not injure sometimes listening to tale that fisherman about there told said oh not now sir did used to knock over bit at first lor love missus listens to em day now what youre used to know what youre used to knew young man once be most conscientious fellow when took to fly fishing determined never to exaggerate haul by more than twenty five per cent when have caught forty fish said then will tell people have caught fifty so on will not lie more than because be sinful to lie twenty five per cent plan did not work well at never be able to use greatest number of fish ever caught in one day be three cant add twenty five per cent to threeat least not in fish so increased percentage to thirty three third again be awkward when have only caught one two so to simplify matter made up mind to just double quantity stuck to arrangement for couple of month then grew dissatisfied with nobody believed when told that only doubled therefore gained credit way while moderation put at disadvantage among other angler when have really caught three small fish said have caught six used to make quite jealous to hear man whom knew for fact have only caught one going about telling people have landed two dozen so eventually made one final arrangement with have religiously held to ever since be to count fish that caught a ten to assume ten to begin with for example if did not catch fish at then said have caught ten fishyou must never catch le than ten fish by system be foundation of then if by chance really did catch one fish called twenty while two fish must count thirty three forty so on be simple easily worked plan there have be talk lately of being made use of by angling fraternity in general indeed committee of thames angler association did recommend adoption about two year ago of older member opposed said must consider idea if number be doubled fish counted a twenty if ever have evening to spare up river must advise to drop into one of little village inn take seat in tap room will be nearly sure to meet one two old rod men sipping toddy there will tell enough fishy story in hour to give indigestion for month george ii dont know what have become of harris have gone out have shave early in afternoon have then come back spent full forty minute in pipeclaying shoe have not seen sincegeorge therefore dog left to ourselves went for walk to wallingford on second evening coming home called in at little river side inn for rest other thing went into parlour sat down there be old fellow there smoking long clay pipe naturally began chatting told that have be fine day to day told that have be fine day yesterday then told other that thought must be fine day to morrow george said crop seemed to be coming up nicely after that came out somehow other that be stranger in neighbourhood that be going away next morning picture trout then pause ensued in conversation during eye wandered round room finally rested upon dusty old glass case fixed very high up above chimney piece containing trout rather fascinated that trout be such monstrous fish in fact at first glance thought be cod ah said old gentleman following direction of gaze fine fellow aint quite uncommon murmured george asked old man how much thought weighed eighteen pound six ounce said friend rising taking down coat yes continued wur sixteen year ago come third o next

time george have won fourpencegeorge always be lucky at cardsand harris have lost exactly twopence thought must give up gambling then a harris said breed unhealthy excitement when carried too far george offered to go on give revenge harris decided not to battle further against fate after mixed toddy sat round talked george told about man have known who have come up river two year ago who have slept out in damp boat on just such night a be have given rheumatic fever nothing be able to save have died in great agony ten day afterwards george said be quite young man be engaged to be married

conversation in weak moment suggested that george must get out banjo see if must not give comic song will say for george that did not want pressing there be nonsense about having left music at home anything of sort at once fished out instrument commenced to play two lovely black eye have always regarded two lovely black eye a rather commonplace tune until evening rich vein of sadness that george extracted from quite surprised desire grew upon harris a mournful strain progressed be to fall upon others neck weep by great effort kept back rising tear listened to wild yearnful melody in silence when chorus came even made desperate effort to be merry re filled glass joined in harris in voice trembling with emotion leading george following few word behind two lovely black eye oh what surprise only for telling man be wrong two there broke down unutterable pathos of george accompaniment to two be in then state of depression unable to bear harris sobbed like little child dog howled till thought heart jaw must surely break george wanted to go on with verse thought that when have got little more into tune must throw more abandon a be into rendering might not seem so sad feeling of

river fortnight enjoyment on river meant to have if killed well must be sad thing for friend relation must not be helped felt that to give in to weather in climate such a ours must be most disastrous precedent only two day more said harris be young strong may get over right after at about four oclock began to discus arrangement for evening be little past goring then decided to paddle on to pangbourne put up there for night jolly evening murmured george sat mused on prospect must be in at pangbourne by five must finish dinner at say half past six after must walk about village in pouring rain until bed time must sit in dimly lit bar parlour read almanac picture lady in skirt why alhambra must be almost more lively said harris venturing head outside cover for moment taking survey of sky with little supper at to follow added half unconsciously yes almost pity weve made up mind to stick to boat answered harris then there be silence for while if hadnt made up mind to contract certain death in bally old coffin observed george casting glance of intense malevolence over boat might be worth while to mention there train leaf pangbourne know soon after five must just land in

of sitting bolt upright grasping knife fork firmly leant back in chair worked slowly carelesslywhen stretched out leg beneath table let napkin fall unheeded to floor found time to more critically examine smoky ceiling than have hitherto be able to dowhen rested glass at arm length upon table felt good thoughtful forgiving then harris who be sitting next window drew aside curtain looked out
