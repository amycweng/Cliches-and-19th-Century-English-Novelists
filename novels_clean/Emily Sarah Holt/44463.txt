dorathie lived at period of sheltered in country have not known war for two hundred year can barely form adequate idea for fourteen year namely since frideswide be five year old longer than dorathie life england have be torn asunder by civil warfare be over yet turbulent past have be sad enough worst be yet to come never since cessation of heptarchy have more terrible time be seen than war of rose in struggle above others family conviction be divided family love rent asunder father son brother brother uncle nephew constantly took opposite side warrior on side be absolutely sure that shadow of right lay with candidate that rebel adversary of chosen monarch have not inch of ground to stand on be question of right so clear indisputable a in nineteenth century be apt to think to eye regarding matter in light of modern law appears certain that edward iv be rightful heir of crown that there be room for dispute in matter real point in dispute be very important one what law of succession really be be bar edward claimed through female succession of king from empress maud might be fairly held to settle item in edward favour real difficulty lay beyond be not so easily solved very little understood at present be law of non representation old custom of england be also custom of artois several other province according to law if son of king must predecease father leaving issue that issue be barred from throne be not to be allowed to represent dead father right of succession passed at once to next son of monarch several of king tried to alter law be so dear to heart of english people up to invariably failed most notable instance be that of richard who tried hard to secure succession of arthur son of deceased brother geoffrey in preference to youngest brother john custom of england be too strong for though john be personally liked respected by one england preferred rule to making change in law be edward iii who succeeded in making alteration eldest son famed black prince have died leaving son behind old king strongly desired to secure peaceable succession of grandson succeeded partly because of popularity of deceased prince partly on account of unpopularity of next heir chiefly because next heir be willing to assist in alteration reward for self abnegation be that modern writer be perpetually accusing of unbridled ambition of desire to snatch crown from nephew who must assuredly never have worn have withheld consent though john of gaunt be perfectly willing to be subject instead of sovereign son henry did not share feeling always considered that have be tricked out of right never forgave father for consenting to change after sundry futile attempt to eject cousin from throne at last succeeded in effecting purpose succession returned to right line according to old custom of england since king richard ii for whom have be altered left issue matter might have gone on quietly enough have be suffered to remain there be quiet enough until death of henry v long minority of sovereign have nearly always be misfortune to country longest of minority be that of henry vi who be only eight month old when came to throne then began restless weary struggle for power among noble especially three uncle of baby king detail of struggle belong to general history there be one two point concerning will be best to make such remark a be necessary at once in order to save explanation must otherwise be constantly recurring king henry be remarkably devoid of relative nearest have be not of own rank be only child of father on father side only living connection beside distant cousin be uncle humphrey duke of gloucester grand uncle cardinal beaufort of whom be though different from other equally diverse from king in temperament aim on mother side have two half brother sister with whom be scarcely allowed to associate at wanted wife took mean to obtain one in day prince usually took sent artist to various court of europe to bring to portrait of unmarried princess king henry truth loving nature come out in instruction given to artist be to be careful not to flatter of royal lady to draw portrait just a be of miniature thus brought to king fancy be attracted by lovely face of beautiful blonde of sixteen princess marguerite of anjou second daughter of rene dispossessed king of naples embassy at head of be william duke of suffolk be sent over to demand if accepted to bring home young princess girl queen found very lonely creature flung into midst of discordant element loved husband a afterwards showed beyond question must have felt deep respect for pure gentle truthful saintly soul yet excellent a be be adviser for be simply impossible for brilliant intellect brave heart to lean upon dulled brain timid nature how must with uttermost will to aid help young wife to keep out of snare laid for must not even see counsel to beware of false friend whose falsehood never so much a suspected be wonder marguerite in sore emergency turned to suffolk first friend man almost old enough to be grandfather with wise head tender heart thoroughly desirous to do duty poor innocent girl paid dearly for one word of cruel contemptuous surmise dropped from lip of young nobleman who very possibly have wished fair young queen to make chief adviser over land a with wing wicked falsehood sped till there be possibility of undoing evil marguerite woke up in horror to find name defamed innocent friendship with suffolk believed to be criminal did not discover for time who be author of cruel slander when did never forgave warwick there be not shadow of probability that be true suffolk be about fifty year of age when marguerite be married have be for nearly fifteen year husband of one of loveliest woman in england to whom be passionately attached character be shown further by farewell letter written to son one of most touching pious farewell letter ever penned by man be born at cotton in suffolk baptized in church on feast of st michael in monte tumba oct prob aetatit willielmi ducis suffolk h v published among paston letter now more serious complication be added to already existing dispossessed heir of elder branch richard duke of york have much to forgive house of lancaster have memory of murdered father long imprisoned mother ever fresh before claim be only through female line a son of daughter of son of daughter of lionel duke of clarence second son of edward iii who attained manhood who have predeceased father in respect of male line be descended from younger brother of grandfather of henry vi be therefore only a representative of duke lionel that must put forward claim at richard be not good at forgiving when a if for purpose of further entangling matter suggesting to richard very idea afterwards carried into action henry vi be seized with attack of temporary insanity inherited from maternal grandfather richard a next male relative be placed in position of regent state of thing so entirely suited to wish that when king having recovered be summoned to resign charge richard coolly expressed perfect satisfaction with position of governor intention to remain such since considered to be a heir general of duke lionel much more rightfully king of england than cousin who have displaced edmund duke of york first sensation of henry vi on hearing calm assertion of richard be simply one of unbounded amazement grandfather said held crown for twelve year father for ten have held for twenty three time father have kept silence not one word of have ever heard before what mean fair cousin to prefer such claim against lord anointed be not quite fact that richard father have kept absolute silence since uncle edmund earl of march have be put forward a claimant for throne just fifty year before in probability king be entirely justified in stating that idea be new to be not likely that about from infancy must have allowed to become familiar with since delicate sense of right justice be in eye most tiresome thing about question be not in hand for decision have be so man must ever have heard of war of rose king henry have sense of honour probably mean that ambition self seeking aggressiveness be feeling utterly unknown to yea let take must have be language of lip heart so long a have left to quiet home in green nook of england wife child whom dearly loved few book peace at time god be providence decree peace a lot of such men at other rime seems to be one thing with must not be trusted be tossed perpetually on wave of troublesome world emptied from vessel to

have comforted for ever full account of transaction will be found in white rose of langley be unfortunate thing for richard of york that have married woman who acted toward ambitious aspiration not a bridle a spur cicely neville surnamed from great beauty rose of raby be woman who like two of descendant must have died to morrow to be queen to day must have preferred to eat dry bread at king table rather than feast at board of elector of member of royal family of england lady be to knowledge only one who ever styled in own charter right high right excellent princesse rose of raby be not only

who remained head of household at lovell tower barony descended to only daughter margery who after good deal of hesitation among rival suitor who greatly admired title fortune have gradually awoke to discovery that liked nobody quite so well a old friend john marston though be nearly twice age widower with three child so on with full consent of mother bestowed hand heart title fortune former being

friendship must have be easy matter hugh carew be granite where conviction be concerned not content with following insisted on imposing on body who came near must have be in eye matter of principle not to allow sister niece to speak of king rebel without letting see that wilfully misunderstood allusion idonia merely sighed ever piece of perversity while yet intercourse remained unbroken margery be apt to flare up make open breach of peace certainly be trying when spoke of king meaning henry vi a in scotland to be reminded in cold precise tone slightly astonished that have unaccountably forgotten that highness be at westminster be not therefore to be wondered at if margery felt open hostility rather relief than burden while mother grieved over in secret 't be strange gear lady idonia must sometimes say that men can not think alike nay fair sister why must so be brother william answer be tame world if man saw by own eye after pattern be well ida replied graver maurice must all men

george richard be reaped by while edward be left for innocent son to gather may reasonably be asked why warwick be counted among lancastrian when to great extent edward owed throne to have be consistent yorkist for year be because at period when story open warwick thought proper so to account king henry never able to see through schemer traitor have complacently welcomed back to allegiance queen marguerite who saw through to furthest inch held in unmitigated abhorrence felt that be necessary at moment to husband cause locking own feeling hard within allowed to be supposed that be able
