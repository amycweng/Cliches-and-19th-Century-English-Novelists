certain nay so neither go to put case be thine own shouldst thou be afeared to wed with priest agnes did not quite like home question yet replied calmly without idea of other question be coming methinks not if truly loved couldst thou truly love agnes for instant agnes gave answer have a little expected to have question asked a have expected to be created duchess say sooth if thou shouldst be feared said john laurence faint suspicion of pain in tone unloosed lip at once afraid afraid to leave dreary past behind to begin new life with cup of gladness full to very brim john laurence be satisfied with answer for first time not one word of reading comment reached agnes mind in intelligible form may be gracious lady good ladyship must like palfrey called be word greeted agnes when made

even having so spoken agnes waited quietly for tempest chapter six shadow before oh for faith to grasp heaven bright for ever amid shadow of earth little while jane crewdson sheer amazement kept mistress winter silent for one moment after agnes have made startling revelation that bondslave must have dared to dream of freedom be almost too preposterous for belief be powerless to stop most insubordinate proceeding for never anticipating such calamity not fond of spending money except on herself daughter have not a might have done bound agnes apprentice after minute of astonished silence thunderstorm such a even agnes have never before experienced burst upon devoted head if mistress winter might be believed such instance of rebellion perversity ingratitude imaginable wickedness have ever before occurred since adam eve quitted paradise agnes be asked to what expected to come in life where expected to go after when mistress winter became weary of scolding be not soon joan took up tale when be tired dorothy succeeded a be gifted with considerable power of speech ball be kept going until bedtime then agnes be allowed to creep to coarse rug bundle of straw feeling in peace at last thenceforward there be not much peace left at least in day time having be interrogated a to name calling of suitor agnes be at once dubbed madam dominic lady grace of blackfriar various similar title dorothy clasping hand in mock rapture falsely averred that have foreseen delightful ending to story when caught sight of agnes friar laurence talking at cross proceeded to give ironical description of friar personal charm sufficiently spiced to be very amusing to mother sister just sufficiently seasoned with truth to be exceedingly galling to agnes henceforth took opportunity to play ill natured practical joke on latter be not likely that agnes must particularly enjoy having shred of dirty flannel linen flung into lap with tittering remark that must enrich trousseau feeling when sat at needlework rotten egg gently broken over head with bland intimation that be to dress hair for wedding presentation in solemn form of torn faded ribbon accompanied by information that must become sweetly on bridal of approach to wedding attire poor agnes be devoid have two gown in world washed out linen bed gown stuff petticoat in work be generally done well patched serge replaced upon

however must have held peace probably discreet portion of community did so may seem little strange on surface when one considers how be that reign of mary be felt so galling that accession of elizabeth be welcomed with fever of delight triumph sense of relief freedom a be undoubtedly case yet that men bore former made sign waited for latter with indescribable longing without attempt to bring about perhaps must attribute partly to law abiding instinct inherent in ordinary englishman yet think still more to fact that a rule at time in respect majority of nation be indifferent there be men who died at stake in defence of free gospel there be men who kindled fire stamped out truth so far a in lay even when put together be still minority majority be watcher who stood round stake who

that must be most popular crowded of seven church be church of laodicea because thou art lukewarm will spue thee out of mouth be not without difficulty that agnes contrived to enjoy occasional always short interview with betrothed such interview be generally followed by forced audience of dorothy who professed entirely hypocritical interest in progress of love match did best to make agnes recount what lover have said to agnes however be wise enough to keep out of trap laid for dorothy took little by motion sometimes lover met for few minute before after reading in cathedral sometimes there must be few word a agnes carried pail to from horsepool once twice when mistress winter have barred door on for misdemeanour walked to quiet nook in field near clerkenwell refreshing with converse on
