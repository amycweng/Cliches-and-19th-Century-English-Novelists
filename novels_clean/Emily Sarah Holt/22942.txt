holy eucharist in one kind in be absolved in private make confession thus in public be such mighty difference if don juan have thrown little le dust in eye perhaps blanche might have have sense enough to ask where church of rome have found authority for half of difference since certainly be not in holy scripture also whether communion held such men a cranmer latimer calvin luther in very high esteem dust be much too thick to allow stronger reply from blanche than feeble inquiry whether really be point of difference what other matter offendeth grace doubtless can expound same why have heard said blanche faintly selecting one of smaller charge first that papist do hold mary blessed virgin to have be without sin catholic have fantasy replied don juan lightly be only few church bind not on conscience of take leave a will likewise hold obedience due to bishop of rome instead of only unto own prince a with objected blanche growing shade bolder again be in matter ecclesiastical in secular

represent father being of like substance no le than appearance a saith blessed saint augustine also blessed jeronymo others of holy father of church right from time of lord apostle don juan have never read line of work of jerome augustine fortunately for have blanche chance on safely calculated blanche be completely puzzled sat looking out of window thinking with little power to small purpose have not idea when augustine lived whether read service in own tongue in surplice celebrated latin mass in full pontifical if be true that father down from apostle have held roman view for poor ignorant blanche have not least idea whether be true false be very awkward thing don juan stood watched face for instant diplomatic instinct told that subject have better be dropped be needed to effect end be few well turned compliment ingenuity readily suggested in five minute more theological discussion be forgotten at least by blanche a don juan be assuring that in andalusia there be not eye comparable to hers mr tremayne arthur came in to supper that evening former quietly watched state of affair without appearing to notice anything saw that don juan who sat by lucrece paid most courteous attention that lucrece received with thinly veiled air of triumph that blanche eye constantly followed young spaniard came to conclusion that affair be more complicated than have originally supposed waited however till arthur lysken be away until said anything at home when young person be safely despatched to bed mr mr tremayne mr rose drew together before fire discussed state of affair at enville court now what thinkest robin inquired mr rose be blanche la pauvrette a fully taken with don juan a barbara did suppose be afeared fully don juan if mistake not be likewise taken with blanche doubt somewhat if be therein a wholehearted a what say elder asked mr tremayne look on with eye see nought nathless there be one pair of eye see blanche path be not like to run o'er what mistress rachel nay be blind a rest mean lucrece lucrece thinkest will ope eye of other think casteth about to turn don juan way alack poor blanche said mr tremayne howso matter will go mefeareth will not becape suffering be match for lucrece observed mr rose truth be in wise assured don juan be not answered mr tremayne with slightly amused look a for blanche be like to suffer have well nigh added demeriteth same will do good thekla at least if lord bless unto be assured meant not to leave out that furnace purifieth gold said mr tremayne sadly yet heat be none le fierce for robin dear heart whether wouldst thou miss suffering rather purifying take together be soon over thekla said mother quietly during fierce heat of marian persecution word have once be said to marguerite rose have failed to realise then lesson be learned now thirty five year later soon over to look back dear mother replied mr tremayne yet never seems short to that be in furnace mr rose turned rather suddenly to son in law robin tell if thou couldst have seen thy life laid out before thee on map have be put to thy choice to bear little ease to leave go tell what thou hadst chosen for mr tremayne have spent several month in horrible funnel shaped prison aptly termed little ease have just escaped from with life paused moment face grew very thoughtful think mother said at length have chosen to go through with

need to learn last hardest be to give god leave to choose for at least thus hath be with may be mistake to say be for yet be sure be happy man learneth soon hath taken well nigh eighty year thou art better robin to have learned in fifty count mother learn not lesson in same order said rector smiling though there be many lesson must learn 't be not like to be last without must die to morrow if have learned thoroughly now be easier to leave in god hand choice than other mr rose did not ask of what be thinking must guess pretty well must be harder to lose thekla now than if have come out of little ease have found dead harder to lose arthur in early manhood than to have seen coffined with baby brother sister year ago mr tremayne drew long sigh a if have guessed too must be easier to leave thing to god choice said if only dwelt nearer god note vuesa merced epithet of ordinary courtesy be literally grace chapter seven spoke in wheel foolish work of fancy bitter close of tennyson few week after conversation lucrece enville sat alone in bedroom shared with sister margaret be not shedding tear be not way to weep mortification be bitter enough for amount of weeping lucrece be a selfish a step mother rather shade more so lady enville selfishness be pure love of ease there be deliberate malice in person who stood in way might be ruthlessly swept out of who did not interfere with pleasure be free to pursue own selfishness of lucrece lay deeper not only sought own enjoyment aggrandisement must not bear to see anything even if did not want in possession of one else be sufficient to make lucrece long for plot to acquire though have liking for article in must not know what to do with when got in particular instance have wanted article have missed true value set upon be rather for adjunct than for whatever value one thought be uppermost be bitterest have missed article be don juan charm be twofold first must one day be rich man noble secondly blanche be in possession lucrece tried utmost effort to detach from sister to attach to herself don juan proved to be match in perseverance in strategy blanche have not faintest suspicion that anything of sort have be going on don juan have very quickly perceived counterplot have found most amusing episode in little drama with be beguiling time during forced stay in england nobody else saw plot counterplot until one morning when low soft voice arrested sir thomas a be passing out of garden door father may have minute speech of ay so lucrece be about to take turn twain in garden come with lass so better father for must say lacketh other ear what now demanded sir thomas laughing wouldst have money for new chain leave to go to merry making thou art welcome to lass thank father said lucrece gravely a paced slowly down one of straight trim garden walk not so word be of sadder import sir thomas turned looked at never until moment in four twenty year have second daughter given iota of confidence nay what now said in perplexed tone pray father be not wroth with for reason be strong if be so bold a to ask at if have yet received order from queen majesty council touching disposing of don john art thou turning

grave stern now do know of surety if suffer father to post in certain place that wot of behind tapestry will ere long know too lucrece triumphant malice have carried step too far father open upright honest mind be shocked at suggestion god forbid girl replied hastily will not play eavesdropper on own child hast thou done lucrece lucrece saw that must make retreat from position did so in excellent order oh father how must so one day sat in arbour yonder two walked by discoursing day when sat in window seat in hall came in talking saw not must never do thing a listen unknown father right lass

declined single noun giver have informed that bestowed breviary on best beloved because held dearest of treasure blanche valued on account lucrece knew for have come upon blanche in unguarded moment with book in hand rosary round neck have to extent forced confidence more readily given since blanche never suspected treachery can ensure father pursued traitress with assumption of utmost meekness hath cost much sorrow ere set to speak unto hast spoken to blanche aforetime not much father replied lucrece in voice of apparent trouble counted fitter to refer same unto better wisdom think be like to list god have mercy moaned distressed father thoroughly awake now to gravity of case maybe father will think have left pas too far pursued lucrece with well simulated grief yet can guess must not by goodwill seem to carry complaint of blanche thou hast well done dear heart thank thee answered deceived father leave now lass must think gear over poor darling lucrece glided away a softly a serpent resembled in heart in hour sir thomas came back into house sent jennet to tell sister that wished to speak with in library be characteristic not of of wife that in sorrow perplexity turned instinctively to rachel not to when lucrece intelligence be laid before rachel though perhaps grieved le be even more shocked than brother that blanche must think of quitting happy honourable estate of maidenhood for slavery of marriage be in misdemeanour of first magnitude that must have made own choice have received secret gift held clandestine interview be awful instance of what human depravity must reach now what be to be done asked sir thomas wearily first with don john next with blanche viper pack out of house bag baggage cried wrathful spinster crocodile to conspire against

interval until sir thomas returned now then clare flitted in out to ask mother wish concerning different thing jennet came in with fresh wood for fire lady enville continued to give caution charge a occurred to now regarding conduct now costume miserable time blanche found felt fancied one else considered in dire disgrace yet beneath mortification humiliation grief over be brooding there be conviction in depth of blanche heart resist a might that father who be crossing will be wiser truer friend to than mother who must have granted sir thomas came at last wore very tired look seemed a if

time to consider course more fully supped in own chamber lady enville presented in hall be particularly gracious rachel uncommonly stiff margaret still meditative lucrece outwardly demure secretly triumphant supper at parsonage be deferred for hour that evening until guest must arrive mr tremayne received with motherly kiss foolish a thought blanche looked upon a being almost a much victim of others folly a sufferer for own thekla tremayne knew well that knowledge that have ourselves to thank for suffering doe not lessen pain increase kindness with blanche be received rather a honoured guest than a naughty child sent to coventry be soothing to ruffled feeling still have great deal to bear be deeply grieved to be suddenly completely parted from don juan imagined that must be a much distressed a herself idea of rebelling against father decree never entered head did least suspicion of lucrece share in matter blanche be rather curious to ascertain how much clare knew of proceeding what thought of now so happened that in haste of departure clare have be told next to nothing reason of hasty flight to parsonage be darkness to except for impression gathered from various item that step thus taken have reference not to herself to blanche what sister have done be doing be expected to do required such summary stoppage clare must not even guess barbara be quite a ignorant interview between blanche don juan have be so secret so little suspected that idea of connecting with affair did not occur to one precious relic blanche have brought with lock of hair received from don juan on afternoon be so short time back felt so terribly long past gone part of epoch altogether indeed have not have opportunity of parting with except by yielding to father for saw necessity since have laid no order on concerning don juan gift while clare knelt at prayer barbara be out of room blanche took opportunity to indulge in look at treasure be silky black smooth glossy tied with fragment of blue

of love sort said lysken looking up again from stocking be darning be there sort one oh ay responded blanche feeling experience immeasurably past of lysken thou art out of depth blanche methinks said lysken re threading needle in practical unromantic way love be love for differeth of course in degree love not alike methinks even man love for god though be need deeper higher far must yet be same manner of love that hath for father childre friend see not how can be otherwise blanche be shocked at business like style in lysken darned while talked have such question be asked of stocking must have stood still till be settled doubted whether to pursue subject what be use of talking upon thrilling topic to girl who must darn stocking while calmly analysed love still wanted somebody opinion have instinctive suspicion clare must be improvement upon cousin well said hesitatingly there be fashion of love lysken sort that woman hath toward husband be deeper guess than hath for father mother else must not leave to go with said lysken quietly see not wherein must be sort 't be plain thou didst never feel same lysken returned blanche sentimentally how must when never have husband answered lysken darning away tranquilly didst thou never come across that thou shouldst fain shouldst fain what said lysken a blanche paused shouldst have liked to wed said blanche plunging into matter gramercy nay replied lysken turning stocking to look at other side must have thought shame if have blanche felt speech reflection on lysken cried pettishly lysken put down stocking looked at blanche what meanest thou inquired in plain matter of fact style be extremely aggravating to young lady oh 't be to good to tell thee returned blanche loftily thou wist nought at thereabout what about

conversation made allusion to at time tried to turn girl thought to topic gathering from however tone of blanche mind resolved to give lesson must not eject roughly from imaginary pedestal make come down from of own accord poor foolish child said mr tremayne to herself have mistaken rushlight for sun think horizon wider than of one else be despising lysken at moment a willow prosaic character who can not enter into depth of feeling have not attained height of experience there be height depth in lysken that blanche will never reach mr tremayne found opportunity next evening be alone with blanche in parlour knowing pretty well what one be doing anticipated quiet half hour of person to whom blanche be known there be not one so well fitted to deal with in crisis a friend in whose hand have be placed for safety thirty year before thekla tremayne have experienced very dark trial have become miserably familiar with heart sickness of hope deferred during four year when best beloved of robin tremayne have known no certainty whether be living dead have reason rather to fear latter compared with deep long tried love like hers sentimental fancy over blanche be making cross unhappy be almost trivial mr tremayne knew that trouble be trouble if be based on folly thought that recognised in blanche silly though be in point nobler nature than of vain selfish indolent mother from whom daughter derived many of surface feature of character longed to see nobler nature rouse to work sweep away outward vanity giddiness might be that even must show real hollowness of gilded world that one hour journey over weary land must help to drive for shelter to shadow of great rock blanche sat on low stool at mr tremayne foot gazing earnestly into fire have spoken for time during only sound

to promise go to be there god in heaven at so blanche be tossed to fro on swelling billow now up seeing faint ray of light now down in depth of darkness yet through with half palsied grasp so to speak upon hem of christ garment groping after with numb hand scarce felt whether held o blanche be like plague in land of egypt be darkness might be felt blanche listened in awed interest dear heart lord hath passed word to help people in need saith not where that will alway help right a must have be prone to think there be one fashion of help that if be not holpen after own manner be not holpen at yet if thou take penny from poor beggar give in stead thereof angel half sovereign thou hast given alms though have lost penny ala for poor beggar fall to weeping o'er penny till eye be too dim with

be over be when queen elizabeth that now be happily succeeded to evil sister god gave maiden back father safe blanche uttered glad oh gave more than blanche sent therewith message direct from thou lookest on somewhat doubtfully dear heart a though thou shouldst say angel bring wold from heaven now o ' day well in very sooth wi not whether do see not can speak more boldly than to say yet one

wherefore didst thou doubt ' a though must say thou mightest have doubted of fulfilling of thy special hope yet wherefore doubt must have taken pleasure in bereaving thee of aught be not hurtful must not have given thee much more than because made thine heart void might fill with child did love thee le more ' mr tremayne paused so long that blanche asked timidly did come again at last slight sudden movement of friend head showed that thought be far away that came back to present with something like effort methinks dear heart mr tremayne said lovingly there be special point whereto god did desire to bring maiden point whereat oft time aimeth in training of childre be to be satisfied with will not only to submit thereto thou mayest submit unto outward seeming yet be sore dissatisfied be not blanche position at moment to be satisfied with ordering to receive a best thing dearer unto thee than thine own will way a one thing thou wouldst have done at cost if need be of other ah blanche 't be light easy thing unto god led of whom have be telling thee led till must look up to say with true honest heart father lead where thou wilt if in dark well so thou hold be content be thine body soul spirit will be well blessed for if thy will be done then blanche when must look up say in sincerity then laid down rod gave back into bosom blanche drew deep sigh partly of relief not altogether knew maiden own self mr tremayne wouldst thou fain know whom maid be blanche name be thekla rose mistress tremayne dear heart must not have gone back over story now that thought might serve thee to hear love not to look back to time though be to mine own good 't be like ill wound be healed thou hast further suffering thereof yet scar be there for evermore yet dear blanche if be given to choose now whether must have dark weary time part of life reckoning what must have lost without must say once again ay know sweetness of close walking with god will rather grope step by step at side through darkness than walk smoothly in full glare of sun without very street be walk when have won back felt holding of hand be not with in sunlight asked blanche shyly be alway with dear heart see light clearest when other light be out be so prone to walk further off in daylight see so many thing beside must fain be running off after bird butterfly fain be filling hand with bright flower by way picture not rightly to ourselves that thing be to cheer on a step bravely forward for there will be flower enough when reach home blanche looked earnestly into red ember be silent seest thou now blanche what meant in saying must not have thee miss gold reckon mean that god hath somewhat to give better than what taketh away right dear heart ah how much better yet misconceive not child buy heaven with affliction never think that blanche there be many have made that blunder nay beggar buyeth not thy gold with penny piece christ hath bought heaven for chosen be purchase of blood nothing else in world must have paid for will see glory yonder must be fitted for here below oft time god employeth sorrow care to end now blanche canst answer thine own question tell what think of thee blanche blushed scarlet be afeared said hanging down head must think right silly child mr tremayne stroked blanche hair with little laugh think nothing very ill of thee dear child do think thou hast made blunder twain what be blanche wished to know more humbly than must have done that morning well dear blanche firstly think thou hast mistaken fancy for love there be many so do many think love when in truth do love be own pleasure flattering of own vain conceit ask thine own heart what thou lovest in thy lover be liking for thyself if be latter be not love blanche 't be fancy be to love a waxen image to living man love must have loveth bettered at own cost must fain see higher nobler mean not higher in men eye nearer heaven god be price to herself true love will go with into heaven blanche can never die be forgotten remember word of john apostle that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god god in wouldst thou dare to apply holy heavenly name unto vain fancy that will be a though have never be six month thereafter child men woman be verily guilty concerning matter take name of be very essence of god set lightly on thing of earth time will perish in using well there be mistake sweet fear thou mayest have made may be thou art thinking wrongfully of thine earthly father a did of heavenly one dealeth with thee hardly countest thou well may be so yet be to save thee from must be much harder think ill of father who loveth thee must fain save thee o blanche howsoever may deal with thee never never do thou think hardly of heavenly father who loveth thee far dearer than must save thee from far bitterer woe blanche have looked very awe struck when mr tremayne spoke so solemnly of real nature of love now raised tearful eye to friend face thought none ill of father mistress tremayne wi well loveth that be well dear heart be fain must be so there subject dropped rather abruptly a first clare then arthur came into room don juan did not appear to miss blanche after first day when found that father sister be absent from supper table looked round with surprise little perplexity asked question one volunteered explanation very soon found new diversion in shape of lucrece to whom proceeded to address flowery language with even le sincerity than have done to blanche sooner did sir thomas perceive turn of affair than took earliest opportunity of sternly demanding of troublesome prisoner what meant don juan professed entire ignorance of purport of question sir thomas angrily explained nay senor what must inquired young spaniard with air of injured innocence andalusian gentleman wheresoever may be in what condition must always show respect to lady respect cried enraged squire do spanish gentleman call such manner of talk showing respect thank heaven be born in england sir when english gentleman carry toward young maiden a have done either design to win in honourable wedlock be villain be if be in spain senor answered don juan fire flashing from dark eye must answer word with sword since be prisoner have such remedy must be content with reply in speech custom of land be different from ours will even condescend to say that be for diver year have so be affianced to lady of mine own country towards senorita daughter have shown common courtesy a be understood in spain in saying don juan stated what be delicately termed by swift thing be not of what consequence be in eye when council of constance have definitively decreed that faith be to be kept with heretic sir thomas enville be le given to use of profane language than most gentleman of day in answer to speech swore roundly though staunch protestant thanked saint angel that never be in spain queen highness ' command excepted never must be a to daughter must prefer turning into nebuchadnezzar fiery furnace to allowing one of to set foot on soil of highly objectionable country sentiment be couched in most peppery language of squire lip be well capable having thus delivered turned on heel left don juan to own meditation that caballero speedily discovered that have addressed last compliment to of young lady at enville court henceforward only saw at meal then found much to discomfiture placed between jack mistress rachel to pay delicate attention to latter be sheer waste of frankincense be so much in nature when speaking to woman that began to tell that talked like angel mistress rachel looked full in face don john said in most unmoved manner if believed true must call on brother to put forth of hall a believe false do not after day don juan directed conversation to jack be not very sorry to leave enville court have become no longer amusing uncomfortable place in eye be perfectly monstrous that man must object to daughter being honoured by condescending notice of andalusian gentleman who must one day be grandee of first class utterly preposterous since unreasonable man be so absurd a to object to distinction conferred upon house be a well that andalusian gentleman must be out of sphere so don juan went willingly to london friend of parent made suit for elizabeth remembered mother a one who have done several little kindness such a lady in waiting on queen must do for princess under cloud don juan received free pardon leave to return home when a must only broke one more heart while remained in england be beneath regret on part being only poor insignificant grocer daughter then sailed for spain then married dona lisarda then became lord in waiting then lived wealthy gorgeous prosperous life then men spoke well of seeing how much good have done to then grew old highly respected highly self satisfied man then soul be required of did god say to thou fool chapter nine too abstruse for blanche hear just law judgment of sky hate truth will be dupe of lie will be cheated to last delusion strong a hell will bind fast cowper did conceive mistress blanche said mr tremayne one morning a party rose from breakfast table that must with good will see picture of clare grandsire hangeth in study chamber oh ay like responded blanche eagerly clare have seen portrait not blanche mr tremayne led way to study allowed to examine likeness at leisure answered question about john avery entrapped blanche did not realise that be catching with same sort of guile saint paul used towards corinthian corinthian mr tremayne came in sat down quietly with work before inspection be over when curiosity be at length satisfied blanche thanked mr tremayne must have left room with courtesy such be by mean intention of pastor have heard say mistress blanche said quietly that mind hath be somewhat unsettled touching difference lack of difference betwixt papist if so be pray sit down give leave to talk same over blanche felt caught at last must be sir thomas of course who have told rector for there be one else who must have done may be added though blanche did not know that father have specially begged mr tremayne to examine into matter to set blanche right on point whereon might have gone wrong thus brought to stand forced to action be blanche nature to behave after manner of mule in same predicament to affect stronger contrary conviction than really felt be true said rather bluntly did think there be very little if difference between many doctrine held by rival church there be difference be betwixt heaven earth answered mr tremayne nay have well nigh said betwixt heaven hell for do believe devil to have be perverter of truth with corruption be in papistry pray of gentleness to tell of one matter wherein a account difference lieth with what power of intellect have be not much blanche mentally ran over list selected item on thought mr tremayne must find least to say seemeth be too rude harsh severe to charge papist with idolatry said be more idolater than be how so pray why image in church be for teaching of such a can not read do worship unto image only unto be signified thereby moreover pray not unto saint a must have do ask saint prayer for surely may ask father to pray for must not say that prayed unto pray pull bridle there mistress blanche said mr tremayne smiling for have raised already four weighty point may not be expounded in moment take ' like not justly in order rather in order wherein do affect other first under good pleasure what be prayer blanche be about to reply at once when struck that question involved more than supposed must have answered why saying prayer idea came to be that prayer felt instinctively that necessarily be not thought moment then answered slowly must say that be to ask somewhat with full desire to obtain same be that replied mr tremayne blanche thought so methinks there be more therein than so for implieth beyond full belief that whom will ask firstly can hear secondly be able to grant thirdly be willing to grant surely saint be willing to pray for how know can hear blanche thought thought must find reason for supposing again how know can grant pray praise hold communion know not whether offer petition blanche sat meditating see therefore there be certainty on first most weighty of point know not that saint can hear pas grant for talk sake that have knowledge of what passeth on earth can hear when do speak to how then here be saint mary lord mother sitting in heaven upon earth there be petition coming up unto at one time from loretto in italy from nuremburg in germany from seville in spain from bruges in flanders from paris in france from bideford in devon from kirkham in lancashire mistress blanche if can hear make distinction betwixt at self same moment then be woman like to brain must be mazed with din spent with labour invocation declareth omnipotency there be none almighty save one be god urged blanche body may be one whither spirit saint mary be spirit truly so yet spirit can scantly be in ten place at one time how much le thousand blanche be silent next thing take be that pray not unto saint do ask saint only to pray for if saint hear not one be a futile a other deny that pray unto saint mr tremayne went to bookcase came back with volume in hand listen here pray blessed virgin mother of god after mine only hope pray for guard during night ' give power to fight against thine enemy great god who by resurrection of thy son jesus christ hast rejoiced world pray thee grant that by blessed

o mary cause to be truly troubled for sin mistress blanche be from book be common prayer of papistical church word be spoken unto mary a well see cast doubt do ascribe unto divinity for none can effectually work upon man heart save holy ghost only none other can cause heart to be truly troubled for sin ' none other can make heart to burn now what think of mistress blanche be praying unto saint what blanche thought did not say if must be guessed from expression of face be shocked astonished now come to third point to wit image be a picture for teaching of such a have learning methinks mistress blanche that god be like to be wiser than men there must need have be many israelite in wilderness have learning yet command unto a unto be ye will not make unto graven image ' take that small good might thereby be done supposing such to be must be utterly overborne of companying evil moreover when do learn vulgar must hope learn be true be true pray that mary be borne into heaven of angel like a christ did ascend that being thus carried thither be crowned of god a queen dear maid have master word touching such pourtrayments graven image of god will ye burn with fire thou shalt utterly detest thou shalt utterly abhor for be cursed thing ' deuteronomy twelve verse o mr tremayne said blanche with horrified look must surely ne'er call picture image of lord own mother thing accursed must maid answered very gravely that instant moment that there must be given thereunto honour worship glory be only due to glory will not give to praise to graven image nay must call image of christ thing accursed if stood in place in heart of men mark king utterly destroyed serpent of brass be god own appointed likeness of christ moment that child of israel did begin to burn incense unto thereby making idol in papistical church be idol master tremayne interposed blanche eagerly therein lieth difference betwixt popery paganism what must say mistress blanche if wist that therein lieth difference betwixt popery paganism old pagan be wont to say same thing note must have laughed in face if have charged with worshipping wood stone have answered that worshipped only thing signified so much be thus that amongst pagan nation do hold that god cometh down in proper person into image for season like a papist into wafer of sacrament when account gone cast image away a more worth yet hark how god accounteth of worship maketh god even graven image falleth down unto worshippeth prayeth unto saith deliver for thou art god ' list also how expoundeth same deceived heart hath turned aside that can not deliver soul say be there not lie in right hand isaiah verse there must be little idolatry in world if there be deceived heart blanche twisted handkerchief about in manner of person who be determined not to be convinced yet can find nothing to say in answer tell mistress blanche for think too well of good sense to doubt same can not believe that christ be in piece of bread in inmost heart certainly believed such thing must never do to retreat from position in blanche eye disgrace lay not in being mistaken in being shown mistake wherefore may not be so murmured be matter of faith in like manner a be lord resurrection in like manner cry mercy believe resurrection on witness of knew saw sepulchre void saw christ spake with did eat drink with knew to be very same jesus have died can bear witness way for be not there in matter of bread here be see for not to be a be told eye tell that behold bread hand tell that handle bread tongue tell that tasteth bread witness of sens be in question three do agree that matter be bread only sens may be deceived reckon sens may be deceived a meseemeth after two fashion firstly when sens be not in full healthfulness vigour thus if man have malady in eye that know to see thing mistakenly from relation of other around then may doubt what eye see with regard to matter secondly man must not lean on sens touching matter come not within discerning of sense now in regard to bread papist do overreach did tell that change made be mystical of faith not within discernment of sense might then find harder work to deal withal must seek unto word of god only not unto sense in wise go farther tell change be such that there be more substance of bread left at note therefore be matter within discerning of sense if be thus then change be need one can see can taste can handle know at own table whether eat flesh bread how then must be unable to know same at table of lord make matter of sense must need submit to judgment of sens now to take other matter to wit of faith christ said unto jew bread will give be flesh will give for life of world took right a papist do strave among saying how will man give flesh to eat ' now mark lord answer doth say ye do ill to question matter 't be mystery of church try not by sense believe ' openeth door somewhat wider letteth in ray of light upon signification of word saith to except ye eat flesh of son of man drink blood ye have life in ' pray what manner of life surely not common life of nature for may be sustained by other food life then be spiritual life how will spiritual life be sustained by natural meat meat must be spiritual if life be so again saith that eateth flesh drinketh blood dwelleth in in now if eating be after literal manner so also must be dwelling body therefore must be withinside body of christ in heaven body must be withinside one of ours on earth that be impossible ridiculous alike need not to tell mistress blanche faith be not to believe whatsoever will tell be le to believe thing than to trust man can only trust man on due testimony that be worthy trust be to trust christ lord said blanche ay so maid be rather to trust own fantasy of what christ must say blanche be silent for moment then answered did say be body ' will go further ' like how master tremayne be body be broken for ' be bread that held in hand body be broken did that morsel of bread take away sin of world look right in so far a bread be body in so far also be breaking of bread death of body further now mistress blanche be breaking of bread death of body think thereon answer be emblem representation thereof doubt said slowly good then inasmuch a breaking did set forth death in so much did bread set body if one be emblem so must be other may be perchance said blanche sheering off from subject a found passing beyond requiring troublesome effort of thought master tremayne there be one other matter whereon speech of gospeller verily offendeth little pray tell what be mistress blanche be little honour might well say dishonour that do put upon saint mary blessed virgin surely of that knew loved on earth must have be dearest unto lord why then thus scrimp scant reverence due unto verily in matter papist do more meetly than more meetly wherewith mistress blanche with truth of holy scripture with fantasy of human nature must say repeated blanche rather warmly that honour must be very dear to blessed son there be one honour ten thousand fold dearer unto heart maid be honour of god eternal father honour that toucheth not be ready to pay to tell wherefore think must be dearest because must need be thus replied illogical blanche must ask to remember mistress blanche that hath told clean contrary blanche looked up with astonished expression whosoever will do will of father be in heaven same be brother sister mother ' equally honourable equally dear with mother of flesh whom must fain upraise above other woman be likewise disposed to think that word of paul yea though have known christ after flesh yet now henceforth know more ' say be disposed to think may have reverse side though hath known after flesh yet thus now that be exalted to right hand of god knoweth more if so then mary be now unto one of multitude of saved soul equally fair dear precious in eye of died for o master tremayne what must say mistress blanche be truly sound so cold said blanche disparagingly doth so asked rector smiling cold that must be beloved of heart dear maid 't be not that loveth le that loveth other more a blanche made response mr went on there be side to matter mistress blanche daresay have ne'er looked upon toucheth at once matter of image reverence due unto saint mary know that great part of image held in worship for by papist be image of at most

observance a of old for change be in nothing save name only became christian by handful yea by cityfuls what marvel pray how will call church of rome that thus bewrayed trust sold lord again like juda idolatrous christianity nay rather baptised idolatry god hath writ name mistress blanche on last page of word be babylon mother of abomination do marvel master tremayne said little indignantly though in constrained voice how dare bring such ill charge against papistical church do not set great store by holiness pray yea have not monk nun celibate priesthood consecrate to greater holiness than other how can charge with wickedness abomination poor child murmured rector a if to little wist what manner of life idolater term holiness mistress blanche yonder cloak of professed holiness hideth worser matter than can so much a think on 't be not set name on papistical church be god will tell moreover ' like what be holiness goodness right doing be unclear word methinks may mean well nigh aught for must say holiness be walking with god according to will of god well be not god pleased with doing of good god be pleased with nothing christ be not pleased with because of deed must first

dead work can not serve living god with dead work blanche half unconscious shrug of shoulder conveyed information that doctrine be not agreeable to surely god will be pleased with if do out best

touch blanche who be extremely dainty a to what touched quite appreciated simile found answer nevertheless god be merciful mr tremayne picture a hard unpitiful verily mistress blanche god be merciful more than may conceive god hath mercy outside of christ come to bringing aught in hand save christ hath nought to say to be ware that can not come bring nothing if bring not christ assuredly will bring somewhat else own work own suffering in manner own deservings for cometh with own demerit in hand god hath nought saving one thing hath indeed demerited be hell mr tremayne spoke so solemnly that blanche felt awed did not relish doctrine preached better on account how have demerited that asked god will answer hath not son of god hath not life ' that believeth not be condemned already do believe christian believe urged blanche what believe believe unfeignedly that creed saith touching lord believe a unfeignedly that commentary of caesar say touching same julius caesar what mean master

that ought not to be so tried to give answer must not be contradicted of that believe certes said mr tremayne suppressing smile for saw blanche difficulty attempt to evade that look landeth on self place where be at aforetime who be believe blanche wisely determined to commit further must please to tell sir dear child if heard to say touching man that be acquaint withal believe in john ' what must conceive did signify must account said blanche readily thinking question easy to answer that did mean account of a true man trust hold well worthy of affiance good if after thus saying must see to trust half angel into hand to spend for must think that mine act did go with word assuredly nay then look mistress blanche that be greater matter than maybe made account when man will say believe in jesus christ ' for signifieth not only that believe be born lived suffered arose ascended nay be account of a true man trust with body soul with friend good hold worthy of affiance will hold back

to say that did not see why anybody must believe such disagreeable thing about did not feel low opinion of own merit hers be natural religion of professing christian that must do best must christ must make up remainder mr tremayne knew what be passing in mind a well a if have spoken think be hard said think tremayne must not thus account of myself must not dear maid be assured of then wherein lieth

not possible for man to come to christ without god did draw thereto said maid master be said well what so then can have nought to answer for for without god do draw can not come without be willing to be thus drawn god will not do nay said moreover that very will must come from god therein spake truth blanche thought have now driven pastor into corner then do allow asked triumphantly that if must not will same be clean of fault sith very will must need come from god mr tremayne understood drift of catechumen ' like mistress blanche will leave moment to make inquiry into point till will have

succession then stood by two royal will king james of scotland cousin lady arbella stuart be entirely dispossessed claim have to be made under law a have stood unaltered by will of henry eighth there
