quoth davie in dry way seeing lordship have drank bottle half since sat down must think did dear wine cheereth god be referable to drink offering commanded by god of jew wherein wine doth seem to typify precious blood of christ thankfulness of that hath iniquity thereby purged away for in fifteenth chapter of book of number will find drink offering termed sweet savour unto lord since nothing christ be sweet savour unto god therefore judge that wine of drink offering like to of sacrament did denote blood of christ whereby be redeemed one prefiguring whereto looked forward a other doth likewise figure whereunto looketh back therefore wine cheereth god be to be understood by emblem of blood of christ mediator for through mean god be well pleased in way of salvation that hath appointed whereby justice be satisfied law fulfilled mercy reigneth grace triumph perfection do agree together sinner be saved god in christ glorified now sire have done bidding humbly ask majesty leave to withdraw ' king said naught cast nod of consent dear never saw such change a have come over table man seemed sobered awed queen be weeping king silent thoughtful lord rochester whom at time
