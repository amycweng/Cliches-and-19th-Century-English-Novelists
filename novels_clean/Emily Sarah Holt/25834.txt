answer with forbidding bringing in of bull be more than edward first have done before have pope jesuit be then content to let matter rest difficulty might have arisen must not first mayne then campion first jesuit who entered england be sent to move sedition to make party in execution of former bull to followed influx of treasonable book have now become evident that papal bull be to be mere brutum

in hand of unscrupulous minister of crown might be made agency of considerable vexation yet reasonable remonstrance must be offered to reminder that penalty be inflicted by law be only of queen clemency that have not be earlier exacted must also be admitted that penal law bore in reality much harder on romanists than seem to do in protestant eye to deprive protestant of service of clergyman

littleton be very tall man swarthy complexion beard little brown coloured hair about thirty neighbour of white named smart apparently smart by nature a well a name noticed unusual evidence of prosperity in neighbour dwelling shrewdly surmised reason upon due consideration of subject mr smart like good many people before after came to conclusion that be highly unreasonable that neighbour must be mounting social ladder when remained at bottom therefore applied to matter discovered refugee in barn strongly recommended barn a far preferable to white fugitive be persuaded to change hiding place be sooner done than neighbour named hollyhead set wit also to work dulcetly represented that smart barn be much le safe attractive locality than house of worthy individual being of course moved by respect to pecuniary reward for hoped on departure of guest white took fright fled caused much rumour to be blabbed abroad concerning vain search probable vicinity of fugitive humphrey littleton who be in secret began to be alarmed removed friend from hollyhead house to of man named john perk in village of hagley close to hagley park residence of widowed sister in law be before dawn on new year day that reached cottage of perk warrener gamekeeper who have be dismissed from mr littleton service for dishonesty wearied men knocked at door when perk came forth said be friend begged to help to food shelter ye be mr stephen littleton mr winter said perk be so admitted pray goodman grant meat lodging till be fit for journeying when can travel then will bring to london have great reward from king for taking being willing to die not live longer in so miserable condition if mr perk eye glistened a distant prospect of great reward be held out to grew yet more radiant when humphrey littleton counted into hand thirty golden sovereign twenty into of man seventeen to sister perk led way to barn where mounting on barley mow formed large hole in midst here unhappy gentleman be secreted food being brought to by perk a occasion served by sister margaret at time by man thomas burford here might have remained in safety for considerable time without fear of discovery have not mr perk entertained rather too close affection for barley in form than heaped up in barn namely in company with hop water mr perk have friend named poynter who liked beer rabbit quite a well a one winter night nine day after fugitive have be hidden in mow worthy set forth on poaching expedition returning home somewhat late well tippled in drink occurred to mr poynter that must save walk home if friend perk be to lodge for night latter however did not see circumstance in light tipsy altercation followed be ended by perk shaking off poynter staggering home by night be cold wet mr poynter temper be scarcely so cool a atmosphere be tipsily resolved that must have lodging at perk expense whether gentleman must not bethinking that if perk house be locked against barn be not took thither unsteady way scrambling up barley mow to own unfeigned astonishment dropped into hole on top of sleeping conspirator thus roused suddenly in dead of night naturally concluding that enemy be upon winter littleton sprang up to defend to sell life dearly poynter who be quite a much amazed terrified a must be a naturally fought for own safety desperate struggle ensued ended in two overcoming one insisting on remaining with so that must be certain of telling tale for four day poynter remained on mow professing resignation contentment lamenting sore pain suffered from wound in leg received in pursuit of vocation a rabbit stealer when margaret perk came with food afterwards burford poynter pretended to be in mortal anguish besought earnestly to bring salve without be quite certain must die salve be brought wily poynter then discovered that lying in hole have not sufficient light to apply be suffered to creep up on top of mow professed to do with greatest difficulty even there light be scarcely sufficient might drag little nearer door being now quite deceived by mr poynter excellent acting believing that be much too suffering disabled to escape permitted to crawl quite to edge of mow nearest to light of course next to door moment point be reached disabled cripple slipped down from mow next instant be out of door far away running with fleetness made hopeless to think of following there be still however room for hope spring eternal in human breast poynter friendship for perk expectation that perk must bribe to secrecy weighed with fugitive who have not sufficiently learned that friendship of unprincipled man be worth nothing poynter on other hand considered chance superior in opposite direction made at once for hagley hall intending to tell story there on way met with perk who be ignorant of poynter recent adventure that gentleman suggesting joint visit to nearest tavern poynter easily suffered step to be diverted in attractive direction precious pair of friend drank together departed to respective home now mistress littleton lady of hagley park be protestant gentlewoman of extreme discretion day on poynter thus made escape from hay mow have be chosen by to commence journey to london before departure summoned steward mr hazelwood desired to be circumspect during absence owing to mischance happening in county mistress littleton having ridden forth on journey worthy brother mr humphrey commonly called red humphrey who certainly did not share discretion of sister determined to play mouse during absence of cat to convey traitor friend into own chamber at hagley park there be reason to think that mistress littleton be not only sagacious also somewhat managing dame who rode red humphrey with tighter curb than reckless individual approved accordingly having heard of poynter escape taking one person only into confidence repaired to barn about eleven o'clock night smuggled cousin friend away from barley mow into pleasanter shelter of own

be not pleasant rent be due clothes be needed money be exceedingly scanty in outside world too sky be dull gloomy puritan be in greater favour than have be though papist be at lowest ebb that there be inconsistency in conduct did not apparently occur to authority that true way to repress popery be by cultivating puritanism believing true principle of church of england to be golden mean between two acted under pleasing illusion that when half be cut off middle must be left intact better for operation a mr marwill walked on in tottenham road saw figure seated on grassy bank at distance before when came nearer perceived that be young man who sat with head cast down in attitude of meditation light cane in hand with now then switched off head of unoffending dandelion drawing nearer still

methinks will do none ill if likewise visit evening two head be better than one though 't be said o'er many cook spoil broth yet three may be better than two feeling of humiliation grew deepened in aubrey mind be one of best thing must have come to vanity self sufficiency have always be chief failing be now finding to surprise that while chosen friend surrounded with difficulty people whom have slighted despised came forward to help out of have looked down on one more than on mr marwill agnes have received share of contempt partly because of father calling comparative poverty partly because
