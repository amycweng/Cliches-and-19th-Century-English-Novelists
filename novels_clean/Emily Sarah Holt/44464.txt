be have remained with there be also certain zest added by instinctive knowledge that what be good in eye of guenllian be not unlikely to be bad in of lord arundel little roger felt a if have pleasure of doing wrong without conscientious reaction usually followed impulsive little mind be made up that must read that french bible that be locked up in tall press at least four foot above reach be

with sauce madame by reason knew loved thus that will scantly be amongst thy sin son answered friar thomas jovially thank thee keep thee now to matter in hand roger be doing that much more strictly than be ever supposed by friar thomas who be most unsuspicious of men proceeded at once to catalogue of sin satisfied that must now receive small attention from confessor in silence with a much rapidity in a low voice a dared without exciting suspicion roger accused of having taken key from table hidden in wall what key be be not careful to state if confessor wished to know that must ask question at point roger heart gave bound for be asked question thou hiddest what in wall key mumbled roger pea repeated friar misunderstanding not having much care to investigate need to confess such like small matter son didst thou name sauce madame to master wynkfeld oh yes twice over answered roger eagerly good lad now keep thee to thy confession roger diligently did for rest of time then absolved clean shriven ran back to lawrence in highest glee now lolly sin be clean gone go thou to shrift get rid of thine then a soon a ever can will have yon big book be about week later that

to help on account of personal dislike to brother archbishop who have recently received lucrative appointment whereon courtenay have set covetous eye of course real cause of hatred be not paraded before innocent deceivable creature public true reason for hating four obnoxious councillor be that have ear of king while declined to be governed by five conspirator priestly guide who be accordingly much scandalised at allowing to be governed by one of course excepted be usual secret of complaint that man be governed put complainer in place of governor complaint will not be heard again ostensible

be ever since received a historical fact though be not substantiated by single document by thing bare word of conspirator inference from circumstantial evidence might might not be true duke have always lived unhappily with duchess who be cousin of king difference between be partly ecclesiastical siding with antipope urban with pope clement there be also reason to suspect that temper be somewhat le than angelic chronicler tell that ireland fell violently in love with german lady in queen suite whose name be lancerona lancecrona suspiciously manufactured epithet that queen wrote letter to pope urban entreating that might receive divorce urban thereupon divorced ireland philippa that duke married german love that mother be extremely indignant took philippa to live with that sire de coucy father of duchess king of france almost took up arm against england in consequence of wicked proceeding real truth of matter be that evidence exists to support alleged fact have evidence that gloucester others took pain to spread a rumour none to show that be true not only be queen letter not forthcoming there be document to show that divorce ever took place there be evidence except ipse dixit of gloucester partisan that ireland ever contracted second marriage while fact after banishment be invited to visit french court that wife bore title of duchess of ireland to day of death followed that mother ran great personal risk in warmly espousing cause that of king richard when be at lowest ebb took favourable to representation of gloucester may be added that lancecrona who be stated to have be lady in waiting laundress two utterly incompatible position even more so at time than now doe not appear at a one of royal suite in mention of contained in state paper there be cause

over whole island at dublin on th of march four chieftain be knighted by king in st patrick cathedral after mass having watched previous night in church may be well to note in passing that froissart gravely informs that st baptist be founder of cathedral to instruct four potentate in english custom in general in ceremony of forthcoming solemnity in particular king appointed tutor in person of

one point however showed that intended to listen to instruction when squire tried to investigate religious faith seemed so displeased that be forced to silence believe in god three in one said irish king thus far there be difference between creed yours teacher must not quit subject until have ascertained one point be in eye of primary importance to what pope did profess obedience be pontiff successor of st peter who reigned at rome wicked schismatic who have set up at avignon in fear trembling put question might have be easy for fierce struggle between pope anti pope have not penetrated bog of emerald isle irish king at once answered that pope be at rome then asked if must like to be made knight replied that be knight already for irish prince be made knight by royal father when be seven year of age squire responded rather contemptuously that king of england must not be satisfied with kind of childish knighthood must create knight in church with solemn ceremony shortly before

king castide opinion be worth record a to reason why irish submitted so readily thought rebellious english be alarmed at blockade of coast be so strict that provision merchandise must be landed admitted that wild irish cared nothing for since lived by hunting be stranger to commerce reason considered be personal respect bore to king richard whom accounted to be prudent conscientious man whose reverence for memory of edward confessor be shared by fact undisturbed by inconvenient knowledge richard if not irish king also have at least a much sanctity about a edward confessor how most unamiable of men whose cruelty a husband be only equalled by irreverence a son ever came to be canonised honoured a saint edward must be left a one of many insoluble enigma rome propounds to crushed heart smothered intelligence stifled conscience of votary for other reason castide remitted to grace of god canon of chimay whose exquisite naive simplicity at time cut sharply a knife made answer with more wit than be aware that grace of god be good of infinite value to who can obtain see few lord now o ' day augment territory otherwise than by force campaign thus ended roger returned to england in company with royal cousin rejoined family in london on may much to satisfaction of lawrence madison who greatly preferred to follow master out of battle rather than into though wisely kept to that sentiment must only have earned character for cowardice on very few men have idea then dawned that person must love peace for other reason than laziness fear of being hurt two characteristic of king richard uncle gloucester specially detested despised be religious opinion dislike to war tumult might truly be said paradox though be that gloucester be never at peace except when be at war during twelve month following return to london roger kept exceedingly quiet be only safe thing must do be said that eminent man be asked how being resident in paris contrived to live through reign of terror made myself of reputation kept silence be significant answer earl of march followed same plan beginning of be characterised by strong agitation against lollard party provoked by very bold step on part sir john oldcastle afterwards lord cobham issued book of conclusion epitome of lollard doctrine a well a damaging attack on opposite party be presented to parliament by lord latimer sir richard stury posted up on door of st paul cathedral gate of westminster abbey two archbishop took alarm in good earnest be strongly opposed to new doctrine be not new a old a christianity rightly judged that unless view have be spreading considerably in secret must scarcely have made flourishing appearance in public king richard must be appealed to entreated to put down unwelcome manifestation with strong arm of law astute prelate well knew that only at one point like achilles be richard vulnerable on lollard question religious view be own must listen to diatribe against political aspiration of advanced lollards dreaded disliked a much a hierarchy archbishop courtenay trusted to tongue le skilful than own task of winning king over started for ireland without delay taking with bishop braybroke prelate whom king liked respected richard most open unsuspicious of men be match for one of wiliest priest who ever wore mitre under dexterous hand be induced to believe that political aim of advanced section included own deposition exact contrary be truth beloved queen who have hitherto always guided sceptre on point be now beyond fitful fever of earthly tumult never be there king of england who so easily believed what be told say chronicler froissart who knew richard personally king thus influenced departed from course approved by own better judgment for one moment swerved from that kindly support have always given hitherto to lollard party called before four most prominent lollards then in suite lord latimer sir john montacute sir lewis clifford sir richard stury sharply rebuked for favour shown to traitor with threat of expulsion from household if did not change political aspect latimer clifford stury be terrified especially last who fell upon knee vowed that must never do again be old men youngest of group john montacute who be four twenty held peace promised nothing must king richard have looked forward five short year must have seen that one young man who now refused to follow king to evil alone of four giving life for king sake man who must not deny god for fear of sovereign be one who be ready to die for god be during short period of glamour thrown over king richard by astute archbishop certain lollards be imprisoned in beaumaris castle that recanted that various edict be issued in strong language wherein gloucester courtenay delighted against who sowed tare among people complete change of tone in royal mandate be very striking between period when gloucester influence paralysed king two short interval when richard be left to yet to day richard not gloucester courtenay be assailed with obloquy be due only to two latter on occasion richard followed archbishop leading up to certain point when courtenay pressed advantage have gained urged capital punishment for heretic king drew back card have be shown little too plainly short term of imprisonment for obnoxious politics be consonant with richard idea of right justice death a penalty of religious opinion must not give be likely when religious opinion be to extent own courtenay appeared to waive matter ostensibly deferred to king judgment richard never suspected that sentence of death have merely be by courtenay gloucester transferred to person that resolve be that if must not permit heretic to die richard must die be during period that earl roger kept quiet silent so quiet that never hear word about for whole twelvemonth though circumstantial evidence tends to show that be in london time high position known opinion alike placed in danger only safe thing to do be so far a possible to reduce to nonentity hope that gloucester myrmidon must forget during last two year death have be very busy in high place plague of have made three royal widower duke of lancaster king earl of derby in summer of archbishop courtenay be also summoned to judgment bar removed from courtenay influence king awoke from dream determined to initiate new order of thing knew at last too late that gloucester arundel be among worst enemy have seen with regard to one man more cousin derby course of english history must probably have be different there be person awake also with important difference that have never be asleep gloucester be ready to act just a soon a royal nephew sooner in fact for plan be already matured while richard be only in process of formation time be

astonished at step knew nothing of interview at fleshy to of roger gave general vague explanation have reference to necessary care of irish estate own sole fervent desire be to put where gloucester

for ireland must never forget irish blood king richard also have liking for country of uncle of gloucester be pleased to speak very scornfully be fool who think of conquering ireland said gloucester in usual unwatered diction irish be poor wicked people with impoverished country who must conquer one year must lose next affection of young earl for green isle by mean increased popularity with english retainer saxon celt have always mutually looked down upon other irish saw in english intruding stranger none more welcome for being conqueror english reckoned irish uncivilised barbarian with whom person of refinement must be satisfied to associate be not so over refined that need have be particular half educated man still more woman be usually more fastidious on score of vulgarity than blue blooded noble there be murmur among roger suit that be too accessible to mass that heart be rather irish than english when king discovered somewhat to surprise that chosen heir have so unexpectedly disappeared from scene on plea of looking after irish property sent commission of lieutenancy for ulster connaught meath most convenient arrangement for roger since afforded full excuse for not returning to england until state of affair must have changed majesty be not only person who be puzzled by roger proceeding there be person who be not puzzled at of one point roger might safely have felt assured that however sudden disappearance might surprise perplex others uncle gloucester at least must not fail to understand fact that particular material have proved unsuitable for purpose be not likely to ruin design of so far seeing scheming conspirator a gloucester having convinced that nephew of march be not soft malleable article that have supposed gloucester merely cast useless thing on one side set busy brain to work to evolve fresh project proved very different one from last new scheme involved partition of kingdom into four part of brother of lancaster be to be bought off with one matter somewhat easier said than done york who be plastic a putty in hand of gloucester be to have arundel be to be rewarded with third fourth fell to gloucester march be left out altogether how long sagacious disposition of political affair must have lasted may be very reasonably questioned certainly not at furthest beyond second generation quarter of england must never have contented

able other sovereign perhaps excepting henry vi must have borne with so long be asserted by king enemy long afterwards be now generally believed that gloucester be murdered by being smothered between two feather bed unfortunately for assertion very report be spread with view of aspersing king while gloucester be still alive subsequent elaborate account therefore be simply more carefully revised version of old slander truth be that gloucester be either privately executed that died of apoplexy before execution took place why man under sentence of death approved a inevitable by own brother just humane lancaster must not have suffered execution must be left to modern writer of follow leader school who persist in terming execution murder how many time penalty have be deserved must not be easy to reckon thing be not now a previously done by half except in one item spoiled whole earl of arundel be beheaded on st of september archbishop norfolk warwick be banished for life if one other

maintained that distance silence have evidently perceived to be only safe course for how far be neglecting duty in so doing be question may reasonably be asked date at returned to england seems to

repetition of dreadful scene just enacted at kenles be one of two topic on fevered thought ran endlessly other motive topic alike be lawrence in delirium have told guenllian secret wanted time to consider whether must be well to share with beatrice guenllian have entertained suspicion of truth already knew now with certainty lawrence loved beatrice that felt certain did not love on latter
