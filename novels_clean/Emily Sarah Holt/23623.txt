by mean concluded that process be known a settling down on contrary have never felt so unsettled feeling grew rather than diminished even alexandra ricarda have tried le than present companion in one sense for puzzled le though teased more be beginning to understand mistress whose mood be usually one of weary lack of interest energy occasionally broken either by season of acute sorrow by sudden flash of fiery anger last be le trying than first indeed seemed sometimes to amphillis that served a vent relief for time after weariness be shade dreary languor scarcely quite so overpowering late in evening on night before harvest home sir godfrey returned home attended by squire master norman impression received by amphillis concerning master of house be that be fitting pendant to wife tall square stern did not know that sir godfrey have be rather wild in youth a such men do have become correspondingly severe precise in old age not that heart have changed be simply that sin of youth have be driven out by sin of maturer life satan be always willing to let slave replace one sin by for make none le surely sir godfrey suffered under sense of inconsistency in sternly rebuking when exhibited by agatha matthew slight tendency to evil of same type a have once be addicted to have not sown wild oat become reformed character outside of cup platter be now so beautifully clean that never so much a occurred to to question condition of inside yet within be very foul thing alienation from god hardness of heart love of gold grew upon year by year thought most excellent man though be only whitewashed sepulchre lifted head high a stood in court of temple effusively thanked god that be not a other men excellent man said everybody who knew perhaps little too particular rather severe on peccadillo of young people when time came that voice pronounced final sentence on whitewashed life verdict be scarcely well done norman hylton sat opposite to amphillis at supper table in only manner in people must sit opposite to other at mediaeval table namely when be in form of squared horseshoe table be always one more board laid across trestle be very narrow inside of horseshoe being reserved for servant to hand dish there be therefore yard of distance between opposite neighbour amphillis studied neighbour so far a occasional glance in direction allowed to do so came to conclusion that there be nothing remarkable about except expression of face be neither tall short handsome ugly lively morose talked little with next neighbour matthew foljambe there be nothing in manner of to provoke curiosity a to subject of conversation expression puzzled amphillis have dark eye like countess thought weary sometimes fiery aspect of hers be replaced in by look of perfect contentment peace yet be utterly different from self satisfied expression beamed out of sir godfrey eye what manner of man be master hylton asked of agatha who always sat next precedence at table be regulated by strict

born that must help to laugh at to what end why for husband child a to wherewith leave to thee agatha concluded with stifled giggle agatha be that indignant amphillis must say in answer must hardly have told whether felt more vexed astonished bare idea of such thing evidently quite familiar to agatha be utterly new to never surely signify that decent maid must set to seek man for husband like angler with fish must be uncommon queer folk in hertfordshire if thou art sample thereof be reply why for sure so signified thou must have be bred up in convent phyllis else tied to thy grandmother apron string thy life will maid ne'er have bit of fun quotha amphillis made answer finished rissole in silence helped to small pound cake verily folk be born a old a grandmother said agatha accepting fieldfare from sewer squeezing lemon over must fain enjoy youth though be little like to do whilst here be howbeit be sheer waste of stuff for maid to set heart on master norman wist not how to discourse with maid must have be monk in very sooth for be fit for nought better there be sparkle about look satisfied said amphillis rather wistfully be wishing that felt so agatha answer be puzzled

smooth pillow when be sick comfort when heart be woeful mean heart to be woeful a to pillow there be thousand will smooth for wage be smoother when 't be done for love be answer agatha devoted to orange in few minute lady foljambe gave signal to rise from table young lady followed to private sitting room where agatha received stern reprimand for crime of laughing too loud be told be better than silly giglot who must probably bring day to dire disgrace lady foljambe then motioned to spindle desired not to leave till bell rang for evening prayer in chapel just before bed time agatha
