stead who be new priest asked bertram one sir marmaduke de tyneworth fictitious person what manner of man be right honest man proper fitting satisfactory man say who have confessed unto more kindly courteous than father dominic hath then not yet confessed thee never confess said hugh quietly impression made upon bertram feeling by statement be very much that must be left on ours if heard man with high reputation for piety calmly remark that never prayed never confess repeated in astonished tone not to men confess unto god only how canst other than by priest what hardship trow can not speak save by priest thou canst receive absolving can ay verily friend can bertram stopped with puzzled look come out with thy buts said hugh smilingly why methinks holy church saith that be god mean whereby men will approach unto hath given unto other holy church saith ay so where saith god thing bertram be by mean ignorant of wycliffe bible searched memory for authority precedent well thou wist that man have leprosy be bidden to show unto priest be to declare if malady be true leprosy priest being therein emblem mystery of christ be true healer of malady of sin ah said bertram triumphantly lo ' thou when lord did heal one have leprosy what quoth show to priest saith not be true priest therefore thou mayest slack to show thee to yon other priest be emblem of ' because replied hugh did fulfil law made honourable therefore saith show to priest ' law held good until must have fulfilled same mind thou urged bertram eagerly be lither wicked abandoned pharisee did speak like unto thee what said save very thing thou wouldst fain utter to wit who may forgyve synnes god aloone ' alway lord did snyb rebuke ill fawtors friend countest thou that jew have leprosy betook unto high priest

used with what saying that god be not sufficient high priest may not act without lesser priest do what sayest touching pharisee repeated bertram who be not able to answer hugh argument considered own unanswerable what say be calm answer why say spake very sooth saving that pushed not matter to full issue have followed reasoning on to further end then must have said spoken truly if man can in very deed forgive sin then be god ' mark pray thee what did lord in matter brought forth letter of warrant healed palsied man afore that ye wite ' saith that mannes sone hath power in erthe to forgyve synnes a though have said unto ye say well none may forgive sin god alone wherefore see in forgiving of sin plain proof be god son ' to show that have power to forgive sin did heal man of malady verily ask more of priest must confess only that bring forth letter of warrant a did master mine when will see to heal sick with word then will crede that can forgive sin in like manner lo thou if can forgive can heal if can heal by word then can forgive water be rather too deep for bertram to wade in tried line of argument saint james also saith that men must confess sin ech to othire ' well when liketh sir marmaduke to knowledge sin unto then will mine unto if have done wrong to other look thou into matter of saint james thou shalt find to touch not well men only sick knowledging sin when conscience be troubled praying for other will be healed of sickness moreover achan did confession unto josue said bertram starting hare ah josue be priest trow nay if be well to knowledge sin to other will not be worse because man be priest better said hugh in quietest manner nay urged bertram who thought have advantage here ' be well to confess at be good to confess unto if to to woman if to woman to man to man then to priest hugh gave soft little laugh good friend must prove gear in world by manner of reasoning if be good to confess unto then unto anything liveth if so then to beast if to beast then to yonder cat come hither pus hear friend confession have done with thy mocking cried bertram mind thou lord did charge holy apostle with power to forgive sin granting that so be what then what then why priest have now like power what toucheth priest in be successor unto apostle in what manner hugh be evidently not disposed to take link of chain for granted man exclaimed bertram almost in pet wist not that paul did ordain timothy bishop of ephesus bade do like to other so from to other be blessed grace handed down till gat at priest now be be so said hugh coolly when where bade paul that timothy must forgive sin bertram found much harder to prove assertion than to state must only answer that did not know returned hugh timothy without much mistake must need give thee up thou art worst caitiff to reason withal ever mortal man did see hugh laughed lo ' friend ask for one instance of authority show unto passage of authority in god word whereby priest will forgive sin show unto priest that now liveth will bring forth letter of warrant by healing man suddenly of sickness whatsoever be at point bring forth prithee else confess thou hast such to bring hold thy peace for love of mary mother said bertram passing irrepressible opponent plateful of smoking pasty for party be at supper fill thy jaw herewith be so hot thou shalt occupy time word being somewhat too hot for thee

lamb that power of be in tree of life enter by gate into city when art thou shorn priest asked edward cynically will do thee to wit in time to see said richard more lightly a rode across drawbridge at langley how far did edward play traitor in matter of attempted rescue of mortimer can not be said distinctly that did at have played traitor on so many previous occasion have assisted in hatching so many conspiracy for mere object of denouncing associate that suspicion of having done so in instance be difficult to avoid strangest point of be that to last hour of life man played with lollardism

shared fate of mortimer be closely confined in stronghold be not in isabel nature to fret much over thing richard be gentle playful affectionate child to whom absence of familiar face must be serious trouble then what must become of edward whom have tacitly criminated what must become of richard darling brother whom not to criminate have sacrificed truth must have sacrificed life last worst of
