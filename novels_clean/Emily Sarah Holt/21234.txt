disappointed tone dear heart be fine responded fortune little did jenny lavender think a passed up aisle to father pew that jenny who entered that church be never to leave again there be stranger in pulpit day man of very different sort from usual preacher be old man style of sermon be old fashioned instead of being learned closely reasoned discourse seasoned with scrap of latin political essay on event of day be sermon such a have be more common in beginning of century simple almost conversational striking full of gospel truth sermon jenny lavender have never heard before text be genesis chapter verse will not let thee go except thou bless preacher told hearer in plain fashion without learned disquisition flowery phrase what blessing meant that for god to bless man be to give not what wished what really needed for soul welfare that many thing men thought blessing be really evil that did not help man towards god only hurried faster on road to perdition told that christ be god greatest blessing unspeakable gift that who received be in truth possessed of thing when came near end of sermon bent forward over pulpit cushion spoke with affectionate earnestness to hearer now brother how many here day said be ready to speak word unto lord how many of earnestly desire blessing what canst thou not get so far poor soul be thine hand so weak that thou canst not hold be thy foot so feeble that thou canst not creep thus far up ladder at top whereof standeth well then let see if thou canst reach step beneath lord most earnestly desire thy salvation be too far for thy foot to stretch canst thou say lord desire thy salvation however feeble faint thy desire be poor sinful soul art thou so chained weak that thou canst not come even so far then see if thy trembling foot will not reach lowest step of lord make to desire thy salvation ' surely howsoever sunk in mire howsoever blind thou be thou canst ask to be lifted forth to have sight given thee brother will ye not so do when ye fall to prayer even ere ye sleep will ye not say so much a yea will ye not go further run up ladder cry with mighty voice will not let thee go except thou bless ' when jenny lavender came out of church stood on second step of ladder scarcely heard abigail walker taunt of well if mr jane did give gown will go bail stole that pink ribbon such thing be far beneath one who have set foot on ladder jenny did not stay at bottom ran up fast by time that knelt down at bedside for evening prayer have come to fourth step will not let thee go except thou bless last atom of jenny old admiration for robin featherstone have be already shaken vanished day spirit of god who have touched heart through preacher led to see folly vanity frivolity be utterly out of concord with then came feeling of regret for unkind flippancy with have treated tom fenton jenny knew that tom be christian man have be one reason why despised so long a be not christian woman there be gulf between now of own digging tom have given over coming to farm except on business gave kindly good morrow when met be no more than gave to kate other girl of acquaintance jenny saw nothing of beyond on side heard praise a doer of brave kindly action knew that apart from mere outside there be not man to be compared to tom fenton in whole neighbourhood be bitter to reflect that time have be when tom be ready to put have at foot have only own folly to thank that be over wonder jenny grew graver looked older than used to be father be uneasy about feared be ill unhappy consulted sensible old mother nay said mr lavender jenny not took bad a for sadness be just womanhood coming to spoil joe furnace burn up dross let go wo hurt good gold think then mother there be fear of dear lass going into waste like asked farmer lavender anxiously joe will let know when do at present think be only coming to sens bit old preacher appeared more in pulpit at darlaston so far a jenny lavender be concerned have done work for be sent there jenny have not single christian friend except old persis fenton kept away from tom aunt just because be aunt be therefore shut up to bible read diligently perhaps grew faster because be watered direct from fountain head old mr lavender be wise in moral sense not in spiritual one beyond having general respect for religion dislike to thing irreverent profane farmer lavender shared with looked on piety a sunday thing too good to use day so jenny stood alone in own family while be passing at farm colonel lane mr jane be speeding post haste to france colonel explained to featherstone whom alone of servant took with that sister having have honour of performing important service to king life be in danger from resentment of parliamentary party king be now safe at paris where hoped to join on arriving there if featherstone wished to return home thought there be doubt that must get passage for in suite of person journeying to england if on contrary preferred to remain in france colonel must willingly retain service have entered into arrangement concluded whereby rent will be secure will be remitted to from time to time while remain in france trust may not be long ere king will be restored can go back with featherstone requested little time to think matter over certainly have desire to leave colonel before reaching paris city wished to see beyond others ay take time answered colonel sister will provide with woman when arrive thither in truth be not for own sake for jenny that left at home conversation confirmed featherstone in two opinion already entertained first be satisfied that understanding have be arrived at between colonel friend mr chadderton whereby latter be to remit colonel rent under colour of keeping estate for secondly be more convinced than ever will jackson have played traitor that be through parliament have be made aware of colonel service to king cause whatever might be dover be reached in safety party embarked on board adventure for calais took twenty hour to cross before ten of be over robin featherstone must have be thankful to be set down on most uninhabited island in pacific ocean with prospect of ever seeing paris anything else might have be safe upon dry land be in very limp unstarched condition of mind body that landed on calais quay colonel lane old traveller excellent sailor be rather disposed to make merry at poor robin expense for toothache sea sickness be malady for man rarely meet with much sympathy slept last night at saint denis where colonel encountered old acquaintance english gentleman who be just starting for paris who assured colonel that must communicate news of approach to king truly be weary of horse riding a may well be said mr jane a mounted next morning to traverse eight mile lie between saint denis paris poor little jenny lavender 't be well brought not withal must have be dog weary ere have won thus far for short distance mr jane rode by colonel mounting horse beside featherstone followed french youth came last conducting baggage horse rather more than distance to capital have be traversed when large cavalcade be seen approaching consisted of number of gentleman on horseback preceding one of large cumbrous coach then in common use in sat two lady little girl coach be drawn by six heavy flanders mare went at so leisurely pace that must easily be accompanied by crowd of french sight seer who ran before behind around a soon a two party came within sight of other one of gentleman who preceded coach rode forward met traveller pulling off hat a came up to featherstone perceived that be lord wilmot how do colonel lane said mr jane most obedient pray be in readiness for high honour awaits majesty come to meet with prince brother queen in coach desiring to do a much honour give a good welcome a possible be vastly beholden to majesty replied colonel lane looking a pleased a felt be very much for honour thus paid to be most unusual showed that young king mother considered service important one featherstone called looking back keep close behind may lose featherstone tried hard to obey found order difficult of execution crowd be only bent on seeing meeting cared not straw whether featherstone be lost not knew not word of french be aware that if did lose master must probably have little trouble in finding again moreover be very curious to see king partly on kate lavender principle of afterwards having to talk about just at awkward moment horse took to curvetting have enough to do to manage be vaguely conscious that one of rider who sat on fine black horse have come forward beyond rest be cordially shaking hand with mr jane colonel heard gentleman say welcome life fair preserver dimly fancied that voice be familiar then having reduced horse to decent behaviour lifted up eye saw will jackson will jackson none other though now clad in very different garb be who sat that black barb so royally king plumed hat be in left hand while right held that of mr jane be at will jackson word of thanks that be smiling with such delight be before whom colonel lane bent bare headed to saddlebow awkward lout who have never be in gentleman service ignorant clown fresh from plough tail roundhead traitor have vanished a if have never be in stead be king charles second smilingly complimenting friend to whose care caution owed safety if earth must have opened swallowed up featherstone thought must have be thankful worse ordeal be before a sat on now quiet horse gazing open mouthed open eyed king saw old twinkle featherstone knew came into dark eye have see old friend yonder said comically pray fetch fellow servant up to speak with poor featherstone be laid hold of pulled off horse pushed forward close to of king how do robin asked merry monarch who heartily enjoyed little affair of sort nay look not so scared man be not about to cut off thine head featherstone contrived to mumble out something in forgive be only word audible forgive thee what for said king charles for thou knewest not tookest for roundhead why man be just then finest service thou couldst have done have nought to forgive thee for save glass of best ale ever drank that thou drewest for at breakfast on morrow of departing here of majesty plunged hand in turn into pocket a usual found empty what plague be money can none of lend few louis pocket of suite proved to be almost a bare a of king duke of hamilton managed to find half louis well knew must never see again queen henrietta be applied to in coach in vain a have money did not choose to produce well knowing son extravagance thoughtlessness colonel lane have sovereign furnished king held out to featherstone there said keep somewhat for thyself give somewhat to little dairy maid took part must have have knock thee down tell will make brave soldier for guard when men be killed divide a thou wilt nay must have token for pretty mr jenny majesty cast eye about fell on plumed hat without minute consideration loosened diamond buckle give said tell king heartily agrees with will jackson ill looking fellow be just like king charles to give away diamond buckle when suite have money to pay for necessary robin featherstone stepped back into crowd where be pretty well hustled pushed about before regained horse managed to keep fast hold of money diamond clasp be rather troubled what to do with jewel have so pointedly be intended for jenny that must scarcely help dealing rightly in instance division of money be not so clear man who be just generous must have given sovereign to fortune have kept half louis worth about shilling penny for feather tone be not generous not particularly anxious to be just portion to be appropriated to fortune dwindled in thought until reached crown there for very shame sake stayed why not demanded mr featherstone of conscience when made feeble remonstrance did not majesty say divide a thou list pray who be be not to obey majesty have majesty order be little le in accordance with own inclination perhaps mr featherstone must not have found so incumbent on to obey be astonishing how easy virtue becomes when run alongside man interest choice featherstone have never learned denial be virtue nearly a hard to exercise without practice a must be to play tune on musical instrument player have never handled before in wonderful allegory holy war be le read than companion pilgrim progress deserves quite a much bunyan represents self denial a plain citizen of mansoul of whom prince immanuel made first captain then lord must never have be selected for honour if have not first done unobtrusive duty a quiet citizen self denial self control be not commonly admired virtue just now yet be very poor man who have not most valuable possession robin featherstone stayed with colonel just a long a suited until have exhausted such pleasure a must have in paris without knowing word of french language be too lazy to learn what vast amount of good not to speak of pleasure men lose by laziness when point be reached featherstone told colonel that wished to return to england colonel lane who happily for be not lazy set thing in train procured for robert passage to england in service of gentleman who be going home wonder how little jenny going on said idle friend to a drew near bentley might do worse than take
