christmas before knew rest then one winter morrow came warrant of chancery granting to lady land of own inheritance by reason of execution of husband then knew that have come that must come child meg except have not yet be allowed to see mother who have never stirred from bedchamber one evening early in january be sitting in closet clad in new doole raiment how hated talking to one in low voice

tall stately with white white face so that weed be scarcely whiter kind of fixed unalterable expression of intense pain yet unchangeable peace seemed to strange look whether pain peace be greater knew not must tell be newer girl sat looked at with puzzled face then faint smile broke through pain on white face like sun breaking through cloud voice knew asked of know child be how mother came back to did not leave again ever since died have lived for that white face full of peace yet of pain abides with colour have never returned think pain grows le with year peace grows more smile freely be faintly a if smile hardly belonged to be only borrowed thing might not be kept eye never light up a of old only once when month after father end nym geoff came back to then just for one moment old

one like seemed to do work to live living in very light of throne of god just a impassioned musician turn thing into music true painter longs to paint lovely thing see so with thing turn to jesu christ must think will be canonised day be sure deserves better than many one whom have heard man name a meriting to be saint perhaps be possible to be saint not be canonised must man not have be saint before can be declared one know lady julian must chide for saying bid remember that church only can declare man to be saint wonder if lord never make saint without waiting for church to do for church may never call lady saint joan will be whether be so called at time think too that who will be privileged to dwell in heaven will find there great company of saint of whom never heard perchance of that sit highest there will not be most accounted of in calendar on festival day suppose a ancestress of mother did in chronicle wrote once read be in possession of french relative be written by lady elaine de lusignan daughter of geoffroy count de la marche who be son of house note suppose that saint who be noble in world will sit nearest throne who be peasant furthest off nay think will be order of nobility will obtain there who have served lord best done most for fellow men think will be noble of world for doe not lord say that first will be last there last first can guess joan de mortimer lady mother will not stand low on list be true be countess in life be little to comfort be beside that early orphaned cruelly ill used wife bereaved mother life brought little good heaven

might have loved whom never saw after be flung over convent wall who be mine not hers to whom suppose will have wedded know nothing will never know say be sin to think of thing seems to be sin loving people more especially mother ada told one day that saw in inclination to be too much drawn to mother alianora warned to mortify because be father sister therefore there be cause to fear might be indulgence of flesh now week past poor dry withered heart seems to have little faint pulsation in go out to margaret sister margaret with strange dark eye own sister who be utter stranger to must crush poor dry thing back hurt be left to hurt of will saint in heaven tell why be that god who loveth men will not have monk nun to love other lord prior saith be jealous god demand that give love to yet may love blessed saint without derogation to must not love mine own sister be very perplexing do earthly father forbid child to love one lest must not be loved sufficiently must have thought that love like other thing increased by exercise that loving sister must rather help to love god say not suppose know ah if must find out at last that mistook god be meaning that might have have love margaret too nay even might have have love that other of be so wicked in to think yet something be in will keep ever thinking o holy immaculate virgin saint margaret saint agnes ye blessed maiden dwell in heaven have mercy on miserable sinner soul be earth bound can not rise be bride of christ can not cease lamenting lost earthly bridal hath christ thousand bride say holy church be bride be one then how can all vestal in convent be of bride suppose can not understand a ought to do perhaps must have understood better if might have be have be if have not stood withering year taught to

must have be frightened if have not done so say have poor wit be fit to teach only babe not fit to teach saith mother ada in tone be sure people must call cross snappish if be extern for fancy run to playing with rather than teaching thing worth knowing ah mother ada be not love worth knowing must have that only from happy mother who not being holy woman be permitted to love not from poor crushed hopeless heart like mine there be nothing in life to look forward to till death be vow of sisterhood death seems poor hope know of course what mother ada must say have vocation heart be in world of world god sent to world man rather woman thrust against will into sisterhood not bit better than lot wife say mother ada be struck to pillar of salt for looking back so shalt thou be sister annora with thy worldly fancy carnal longing well if be be not sure must feel much different sometimes seem to myself to be hardening into stone body soul soul ah be worst of now then in dead of night when lie awake for hour more after lauds can seldom sleep one awful thought harrieth weareth at time almost to madness never knew till year ago when heard lord prior speaking to mother gaillarde thereanent holy church held contract of marriage for true canonical tie if be thus be never divorced never heard word thereof what then be true wife not be happy with who be what be doth care for make first thought give heart to a must have done if how convent bell startled miserable be vowed to god be for ever vow came first if be never undone mater purissima sanctum virgo virginum os pro be there tale sad strange story lying behind dark eye in shut up heart of sister margaret not like mine be never betrothed eye seem to to tell story margaret never speaks to unless do first dare not except about work when mother gaillarde mother ada be present yet once twice have caught dark eye scanning face with wistful look maybe too be trying to crush down heart a have done can not help thinking that heart behind eye will take great deal of crushing mother alianora be so different from two named just now be sure there be not better holier woman in order be always gentle tender never cold like mother ada hard sarcastic like mother gaillarde be glad lady prioress rule with easy hand sadly too slack saith mother gaillarde so dear mother alianora doth not get chidden for what be best part of must not be afraid of speaking to margaret if only be present of superior at recreation time afternoon sister amphyllis asked mother alianora how long have be professed forty nine year saith with gentle smile be surprised to hear hath then be in order only five year longer than have how old be mother saith sister amphyllis nineteen year saith there must many one have died since came here mother ay alianora with far away look at tree without oldest nun in abbey sister margery de burgh died month after came hither remembered sister be nearly hundred year old have received holy veil from hand of saint gilbert sister amphyllis crossed annora saith mother alianora canst thou remember mother guendolen what did know about mother guendolen faint vague misty memory seemed to awake within odd incongruous mixture like dream dark eye like margaret told tale seemed tale of terror enamelled cross have somewhat to do with battle queen scarcely know mother said somewhat do recall yet what be hardly know be eye dark with affrighted look in be dark said mother alianora very peace of god be in ah thou art mixing up two person cousin mother gladys be near of age mother guendolen only outlived mother gladys by one year be full diverse manner of woman thou shouldst remember annora thou wert maiden of fifteen when died at once seemed to flash up before do remember mother if please be tall have very black hair dark flashing eye moved like queen think of saith mother alianora rather a be in last day when flashing eye flashed no longer queen be lost in saint if please mother said have not enamelled cross that wore recollect something about mother alianora smiled somewhat amusedly have perchance thy memory runneth back to battle over cross betwixt sister sayena who laid plaint afore lady prioress that mother guendolen kept to herself article of private property must have gone into treasury have be mother marriage gift from queen that then be well remember mother guendolen word sware to part from cross alone with life master granted to keep when entered order then fire died out of eye voice fell low added ah sister dost thou envy christ cross ' ay have carried more of cross than most came here about age thou didst annora little child of six year who be in world mother quoth sister nora be surprised to see mother alianora glance round room a if to see who be there afore answered did answer for moment be sister guendolen of sempringham let satisfy thee maybe in world above be that must have be in world be not must not wonder if mother guendolen life have held might have be like mine want to know what carnal worldly ' mean be word hear very often always with condemnation seem to mean quite different thing in lip of different speaker when mother ada us mean having affection in one heart for thing person be not part of holy church when mother gaillarde speaks mean caring for thing that doe not care for includes everything except power grandeur order of saint gilbert when mother alianora say fall softly on ear a if meant not love happiness thing good innocent simply must grieve lord hurt soul loved be with just opposite of jesus christ oh if only blessed lord have be on earth now might have gone on pilgrimage to place where be if must have asked question perplex laid at foot sorrow trouble for think must have commanded saint to chase away because maybe have poorer wit than other woman who let mother bring babe to fancy must have be patient gentle even with scarce think must have treated sorrow even wrong mistaken sorrow if only be real a do with cold look hard word gibe take so much bearing suppose must have told wherein sinned think must have done gently so a not to hurt more than must be helped not like who seem to think that nothing say do can possibly hurt one be use saying such thing to people once did say about tenth part of what felt when mother ada be present turned on almost angrily sister annora be scarce better than idiot know not confession to priest be same thing a to lord well may be so though never feel like be sure priest be not same thing if be young mother with little babe must never bring to priest have known save one be stranger who confessed for week five year gone when lord prior be ill be quite different from others there be soul behind eye something human not merely sort of metallic box sounded when rang with bit of metal never know why margaret eye make think of man suppose may be that there be same sort of look in be not sure that can put into word make think not of dry bough like heart feel to be rather of walled recluse something alive very much alive inside thick hard impenetrable wall can not enter can never leave soft tender sweet fancy people who look like must have have history person trouble beside man margaret be saint peter wife mother because if holy apostle have wife mother must have have wife what must holy apostle be doing with wife ventured once to ask ada how be to be explained said that of course saint peter must have be married before conversion calling by lord dare be bound added mother gaillarde that be shocking vixen something bad so a to serve for thorn in flesh to holy apostle 'd deal better have be unwedded man well folk relation be thorn in flesh can quite suppose must think mother gaillarde be that being nun be mercy to man so that be told off to prick not be body so be called to be thorn in flesh to somebody must not fancy being looked on by relation if be in world a nothing mean of grace might be good for doubt if must for wonder if margaret ever knew that priest whose eye looked like hers must like to ask ada always forbids to ask other question about past life say curiosity be sin be curiosity led eve to listen to serpent think mother ada soul have wing always feel a if mine have something that if only be at liberty must spread carry away far far from here right up into very star for aught know poor caged bird a be how can wing unfold fancy margaret have wing very likely stronger than mine seems to have altogether stronger nature mother alianora will let ask question sometimes asks well so doe mother gaillarde more than body in such different way mother alianora asks a if be comforting helping mother gaillarde a though be piece of embroidery have be done wrong be looking to see where stitch have begun to go crooked if be piece of lawn must not at like mother gaillarde to pull crooked stitch out of pounce on so eagerly pull so savagely at marvel what margaret history have be last evening a be putting orphan to bed two of sister do by turn week little damia saith to sister annora what be matter with new sister who dost thou mean child asked sister marian for sister marian be last professed said child mean sister

such odd fancy a thou said a tucked up now say thy hail mary go to sleep thought right to check damia who have very lively imagination must make up story by yard about see if one encouraged when sat down again to loom instead of holy meditation ought to come to suppose must do so if be perfect kept wondering if damia have seen rightly if margaret soul have be to look for something be disappointed in not finding looked at be just across room a damia said there be very sorrowful weary look on face look a if thought memory hope have be awakened in only to be sent back sorely disappointed disheartened somebody else noticed too lady prioress be rather late last night in dismissing sister roberga said be sure there have be altercation between mother gaillarde certainly mother gaillarde a stood at top of room by lady did not look exactly incarnation of sweetness lady gave word at last a said pax vobiscum sorores sister went up to knelt to kiss hand took own lamp from lamp stand glided

bitter cup if thou want yet then remember how short life be that after have done will will be together with for ever dear heart be only little while sister who be to watch with have come forward to foot of bed be standing silent there when mother alianora thus spoke fancied that heard little sob wondering who be looked up looked up to great astonishment into dark strange eye of own sister margaret margaret alone to keep watch night long what must lady prioress mean here be opportunity to indulge will not to mortify to make love grow instead of repressing have actually put into hand chance have so earnestly desired to speak to margaret alone now that first difficulty be removed rose up before must margaret speak to be perhaps searching for opportunity of mortification must refuse indulgence permitted knew a much of king court a much of knightly tournament a knew of sealed up heart of hers must be allowed to know more annora said aunt again there be one thine in life that regret sorely be be not more of mother to thee when thou earnest a little child of course be under discipline feel now did not search for opportunity a might have done let little chance pas might have

may be around thinking be forward till ye know not whether face be toward city let thy face be toward lord of city said mother alianora will lead thee forth by right way that thou mayest come to city to holy hill right way daughter be sometimes way over moor through mist who of walketh in darkness there be light to let trust in name of lord lean upon god ' why child be only when man can not see that be possible for to trust faith be not called in exercise so long a thou walkest by sight when thou art utterly alone said sister in low voice with not one footstep on road beside thee that art thou never child so thou be christ footstep be alway there in suffering ay in perplexity daughter when thou losest step thou yet hast if lack wisdom let ask of god ' god be never from home neither be satan greater be be in than in world ' mother alianora seemed weary when have said lay still while margaret did not answer think mother dropped asleep sat beside watched margaret stood still at foot of bed not sitting down in dim light of one little lamp must scarcely see face a stood only that be turned toward casement where faint half moon rode in heaven calm ancient star looked down on oh how small world be ours in great heaven yet for one soul of one little babe in small world son of god hath died heart went out to margaret a stood there yet lip be sealed felt strangely a if must not speak something held back knew not if be god satan only mine own want of sense bravery long hour wore on church bell tolled for lauds heard soft tramp of sister foot a passed returned then door closed ada voice said laus deo sister ismania replied deo gratias then mother ada footstep passed door a went to cell once more be silence on rolled hour slowly still mother alianora seemed to sleep still margaret stood a if have be cut in stone without so much a moving still sat feeling much a if be stone too have power to move speak might be about way between lauds prime when spell be at last broken be broken to astonishment by margaret asking question fairly took breath away annora art thou saint be first word margaret have ever spoken to except from necessity that weary dried up thing that call mine heart seemed to give little bit of throb lady love said never be never must be be glad to hear said why margaret oh how heart wanted to call something sweeter said darling beloved mine own little sister tongue be so unwonted to utter such word must not persuade to say yet more to surprise margaret came out of window came knelt at foot laid clasped hand on knee hadst thou said ay ' must have spoken no more a thou art not annora be true that twain have one mother something in margaret tone helped took clasped hand in mine own be true mine own sister said sister ' mother ' said be word that mean nothing at to wonder if god meant to mean nothing to must not have be a good woman have served a well if have dwelt with own blood a other maiden do even if voice died away margaret said mother ada must say be wicked mine heart be for ever asking same question be said eagerly o annora then thou knowest thought maybe thou shouldst count wicked chide for indulging such thought how must chide one sinner a be said nay margaret doubt not thought have be far unholier than thine thou rememberest not be sure ere be professed be troth plight unto young noble always that life have lost flitteth afore a bird held jewel in beak might lure on from flower to flower ever following never grasping sweet illusion margaret sister despise not for confession thou wilt see be saint like to be despise thee said dear heart wert thou to know how much further have gone looked on with alarm margaret be professed religious woman note religious woman answered if thou gild piece of wood doth become gold religious woman be not woman that wear black white cut in certain fashion be woman set god above thing have not done have not laid mine heart upon altar living sacrifice because believed called to break poor quivering thing in twain will judge that did will to best of power knowledge because now then human sob break from woman heart by reason be not yet angel that did not make stone believe will not believe gave own son to die for man can be moloch delighting in human suffering caring not how many heart be crushed so long a there be flower upon altar how many life be made desolate so long a there be choir to sing antiphon annora be not god who doe such thing men be doubtful how to answer seeing must not understand what meant only said yet god permit men to do ay never bid to make others suffer far le to take pleasure in doing so margaret said may know thy story have told thee mine truly be not much to tell said a if dreamily not much only one a will be told out by mile rather than yard from thousand of convent on day when great doom will be only story of crushed heart how much doe that matter to father of order there be somewhat too many in cell for to take note of one remembered what mother gaillarde have said be terrible if be true answered thought be only one that made unhappy because must be so wicked at time in meditation have looked round chamber thought here be blessed woman wrapped in holy meditation only tempted by wicked thought of world outside like lot wife at sodom margaret fairly laughed verily said if be given to to lift veil from heart of blessed woman scan holy meditation reckon thine amaze must not be small annora think thou art saint impossible said why fell asleep in midst of rosary s'ennight back having be awake night before benedict said must do penance for saint be not such a annora if angel write in men book have worse to set down in thine than what thou hast told count will reckon work full light o humble meek of heart thinking other better than trust be at best like such a thou margaret left station at foot coming round knelt down beside laid head on shoulder kiss sister said so did at once without thought then perceiving what have done be affrighted o margaret have not sinned be not indulgence of flesh wert thou made without flesh asked margaret with short dry laugh must be mortified sin must be mortified answered more gravely why must mortify love not spiritual love natural love surely renounce why must renounce doe god make men son brother husband father only that may have somewhat to renounce can train only in wilderness of sinai not in land flowing with milk honey renounce for renounce for demandeth of margaret voice be low sorrowful now ay there be time when holdeth out hand for one dearest earthly thing call to resign blessed be that then howsoever shrink faint yet love more than brace will to give up to to that so do annora giveth be better than earthly thing quid enim mihi est in caelo et te quid volui super terram psalm verse seems to that ought to beware of renouncing what doe not ask of if be in doubt then let draw line on safe side on side not on side of inclination yet of one thing be sure that many woman mortifies grace instead of sin resigns to god asks not keeping that must have mortify grace cried o margaret how must think thou wouldst sister if thou hadst refused to kiss replied with amused smile kiss be such very carnal thing said mother ada always say so saith read of none of holy apostle kissing body save only juda iscariot who told so doth find written that did not kiss body annora marvel if lord kissed not little child be sure holy patriarch kissed other believe in trying to be better than god have noted that when man endeavour to purify above lord example commonly end in being considerably le good than other men wish might love other said with sigh be very much afraid kissed again know what mother ada must have said wish might said margaret sturdily do will if must make idol of other said will not make idol of thee answered sister again in low sad tone set up one idol came to held out pierced hand tore down from over altar gave to be keeping for will give back one day in world where need fear idol making sin at annora thou shalt hear story at moment looked up saw mother alianora eye wide open do lack aught dear mother asked child answered gently go on with thy tale margaret ear of one will soon hear harp of angel will not harm thee be somewhat surprised must say that what of dread fire of purgatory must come first did count so great saint a to escape then thought perhaps might have have same revealed to in vision thought did not appear to trouble margaret who took a matter of course not truly must be surprised if mother alianora be good enough to escape purgatory for be sure be best woman ever knew be strange must reckon of ada always say be saint think such whereto mother gaillarde once added in dry sharp way that be not much better who tried to make other folk think so know of whom be thinking fancied ada did from face then margaret began story know saith be year forty seven year since annora be professed wherefore be so used mere babe a be knew never then that can tell thee made answer for be queen isabel thrust in father did somewhat to misliking what indeed know not pounced on poor little maid made to suffer for deed be that how be done said margaret then may god pardon more readily than have done for long year hated with force of soul have be cause thereof be past now priest say that man sinneth when having call of god will take cowl upon what then of thrust on whether will never chose habit for year hated a fervently a lay in to hate have choice be given moment of year must have gone back to world instant world voice changed suddenly what be world be enemy of god true will bolt bar wall gate keep out be thing to be found in one city man can escape by journeying to be not rather in own bosom ever with say much of carnal affection be evil creep not into religious house a if man must essay to keep satan angel out of house by painting god name over door love of whatsoever sort say be filthiness of flesh ah how about filthiness of spirit be there pride jealousy in religious house strife envying murmuring rebellion of heart be fairer thing in god sight than natural love of own blood doth call to give up not may not be rather that if there be more true love there be le envy jealousy if there be more harmless liberty there be le murmuring when man take god scourge into hand seems to be apt to wield ill margaret said so shouldst thou make satan cast out satan forbidden love be a ill a strife murmuring forbidden of whom saith god never forbade to love brother sister told to do never forbade to honour father mother to dwell with to tend cherish in old age told to do ay spake of certain that did vainly worship seeing taught learning commandment of men matthew verse vulgate o margaret what art thou saying holy church enjoins vow of religion tell then annora what be holy church be word fill man mouth full comely that know what be be simply soul of righteous men redeemed of christ lord be body be filled with spirit when did enjoin such vow when did righteous men thus band together to make men woman unrighteous by binding command upon be of men not of god margaret sister

margaret saith mother alianora who taught thee that where didst thou hear such learning did not speak chidingly only a if desired information be surprised be not more severe for truly never heard such talk be sorely afraid for poor margaret lest evil thing have got hold of maybe devil in likeness of sister in old convent wave of pain swept over margaret eye when mother alianora said that dreamy look of calm came chased thence where said in burning fiery furnace heated seven time hotter than wont of whom verily think of fourth walked there who be son of god walk oftener methinks in fiery

of perfection never understood if sister ada do be glad to hear must have learned lately understand a sister ada put said a joan eye came to understand what be to give up one will in thing when seems to be contrary to will of god to have more real pleasure in trying to please than in pleasing one self understand too that there may be more true peace in bearing sorrow wherein god help comfort than in having sorrow comfort sister ada seems to mean something different a if one be to be absolutely without will about thing yet to delight in crossing of one will now if have not wall see how be to be

troubled with eye leech think best must no longer be over illumination room be set to manner of work will try sight so be appointed thereto in stead can not say be sorry for will see more of joan since in chamber pass three morning of week mean child joan for verily be child of mine heart very soul yearns over for sister though be can not help thought have not be for queen isabel unjust dealing must have be mother may good lord forgive if be sin know now that deep grey eye of hers with long black lash stirred mine heart so strangely when first came be eye of lost love knew in have known such eye aforetime seemed to be long long ago a though in world much hath joan told of hear set before a man worthy of best love of good woman heart whom mine heart did wrong to in enduring love be coming to think seeing a be dimly through mist that such love be not sin disgrace even in heart of maid devoted unto god for knoweth that put first take ordering of life a being not only a just holy a best lot for that will be most to glory mine own true welfare say not openly unto such a must be likely to misconceive there be to whose pure devoted soul thing indifferent be pure be that will see god man saith in world there be also unto whose vile corrupt heart thing indifferent be impure maybe not in world only by time even in cloister so feel that might misread meaning take ill advantage thereof keep thought to myself to god never ask joan one question touching of whom treasure bye note that uttereth yet know not how be seems to love to tell of be by reason hath loved that heart hath eye to see into mine not much doth joan say of mother to think name more to others methinks see what be good woman a woman go of go ill with little surface cleverness that reckoned to run deeper than did inclined to despise lord by reason wit lay further down came not up in glittering bubble to top dare reckon looked well to bodily comfort such be better wife than might have have very likely better than poor alianora la despenser must have made have god ordered thus methinks from hear that hath passed behind jasper wall pray god may meet there wed not be given in marriage being equal unto angel surely angel love strange talk be that joan held with yesterday marvel what may portend say of late year many priest have put forth writing wherein say that church be greatly fallen away from verity of scripture that through age good men have said same a be case with blessed robert de grosteste bishop of lincoln over two hundred year gone with holy thomas de bradwardine archbishop of canterbury with richard rolle hermit of hampole whose holy meditation on psalter be in library have oft read therein now be there further stir a though reforming of church must arise such a bishop grosteste did earnestly desire joan say lord be earnest for new opinion eager to promote that saith that in church in matter politic men sleep nap for season during slow decay go on apace then at once do wake up set to work to mend matter during reign of present king saith world church have have long nap now be just awake looking round to see how matter be over dust ivy lack cleansing away diver clerk layman be thus bestirring foremost of whom be lord of lancaster king son john of gaunt among lay folk among clergy one father wycliffe note be head of college at oxenford be now rector of lutterworth in leicestershire saith be father wycliffe that thing be thus gone to corruption by reason of lack of salt preservative to be found in holy scripture many year back did king alfred forefather set forth much of said scripture in english tongue a much indeed a have time for death hindered else have holy hook be rendered into english tongue now by reason of year english be in day be gone clean out of mind man can not understand same so there be great need for rendering that man may understand now father wycliffe hope to effect if god grant grace truly marvellous strange notion hath joan say must fain do away with endowing of church saying that lord apostle have such provision be that by reason be right because of hardness of men heart surely holy woman ministered to of substance did well not ill moreover must have monkery done away yea clean out of realm hath mighty hard name for monk especially mendicant friar yet of nun be never heard to speak unkindly word strange matter in good sooth nearly take away breath to hear tell of when saith that pope must have right power in realm of england be what church of england hath alway held bishop grosteste did a fervently abhor pope power egyptian bondage be word for much have father also to say against simony must have private confession to priest verily must gladly see abolished indulgence letter of fraternity pilgrimage guild set face against new fashion of singing mass intoning then new invention use of incense in church strangest of be to hear of inveighing against doctrine of church that sacred host be god be body be so saith in figure christ body be not eaten of men save ghostly morally to eat christ ghostly be to have mind of how kindly suffered for man be ghostly meat to soul arnold english work of wycliffe volume page here be new doctrine yet father wycliffe hear saith be old doctrine of apostle that contrary be new having never saith be heard of before time of one radbert who did first set forth five hundred year ago in after that slumbered being then condemned of holy doctor till year of lord god when pope that then be forced on church strange matter know not what to think joan say of new doctrine priest go further than father wycliffe even cast doubt on purgatory worship word then merely meant honour of lady ah if can prove from god word that purgatory be not must chant many thanksgiving thereon year when knew not if lost love be dead alive have thought with dread of awful land of darkness sorrow yet not knowing must have mass sung for have be so able must never have told for whom be only have asked for for father mother christian soul have offered mine own communion with intention thereto ay many time dare confess have offered same with intent if must be to god commanded dead knowing that god knew humbly trusting in mercy if did ill for worship of lady be passing strange specially to that be religious woman for be always taught what blessing be that have woman to whom might carry grief sorrow seeing god be man not so like to enter into woman feeling priest say be almost afraid to write be dishonouring christ who died for who therefore must need be full of tenderness for for whom died can not need man woman not even own mother to stand betwixt o lord have be year dishonouring thee setting up even though be thy blessed mother between thee yet surely regardeth honour full diligently said not to saint john behold thy mother doth not that apostle represent whole church who be thereby commanded to regard righteous man a own very mother be teaching of church of rome remember blessed hermit of hampole scarcely make mention of be christ in book if be so of joan ensures in word of god whereof hath read book have missed verily know not what to think lord thou wist what be error save therefrom thou wist what be truth guide therein must seem have erred in offering communion at for if to eat christ body be only to have mind of be according to own word hoc facite in meam commemorationem how then can there be at offering of sacrifice in holy mass joan say that saint paul epistle to hebrew saith that be hallowed by oblation of body of jesus christ once that where remission be there be more oblation for sin truly have need to pray lord guide into thy truth yet more lord keep therein must think hereon in sooth do then up rise great barrier to new doctrine lay before joan a quickly a sun can break forth melt spoonful of snow doe clear away with word of saint paul have epistle right at tongue end for instance quoth christ said must bestow holy spirit to lead church into truth how then can church err what church said boldly church be righteous men hold christ word not pope cardinal such like last have right to hold first in bondage said benedict told saint paul bade religious to obey superior how much more men to obey church marvel saith where father benedict found that never word say paul touching religious person there be none in day religious in paul day cried never so much a one saith not monk not nun friar pareshull told so much be great man among saint peter bid clergy not to dominate over inferior saint paul say to ephesian that out of be speaking to clergy must arise heretic speaking perversely saint john say believe not spirit prove spirit if be of god ' dear mother annora be nowhere bidden in scripture to obey church save only once that concern settling of dispute betwixt two member of obey church why be church have not father rolle taught so much holy kirk ' be ilk righteous man soul ' verily church be empowered of christ to make law for own people why then must church of england obey law made by bishop of rome therein said can fully hold with thee for thing said earnestly let hold to god law take interpretation of not from men straight from god lo here be promise of holy ghost assured unto church to to to one followeth christ that keep word be indwelt of spirit dear mother be church of god to be truth promised said nought for knew not what to answer there be yet thing saith joan dropping voice low can that be god church contradicts god word david saith over thing thou hast magnified thy name note have heard of most wise man must read ancient volume dead tongue saint hierome set not down true word namely over thy name thou hast magnified thy word now if be so if god hath set up word over name very highest part of how dare assemblage of men to gainsay what then of indulgence licence to sin pope set forth what of suffering to wed whom god have forbidden forbidding to priest to whom god have suffered surely be very thing god point at teaching for doctrine commandment of men joan said dear heart did not lord say whatsoever ye will bind on earth will be bound in heaven ' surely that authorises church to do a will contrary unto god word may give leave to do will within limit of word trow not contrary thereto when king giveth plenipotentiary power to keeper of great seal own deposing superseding reckon be not among thing be subject unto christ ' saith paul doubtless excepting did subject thing unto ' so if god give power of loosing binding to church can not be meant that will bind who thus endowed contrary to own will law answered nought again for little while at last said joan there be word trouble religious folk be always quoting if man hate not father mother so forth can not be lord disciple think have heard from one week since came here what say new doctrine folk that mean ours be old doctrine mother dear saith a old a apostle of christ what mean why go forth to end will see what mean be to hate own soul also be then to kill to go wilfully into perdition nay what can mean only that even dearest worthiest love be to be set below worthier than love of glory of god that lord never meant religious person must neglect father mother be plainly to be seen by word of wherein rebuke priest of day because taught that man might bestow in oblation to god what father mother need demanded of here again reproves because rejected command of god in order to keep own tradition see therefore that when church doth be not ratified in heaven then said after minute thought be not bidden to hate more than relation why must hate one whom god loveth answered to hate selfishness be not to hate sat while silent setting red eye golden claw to green wyvern joan ran white dot along griffin tail when came to fork of tail laid down brush mother saith dear grey eye looking up into face will read together holy scripture beseech god to lead into truth dear child will do so said joan didst thou ever read in holy scripture that be wicked to kiss folk smiled have read there of one saith who stole up behind holiest of men that ever breathed kissed foot rebuke won from be more than many sin be forgiven loved much ' so if full sinful woman might kiss christ without rebuke methinks if please mother dear might kiss well knew life of woman never thought of way

coming reformation be in air pamphlet be so often wrongly attributed to wycliffe last age of church have be written fifteen year before time wycliffe though then political reformer did not come forward a religious reformer until about six year later note psalm verse vulgate authorised version correctly follows hebrew thou hast magnified thy word above thy name part three chapter waiting if must push ajar gate of life stand within god working see must interpret doubt strife for mystery must find key not to day then be content poor heart god plan like lily pure white unfold must not tear

when came out from chapel after vesper lady commanded sister gaillarde to follow rest of went of course to work room where sister gaillarde joined in about hour saw that looked a though have heard something greatly amused must know nothing till reached recreation room minute tongue be loosed sister ada attacked sister gaillarde a to what lady wanted with with one of grim smile sister gaillarde replied lady be about to resign office storm of exclamation greeted news why sister do tell why find said sister gaillarde gravely burden of official duty too heavy marvel what reckons to be quoth sister joan who though not sarcastic in style of sister gaillarde can now then say biting thing so far a ever made out duty be to sit on cushion bid other folk work exactly be too much labour for of will be chosen in stead marvel said sister ada briskly trust may be one who will look better to house than present lady have done amen said sister gaillarde with mischievous air hope will be sister joan truly hope not answered sister for if such honour came way expect not must feel duty to decline on account of failing sight then see sister quoth sister ada quickly to vote for mother joan must be to good must be little good to vote for mother ada heard voice whisper behind replied think will warrant feel little doubt that sister gaillarde will be one chosen one of four be most likely to be sub prioress be oftener chosen than rest sister gaillarde methinks must make good prioress have scarcely recovered from surprise have not half finished talk when bell rang for compline silence fell on busy tongue young sister postulant be eager to catch glimpse of father mortimer saw good deal of talk pas from eye to eye in few minute before service began sings full well be most seemly in ordering of matter if be a discreet in confessional a in outer ministration methinks will like well howbeit made deal le impression than must have done before lady intention be announced when filed out of chapel assembled again in recreation room tongue be set loose must see that main stream of talk ran on lady only one here there diverging to father mortimer sought out joan asked if new confessor be kin to must not tell beyond saying that have three uncle several cousin in priesthood since saving uncle walter have never seen of must not speak certainly without asking marvel have not seen margaret

conclave master with for election of new prioress after mass of holy ghost mother went round to gather up vote fell a looked sister gaillarde be elected in house there be only nine that voted otherwise of four be for sister joan two for sister ismania one for sister ada isabel feel sure that mine be margaret joan say be certain sister ada be own voted a before for sister gaillarde for truly think fittest of for place ordination fallow next week verily said sister ada next time be at recreation do marvel at sister gaillarde manner of taking election not one word of humility obedience just took a if be right be most suitable person why be obedience be not responded sister ismania obedience might be be not lowliness said sister ada tartly if have be elect of course mean expected thing not for moment must have knelt down kissed chapel floor protested sense of utter unworthiness incapacity for office sister isabel who sat by said in low voice maybe of sister must have agreed with though felt constrained to give look of remonstrance must say thought with sister ada a prioress must have be sore infliction now sister gaillarde came forward think sister ada have known be there to judge from change of colour sister ada said be one of surface observer who always fancy people feel what say let answer once for who think with a sinner before god do feel mine unworthiness even to lowest depth be bound to humble for sin not least for pride must fain think few small a for incapacity feel that will not say what feel think quite capable of governing house say a well a might do a well a most must do must be falsehood affectation to pretend otherwise suppose in condemning hypocrisy lord did not mean that while must not profess to be better than be may make number of profession tell number of falsehood in order to appear worse than be may be notion of holiness suffer to say be not notion of honesty mean to try do duty if of sister think be not doing will confer favour on if will not talk over with other sister come straight to room tell so promise to consider such rebuke honestly a before god if on meditation prayer find have be wrong will confess to if think that be simply done out of spite impertinence that sister will have penance set hope now understand other beg prayer of may rule in fear of god showing partiality want of sympathy walking in right way keeping house pure from sin sister ada made answer whatever sister ismania said with much feeling suffer mother to answer for younger sister trust mother will pardon if be over ready sure be that majority of sister will consent to reply will indeed pray that may have grace of perseverance in good work will strive to obey holy direction in right path ask sister who will promise same to say placet ' there be storm of placets in response unless be mistaken sister ada sister roberga be silent be while be answering placet caught sight of margaret face what have happened to make look thus white wan with expressive eye so full of tear behind must not must not shed sat in pain whole day until evening more because seemed rather to avoid at night when have parted be quiet in dormitory very faint rap came at door of cell bade applicant enter in peace margaret presented annora said hesitating timidly knew what that meant come to little sister said came forward at once closing door behind knelt down at foot then buried face in hand laid face hand upon knee let weep sobbed oh let weep for few moment in silence speak to kept silence wept till heart be relieved when at last sob grew quiet brushed tear away looked up bless thee annora have done good be something to have somebody who will say little sister give one leave to weep in peace dost thou know what trouble not in least dear margaret that something be troubling thee have seen can not guess what be will get over now said be only reopening of old wound thou hast not guessed then who father mortimer be margaret ay god have given roland back to yet have not given be twenty year since parted be no longer young hope foolish can venture now to journey on on opposite side of way without being afraid of loving other more than god there can hardly be much of road left now when be over child will meet in safe fellowship of father home for ever dost thou know annora dear be almost surprised to find quite so childish thought must have borne such meeting a calmly a one else a calmly a did there be little break in voice always have more self control than only dare not confess to for own sake must be tempted to partiality to too much severity in order to avoid must content with father benedict when want roland teaching blessed word none ever gave to wilt thou give leave to tell thee so that thou mayest submit matter to in thine own confession willingly agreed to be sorry for poor child father benedict be terribly particular severe think father mortimer must scarcely be more so however hard be trying not to be partial can not help little doubt whether love have lasted like hers sweet saint mary what be saying do not know that sister priest in house must be awfully shocked to know thing must be be better must not yet poor child house no longer hold sister mother gaillarde be now lady prioress having be ordained enthroned afternoon must say ceremony of vowing obedience felt to le not more than simple placet other day seemed to come red hot from heart spake sister chosen to succeed a mother be sister ismania be glad of for be certainly fittest for place mother joan becomes senior mother new prioress doe not let grass grow under foot be very different from predecessor during first week after appointment such quantity of household article began to pour in whereof in sooth stood in grievous need that

sister ada lost temper early sorely bewailed hard lot in having first to carry find room for thing secondly to use old way have suited well enough must not think what lady wanted with mopping scouring even sister joan said little sarcastically that thought lady must be preparing for possibility of having to stand siege lady who heard behind back smiled grim smile went on doe not keep in own room like last prioress be here there where of sister who be indolently inclined dislike rule exceedingly for think in truth have be going along too easily be glad to see rein tightened horse admonished to be somewhat brisker yet can not say that can always keep pace with lady at time be aware of feeling of being driven on faster than can go without being out of breath perhaps risking fall little occasional rest must certainly be relief howbeit life be working day there will be time to rest in heaven joan tell that have have talk with father mortimer find that mother be cousin being only son of grandfather brother sir john de mortimer who died young in tilt yard note be strange passing strange that margaret must have be drawn to one nephew daughter of men who be deadly enemy from what joan saith can gather that grandfather of hers must have be very evil man in many way love not to hear of evil thing men do somewhat check when speaks on head be not for eating of tree of knowledge of good evil that first father be turned out of paradise yet psalmist speaks of god a that teacheth man knowledge will ask father mortimer to explain when confess time be not far off now when child joan must leave shrink from a draw near must either that be one of must go back to world yet can be seeing be wedded wife mother for be not very carnal affection religious person be bidden to root out of heart yet apostle saint john saith be to love brother how can do be lawful to love only so long a love not one above lord have beloved disciple surely one own mother must ever be more to daughter than

certainly orwell for on second of king have ordered ship of thirty tun weight to assemble there moreover queen must not possibly march from orwell at once to bury harwich since to face one must have turned back on other probability seems to be that came ashore somewhere in orwell haven whether first visited harwich bury be difficult to judge natural supposition must be that remained quiet for
