artist sense though be not endowed with singular charm of manner characterised sister chronicler tell that younger princess marjory be woman of marvellous beauty yet something more attractive than mere beauty must have distinguished princess margaret for two men of most opposite disposition to have borne image on heart till death for husband man capable of abject superstition with hot headed youth far behind to have braved thunder of rome rather than put away royal sister have singular history father king william have put for education into hand of king john of england queen isabelle of angouleme when be little more than infant in other word have committed tender dove to charge of almost worst man woman whom must have selected there be just two vice of english majesty be not guilty

henry while testily maintained to alexander that have done all promised further claim must be established against yet a history show never to last hour pardoned hubert de burgh for marriage with scottish princess most bitterly reproached for depriving of whom have intended to make queen truth seems to be that third who at time of margaret marriage be only lad of thirteen year have cherished for fervent boyish passion that be only woman whom ever really loved hubert at time regent probably never imagined thing of kind while to margaret stately maiden of twenty year if not more sentimental courtship of schoolboy of thirteen must probably be source of amusement rather than sympathy at turn in after life henry showed that have never forgiven slight put on affection be true that affection be of somewhat odd type presenting obstacle to aspersing character of lady love when found convenient to point moral by so doing of men who ever lived surely one of most consistently inconsistent be

velvet settle margaret drew footstool to aunt side took up position there resting head caressingly on marjory knee three whole year aunt marjory that have not be near must make stay away so long there be reason magot two princess exchanged smile again there be amusement in of countess while expression of sister be rather sad margaret looked from one to other a if must have liked to understand what

intent for few minute two girl for aunt be only about twelve year senior sat silent margaret having drawn aunt hand down rested cheek upon be very fond of one being so near in age have be brought up so much like sister except in one two item treated other a such did not assume respective authority reverence usual between such relation at time beyond employment of deferential by margaret familiar thou by marjory chatted to other a other girl might have done just then for few minute neither spoke well magot said marjory breaking silence at last have nought to say to other thou art forgetting think that want full account of three year since came to see thee before have not be empty of event know be answer be groan empty said fair aunt must have be rather than full of such event a be father nicholas saith that old roman greek know used to say man be happy who have history be sure must have be happier lately if have not have know ' what heedless magot why fair aunt surely expect people to recollect lesson did ever remember yours marjory laughed sufficiently so hope to know difference between greek roman however for last three year tell about be to begin with flood like professional chronicler well think conquest must be soon enough delicious aunt marjory how many weary century excuse how many magot oh please how can possibly tell if really want to know will send for father nicholas marjory laughed kissed lively face turned up to idle magot well go on think be idle fair aunt do detest learning date well now be in april left know be very soon after lady of cornwall be married remember exactly what month be in may said marjory shortly may be oh know be eve of saint helen day well thing went on right enough till lord of canterbury took into head that lord father have business to detain tunbridge castle began with that be about july think thought tunbridge castle belonged to lord of gloucester what have to do with o aunt marjory have forgotten that young lord of gloucester be in ward to lord father lord king gave first to lord bishop of winchester when father died then about year after took away from bishop gave to fair father remember pretty boy think knew about at time very likely did magot one forgets thing sometimes margaret looking up into fair face saw did not understand hidden pain behind smile so lord of canterbury complained of fair father to lord king wonder must not attend to own business lord king said that a lord of gloucester held in chief of crown vacant trust be to give a pleased then aunt marjory do like priest magot what question do priest be not alike dear child be like other people good bad surely priest ought to be good art thou always what thou oughtest to be magot be answer be sudden spring from stool fervent hug of marjory aunt marjory said when have sat down again just hate bishop of winchester peter de rievaulx always one of two chief enemy of margaret father shocking magot oh yes of course be extremely wicked do wish be here to set thee penance for naughty speech however go on with thy story well what do think fair aunt lord grace of canterbury richard grant consecrated in did actually excommunicated intruder on land of jurisdiction who must hold communication with king only excepted away went to rome to lay matter before holy father of course must tell tale from own point of view archbishop went to rome indeed did aunt marjory fair father be very indignant that head of english church must not stand by must seek approbation of foreign bishop be what said think fair mother agreed with perhaps in nineteenth century scarcely realise gallant fight made by church of england to retain independence of rome did not begin at reformation a people be apt to suppose be a old a church herself be a old a apostle of clergy be perpetually trying to force to rivet chain of rome upon body of laity who be really church resisted attempt almost to death there be perpetual struggle greater smaller according to circumstance between king of england papacy pope after pope endeavoured to fill english see benefice with italian priest king after king braved wrath by refusing to confirm appointment apostle be ready to allow pope to be sovereign legislator never doctrine must accept at hand must not rule over secular ecclesiastical liberty quarrel between second becket be entirely on point wonder that rome canonised man who thus exalted king who stood out most firmly for liberty of england be second john edward first second richard second partly explains reason why history of monk be mainly author have so little good to say of of edward first only excepted be not easy to say why exception be made unless be because be too firmly rooted in popular admiration perhaps little too munificent to monastic order for much evil to be discreetly said of coeur de lion be gallio who cared for none of thing henry third played into hand of pope to day of anglican church to morrow edward third held balance a nearly even a possible struggle revived faintly during reign of henry sixth war of rose turned men mind to home affair henry seventh be obedient servant of holiness so battle went on till culminated in reformation who have never entered into question who assume that englishman be papist until have idea how gallantly church fought for independent life how often flung from off iron grasp of oppressor be not probable that princess whose father have followed rule of columba lay buried in protestant iona must have roman tendency on question marjory be a warm a one must have wished well then margaret went on horrid bishop of winchester oh fie said aunt came back to england in august aunt marjory be use be horrid hate hate fair father do expect to love well done magot said voice when want lawyer to plead cause will send for thee christ save fair sister heard be here with piece of enthusiasm girl rose to greet earl margaret courtesying low a beseemed daughter be very evident that so far a outside appearance went margaret be only child of mother earl hubert be scarcely so tall a wife have bronzed swarthy complexion with dark hair though short be strongly built well proportioned eye be dark small quick exceedingly bright have when needful ready eloquent tongue very pleasant smile yet eloquent a undoubtedly must be be not usually man of many word capable a be of very deep lasting affection be not demonstrative soft caressing manner of princess margaret be not in husband line at be given to calling spade spade whenever have occasion to mention article if preferred to allude to a agricultural implement for trituration of soil be disposed to laugh good humouredly at epithet though dearly loved silver voice used thoroughly representative man of time be hubert de burgh earl of kent be one of person who leave deep mark upon age be purely self made man have pedigree indeed know with absolute certainty who be father though modern genealogist have amused by making pedigree for to there be real evidence that have least claim yet of wife for be four time married first be heiress second baron widow third countess in own right divorced queen last princess public life have begun by conducting negotiation to satisfaction of coeur de lion in first year of reign when in probability hubert be little over twenty year of age from moment rose rapidly merely to enumerate title bore must almost take page be by turn very rich man very poor one according a royal capricious master made revoked grant religious character of hubert be not matter of speculation of certainty be what contemporary considered elevated piety most singular mixture of barest basest superstition with very strong plain common sense superstition be of style set forth in famous spanish drama entitled devotion of cross true roman type of piety though to protestant mind of nineteenth century seems almost inconceivable hero of play who be represented a tinctured with nearly crime humanity can commit have miracle performed in favour go comfortably to heaven after on account of devotion to cross innocent reader must not suspect least connection between devotion atonement wrought upon cross simply mean that whenever eusebio see shape of cross in hilt of sword pattern of woman dress two stick thrown upon one stop in midst of sin may be committing in form by word gesture express devotion of type be hubert religion notion of spirituality be to grasp pix with one hand to hold crucifix in other kept nicely balanced account at bank of heaven in be historical heaviest deposit be fact that have many year before saved large crucifix from flame idea that action be not most pious meritorious must have be in hubert eye rank heresy yet might have known better psalter lay open to have be acquainted with other syllable of revelation must alone have given very different conception of spiritual religion athwart singular notion of excellence hubert good common sense be perpetually gleaming like lightning across dark moor else man be be slave of rome be supported by probably at instigation that king john have sent lofty message to pope that italian priest must tithe toll in dominion be when administration lay in hand that parliament refused to comply with demand of pope till be seen what other kingdom must do papal aggression be successful in england so long a hubert be in power to reverse famous phrase of lord denbigh hubert be catholic if please englishman first truer englishman at once loyalist patriot never man be than well described by one of english people a most faithful noble hubert who so often saved england from ravage of foreigner restored england to herself stood by throne bearing aloft banner of england in three especially dark perilous day when man stood there to alone under providence owe that england did not become vassal province of france most amply be fidelity put to test most unspotted emerged from ordeal most heavy be debt of gratitude owed alike by england king that debt be paid in sense to uttermost farthing in what manner of coin be discharged be about to see note patent roll henry third dated york june note in octave of holy trinity may june at alnwick robert extract from fine roll note terrible fact have be strangely ignored by many modern historian rot exit michs henry third note drug deadens sensibility of vivisector by rendering victim incapable of sound motion not affecting nerve of sensation in least note be in when story begin english diminutive of margaret be doubtless derived from french margot note reader who be inclined to doubt be requested to consult act fifteen be unquestionably teaching of new testament clergy form part of church merely a individual christian chapter two what do lack if pestilence stalk through land ye say be god doing be not also doing when aphis creepeth on rosebud martin f tupper earl hubert be far too busy man to waste time in lounging on velvet settle exchanging sally of wit with lady of household have done little more than give cordial welcome to marjory pat margaret on head when again disappeared to be seen more until supper time well magot said marjory sitting down in chair while margaret a before accommodated with footstool at foot let get on with thy story want to know about affair two year ago thy fair father look wonderfully well methinks considering that have gone through doe not o aunt marjory scarcely know how be to tell about that be dreadful dreadful tear stood in big drop on margaret eyelash well will try said with deep sigh a marjory stroked hair in first place year ended very well fair father have be created justiciary of ireland for life constable of tower various favour have be granted to that must be on brink of trouble such trouble be very last thing thought of by one of then that bishop of winchester came back before soul knew anything about be high in lord king favour on twenty ninth of july be not likely to forget date blow fell be dismissed then be not from office without word of warning dismissed degraded without shadow of string of most cruel wicked accusation brought against thing that never did dreamed of doing aunt marjory make blood boil only to remember be not going to tell there be one too horrid to mention know maiden marjory interposed rather hastily have heard already of king henry delicate affectionate assault upon fair name of margaret mother did not wish for repetition of beyond of what do think be accused have not heard other article magot then will tell first of preventing lord king marriage with duke of austria daughter by telling duke that king be lame blind deaf leper gently magot gently said marjory laughing be not making syllable of fair aunt that be wicked treacherous man not worthy of love alliance of noble lady pure foy know must say if said just what think be sometimes quite a well not to do magot have perhaps be when one may get into prison by be comfort one can always think pope king can stop that magot dear child oh yes know think be horribly imprudent aunt marjory nobody hears except eva de braose be only person in wardrobe there be one in ante chamber a have heard say more than did just now suppose there be much harm done then secondly charged fair father with stealing only think stealing magical gem from royal treasury made wearer victorious in battle sending to prince of wale llywelyn great with whom king henry be at war why must suppose must do pure foy aunt marjory ask then thirdly said be margaret sprang from footstool suddenly disappeared for second through door of wardrobe marjory heard say eva have completely forgotten till minute to tell marie that lady mother desired to finish piece of tapestry to night if can do go look for let know will not have time slight rustle a of one leaving room be audible then margaret dashed back to footstool a if too have not minute to lose know aunt marjory must not tell next thing with eva listening said that be by traitorous letter from fair father that prince of wale have caused sir william de braose to be hung eva father thou meanest yes then accused of administering poison to lord of salisbury of sending cousin sir raymond to try force lady of salisbury into marrying while lord be beyond sea of poisoning lord of pembroke sir fulk de breaut sometime lord of canterbury grace might have spent life in poisoning body then lastly said have obtained favour of lord king by help of black art marjory smiled contemptuously be not because be more free from superstition than other people simply because knew full well that only sorcery necessary to be used towards henry third be sorcery of strong mind over weak one note be rather unfortunate said that good lord of salisbury whom god rest be seized with last illness very day after have supped at fair brother table aunt marjory cried indignant niece why be not month since be taken ill in night after have supped likewise do suppose poisoned be quite possible that walnut might have something to do with magot did say poisoned one now aunt marjory be laughing at because know like think be absurd way in people insist on fancying poisoned whenever be ill look a if human being be monster of wickedness what must father warner say be magot oh must say be perfectly true must be right so far a lord of winchester few more be concerned well eva hast thou found marie yes dear be with lady be busy with tapestry oh be right be sorry forgot lady bade tell thee mignonne that be coming to thy bower shortly with pedlar who be waiting in court to choose stuff for thy whitsuntide robe pedlar delightful aunt marjory be sure want something marjory laughed want thy tale finished magot before pedlar come too long dear aunt marjory unless pedlar take summer to mount stair know lord father fled into sanctuary at merton abbey refused to leave unless lord king must pledge royal word for safety think must have thought made much difference wonder if pedlar have silversmith work lord king did not pledge word ordered lord mayor citizen to fetch fair father only think of aunt marjory dead alive of nobler citizen appealed to bishop who be everything with king just then instead of interceding for fair father a asked merely confirmed order so twenty thousand citizen marched on abbey when fair father knew that fled to high altar embraced holy cross with one hand holding blessed pix in other be lord in pix inquired marjory meaning of course to refer to consecrated wafer be not sure fair aunt however thing turned out better than seemed likely for not only bishop of chichester even lord of chester fair father great enemy interceded with lord king in behalf heard that lord of chester spoke very plainly to told not only that must find easier to draw crowd together than to get rid of again also that fickleness must scandalise world lord king allowed to say that yes have great effect upon think people who be fickle like others to see do think that pedlar will have sendal silk stuff of extremely fine quality of india thine eye half thy tongue be in pedlar pack magot can not tell thee just let know how ended thy fair father be set free oh did not end for ever so long lord grace of dublin got leave for to come home see fair mother after when have gone into essex king sent after again sir godfrey de craucumbe took away to tower sent for smith to put in fetter man must not do when heard who be to wear fetter said must rather die than be man to put chain on most faithful noble hubert who so often saved england from ravage of foreigner restored england to herself ' aunt marjory think be grand fellow must have kissed if have be there a kiss be at time common form of greeting between men woman for lady to offer kiss to man a token that approved word action be not then considered more demonstrative than must be to shake hand now be in fact not unusual occurrence fair father told pursued margaret when heard what smith said must not help thinking of word of lord when thanked god that mission have be hidden from wise revealed to ignorant for ' lord said to thee god do commit cause for mine enemy have risen against note took to tower of london yes bishop of london be very angry at violation of sanctuary insisted that fair father must be sent back threatened king with excommunication of course frightened sent back to church whence be taken commanded sheriff of essex to surround church so that must neither escape obtain food fair father true friend good old lord of dublin be right aunt marjory priest be not alike interposed begged lord king to do to what have thought to do to lord father lord king then offered choice of three thing lord father must either abjure kingdom for ever must be perpetually imprisoned must openly confess traitor fair choice surely horrid be chose banishment did not said if king willed be content to go out of england for time not for ever traitor must never confess for have never be one word of true man said marjory splendid then eva be that pedlar never coming up lord king found out that fair father have laid up treasure in temple actually accused of taking fraudulently from royal treasury summoned to resign fair father replied must have done that all have be at king pleasure sent order to master of temple accordingly then o aunt marjory be too long tale to tell want that pedlar do think be shame after for lord king to profess to compassionate lord father to say that have be faithful to lord king john of happy memory note also to lord king richard whom god pardon therefore notwithstanding ill usage of harm have done kingdom must rather pardon fair father than execute for ' said must rather be accounted remiss king than man of blood ' well that doe not sound bad magot oh word be very nice thing aunt marjory lord king henry can string very prettily together have patience say eva do go peep into court see what be becoming of snail of pedlar be in hall eating drinking margaret well be sure have have a much a be good for so then aunt marjory fair father be sent to devizes many noble became surety for lord of cornwall king brother among others while be there heard of death of great enemy lord of chester then said lord be merciful to be man by own doing yet never did good where must work harm ' set

entirely different type from of christian around complexion be olive hair raven black eye large dark now melting a if in liquid light now brilliant full of fire if margaret looked two year beyond real age belasez looked more like seven thou knowest wherefore thou art come hither asked countess smiling complacently on vision before to broider for lady said belasez in low clear musical voice wilt thou obey order will obey lady in thing not forbidden by holy law well think will agree maid returned countess whose private view respecting religious tolerance be something quite extraordinary for

rather than face methinks can not see into damsel heart in one minute must think be not at difficult to love want body to love said margaret love body if damsel must permit to counsel love body by mean let want body to love why not because fear damsel will meet with disappointment oh hate to be disappointed hast thou brought thine image with thee to margaret question sounded most natural in first place must not conceive idea of prayer without something visible to pray to in second have be taught that jew saracen be idolater be surprised to see blood rush to belasez dark cheek fire flash from eye will damsel allow to ask what mean understand wilt thou not want to say thy prayer whilst thou art here responded margaret who be at least a much puzzled a belasez most certainly not to image oh do jew sometimes pray without image doe damsel take for idolater yes be always told so said margaret looking astonished fire died out of belasez eye saw that margaret have simply made innocent mistake from sheer ignorance of question damsel have be misinformed israelite hold image to be wicked abhorrent to holy law then thou wilt not want to set up idol for thyself anywhere most assuredly not hope have not vexed thee said margaret ingenuously did not know damsel did not vex a soon a saw that did not know wouldst thou not like better to be christian than jew demanded margaret who must not imagine possibility of feeling on belasez part regarding nationality except of regret humiliation answer though came in single syllable be unmistakable intense pride passionate devotion to own creed people deepest scorn loathing for others combined to make up tone of belasez how very odd exclaimed margaret looking at with expression of great astonishment upon own fair open feature be odd to damsel doe know what question sounded like to tell must not like better to be villein scullion maid than to be daughter of noble lord of kent ' jew be not noble cried margaret gazing in bewilderment from belasez to doucebelle a if expected one of to help out of puzzle not in world estimate answered belasez there be one above world before margaret must reply deep bass ding dong of great dinner

always brings discomfort to possessor knew instinctively in moment that levina be likely to be enemy be true levina be prey to green eyed monster sport with misery of humanity have be best broideress in castle until day now felt suddenly supplanted by young thing of barely more than half age experience who be called in forsooth to do something be imagined that levina must not do what business have countess to suppose there be thing must not do to want something out of power to provide be there slightest likelihood thought levina flaring up that scrap of creature must work better than mere chit of child levina be past thirty with complexion like fire brick levina resembled putty hair colour of nasty sloe levina be that of tiger lily great staring eye like horn lantern countess be most unreasonable levina most cruelly outraged of woman have ever held needle since useful instrument be originally invented levina did not put unparalleled wrong into word must have be easier for belasez to get on with if have done so held head up snorted like impatient horse a stalked through door into ante chamber be where thou art to be snapped in staccato tone amount of personal slight scorn be merely what belasez have be accustomed to receive from christian ever since have left cradle disdain of levina therefore though must hardly enjoy made far le impression on than unaccountable kindliness of royal lady lady bade ask what thou wouldst eat demanded levina in same tone a before thank thee thing have not have life what be for came in shorter snap than ever must not be kosher speak sense what doe vermin mean mean must not be killed according to law suppose be what then then must not eat stupid silly ridiculous stuff may be put in pie if know what lady be thinking about when brought in such road dirt a damsel set above forsooth must have meat served according to law that nobody ever heard of least of lord king noble council must have table set for by a though be sick queen pray noble countess must eat in gold silver how many varlet will serve to carry dainty meat be sweet grace served upon knee must fain have thing done a may pleasure right noble lady belasez answered a usually disposed of similar affront by treating a if be offered in genuine courtesy with faint ring of satire beneath tone thank must prefer wood pewter if please must think one varlet might answer be never served upon knee yet will scarcely be necessary now levina gave second stronger snort disappeared down stair in few minute made reappearance carrying in one hand plate of broiled ham in other piece of extremely dry rather mouldy bread here be gracious damsel first course fulk le especer be so good a to tell that folk of sort be mighty fond of ham so took great care to bring there will be sauce with next that there must be sauce of one specie with course served to in house belasez be beginning to feel doubt yet however levina chose to behave to young jewess maintained own dignity quietly put aside plate of ham cutting off mouldy piece ate dry bread without complaint belasez kindly generous nature be determined that countess who have be so much kinder to than at time christian usually be to jew must hear murmuring word from unless came to actual starvation levina sauce presented unmistakably with second course proved to be piece of apple pie swimming in strongest vinegar though must have set teeth on edge belasez consumed pie in silence avoiding vinegar so far a must entertained while did so by levina assurance that delighted to see how completely belasez enjoyed third article according to levina be cheese first mouthful be enough to convince persecuted jewess soft soap must have be more correct epithet quietly let alone have chetife be sadly in fear that sweetest damsel doe not like suffolk cheese said levina in most doleful tone be manufactured in county asked belasez very coolly for in soap be of foreign importation thought tasted more like french make levina vanished down stair suppressed laughter be quite audible came up again with two more plate informed belasez that constituted last course one of be filled with chicken bone picked exceedingly clean other with piece of sweet cake over have be poured very hot saline compound by mean harmonised with cake set belasez throat on fire managed however to eat thinking that must get little food of kind if did not levina departed with plate remarking that have done good to see excellent meal belasez have made be relief to girl to be left alone for solitude have terror for levina be certainly not enjoyable companion after hour quiet margaret eva entered ante chamber hast thou dined belasez asked margaret kindly thank damsel yes did levina bring thee such dish a thou mightest eat according to law oh yes be rather relief to belasez that question took that form then be right said margaret innocently passed on into own room countess step be heard approaching just before entering stopped at head of stair thou hast given girl dinner levina oh yes lady what have brought apple pie if please lady cheese gateau de dijon ham few other little thing must not touch ham scarcely cheese thou hast forgotten levina told thee meat of kind fish believe jew will touch ham did not know objected to cheese have enough apple pie gateau de dijon make poor dinner without questioning levina further countess went on addressed belasez direct maid hast thou fared well fear levina did not bring thee proper thing belasez hesitated be very unwilling to say how must in conscience say yes be according to law thank lady ham under gracious leave must decline thou didst not take cheese with lady leave be not in accordance with thy law didst thou not like if lady will pardon said poor belasez driven into corner did not like kind be levina said be suffolk cheese belasez conscience rather smote in giving answer ah responded unconscious countess be often hard everybody doe not like know belasez be silent beyond slight reverence to show that heard observation hast thou have enough pursued countess still unsatisfied be greatly obliged to lady quite ready to serve be evasive reply countess looked hard at belasez said more despatched levina for scarf be to be copied gave young jewess instruction exquisite work grew in belasez skilful hand evidently delighted countess be extremely kind reserved sensitive nature of belasez went out towards in fervent love to margaret jewish broideress be object of equal mystery interest must sit watching work for long period noticed that belasez ignored existence of private oratory made reverence to gilded virgin stood on bracket in wardrobe passed benitier without vouchsafing least attention to holy water manifestly jew did not believe in gilded image holy water then in what did believe have faith in thing belasez have owned to saying prayer acknowledged existence of law felt bound to obey whose law be to whom did pray thought seethed in margaret brain till at last one afternoon when sat watching embroidery burst forth into speech belasez what must damsel belasez what dost thou believe jewess looked up in surprise be not sure that understand damsel question will condescend to explain mean what god dost thou worship there be one god answered belasez solemnly that believe too worship same god do think do to certain extent there be difference between be difference belasez seemed to hesitate be afraid speak out said margaret eagerly if say what lady must not approve must be right in lady mother will not mind go on damsel think difference touch who be sent of god son of blessed believe in a well a believe that be yet to come be to be salvation of israel believe belasez word came slowly a if dragged from that be come long ago think will save men be lord christ surely said margaret call so be belasez reply did come said margaret in puzzled tone man came undoubtedly who claimed to be man who be to come be claim true one have always be told that be have always be told that be not then how be to find out be true belasez spread hand out with semi eastern gesture indicated hopeless incapacity of sort damsel ask holy prophet told father of old time so long a israel walked contrary to holy one so long must wander over earth forsaken exile be punished seven time for sin be not exile be not punishing holy beautiful house be desolation land be overthrown by stranger yet be idolater be sabbath breaker profane name of blessed do think never ask for what sin be that be thus cast away from presence of king in old day be always for such sin a have named can not be that now be o abraham father can be that have come king of israel have not known damsel there be thousand of son of israel have asked that question then belasez stopped suddenly go on urged margaret what then will say what damsel will not wish to hear if do go on wish very much to hear then look around on who call yourselves servant of whom ye say be come ask to tell have learned of ye answer with very thing king of israel solemnly forbade point to image of dead men ye hold up before goddess fair dead woman ye say be whom ye will serve answer if thing be what have learned from be come then never can be sent of god god forbade idolatry image making if taught can be messiah be why in age have stood aloof might have received might have believed for know said margaret thoughtfully that holy church lay much stress on image must think if ye prefer to pray without must allow to do so can not understand how ye can pray without for what be there to pray to be infirmity suppose ah damsel said belasez with sad smile seems to very very little matter how will jew christian ever understand other for be life death to be question of obeying of disobeying not of doing something fancy fancy yes holy church must decide for urged margaret earnestly damsel word be strange to ear holy one to whom be praise have decided long ago ye will not make unto graven image ye will not bow down to worship ' command be given what difference can make to that thing call church dare to disregard scarcely understand what church be if rightly know what damsel mean signifies christian christian be gentile how can son of israel take law from to speak a if must abrogate law of sitteth in heaven before whom be le than nothing vanity be strange tongue in damsel speaks understand did margaret understand belasez sat looked at with mind in bewildered confusion to authority of church be paramount be only irrefragable thing here be something looked like church setting up with unaccountable unheard of claim to be older truer better something denied that church with horror be whispered have right to make law referred to law legislator so high above church that scarcely regarded church a worth mention in matter at margaret felt stunned god speaks through church gasped if be so must speak same thing be belasez unanswerable response margaret felt pushed into corner did not know what to say next difference between point of view that of belasez be so vast that consideration must have silenced one else at once passed a idle wind by margaret must not see how to alter must ask father nicholas to show thee how be said at last in kindly manner be only ignorant girl can explain to thee can said belasez what explanation of one can prove man may please about obeying maker will tell doe damsel think have never listened to christian priest will tell to offer incense to yonder gilded image have not better offer to myself be living daughter of israel be that not better than stone image of dead one better than blessed lady cried horrified margaret perhaps if be here living woman might be better woman of two said belasez coolly living woman be sure be better than stone image can see hear feel oh know said margaret eagerly a bright idea occurred to that have holy father pope keep church right lord commissioned saint peter who be first pope to teach body promised to guard from error margaret be mentally congratulating on brilliant solution of difficulty belasez looked up thoughtfully did promise to guard successor oh of course wonder supposing be messiah if did said belasez because have sometimes thought that might explain might explain damsel know that disciple of great teacher often corrupt master teaching in course of time may come to teach doctrine quite different from have struck sometimes whether might be so with that master be truly sent of god that have so corrupted doctrine that there be very little likeness left now there must be very little if spoke according to will of holy one church never change said margaret then must not be true said belasez oh father nicholas say church develops always teach truth unfolds more more a time go on truth be one damsel maybe more can never be different contrary change urged margaret taking last weapon out of quiver may need one thing to day to morrow may if original command have be even ye will make image one ' must think might then a need be have be altered to ye may now make thousand image being ye will make none ' can not be altered must be to alter character who be in universe only unchangeable one margaret sat watched progress of embroidery said more chapter four time of jacob trouble know that thorny path tread be

out eloquent blessing on belasez kissed hand that of margaret tear choked girl voice a turned to follow father argument against idolatry margaret have heard from belasez be ghost easily laid by father nicholas few vague platitude concerning supreme authority committed to apostle peter through to papacy father nicholas discreetly left point unencumbered by evidence wickedness of listening to sceptical reasoning happiness of implicit obedience to holy church be quite enough to reduce belasez argument a remained in margaret mind to condition of uncomfortable reminiscence being also wicked be best to forget a soon a possible there have be one listener to conversation of whom party took account who must not forget be doucebelle de vaux in brain word of young jewess took root germinated so silently that one suspected father nicholas have not faintest idea of importance of question when one morning during latin lesson administered twice week to young lady of castle doucebelle asked precise meaning of adoro mean in original to speak to accost one said priest being now taken into holy service of religion signifies to pray to supplicate thence derived to worship to bow one down if

practically looked like yet how be if church be mouthpiece of god that command issued by one be diametrically at variance with recommendation given by other if god did not change if church did not change when have be in accord how came to differ doucebelle have now reached point where must neither turn round go further more cogitated on problem more insoluble appeared to yet instinctive feeling told that to refer to father nicholas must be of service be one of better class of priest man of respectable character with literary proclivity have in case effect of keeping from vice on one hand of deadening spiritual sensibility on other to religion taught have be taught be sufficient for necessity must not understand one wanting more when man mind have never be disturbed by question be cause for wonder that have never sought for answer that father nicholas must have listened to doucebelle knew for be by mean unkind disobliging man have sense to perceive that be incapable of understanding that only idea of dealing with such query must be not to solve to suppress doucebelle passed in mental review person in castle one in turn dismissed a unsuitable for purpose other chaplain of earl

be not sure that will twice why what wouldst thou say to will hear if want to know belasez thereupon shut up like coffer seemed to have lost tongue for remainder of night doucebelle determined that if must possibly contrive without wounding feeling of father nicholas next confession must be made to father bruno seemed to to be man made of altogether different metal from colleague master aristoteles kept entirely to physical ailment never heard confession except from sick in emergency father nicholas be very easy confessor for thought be usually in beloved study whatever confession might be absolution seemed to follow a matter of course if advice be asked on point outside philology in division generally appeared to be rather taken by surprise almost a much puzzled a penitent strongest reproof be ah that be wrong child thou must not do again so confession to father nicholas while eminently comfortable to dead soul be anything satisfying to living one father warner be terrible confessor minute question penetrated into corner of soul body took nothing for granted good bad absolution be hard to get from not to be have on term of severe penance yet seemed to doucebelle that there be inner sanctuary of heart from never even tried to lift veil depth in nature never approached be because there be such depth in therefore necessarily ignored existence in in one way be miserable comforter wished to try father bruno most unwittingly father nicholas helped to gain end by requesting holiday have heard rumour that latin manuscript have be discovered in library of saint albans abbey father nicholas in whose eye lost book of livy be of more consequence than thing else in world except order of saint benedict be unhappy till have seen manuscript countess in earl absence readily granted request doucebelle fear of hurting feeling of kind hearted though careless old friend be no longer bar in way of consulting father bruno father warner who be confessing other half of household growled disapprobation when doucebelle begged to be included in penitent of father bruno something new always catch silly girl fancy said doucebelle have scruple about hurting feeling since did not believe in existence so when turn came knelt down in bruno confessional at first wondered if be about to prove like father nicholas for did not ask single question till stopped of then instead of referring to thing have said put one of weighty import daughter what dost thou know of jesus christ know said doucebelle that came to take away sin of world humbly trust that will take away mine that will repeated bruno be not done already thought father that must be done when die what have thy dying to do with if be done at be done when died then where be sin father asked doucebelle feeling very much astonished be new doctrine to bruno be augustinian well read in writing of founder of order be where god can not find child therefore there be little fear of thy finding understand if thou hast laid upon christ lord know have said doucebelle in low voice then on own authority assure thee that have taken father may really believe may thou must if thou wouldst not make god liar what then have to do what wouldst thou do for if have rescued thee from burning house lost own life in doing of must hing said doucebelle feeling rather puzzled wouldst thou love hate o father can there be question supposing there be thing left in world for thou knewest have cared favourite dog cat wouldst thou leave to starve take care of think be doucebelle earnest answer must care for a though be own child then daughter see thou dost that for who did lose own life in rescuing thee love with fibre of thine heart love what have loved for sake have left with thee for whom on earth cared most poor sick unhappy be unto thee a thy dearest dearest of be very unlike counsel doucebelle have ever before received from confessor there be something here of must take hold not that father bruno have suggested new course of action so much a that have supplied new motive power to do good to give alms to be kind to poor sick people doucebelle have be taught already reason for be abstract notion that be right thing to do that must help to increase little heap of human merit to mind in particular to ignorant one there be enormous difference between personal impersonal tell child that thing must be done because be right motive power be faint vague not unlikely to be overthrown by first breath of temptation let child understand to do thing will please displease god have supplied far stronger energising power in intelligible reference to will of living person doucebelle felt a more le do father said after momentary pause want advice state thy perplexity daughter hope father will not be angry few day ago when other priest be talking in ante chamber about door be open heard word in bower did belasez hear what be said yes have what did say asked at night whether what have said have wounded said thought there be one christian priest who be like what scripture described christ to be did say that there be tone of tender regret in priest voice did father want to know how to deal with belasez sometimes will talk to quite freely tell thought feeling at other time can not get word out of let alone at other time what be state of mind seems to have be very much struck father with sermon from bishop wherein proved out of own scripture say that lord be messiah whom jew believe know if have reached point further than think hardly know what to believe only sermon do good god preaches said bruno perhaps spoke rather to than to doucebelle whenever maiden will speak to thee repulse lead her to best of thy power to see christ be god be one cure for evil yet must teach first to thyself think have done so little answered doucebelle father will not speak to child will wait upon god speak word give at time will remember blunder men make belasez be after flesh nearer akin to than thou art be kinswoman of lord jesus let that thought spur thee on if thou faint by way father lord be not jew be jew daughter hardly news must more have amazed doucebelle why then do people use so harshly thou hadst better ask people answered bruno drily father be right to use jew so thou hadst better ask lord what doe say father said speaking to abraham father of will bless that blesseth thee curse that curseth thee ' oh be so glad cried doucebelle if please father must not help loving belasez tried hard not to do so because thought be wicked can not be wrong to love jew if christ be one bruno did not reply immediately when did be with slight quiver in voice surprised doucebelle can never be wrong to love said daughter let not thy love stop at liking maid company let go on till thou canst take into heaven strangest of strange idea be to doucebelle have be taught that love be always weakness only too frequently sin so purely earthly thing must be taken into heaven astonished beyond measure father said in tone of mingled amazement inquiry what now daughter people always speak of love a weak if not wicked people often talk of what understand child god be love ' think not therefore that god resembles worldly fancy spring to day fade away to morrow be heavenly love can never die be ready to sacrifice thing so look to true welfare of beloved that will give thee earthly suffering rather than see thee sink into perdition by thy sin be real love daughter thou canst not sin in giving to belasez to other yet father said doucebelle in puzzled tone religious give up love when go into cloister understand sister of saint ursula may not leave convent even if own mother lie dying pleads hard to see though priest do wed have not yet in england ceased to be case yet people always seem to think celibate priest more holy a if be more in accordance with will of god yet god tell to love other can not quite understand if doucebelle must have seen a well a spoken through confessional grating assuredly must have stopped sooner for agony be working in line of father bruno face must have be terrible to to see only thought that be long while before answered wondered at hard constrained tone in voice child said doe one god quite understand ' do understand how much le other be only love understands who most love god will best understand men for rest o lord who hast loved pardon blunder misunderstanding of thy people save thy servant trust in thee now go child unless thou hast more to say absolvo te doucebelle rose retired did not know that father bruno heard

have not returned from coronation festivity girl be alone in margaret bower when father bruno entered with god save here belasez rose hastily prepared to withdraw wait child said priest gently must

eighteen said yes licorice child yet have pity aye just eighteen do know mother said belasez in accent of mingled surprise curiosity did eighteen year ago bruno rose hastily a if wished to dismiss subject margaret dropped on knee requested blessing gave a though thought be far away then left room slowly gazing on belasez to last be first not by mean last interview between father bruno jewish maiden month later doucebelle asked belasez how liked like love said belasez with more warmth than usual what confession answered doucebelle playfully oh not that sort of love responded belasez with tinge of scorn think must be sort that can take into heaven with next morning levina announced to countess in tone of gratified spite two person be in hall old man unknown to young jew delecresse have come for sister belasez received news of recall at first with look of blank dismay then with shower of passionate tear deep attachment to christian friend be most manifest kissed hand of countess margaret warmly embraced doucebelle then looked round a if something be wanting still what be maid kindly asked countess father bruno faltered belasez through tear oh must say farewell to father bruno

earth with innocence of heaven wait moment turned went rapidly down stair belasez waited till came back be accompanied by father warner trembled at ordeal guessed to await soon found that be not far wrong father warner took into empty chapel required to repeat creed of course must not do to tell be seven deadly sin what five commandment of church belasez have never heard of of warner shook head sternly wondered what brother bruno must possibly mean by presenting ignorant heathen a fit candidate for baptism belasez felt a if god man alike must have none of warner recommended to put under tuition of priest at norwich be to complete impossibility perhaps in year thereabouts if be diligent obedient in following order of director might hope to receive grace of holy baptism went out sobbing encountered bruno at head of stair o father bruno faltered girl father warner will not do be afraid so said bruno sadly must not have thought of asking have brother nicholas be at home well daughter be fault of thine remember baptise only with water whose minister be can baptise thee with holy ghost with fire let be thy shepherd to provide for thee thy priest to absolve thee thy king to

castle to belasez seemed like stepping out of sunlit fold into dreary wilderness beyond a passed upper end of hall belasez paused for instant to make last reverence to margaret who sat there talking with unacknowledged husband sir richard de clare black scowl on face of brother drew attention at once who be that young gentile demanded sir richard de clare lord of gloucester what hast thou against asked old hamon be youth that threw cap into pool year ago called jew cur said delecresse between teeth pooh pooh said old hamon have to put up with little amenity never mind child will never mind

feather must rather be so than with stone thanks for compliment nay said nothing about thee licorice if be a thou thinkest let repeat that mistake will repeat mistake warrant thee conversation ceased rather suddenly except for one mournful exclamation from abraham poor anegay anegay where have belasez heard name before belonged to friend relative so far a knew yet that have heard before that in interesting connection with something be absolutely certain belasez dropped asleep while be thinking seemed to hardly minute passed before woke again to hear mother moving in next room to see full daylight streaming in at window suddenly just a awoke rushed upon when how have heard of anegay saw little child standing by side of licorice with be old belya mother of hamon before stood enormous illuminated volume at be looking belasez found impossible to remember what have be said by belya mother response be a vivid in mind a if whole scene be of yesterday hush child must not know yes belya thou art right be taken from anegay face what be be taken dimly before belasez mental eye picture seemed to grow in king upon throne woman fainting be principal figure before ahasuerus be of course belasez sprang up with determination to search through father book to find picture have be taken from anegay face after who be anegay licorice be in full tide of business porridge making in little kitchen when belasez presented with apology for being late nay folk go to bed at nine may well not rise till five said licorice graciously throw more salt in here child fetch porringer whilst stir call thy father delecresse breakfast will be ready by time be breakfast be half over when licorice inquired of daughter whom have seen at bury castle oh to speak to only countess daughter damsel

licorice with assumed carelessness there be knight of name in heart belasez felt that name belonged to priest father bruno few more question be asked of import then rose when licorice set free from household duty belasez took way to little closet over porch served a father library be happy possessor of eleven volume goodly number at date eight passed by knowing to contain picture ninth be illuminated copy of brut of course began a chronicle then did with creation belasez looked through twice without finding thing to satisfy next came chronicle of benoit illumination in be merely

splendid copy of hagiographa with full page picture glowing with colour gold of course illumination have be executed by christian hand book have come to abraham in exchange for bad debt be not so consistent a to refuse to look at representation of created thing however wicked might account to produce belasez turned over stiff leaf one after till reached book of esther yes surely be picture remembered there sat king ahasuerus on curule chair wearing floriated crown mantle clasped at neck with golden fibula there fainted queen esther in arm of lady arrayed in tight gown pocketing sleeve wimple other monstrosity of early plantagenet era persian satrap enclosed in coat of mail surcoat with silver shield whereon exceedingly rampant red lion be disporting appeared to be coming to help of liege lady while tall white lily in flower pot about twice size of throne occupied one side of picture to detail belasez paid attention one thing at looked be face of fainting queen be turned full towards spectator be very lovely face of decidedly jewish type what made belasez glance from to brazen mirror fixed to wall opposite be anegay of whom bruno have be thinking when murmured that be so like one undoubtedly there be likeness same pure oval face smooth calm brow dark glossy hair struck belasez that own feature a seen in mirror be le prominently jewish once more who be anegay how little be possible to know of innermost heart of nearest friend belasez went through duty that day without rousing faintest suspicion in mind of mother that have heard syllable of conversation between parent night before yet thought of little else household work be finished sat in deep recess of window at embroidery when delecresse came stood beside belasez who be that damsel that sat talking with lord of gloucester in hall when passed through be damsel margaret daughter of sir hubert earl what sort of maiden be very sweet gentle liked extremely be always most kind to be attached to lord of

scornfully even with tongs took to cap must not touch one of vile insect for gold at norwich what dost thou mean hold thou thy peace be fool to tell thee what art thou going to do persisted belasez what thou wilt hear when be done said delecresse walking away left poor belasez in grief terror misery of what sort must not even guess be impending over poor friend margaret how be possible to warn of what be to be warned few minute be spent in reflection then belasez work be hastily folded went in search of father abraham listened with perplexed annoyed face boy always let hand go before head what can do daughter in good sooth must not willingly see injury done to christian have be so kind to thee where be cress went into kitchen said belasez abraham shuffled off in direction in loose yellow slipper be one of recognised sign of jew delecresse be just gone out said coming back directly will talk to when come in twelve day elapsed before delecresse returned cress thou wilt not do anything to sir richard of gloucester earnestly pleaded belasez when found alone said delecresse with glitter in eye be not promising hast thou done thing mean to do o cress what hast thou done go to

jew of course thy face match thy name now thy news will noble knight be pleased to tell unworthy servant if like taste of revenge delecresse despised for word used son of israel to humble thus to one

have pure foy worse than hate devil devil be very near to at moment if help to be revenged on will pay by giving revenge on delecresse have dropped alike respectful word subservient manner spoke up now a man to man turn about be fair play suppose said sir pier if thou seek not revenge on friend of mine will seek on sir richard de clare young earl of gloucester be friend of mine said sir pier

be capable of personal attachment a well a of hatred sir pier delicate notion of love rather astonished sir pier be very far from being only man who be be incapable of entertaining others delecresse soon recovered be too anxious to get work done to quarrel with tool be gratifying too to discover sir pier be not likely man to be troubled by romantic scruple about breaking heart of young margaret delecresse have be unpleasantly haunted by have with difficulty succeeded in crushing down turning key on belasez pleading look margaret bright pretty face persisted in recurring to memory in very provoking manner sir pier be evidently man who must help to forget well go on said minister when delecresse hesitated have good reason to believe that sir richard be on point of wedding damsel margaret de burgh nay be not sure if be not married clandestinely must not be used a handle to ruin of two pair of eye met smile be anything angelic broke over handsome countenance of sir pier not bad idea for one so young remarked be thine own own answered delecresse shortly must make use of thee in king service thank said delecresse rather drily wish to have more to do with devil angel than find necessary sir pier broke into laugh neat suppose be one of angel be surprised to hear sentiment from jew nothing be more inconsistent than sin in anxiety to gratify revenge delecresse be enduring patiently at hand of sir pier far worse insult than over have so long brooded from richard de clare kept silence really be pity observed sir pier complacently surveying delecresse that such budding talent a thine must be cast away upon trade thou wouldst make far more money in secret service must be easy to change thy name keep thy descent quiet be ready to eat humble pie for short time there be saying to what thou mightest rise in world other delecresse felt unfledged cherub by side of sir pier bah sir pier snapped finger what do such a know about there be other world if there be chance be

silently below wish have not done came in muttered accent from lip at last do almost really wish have not done then a reader know went home snubbed sister abraham must get nothing out of son except scornful platitude concerning creeping creature not shred of information must delecresse give be almost rude to father very high crime in eye of jew be because be so intensely dissatisfied with o son

to in strain if can succeed in convincing lord king that have hand in business well sir pier shoulder went up towards ear in manner indicated that result to be far from what expected two young fool attempt to deny face must give lie if did a for lady countess sprang forward threw on knee clinging to arm of husband while passionately addressed to sir pier on life honour lord knew nothing of be done while be away with lord king at merton be doing lord mine be true what sir pier tell daughter have gone too far with sir richard de clare ever to be married to note sir pier stood listening with rather amused set of lip a if thought scene very effective to human agony before eye be more than play enacted for entertainment of course be in way of business sir pier principle be to get a much diversion out of business a must very good indeed lady said that worthy minister confession may spare annoyance a to lord will hing hardly expect to swallow pretty little fiction suppose if do beg will undeceive officer do duty officer have evidently received previous instruction for at once laid hand on shoulder of earl hubert sir richard half insensible margaret be roused into life by attempt to take bridegroom from with cry might have touched heart that of sir pier de rievaulx flung arm around held close apparently officer be touched for stopped looked at chief for further order coward

said sir pier in tone of hardness veneered with civility darling must let go interposed young earl of gloucester who seemed scarcely le miserable than bride magot child may not stay justice said distressed tone of father yet held tight until sir pier tore away look to damsel condescended to say with glance at doucebelle bruno oh have where be priest blessed wedding must have there be priest sobbed countess lifting head from husband arm where have let sink be per verba depresenti that will see be cool response of sir pier take priest sir drew now lady fare thee well jewel said earl hubert kissing brow of countess poor little magot farewell too sir hubert lord forgive meant ill forgive thee said earl with smile again kissing wife brow must not do otherwise margaret now sir pier be prisoner little amenity being disposed of sneered sir pier suppose woman must cry over something kind must think to give something to cry about march out prisoner father nicholas have be discovered in study engaged in deepest meditation on grammatical crux have received news of arrest with blank horror amazement very laughable in eye of sir pier master aristoteles be pounding rhubarb with sleeve turned up required convincing that be not wanted professionally father warner be where to be found three priest be spared fetter in consideration of sacred character earl be heavily ironed so armed band with prisoner marched away from castle feeling of prisoner be diverse father nicholas be simply astonished beyond power of word to convey master aristoteles be convinced that recent physical disturbance in atmosphere be more than enough to account for whole affair earl hubert felt sure that old enemy bishop of winchester be at bottom of earl richard be disposed to think same father bruno alone looked upwards saw god assuredly one of saw moving cause in tall stern silent jewish youth last idea that ever entered mind of richard de clare be to associate great grief of life with boyish trick have played on delecresse two year before for great grief of richard life sorrow be through six twenty year remained of mortal span never forgot never forgave proved easiest thing in world to convince king henry that have not intended richard to marry have dearly beloved uncle bishop of valentia held up before black cloth said be white majesty must merely have wondered what must be matter with eye next point be to persuade royal most deceivable individual that have entertained earnest desire to see richard married to princess of savoy cousin of queen also be not difficult third lesson instilled into be that richard having thought proper to render impossible by choosing for king henry be cruelly injured unpardonably insulted man majesty swallowed a glibly a possible metal being thus fused to proper state prisoner be brought before affronted sovereign in person be tried in inverse order according to importance father bruno must prove without much difficulty that obnoxious marriage have taken place on showing of prosecution before have entered household penalty be light one of discharge from countess service that deserved penalty at be not taken into consideration crown must not so far err a to bring charge against entirely innocent man verdict therefore in father bruno case resembled that of famous jury who returned a not guilty hope wo do again master aristoteles be next placed in dock have honour of amusing court asseveration of innocent ignorance be so mixed up with dissertation on virtue of savin betony lamenting reference to last eclipse might have warned of what be coming on that court condescended to relax into smile let simple man go with light sentence of six month imprisonment at subsequent period in life master aristoteles be wont to say that sentence be best thing that ever happened to since enforced meditation idleness have enabled to think out grand discovery that dust gathered on beam of chestnut wood be infallible specific for fever have since treated three fever patient in manner not one of have died whether patient must have recovered without dust with being so much let alone master aristoteles did not concern next came father nicholas light sentence also sufficed for not on account of innocence because friend abbot of ham be friend of bishop of winchester earl hubert of kent be then tried animus of accuser be plainly shown for brought up again old hackneyed charge on account of have be pardoned year before for of more than once affront offered to king by earl marriage with margaret of scotland fact that third wife be within forbidden degree that dispensation have be obtained be renewed with other disproved spiteful accusation of old time head front of offending in instance be of course marriage of daughter did not make much difference that hubert calmly swore that have never known of marriage before after except what have learned from simple statement of countess wife to effect that have be contracted at bury saint edmund during absence at fervent intercession of hubert friend moved by passionate entreaty of countess did not make much difference either what did make good deal be that earl who knew royal master offered heavy golden bribe for pardon of crime have not committed king henry thereupon condescended to announce that in consideration of effect produced upon compassionate heart by piteous intercession of prisoner friend fury must abate crown must take earl hubert therefore received most gracious pardon be permitted to return money to bosom of distracted family heaviest vengeance fell on young head of richard de clare through on fair girl with cedar hair whose worst crime be that have loved be not vengeance must be weighed like hubert coin told on clock like imprisonment of physician be counted out throb by throb in agony of two human heart one fiercely stabbed artificially healed other left to bleed to death like wounded doe king first step be to procure solemn papal sentence of divorce between richard margaret consent of course be asked thought needful majesty adviser allowed richard little rest then before thought necessary to do thing more result of trial be to leave father bruno homeless returned to monastery at lincoln sought leave of superior to be transferred to convent of order at norwich heart still yearned over belasez with tenderness be half of heaven half of earth yet knew that in probability must never find possible to cross path well let do what must leave rest with god if meant to meet meet must though satan angel combined to bar way wife may thy beard be shaven be just dropping off well have taken abraham long while to summon up courage to make what felt must be to licorice unwelcome communication be rather dismayed to find so badly received at first step do go on thou weariest of old jackdaw be half asleep have spoken to child licorice a if thou couldst not have said that hour ago well how do matter stand there be one person in particular whom be sorry to leave of course there be saw that a plain a barber pole across street did tell thee so be young christian gallant who be blessed be memory of abraham father why did ever let that girl go to bury be not a thou art fearing wife be worse worse licorice seemed wide awake enough now why what must there be worse unless have married christian have abjured faith wife be worse have seen de malpas name be almost hissed from lip of licorice same be to be licorice adonai know why be evident be fated to meet what did viper tell gather that told thing except brought face to memory that have known of old fancy so of course doe that be sister low peculiar laugh from mother made belasez blood curdle a lay listening there seemed so much more of fiend in than angel what as must be never to guess truth want to know truth wife asked if might not thou let alone will cook up nice little story will set mind at rest o licorice more deception yet deception why wouldst thou tell truth just go to now wake let know that be belasez strained ear to utmost word followed must not be heard from mother dropped tone what must follow eh demanded licorice raising voice again adonai know said abraham sadly suppose must not keep long must think not thou canst go tell mayor see what catch poll will say must there be pretty ferment old man must cost thee thy life mine also give over talking about lie a if thou wert one of cherub will let thee know when think there be danger of show little spice of prudence like craftsman of middle earth a thou art more deception of course there be more deception man have better keep off slide to begin with doe not want to be carried down child fancy licorice that anegay be sister that became christian married one have idea of thing more who told anegay name can not imagine might be bruno have always be so careful to keep from hearing there be pause didst thou find christian dog have tampered with faith know licorice must not get that out of then have doubt will get out of belasez trembled at threat thing more old man if not will go to sleep again licorice said abraham in low voice child said loved a love may be buried in dunghill what witchcraft have used to touched so wife must hardly speak to did not know why abraham do give over thy sentimental stuff nothing ever touch doubt if do be abraham dry answer rabbit a thou art a frightened a hare a soft a bag of duck down be going to sleep belasez heard more woke however next morning with uncomfortable conviction of something disagreeable about to happen with human being be more le familiar gradually dawned upon that licorice be going to get out of be likewise about to devise false tale for especial benefit have not heard two sentence passed between parent before woke might have be still more on guard licorice thou must take care what thou sayest to child told that anegay be not sister just what might have be expected of thee paragon of wisdom well never mind will tell be aunt will do a well when daily cleaning dusting cooking baking be duly completed licorice made belasez heart flutter by command to attend in little porch chamber belasez began in tone so amiable that belasez must instantly have suspected trap have overheard nothing for licorice character be well known to belasez hear from thy father thou hast heard foolish gossip touching one anegay be kinswoman of thine thou art desirous of knowing truth thou shalt know now indeed there be reason to hide from thee further than that tale being painful one thy father have not cared to talk about anegay be sister of abraham thy father therefore thine aunt belasez who have be imagining that anegay might have be father sister at once mentally decided that be not have noticed that abraham reference to dead girl be made with far more indication of love regret than of licorice have fancied that might be due to existence of relationship on part not on hers now concluded that be simply question of character who anegay be be point left a much in dark a ever be great friend of mine daughter loved very dearly said licorice applying one hand to perfectly dry eye proceeding imparted to belasez who knew that such term from be generally to be interpreted by rule of contrary strong impression that have hated at time thy father dwelt at lincoln be before be married thou knowest anegay being only motherless daughter used to spend much of time with can not quite tell thee how for indeed be puzzle to myself anegay became acquainted with christian maiden whose name be beatrice peculiar twinkle in eye of licorice caused belasez to feel especially doubtful of truth of part of story who have brother pursued licorice young christian squire a thou shalt hear most wicked artful man belasez at once set down unknown squire a model of cardinal virtue thou art well aware belasez child that idolater practise black art be versed in spell can cast over unfortunate person who be so luckless a to come within influence there have be time when belasez believed many more charge brought against christian just a in turn believed similar calumny against jew month spent at bury castle unconsciously to herself till be done have shaken uprooted many prejudice leaving with simple conviction that jew christian be fallible human being very much of same stamp better than others good bad to be found in camp licorice however be by mean person to whom chose to impart such impression there have never be confidence communion of spirit between in fact be cast in such different mould that be hardly possible there must be licorice be sweeping cooking machine whose intellect be wholly uncultivated whose imagination ran into cunning deceit belasez be article of much finer quality mentally morally only person in own family with whom must exchange thought feeling be abraham be not equal though came nearest to have often distressed belasez that mother seemed to have so little in common many time have tried hard to scold into more love for licorice have found process sheer impossibility have now given up with sorrowful recognition that be not to be done firm conviction that be own fault that ought to be very penitent for such hardness of heart seems to continued licorice that bad young man whose name be de malpas must have cast spell on poor unhappy anegay for how else must daughter of israel come to love so vile insect a one of accursed goy for did love belasez bitter grief disgrace be to friend of course need not say that idea of marriage between be odious impossibility only resource be to take anegay away from lincoln where must learn to forget about creeping creature return to duty a servant of living eternal one be at time thy father be wedded then came to live in norwich bringing anegay with licorice paused a if tale be finished sounded specious how much of be true did forget mother of course did belasez be duty belasez privately thought that people did not always do duty that duty a must be extremely hard to do be ever married mother if please married young jew dear named aaron son of leo died soon after birth of first child said licorice glibly be really happy mother happy of course be have business to be thing else belasez be silent not in least convinced thou seest now belasez why be so much afraid of thy visit to bury well know thou art discreet maiden entirely to be trusted so far a thine ability go what can such quality avail thee against magic have heard of grand aunt of mine whom christian by mean glued to settle for three year must not rise from until wicked spell be dissolved mistrust thee good daughter do warn thee licorice rose with manner indicated termination of interview apparently thinking better to reserve religious question for time may ask one other question mother what became of maiden beatrice brother licorice eye twinkled again belasez listened for answer on principle of irishman who looked at guide post to see where road did not lead squire be killed fighting saracen believe know what became of maiden licorice disappeared squire be not killed be sure said belasez to herself be father bruno left alone belasez reviewed very doubtful information anegay be not sister probably not aunt that have loved bruno be sure to be true that have be forcibly separated from be only too likely subsequent marriage to aaron very existence of beatrice be in belasez eye purely fictitious detail introduced to make event dovetail nicely why doubted latter point must hardly have told be really due to gleam in mother eye invariably put on when be launching out rather more boldly than usual into sea of fiction yet there seemed reason for invention of beatrice if be not real person be story belasez have heard sufficient to explain allusion have overheard went over one by one a recurred to memory decided that be have heard nothing from parent nothing from bruno contradicted in least why then uncomfortable instinctive feeling that something be left behind have not be told belasez be lying awake in bed when reached that point moment after sprang to sitting posture yes there be something behind what have heard that if be known must cost abraham licorice life what have heard explained mysterious allusion to herself a personally concerned in story why must leave instantly if knew what be one point abraham have distinctly told must not know licorice expressed such anxiety that must not even guess there be not much sleep for belasez night note confession of countess be historical took whole blame upon chapter ten truth told at last guardami ben ' ben ' son ' ben ' son beatrice dante well now be provoking what be matter wife abraham looked up from bale of silk be packing why here have genta be taken fever there be not soul to go nurse there be esterote brother wife there be esterote have baby to look to dost thou expect to carry infection to what be

after girl be thine not mine thou must take thine own way will bid good bye for ever for have hope of seeing again abraham made answer unless troubled eye quivering lip did so for night closed in upon very quiet chamber owing to absence of licorice delecresse sat studying with book open before belasez be busied with embroidery abraham be idle so far a hand be concerned one who have studied for minute must have seen that thought be very active by mean pleasant ten calm day passed over nothing happened heard through neighbour that genta be going through phase of tedious illness that licorice be most attentive valuable nurse at end of ten day delecresse came in with order for of exquisite broidery only belasez must execute be wanted for rich usurer wife rosia wished belasez to come to with

gate of church be growing dusk have not perceived presence of third person like refugee from storm be heavy said abraham a hailstone came pouring dancing down be afraid will not get home till late be response of daughter not till late said abraham absently belasez came softly from behind turned round quickly hand held out in greeting eye sparkling delight written on feature of face father bruno never knew be in norwich have not be here long child wondered if must ever meet ah little idea have belasez how meeting have be imagined longed for prayed for through weary week glanced at father suddenly remembering that warm welcome to christian priest be not likely to be much approved by bruno eye followed hers abraham said in tone sounded like mixture of friendship deprecation abraham have bent down a though be cowering from expected blow now lifted up held out hand bruno de malpas thou art welcome if god hath sent thee god sends event answered priest accepting offered hand ay be trying to learn replied abraham in voice of great pain for at time sends that break heart that may heal father title from bruno lip surprised puzzled belasez may be so said abraham in rather hopeless tone be adonai let do what seemeth good ' so thou hast made friend with belasez did not know be thine when made friend with said bruno with quiet smile of have always seemed to belasez at once so sweet so sad

quick said bruno go go belasez god keep thee sobbed abraham so belasez be driven away from old home have hardly expected have always be trouble to cause of self reproach that licorice did not love other better be not able to repress sensation of satisfaction in making discovery that licorice be not mother yet belasez have not looked for be to do father asked rather blankly must lodge thee with sister of saint clare child there be nothing else to be done will come fetch thee away so soon a arrangement can be made beatrice a must henceforth call did not fancy arrangement at bruno detected a much in face thou dost not like dove like being with stranger said frankly be afraid nun will think variety of heathen for can not do will want will not if tell abbess thou art new convert said bruno may very likely attempt to instruct thee father why must there be nun beatrice did not know how astonished bruno only smiled thine eye be unaccustomed to light be answered father among people of old mean said beatrice hesitatingly mother people go on beatrice let be people speak a be nature to thee to do thank father among people there be nun so far from that for woman to remain unwed be considered reproach why dost thou know think because woman longed for glory of being mother of messiah true therefore christ being come that reproach be done away let woman choose for herself if virgin marry hath not sinned ' nevertheless be unmarried think of thing of lord that may be holy body soul ' father do wish to be nun never hastily answered bruno nay beatrice must not have said that be thou what lord think best to make thee want to be left alone again beatrice heart be set at rest have terribly feared for moment lest bruno being monk might think absolutely bound to be nun soon reached franciscan convent abbess rather stiffly mannered grey haired woman received young guest with sedate kindliness committed to special charge of sister eularia be young woman of about twenty five in whose mind curiosity be strongly developed took beatrice up to dormitory showed where be to sleep gave seat on form beside at supper be almost immediately served beatrice noticed that whenever eularia helped to thing edible made sign of cross over why dost thou do that asked young jewess be according to rule replied nun surely thou knowest how to cross indeed see why must poor thing how sadly thou lackest teaching dost thou not know that lord christ suffered on cross oh yes why must cross on account in respect to exclaimed eularia pardon if one whom loved be slain by sword must not courtesy to sword saw because loved must hate very sight of one eularia be scarcely le puzzled than beatrice be symbol of salvation said must look on rather a symbol of suffering true suffered for for reason must still le admire that made suffer eularia shrugged shoulder thou art very ignorant discussion slumbered until rose from supper when eularia seated beatrice beside on settle offered to instruct in use of rosary what pretty necklace thought nun did not wear ornament ornament of course not then what do do with pray by pray by understand keep count of prayer count why why how must remember else why must remember poor ignorant child when thou comest to make confession thou wilt find that priest will set thee for penance so many aves so many paternoster what be dost thou never pray gasped eularia never say so many of one thing so many of answered beatrice half laughing never heard anything so absurd holy prophet did not pray in way of course did exclaimed eularia how must obtain help of lady without repeating ave salve how must indeed before be born be retort oh dear dear said eularia why thou knowest nothing beatrice privately thought that must prefer not to know rubbish plenty of be served up to before left convent by holy sister of saint clare be nearly three week before bruno came for very weary of host be be le astonished dismayed by ignorant heathen must not worship holy image must not use holy water must not kneel before holy sacrament must not do other not content with series of negation actually presumed to reason about what dost thou believe despairingly demanded sister eularia at last believe in god said beatrice gravely believe that jesus of nazareth be sent of god in holy ghost asked eularia if understand certainly be not written spirit of god hath made ' in holy church know what be how shocking in forgiveness of sin assuredly in resurrection eternal life undoubtedly in invocation of holy saint believe that there have be holy men woman dost thou invoke do mean pray to dost thou beg of to intercede for thee indeed not did ever see such ignorance thou wilt not learn will learn of father one else be sure doe not believe rubbish do sanctum hilaria pro nobis what language be innocently asked beatrice holy tongue of course be not holy tongue have jew holy tongue responded eularia in surprise yes indeed hebrew did not know believed thing to be holy have relic know what be eularia led way to sacristy look here said reverently opening golden reliquary set with ruby here be small piece of holy veil of foundress saint clare be finger bone of blessed evangelist matthew here be piece of hoof of holy as on lord rode now thou knowest what relic be what can make keep such thing a asked beatrice opening wide lustrous eye enthusiastically added eularia opening reliquary set with emerald pearl be most precious relic one of small feather from wing of holy angel saint gabriel to intense horror of eularia silver laugh of unmistakable amusement greeted holy relic beatrice hast thou reverence not for angel feather answered beatrice still laughing well did think have more sense can assure thee thou wilt shock father bruno if thou allowest to commit such impropriety will shock then how excessively absurd eularia took unpromising pupil out of sacristy more hastily than have led in perhaps be a well for beatrice that father bruno arrived next day reached bury castle in safety countess have be very much interested in bruno story most readily acceded to request to leave beatrice a visitor until must have home to must take beatrice de malpas daughter of baronial house in cheshire be very different person in estimation of christian noble from belasez daughter of jew pedlar rather to surprise found seated above salt be treated a lady of rank embargo being over have confined to margaret apartment took place at earl table in banquet hall earl hubert quick eye soon found out addition to supper party condescended to remark that be extremely pretty ornament to hall beatrice be much pleased to find old friend doucebelle seated next to soon began to converse on recent event be curious fact a concern human nature however long friend may have be parted conversation nearly always turn on have happened just before met again speak of what delighted agonised ten year ago though effect may have extended to whole of subsequent life talk of last week journey of yesterday snow storm beatrice fully expected doucebelle sympathy on subject of relic be disappointed to find not forthcoming doucebelle be rather inclined to be shocked than amused angel feather in eye be provocative of thing rather than ridicule beatrice who have anticipated taking common sense view of matter felt chilled by result life have fallen back into old groove at bury castle grief with countess be usually passionate also transitory feeling extremely easy temper led to get rid of sorrow a soon a ever must pain whether mental bodily be in eye not necessary discipline unpleasant disturbance of proper order of event in fact be one of person who be always popular by reason of gracious affability in whom below fair flow of sweet water there be strong substratum of stony selfishness objected to people being in distress not because hurt because hurt to see difference between two though may scarcely show at time on surface lie in entire essential variety of stratum underneath be only natural that with character countess must expect others to be a little impressed by suffering a really have conception of disposition to sorrow be not easily healed scratch scar must be carried to grave in eye calamity have happened to daughter be disappointment undoubtedly one must find difficulty in surmounting at there be plenty of other men in world quite a handsome a amiable a rich a noble a richard de clare if such grief have happened to herself must have wept incessantly for week be low spirited for month in year must have be wreathed with smile arranging trousseau for wedding with bridegroom only thing must really have distressed long must have be if vacant place in life have not be refilled be character be of deeper type for world held other man life blossom once blighted second crop of happiness must grow at least on same tree to character a only possibility of throwing out fresh bloom be when tree be grafted by great husbandman with amaranth from heaven yet be not in margaret nature must have be in mother to say much of what felt outwardly showed difference except coeur leger be gone never to return did not shut up refuse to join in employment amusement of around majority of around never suspected that work amusement alike have interest for must ever have that must never think a have thought be a have be again one person only perceived truth be because be cast in like mould bruno saw too plainly that hope expressed by countess that magot be getting nicely over disappointment be not true never must be true in case amaranth have be grafted in plant be blossoming again there be such hope for at least a yet beatrice be unable to enter into margaret feeling not so much through want of capacity a of experience eva be equally unable being naturally at once of more selfish le concentrated disposition mind must have be more easily drawn from sorrow important item of healing process doucebelle came nearest a be most selfless of grief in like case must have be rather for suffering of richard than for own beatrice soon carried relic question to father for decision though with trepidation a to what must say if must not agree with must be sorely disappointed bruno smile half reassured so thou canst not believe in genuineness of relic said well child so thou hast full faith in christ salvation can not think much matter whether thou believest certain piece of stuff to be veil of saint clare not saint clare veil be concerned in thine eternal safety doucebelle seems almost shocked doe believe in perhaps will not harm with like proviso father honour in hold rag bone seems to like idolatry then be careful thou commit not worship such thing dear child find too much in christ in perishing world to have much time to think of beatrice be only half satisfied must have felt more contented have bruno warmly disclaimed charge be at cost of distress that realised that what be serious essential to be comparatively trivial matter to waft of polluted air be only too patent to be lost in purer atmosphere at altitude where bruno stood girl be gathered together one afternoon in ante chamber of margaret apartment bruno who have come up to speak to daughter be with except in special case chamber of house be sacred from priest eva be busy spinning must be more accurate to say that marie who be supposed to be spinning also be engaged in breaking thread margaret be employed on tapestry work doucebelle in plain sewing beatrice with delicate embroidery father said beatrice looking up suddenly be taught that be sin to make image of created thing on account of word of second commandment what do say non fade tibi sculptile neque omnem similitudinem ' murmured bruno reflectively think child that depends very much on meaning of tibi ' ah see in thy face thou hast learned latin thou shalt not make to thee sculptured image ' then sculptured image may be made otherwise latter half of commandment think show what be meant non adorabis ea neque cole thou shalt not worship ' at same time saint paul saith omne autem quod non est ex fide peccatum est be not of faith be sin ' nisi ei qui existimat quid commune esse illi commune est ' namely to who esteemeth thing unclean to be unclean ' if thou really believest sin by mean allow to do father suppose can not be sure said doucebelle thou needst not fear that thou wilt ever walk too close to christ daughter quietly answered bruno father be bound to give up can possibly be sin even can become sin asked eva in tone decidedly indicated dissent must like to hear thy objection daughter why must have to give up thing nice said eva disconsolately there be sort of delightful thing be not exactly sin not quite virtue interposed beatrice with amused expression a eva paused well still be not wrong in make one waste one time forget to say one bead be cross to one sister just because be so delightful one doe not want to give over being cross be sin suppose so be when one forgets to say one prayer know whether wasting time be exactly sin see said bruno in same quiet tone have lord sent thee to clear temple of profane who desecrated by traffic thou wouldst have overthrown table of money changer not seat of sold dove beatrice doucebelle answered by smile of intelligence eva looked rather dissatisfied be not sin to be happy father asked margaret in low voice not if god give thee happiness be just said eva discontentedly how be one to know child answered bruno ignoring tone god never mean child to put thing into place of moment thou dost that thing be sin to thee when do do father asked doucebelle when make thee forget to say thy prayer must think drily observed beatrice when come in way between thee said bruno be sin to waste time father queried eva be sin to waste thing answered bruno if be more sin to waste one thing than surely be to waste life rose went away eva shrugged shoulder with wry face there never be body so precise a father bruno must rather ask question of father nicholas ten time over well like asking question of father nicholas responded doucebelle because never answer never go down to bottom of thing have chetife cried eva dost thou want to get to bottom of thing be just why like father nicholas because never bother one with reason distinction be only yes thou mayest do so ' do ' then be satisfied now father bruno will persist in explaining why be not to do that sometimes make want to do more seems to leave in one own hand beatrice broke into laugh why eva thou wouldst rather be chair to be moved about than woman to be able to go at pleasure must rather have distinct order said little scornfully do ' can understand saint paul say ' saint john say that ' to have to make up one own mind detest must detest opposite be afraid beatrice thou art greatly wanting in virtue of holy obedience of course one can make allowance for thine unhappy education eva have occasion to leave room at conclusion of unflattering speech beatrice indulged in long laugh well what be afraid of said to margaret doucebelle be that eva be rather wanting in virtue of common sense whether be to lay on education know there be answer thought of hearer be almost opposite margaret considered beatrice rash self satisfied doucebelle thought heartily with only wished that have a much courage to say so chapter twelve what be love only said life be dreary cometh not ' said said be aweary weary must be dead ' tennyson be fortunate for bruno de malpas that have friend in bishop grosteste whose large heart clear brain be readily interested in wish to return from regular to secular order smoothed path considerably promised benefice in diocese if dispensation must be obtained last be lengthy process month passed away before answer must be received from rome greatly scandalised hawise eva for different reason to see how very little progress be made by beatrice in in eye be christian religion be comfort to to reflect that have be baptised a infant therefore in event of sudden death have chance of going to heaven instead of dreadful certainty of being shut up in limbo place of vague locality vaguer character being pleasant painful inhabited by hapless innocent whose heathen careless christian parent suffered to die unregenerated of be sorely shocked to discover when have be about two month at bury that poor beatrice be still ignorant of five commandment of church be irreverently persisted in old inquiry of what be church sturdily demanded what right church have to give commandment hawise be quite distressed be not proper phrase with be strongest denunciation must be uttered nobody have ever asked such question before ergo ought never to be asked sane person knew perfectly well what church be though when gently urged by beatrice hawise backed out of definition good catholic must possibly require telling a to so shocking supposition a that church have right to issue own command well be not proper eva objection be quite a strong of different sort really must not understand what beatrice wanted if priest church be very much same thing told what to do must not rest be thankful be great deal le trouble than everlastingly thinking for one one of note ever think for chimed in hawise then be glad be not of note bluntly responded beatrice de malpas be quite shocked said hawise god made with heart conscience be answer if have not meant to use must not have given to at point beatrice left room in answer to call from countess hawise turning to companion remarked in whisper that must be that dreadful jewish blood on mother side have given such very improper notion be so low for part added if be proper to say so must remark can not imagine why father bruno doe not see that understands something of christianity of course one must not criticise priest speak truth daughter said voice from doorway rather disconcerted hawise thou canst not understand action in what respect humbly crave pardon father be really distressed about beatrice indeed how so understands nothing about christian duty hope be little more than truth if not let understand christ first child christian duty will come after forgive father without teaching not without teaching said bruno gravely without mine may be father doe not know five commandment of holy church nay asks what church mean if be in church can wait to know thy garment will not keep thee le warm because thou hast never learned how to weave hawise did not reply looked unconvinced few day after eva be pleased to inform beatrice that have be so happy a to reach point in eye be apex of feminine ambition be betrothed to sir william de cantilupe margaret sighed dost thou like asked beatrice in straightforward way be sometimes shade too blunt be apt to betray into asking direct question might have be kinder more delicate to leave unasked eva blushed simpered will tell thee beatrice said little marie dancing up be over head ear in love so much over head marie hand went a high a must go above own be belief have tumbled in on wrong side wrong side answered beatrice laughing wrong side of love wrong side of eva wrong side of eva responded marie with positive little nod a to love be not quite sure that know much about for believe care so much for sir william a care for being married be grand thing with so far a can make out be not notion of love thou silly little child of twelve what dost thou know about contemptuously demanded thy time be not come hope wo said marie if be to make such goose of over a thou

somebody else go a black a thunder cloud if be hour late be quite sure be visiting other gentlewoman whom love better than love be for ever making little bit of misery out of nothing if be to call honey sweet eva ' to day only sweet eva to morrow must be positive there be shocking reason for instead of like sensible girl never thinking about in way at beatrice doucebelle be laughing even margaret joined in little of course said marie by way of postscript if sir william have be badly hurt in tournament anything of sort must understand worrying about if have told that did not love must understand worry for nothing at if doe not tell that love time come fancy doe marie be so silly thanks will try not said marie keenly call that love what dost thou think beatrice why think doe not sound much like marie in thy description why what notion of love hast thou said eva scornfully have not forgotten how thou wert wont to talk of thy betrothed never professed to love leo said beatrice looking up how must when have not seen dost thou want to see in order to love sentimentally inquired eva answered beatrice thoughtfully want to know might easily love one whom have not seen with eye if be always sending message doing kind action for must not love somebody who be to mere name nothing more be plain thou hast sensitiveness beatrice 'd rather have sense must said little marie a if one must not have sneered eva well if one must must have thought thou wouldst retorted marie well understand said eva can not care to be loved with le than whole heart must not thank for just love that can spare from other people must not one have to spare for other people suggested marie sound a if one heart be box said beatrice must hold so much more be not more like fountain can give out perpetually always have fresh supply within yes for beloved one replied eva warmly for answered beatrice be narrow heart will hold one person well must rather be loved with whole of narrow heart than with piece of broad one o eva what dost thou mean doucebelle said eva sharply turning on new assailant indeed must man who love must love supremely must care for nothing must find sweetest reward for thing in smile bitterest pain in displeasure be what call love well must call that something else if margaret must scold murmured marie in undertone what be marie asked margaret with smile self conceit plenty of said child ask father bruno what think beatrice suggested margaret after gentle hush to somewhat too plain spoken marie thou canst do must not come so well from dost thou mean to say be conceited little piece of impertinence inquired eva in dulcet tone well thought thou saidst be response for marie got chased round room with wooden side of embroidery frame being lithe a monkey escaped by flying to countess room communicated with of daughter by private staircase father bruno came up a often did same evening before beatrice have time to consult small countess of eu appeared from nowhere in particular put crucial question in crudest form please father bruno what be love dost thou want telling inquired bruno with evident amusement please want telling because ca agree bruno very rarely laughed did now then if can not agree certainly do need must rather like to hear various opinion oh eva say began child eagerly bruno hand laid gently on head stopped wait child let speak for herself there be silence for moment for one liked to begin except marie whom decorum alone kept silent what didst thou say eva believe said good father cared not for love of did not hold first best do love seeketh not own said bruno that seek own be not love what be father modestly asked doucebelle be self love daughter worst enemy can be to true love of god man real love be unselfish unexacting immortal love can die surely saint paul say contrary daughter can kill suppose said margaret in low tone yes weak replied bruno father be holy apostle not speaking of religious love suggested eva trying to find loophole what be alternative irreligious love know of such thing daughter there be wicked sort of love certainly not there be wicked passion love can never be wicked because god be love people can love wickedly asked eva looking puzzled fail to see how one can love wickedly self love be always wicked then father if be wicked call love said eva leaping very cleverly a thought to conclusion scarcely said bruno with quiet smile say rather daughter that if be self love call wicked perplexed expression returned to eva face child what be love why father be just what want to know said marie bruno waited for eva answer suppose said nervously mean liking person wishing for company wanting to love one suppose that be caring for so much that thou wouldst count nothing too great sacrifice to attain highest good be how god loved child eva thought extremely poor tame beside own lovely ideal then said marie if love margaret will want to be happy will not want to make happy unless must make so right child said bruno with smile of approbation to do otherwise must be loving not margaret father exclaimed eva do mean to say that if betrothed prefers to go hawking rather than sit with if love will wish to leave whom wouldst thou be loving if not must not wish to go leave child there be divine self abnegation to very few attain few come nearest to imitation of who pleased not ' think god knoweth often be happiest let ask god for grace to reach be commandment that ye have love one to ' a be generally case when have said thought necessary at moment bruno rose with benediction quitted room call that loving said eva contemptuously when be gone poor tame stuff must not thank for well must said doucebelle quietly oh thou be eva answer in same tone why thou hast heart to begin with doucebelle silently doubted that statement o eva for shame said marie doucebelle always doe what body want unless think be wrong thou dost not call that love hope think be quite a like a wishing people to do what want to please said marie sturdily believe one of know thing about loftily returned eva if have be margaret now must not have sat quietly to broidery must not have borne margaret looked up quickly changed colour with slight compression of lower lip went back to work in silence what wouldst thou have done eva demanded practical little marie wouldst thou have stared out of window day long returned eva with fervent emphasis must have wept life away margaret be not like can get interested in work other thing forget hapless love outlive must kill in month margaret rose very quietly put frame by in corner left room beatrice who have be silent for time looked up then with expressive eye be killing eva father told so week since say be quite

gave absolution confession be over next sunday there be unwonted occurrence of sermon after vesper sermon be not fashionable at time when preached at be usually extremely dry scholastic disquisition father warner have given two during abode at castle be concerning duty of implicit obedience to church father nicholas have preached about dozen on virtue dreary classical essay three concerning angel one on good friday be series of fervent declamation on passion time be bruno who preached on very different topic from mentioned above clear ringing voice be in much more interesting sound than father nicholas drowsy monotone father warner dry staccato at least be interested in subject one must doubt that a soon a last note of last chant have died away bruno came forward to step of altar have given due notice of intention beforehand one with beatrice in particular be prepared to listen to text to hearer unfamiliar with letter of scripture be rather startling one o ye that pas by way hearken see if there be sorrow like unto sorrow wherewith lord hath trodden a in wine press in day of wrath of anger ' margaret looked up quickly seemed to very language of own heart at least be likely to be attentive perhaps medieval preacher except bruno de malpas must even have thought of alluding to literal primary meaning of word from first moment of joint existence jerusalem rome have be enemy rival not content with so far a in lay blotting out very name of israel from under heaven rome have calmly arrogated to herself without even offering proof of right to promise made to father saint paul tell belongs in higher richer sense to invisible church of christ than to literal visible israel rome go further than apostle for in anxiety to claim higher sense for denies lower altogether romanist will hear with patience of national restoration of israel whether anglo israelite theory be true false be certainly a theory exceedingly unpalatable to rome with respect moreover to particular passage have become so customary to refer to suffering of christ that original application to destruction of jerusalem have be almost forgotten here bruno jewish proclivity stood in good stead delighted beatrice by fully stating original reference of passage then went on to say that be no longer applicable to babylonish captivity since time there have be sorrow to suffering of israel be not to be compared to

enough to bear weight of christ cross carrying with sin sorrow of world for ever must be strong enough to bear sorrow of theirs so long a man persisted in saying will be done must not imagine that god must waste mercy in helping not will thine must always precede sending of strengthening angel lastly reminded that god sent grief to for own sake be not for sake gave pleasure nay grieved when have to afflict child of men be medicine without must not recover health always gave right remedy in right quantity at right time now said bruno at last ye into whose hand great physician hath put wholesome yet bitter cup how be ye going to treat will ye dash down say will have none of remedy ' for end of be death death eternal will ye drink only because ye have choice with wry face bitter tongue blaspheming hand give will do no good then will work for evil will ye take meekly with thanksgiving on lip though there be tear in eye knowing that will be better than yours that who bore for pang
