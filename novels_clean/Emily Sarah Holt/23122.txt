seven year told where doing what be one of whom of whose doings have thought never to hear more one of whom try never to think save when be praying for in night when be alone with god can ask to pardon if sin whom did name said philippa in astonished tone have spoken of of husband do know have never heard of before to day of think did mention duke of lancaster shake of head negatived suggestion well named none else pursued philippa saving earl of arundel can not know even then felt intense repugnance to saying father much to surprise grey lady slowly bowed head in what manner began philippa can know before uttered word suspicion almost terrified began to steal over threw on knee at foot of grey lady grasped arm tightly holy saint have mercy upon be isabel la despenser

there be cry from isabel only held out arm in embrace a close tender a with have parted long separated mother daughter met chapter nine together woe to eye shed tear tear for god to wipe away gem be so hard to forgive asked soft voice of isabel will try seems impossible responded philippa how can forgive injury that reach down to very root of heart life child said isabel that injureth followeth after satan forgiveth followeth after god be because great debt to god be too mighty for bounded sight can not reach to end thereof that be so ready to require of fellow debtor small sorry sum owed to ourselves loveth not brother whom hath seen how can love god whom hath not seen can love yet not forgive be sometimes easier to love one ere be seen than after said philippa sarcastically isabel smiled rather sadly for latent thought in daughter mind be only too apparent to have philippa known a little of father a of mother feeling towards must have be far le bitter there be other answer even though twenty seven year lay between day june morning on have quitted arundel isabel must not trust to speak of richard fitzalan dared not run risk of re opening wound by looking to see whether have healed mother said philippa suddenly thou wilt come with to kilquyt for time answered isabel if thine husband assent thereto will not ask said philippa with slight pout then will not go replied isabel quietly will not enter house without permission philippa surprise disappointment be legible in face mother thou knowest not lord interposed there be not in world man more wearisome to dwell withal thing do dislike thing wish to do forbids be thankful for absence for when be at home from dawn to dusk doth nought save to find fault with notwithstanding remonstrance philippa have fathomed mother motive in thus answering sir richard possessed little of own be almost wholly dependent on earl father have pleased that gentleman to revoke grant of manor to herself husband must have be almost ruined philippa knew quite enough of earl richard copped hat to be aware that few tidings must be so unwelcome at arundel a conveyed fact of isabel presence at kilquyt mother uplifted hand stopped from saying more hush daughter said low voice repay not thou by finding fault in return what glory be if when ye be buffeted for fault ye will take patiently if when ye do well suffer for take patiently be acceptable with god ' be not so patient a mother answered philippa shaking head perhaps be better for if be dost thou mean must really ask lord leave ere thou wilt come with do mean thou sayest for time wilt thou not dwell with vow of lord be upon replied isabel gravely can not forsake place wherein hath set work hath given to do will visit thee sister also that done must return hither dost thou mean to live die in yonder cell be in recreation room of convent that be conversing even so daughter see note philippa countenance fell seemed very hard to part again when have just found other if be religion must be difficult work to be religious yet be more disappointed than surprised especially when first momentary annoyance be past child said isabel softly seeing disappointment if err in thus speaking pray god to pardon can follow what see right to that esteemeth anything to be unclean to be unclean how can forsake heart look to for help throughout valley if thou have need of thou canst always come send for gentle apologetic explanation touched philippa more because felt that in like case must not herself have condescended to make next thing to be done be to write to sir richard philippa be unable to do personally since art of handling pen have formed part of education mother did for for isabel have be solidly elaborately instructed by giles de edingdon under superintendence of king confessor luke de wodeford also predicant friar letter have to be directed very much at random to sir richard sergeaux of duke of lancaster following at bordeaux wherever may be found fortunately for philippa prior of neighbouring monastery be just despatching cellarer to london on conventual business undertook to convey letter to savoy palace whence must be forwarded with next despatch sent to john of gaunt philippa in whose name letter be written requested husband to reply to at shaftesbury whither isabel meant to proceed at once spring be in full beauty when reached shaftesbury philippa have not found opportunity to let abbess know of coming be very cordially welcomed by good natured dame recreation bell sounded while be conversing at philippa desire abbess sent for mother joan to guest chamber sister senicula led in how be with aunt said philippa affectionately have returned hither a may hear ah be thou child said blind nun in answer fare reasonably well a blind woman may be glad thou hast come hither again evidently cost isabel much to make known to sister from whom have parted in such painful circumstance thirty seven year before for few moment longer did not speak philippa waited for at last isabel said in choked voice sister joan holy virgin exclaimed blind woman who called that one thou knewest once answered isabel quivering voice from heaven cried joan almost wildly can dead come back again stretched forth hand in direction from sound of sister voice have come no living may said isabel kneeling down by clasping arm around isabel joan trembling hand be passed over face a if to assure that ear have not deceived can be voice thine holy virgin thank thee abbess broke in in manner though well meant be exceedingly ill timed in bad taste be kindly disposed have not faintest trace of delicate perception of others feeling consideration for constitutes real difference between nature lady such a be not lady verily to think that holy mother mother joan be sister cried remember somewhat of history holy sister be not be sometime countess of arundel philippa saw how isabel trembled from head to foot knew not what to say joan la despenser be equal to emergency holy mother said quietly must please of great goodness to permit to remain here during recreation hour with sister be assured will have much to say to other if may have blessed allowance to speak freely after manner be so sister said abbess smiling genially will see to sister in recreation chamber long conversation followed departure of abbess joan took up history where have parted from isabel told what have be own lot since then isabel in turn recounted story long eventful one for told only how have be taken to sempringham by page have there settled in hermit cell happened to be vacant when philippa be lying awake night thought be troublous one not only did very much doubt sir richard consent to mother visit to kilquyt question be puzzling exceedingly how far be desirable to inform isabel of death of alianora have noticed how unfortunate remark of abbess have agitated mother also observed that when joan came to speak to isabel be totally silent concerning earl richard uncomplimentary adjective have not spared in speaking to philippa be utterly discarded now must not do at least a much harm a good to revive old memory of pain by telling philippa decided to remain silent summer be passing away autumn hue be slowly creeping over forest when sir richard answer arrived at shaftesbury be not pleasing missive must have cost philippa more tear if have made le angry that gentleman have not written in good temper be not without excuse for have suffered something have not dared to reply to philippa entreaty without seeking in turn permission of earl of arundel in whose hand fortune lay to make mar by one of uncomfortable coincidence have led to proverb that misfortune never come single so happened that news of countess death have reached earl on very morning whereon sir richard laid philippa letter before result be that there broke on devoted head of sir richard tempest of ungovernable rage so extremely unpleasant in character that might be excused for anxiety to avoid provoking second edition of earl be grieved so far a nature like must entertain grief to lose second wife to find that first wife have be discovered by daughter possessed additional character of insult that occurrence be accidental did not alter matter word must not content aggrieved mourner hand sought hilt of sword sir richard thinking discretion better part of valour made way a quickly a law of matter space allowed out of terrible presence whereinto have rashly ventured feeling wholly innocent of provocation be not surprising that must proceed to dictate letter to wife scarcely calculated to gratify feeling thus ran offending document dame epistle hath reached mine hand see note wherein hath pleased to give to know of finding of lady isabel la despenser fair mother see note likewise of desire that must visit at manor of kilquyt know therefore can in wise assent to same for be assured that must provoke that in small degree wrath of fair father gracious lord of arundel hereby charge on obedience so soon a will receive letter that return home tarry no longer at shaftesbury sempringham know that fare reasonably well eustace squire fair father likewise saving that hath showed much anger towards thus praying god blessed lady saint peter saint paul to keep rest r sergeaux entire epistle be written by scribe for sir richard be a innocent of art of calligraphy a philippa appending of seal be only part of letter achieved by own hand philippa read note three time before communicated content to one first time be with feeling of bitter anger towards father husband second view of father conduct remained unchanged began to see that sir richard from own point of view be not without reasonable excuse for refusal that considering annoyance have suffered letter be moderate even tolerably kind kind be for after third perusal philippa carried letter to joan read to not in isabel presence what fool wert thou child said joan with usual bluntness to send to thy lord concerning matter well what be done be done have looked for better have known of philippa did not read letter to mother merely told substance sir richard must not permit to receive at kilquyt that have ordered home without delay isabel lip quivered moment next instant smiled be not surprised child said take heed obey be hard work to obey hard to part with joan harder yet to leave isabel in lonely cell at sempringham to go forward on a lonely journey to kilquyt perhaps hardest of be last night in recreation room at sempringham isabel philippa sat by in corner hand of eremite clasped in of daughter how do account for sorrow be in world philippa have be saying take life for instance own mother god must have given very pleasant life if have pleased why did not do so how can augur love to take out of way thing loved loving daughter answered isabel be assured longer live more assured be that way god marketh out for

hand bud flower never did till must cry upon rood be finished ' must not god said philippa little timidly have given more grace to avoid sinning rather than have needed thus to burn sin out of with hot iron thou art soaring up into seventh heaven of god purpose child answered isabel with smile have wing to follow thee so far thou thinkest then mother replied philippa with sigh that can not understand matter at can understand only what be revealed to replied isabel grant be little yet be enough a many a love rebuke chasten ' what son be whom father chasteneth not how must be otherwise be wise father loving who must teach son nothing must forbear to rebuke for such folly a might hereafter be ruin isabel be silent philippa memory went back to old loveless day at arundel when for there
