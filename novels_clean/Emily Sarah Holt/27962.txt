chaff with woollen rug over baby be already asleep agnes laid gently on one of woollen rug while ermine to derette amazement knelt prayed for time derette took scarcely five minute to prayer why must require more when notion of prayer be not to make request for what wanted to one who must give to to gabble over one creed six paternoster doxology with a much rapidity a must persuade lip to utter word then in five minute after few rapid motion derette drew woollen rug over very quickly knew nothing more for night at least city of oxford a then inhabited be considerably smaller than be now wall ran roughly speaking on north from castle to holywell street on east little lower than end of merton street thence on south to other side of castle beyond wall house extended northward somewhat further than to beaumont street southward about way to friar bacon tower oldest church in city be saint peter in east be originally built in reign of alfred university sermon used to be delivered in stone pulpit of church there be royal palace in oxford built by henry first who styled le beau mont stood in stockwell street nearly on site of present workhouse have not be visited by royalty since when baby be born in destined to become mighty man of valour to be known to age a king richard coeur de lion in king edward second bestowed on white friar now remains of be small portion of wall built into workhouse really great man of city be earl of oxford at time aubrey de vere first holder of title have be married to lady who be near relative of king stephen second present countess though of good family came from lower grade modern idea of castle be often inaccurate be not always single fortified mansion consisted quite a frequently of embattled wall surrounding several house usually including church castle of oxford be of latter type church of saint george being on western side keep of castle be occupied by garrison though generally contained two three special chamber for use of owner must necessity oblige family to take refuge there in last extremity entrance be dexterously contrived particularly when fortress consisted of single house to present a much difficulty a possible to besieger be always at height in wall be reached by winding rather rambling stairway leading from drawbridge often running round considerable part of wall one more gate in course of stair must be closed at pleasure large imposing portal admitted visitor to small tower occupied by guard through real entrance be approached stood in thickness of outer wall be protected by pair of gate portcullis just inside be porter lodge on ground floor soldier be lodged on midmost be state family apartment while uppermost accommodated household servant attendant special tower be usually reserved for lady of family be often accompanied by tiny garden in partition wall well be dug must be reached on floor below vestibule be dungeon great banqueting hall be general sitting room to one in castle have access here be common for family servant guard to take together two principal meal dinner at nine be supper at four five o'clock only distinction observed be that board trestle for family guest be set up on dais for household garrison below table be arranged in form of horse shoe diner sitting on outer larger side while servant waited on inner lady have beside own private sitting room always attached to bedchamber known a bower to stranger be rarely admitted here sat sang gossiped worked endless embroidery day be scarcely yet over when english needlework bore palm in europe even in east while first illuminators be monk of ireland lady be spinner weaver surgeon reader of day be great at interpreting dream dearly loved flower gentleman looked upon reading a occupation quite a effeminate a sewing war hunting being two main employment of lord of creation gambling chief amusement priest monk be exception to rule until henry first introduced taste for somewhat more liberal education even more respectful to letter be grandson henry second who have fancy for resembling grandfather in thing yet allowed education of son to be thoroughly neglected popular idea that university of oxford be older than king alfred be scarcely borne out by modern research that there be kind of school there in alfred day be certain nothing like university arose before time of henry first impetus founded came from outside frenchman with scotch education jewish rabbi be two men to whom more than others must be traced existence of university of oxford theodore d'etampes secular priest apparently chaplain of queen margaret of scotland arrived at oxford about year where taught class of scholar from sixty to hundred in number thing call science came there with jew who settled under shadow of saint frideswide shortly after conquest hebrew astronomy astrology geometry mathematics be taught by at hostel of lombard hall moses hall jacob hall while law theology humanity engaged

henry second revived protected school in churchyard outside west door of saint mary church scrivener binder illuminators parchmenters occupying school street ran thence towards city wall special glory of oxford at time be not university shrine of saint frideswide have existed from eighth century when royal maiden whom celebrated after declining to fulfil contract of matrimony father have made for a be much too holy to be married have added insult to injury by miraculously inflicting blindness on disappointed lover when attempted to pursue have however grace to restore sight on due apology being made becoming prioress of convent founded died therein on october th day be afterwards held a gaudy day possibly because indignant lover be king be held ominous for monarch to enter chapel of saint frideswide in convent church king john who be a superstitious on point a be profane on others never dared to pas threshold father being gifted with more common sense be present at translation of saint in bone of saint frideswide still sleep in christ church at reformation be purposely mingled with of katherine vermilia wife of peter martyr on grave where two be interred be carved inscription here lieth religion with superstition of course object of be to prevent further worship of relic a must be impossible to discern bone of saint from of heretic be not improbable that be good woman according to light saint be assuredly far le enlightened to common sense apart from tradition sentiment be difficult to understand why certain group of person who lived in age when education be very limited superstition prejudice very rife spirituality almost dormant taste for childish folly useless hair splitting commonest thing in literature must be singled out for special reverence a saint under honourable name of father be deemed higher authority in respect to interpretation of holy writ than far more intelligent often far more spiritual writer of later date if curious hero worship be confined to generation immediately following apostle must be little more intelligible a such men might possibly have derived of idea from apostolic oral teaching to who know history of early age of christianity be not blinded by prejudice be simply amazing that authority of such men a basil cyprian jerome must be held to override that of spiritual giant of puritan era of who have deeply reverently studied scripture in own time to appeal to view held by such men a decisive of burning question of day be like referring matter of grave import to judgment of little child instead of consulting men of ripe experience know what followed similar blunder on part of king rehoboam yet how often be repeated must seem that not only be prophet accepted in own country also in own day note saint martin well stood in junction of four way from carfax take name note penniless bench ran along east end of carfax church be original of penniless bench be not always occupied by idle vagrant for sometimes scholar of university used to congregate there a well a corporation of city note christian believed at date chapter two valiant for faith a labourer in thy vineyard send out christ to be content to bear burden of weariness for thee ask other wage when thou shalt call home to have shared travail make thy kingdom come be popularly supposed that surname only came into existence with reign of king john be not quite accurate assertion existed from conquest be chiefly personal apart from great feudal family only began at date to consolidate crystallise into hereditary name so far a common people be concerned in reign of henry second man surname be usually restricted to be named either from one of parent a john william son john fitz mildred from habitation a john by brook from calling a john tanner from peculiarity in costume a john whitehood in person a john fairhair in mind a john lovegood in taste a john milk sop in habit a john drinkdregs if removed from one place to be likely to change name to become known say at winchester a john de nottingham if father be priest who be well known person must not improbably be styled john fiz al prester note will readily be seen that majority of name be not likely to descend to second generation son of john william son must be henry john son henry alice son might might not retain personal name trade name place name probably must inherit explains reason why so large majority of modern surname be place name whether in respect of town a nottingham debenham brentwood of country locality a brook lane hill etcetera now then series of john in regular descent must fix name of johnson on family son grandson pursuing same calling a father must turn line into tanner surname have arisen in such manner friend in kepeharme lane knew nothing of surname otherwise than personal apart from great territorial family of norman immigration who brought place name with manning brown be so termed from complexion elder son not being specially remarkable be known merely a romund fitz manning younger in boyhood of somewhat impetuous temper have conferred on epithet of haimet escorceueille burntown elder brother of manning be dubbed

than down to old berthold who carried weight of threescore fifteen year friend said gerhardt let speak to god before say anything to other knelt gerhardt poured forth fervent prayer that god must be with aid in work have undertaken that must supply with bread to eat raiment to put on that must keep door of lip that must speak guile discourtesy error yet open mouth that with boldness might preach word that none of might be ashamed to confess faith of christ crucified seek to hide offence of cross for sake of pleasing men whole hearted amen be response from group around rose gerhardt repeated by heart three psalm fifteenth forty sixth ninetieth not in latin in sonorous german many of compatriot taking up word repeating with in style made plain that be very familiar then gerhardt spoke will

asked gerhardt looking round upon with rather compassionate smile god grant may be so now friend must further remind not that ye know not that ye may bear importance in mind that beyond belief common to christian faith confesses three great doctrine ye must teach first that holy scripture alone containeth thing necessary to salvation nothing be to be taught a article of faith what god have

never have nought of head piece returned isel have heard mother tell have twenty walloping ere must make say paternoster never must learn nought else save joy aggerum what do mean by aggerum mother inquired haimet well be that what call aggerum adjerum such outlandish name be little word that prayer begin with deus in adjutorium ' said gerhardt quietly haimet seemed exceedingly amused have attended school long enough to learn latin sufficient to interpret common prayer psalm formed private devotion of most educated people be because mother have wished to be priest having now in own estimation arrived at year of discretion declined calling chosen for preferring a said to go into business have accordingly be bound apprentice to moneter money changer poor isel have mourned bitterly over desertion to mind a to of most people in day priesthood be highest calling must be attained by middle class man while trade be very mean despicable occupation far below domestic service recognised however that haimet be exception to most rule be likely to take own way despite of isel own lack of education be almost a unusual a haimet possession of at time learning be in hand of clergy monastic order woman by joy meant doxology english version of substituted joy for glory while adjutorium denoted two response follow lord prayer in morning service o god make speed to save o

application for good night time to stay mabel oh be right farewell romund shut door disappeared deary that seems done of hurry like said isel half like such sudden hasty sort of work derette child be sure will not be sorry think will mother will have more liberty in anchorhold than in nunnery more liberty quotha cried isel in amazement can child mean more liberty penned up in two little chamber never to leave life than in fine large place like godstowe with big garden cloister to walk in ah mother want liberty for foot for soul there will be abbess sister to tease one in anchorhold well what

best ermine there be rather sorrowful intonation in voice will wait till morning do a desire be ermine reply must give answer to night for know what will be best way prepared way be that lead straightest home be very evident when morning arrived that gerhardt must much have liked ermine to accept lowly safe sheltered position of companion to derette in anchorhold while hermit lived alone wandered about at will anchorite who be never allowed to leave cell always have with companion of own sex through whom communicated with outer world visitor of same sex child must enter cell freely anchorite might speak through window to person derette therefore must really be le cut off from society of friend in anchorhold than must have be a cloistered sister at godstowe where must only have be permitted to see at most once in year outside threshold of cell might never step save for imminent peril of life a in case of fire must live there die there sole occupation found in devotional exercise sole pleasure in friend visit few sight must see from window through tiny slit into chancel of church of saint john baptist know a chapel of merton college anchorhold be built close to church

wearing certain uniform person must be regarded a so sacred that who dared to molest must be man of rare exceptional wickedness be something also to be sure even moderately sure of provision for bodily need during life something to know that if sudden accident must deprive her of service of only companion world deemed so good deed to serve that woman whom might summon through little window must consider honoured benefited by being allowed to minister to even in meanest manner loss of liberty be much assuaged compensated by being set against such advantage a recluse be considered holiest of nun not to say of woman countess of oxford must have held degradation to serve in need derette must dearly have liked to secure companionship of ermine saw plainly that be not to be when morning

accorded to aliz de norton at time be of extreme rarity le used than in saxon day far le than at subsequent date under later plantagenet only woman who enjoyed a of right be queen wife of king son countess baroness for at period sole title known to peerage be of baron earl duke be still sovereign title entirely foreign one epithet of dame lady be also prerogative of few abbess who held rank of baroness very commonly however be applied to daughter of sovereign to abbess prioress recluse to earl daughter be matter rather of courtesy than of right beyond general epithet of lord there be definite title of address even for monarch appropriation of such term a grace highness excellence majesty serenity belongs to much later date sir however be always restricted to knight dame be most respectful form of address must be offered to woman however exalted might be rank knight be above peer even king receiving additional honour from knighthood equivalent title of dame doe not seem to have be regularly conferred on wife till about though might be given in case a matter of courtesy at rather earlier period perceiving exalted friend isel went forward a quickly a be in to receive with possible cordiality to usher to best place in chimney corner aliz greeted family pleasantly with shade of constraint towards german guest for few minute talked conventional nothing a be custom of who meet only occasionally then aliz said came to day isel for two reason have here first do know of vacant situation for young woman isel must hing in hurry more especially if mental process be involved

there must be no more to wish for holiness of anchorite be deemed to run over upon maid young woman who wore semi conventual garb of person be safe from insult sure of help in time of need youngest sister go into saint john anchorhold next month said haimet have not yet procured maid for so be destiny said aliz with smile to derette well be blessed calling manner however added that have particular desire to be blessed in fashion must be very thing for leuesa pursued will send down to talk with truly must be very thankful to choice soul to whom be given rare virtue of such holy self sacrifice aliz spoke feeling of day must see bliss for woman except in marriage set single life on pinnacle of holiness misery not to be reached by ordinary men woman virtue of self denying people who sacrificed by adopting be supposed to be paid into ecclesiastical treasury to form kind of set off against day shortcoming of inferior married folk therefore aliz expressed gratitude for prospect a affording extra opportunity of doing duty by proxy derette be in advance of age be not sacrificing said be pleasing must not like to be wife oh what saintly creature must be cried aliz clasping hand in admiration that can prefer holy life be given to few indeed to attain that height holy life doe not consist in dwelling in one chamber suggested gerhardt in refraining from matrimony dwelleth in god in secret place of most high be man be holy must be well for gerard friend observed aliz freezingly not to be quite so ready in offering strange fancy on religious topic be aware that priest of city have sent up memorial concerning to lord bishop that have be laid before king strawberry gerhardt tool be just then rounding be not quite so perfect round a neighbour laid tool down hand held carving trembled slightly did not know said in low voice thank for warning fear there may be penance inflicted on resumed aliz not unkindly wisest course for must be at once to submit not even to attempt excuse gerhardt looked up look struck who saw there be in little surface trouble under look of such perfect peace sweet acceptance of divine will a have never before beheld there will be penance laid on said that father will not help to bear have only to take next step whether lead into home at bethany judgment hall of pilate garden of god lie beyond aliz looked at a if be speaking foreign tongue gerard said do hope have foolish idea of braving out censure of bishop such action must not only be sin must be worst policy imaginable holy church be always merciful to who abase before who own folly humbly bow to rebuke have mercy on rebel who persist in rebellion stubborn opinionated men who in incredible folly presumption imagine capable of correcting answered gerhardt in same low voice have mercy then hope see how very foolish impossible must be for to adopt other course than of instant complete submission urged aliz in kinder tone gerhardt rose from seat faced meaning be kind said conscientious also desire glory of church also feel pity for suffering of human creature who dissent from be crushed under wheel of triumphal car thank for pity in land where one cup of cold water goeth not without reward may be that even passing impulse of compassion be not forgotten before god may at least call down earthly blessing for way be clear before have to go straight forward thank god know duty doubt be worse than pain indeed be thankful too said aliz a rose to take leave that must do duty be thing desire well isel lady keep will send leuesa down to morrow next day aliz departed rest began to think of bedtime isel sent girl upstairs then haimet followed agnes went at last gerhardt sat on eye fixed on cold hearth be evident that regarded news have

child exile a be orphan cast on great heart of merciful trust be given to mean to fulfil depends on leave of thy lord depends on nothing of sort sware to dead father of boy must protect from hurt sware well then said elder jew oath must be fulfilled cohen depends on circumstance returned rabbi in jesuitical wise for instance if countess sware by idol of goy be void if sware by troth faith such thing may be doubtful might require synod of rabbins to determine if sware by holy one blessed be then oath must stand of course daughter thou have boy circumcised bring up a proselyte of israel

about image flounder about a if did not know what to say well see know one o ' two have only be told other oh yes see be not first who have have one religion for sunshiny weather for rainy day only that with different from most people wear best robe in storm david rubbed face upon sleeve of jacket a if wished to rub more discrimination into brain nay know hope have call to say that usually say what think there be need to fret have time to mend woman noticed that for few day after david be very silent thoughtful when sunday came excused from going to church much to surprise perplexity of wife day after asks for holiday did not return till late at night a sat round fire on following evening david said suddenly think have found out what asked mistress puzzle own too let have key by mean if posse well have be to see hermit of holywell say be holiest man within reach of london go what way will have read bit out of book seems to settle matter at least thought so maybe might see so easy take more than fair word to convince however let hear what be what be book must like to know that first said be epistle written by paul apostle to somebody ca just remember whom who be why be one of saint be know there be mention of in book david looked like man stopped unexpectedly in rapid career always want to know so much about thing said rubbing face on sleeve a have habit of doing when puzzled now never thought to ask before can act on message from superior must surely satisfy a to credential of messenger however let hear message perhaps may tell something thing bear on face evidence of what be still more of what be not well what read be if thou shalt confess with thy mouth lord jesus shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised from dead thou shalt be saved look ' saith there be word here of body else if thou shalt confess ' not saint image church priest baptism ' saith be confessing ' then turned over leaf read bit from place how lord said come unto ye

easy enough never come to christ ' saith so be like to be a easy to come to christ without priest well ' say priest doe say so ' say ' quite short like for can see in book ' say doe ' go on said countess eagerly when david paused well then hope will excuse if said more than must say to now look here father suppose have somebody coming to for advice have be jew like be ready to believe in lord must not put up with image such must turn away because must not believe enough must baptise ' must baptise ' saith then turn over book again read believe on lord jesus christ thou shalt be saved be what apostle said to one man ' say if be enough then be enough now ' ' say that sound rather a if thought church might go wrong have gone wrong in putting thing beside lord son ' saith what meanest thou by church holy ghost can not teach error men in church may go wrong be continually wandering into error what said lord to ruler of jew who be priest of day ye do err not knowing scripture book be truth when men leave book ' saith go astray ' not holy church ' said ah ' saith elect may stray from fold how much more be stranger there only safe place for one of ' say be to keep close to side of

drew off hood sat down in chimney corner found then answered david have much trouble found never mind trouble have settled puzzle for then think settled for ask pardon understand suppose do countess said christian coming down ladder bought herring a bade there be salt salmon in market to day to whom be speaking inquired countess with expression of fun about corner of lip replied christian in surprise then perhaps will have goodness to call by christian name be sarah o countess have be baptised have by hermit by hermit how how with water what did expect at once without preparation what

ethiopian eunuch have sponsor know who be suppose hermit did probably made a true christian for ' in truth ' said institution of sponsor seems good for little child friend who promise to see that will be brought up good christian if parent die early for woman of age be simply absurd wo have let confess christ a messiah lord baptise with water in name be sure will be satisfied with if of saint angel be not satisfied can come down say so if think worth while ' so a saw suppose be not going to do gave in hope be right said david rather uneasily david wish must put little sense into be good man be very foolish one right ' of course be all right be man not god who start at trifle like frightened horse make men offender for word lord looketh on heart ay moses on whom be peace be particular enough about detail look very trifling to be particular enough where concerned honour of god where formed part of symbolism alteration must cause to be wrongly interpreted so a to teach untruth for else let go so did lord when aaron explained why have not eaten goat of sin offering moses be content did christ condemn david king excused for eating shewbread be sure moses must have baptised morning without waiting for sponsor lucca oil be very silly world must have thought church might have be trifle wiser really seems to have le common sense of two how must have found sponsor must like to know know nobody christian told when be baptised that church did not allow husband wife to be sponsor to same person so must not have stood for must have have to be christian rudolph other woman rudolph that baby note must have let stand yes if must not find one else promise to bring up in catholic faith well if be not rich when have got to bring up will tell what david if benevolent saint must put little common sense into church must be blessing to somebody church be weary of ceaseless parrot scream church stand in way to jesus of nazareth not a door to go in a wall to bar out wish have lived in earlier day before rubbish have have time to grow now mind concluded countess a rose to go to bed david christian mean to be bothered about talk to to rudolph to body else will read book teach to do

old fellow said stephen rubbing ear process to gib responded with loud purr have seen man to day who be afraid to touch think must do much to must now be nice go on replied gib purring away leuesa lost time in coming to see ermine brought two little girl of whom elder aged five year immediately fell in love with baby while younger aged three being too much of baby to regard infant with sentiment disdain bestowed delicate attention upon gib stephen declared laughingly that saw must keep pasty well really doe look very like cat said mercer eyeing gib still little doubtfully very like indeed replied stephen laughing again never saw anything that looked more like one there be more than one at oxford must like to see ermine stephen too said leuesa mother isel must derette be ermine answer be not so sure of one else be sure of one else interpolated stephen must be perfect windfall to anania for 'd get talk out of for nine time nine day must be safe think why not answered roscius earl have nought against have oh have nought against settled thing with went back on purpose to do so be thinking of ermine bishop be not same note for aught know sumner be only one of malger went to lincoln two year back well must be glad not to meet villain said stephen will not meet then a to other matter what must do to her sentence be carried out ca execute man twice be point doe not generally rise for decision see got taken in be forbidden be never meant to survive did believe penalty must fall on said roscius if like will ask cousin who be lawyer what law have to say on matter then mention ermine name will mention nobody name will only say that friend of mine be having chat talking of one thing fell wondering what must happen if man be to survive punishment intended to kill might serve mind if do law in be much more dependent on personal will of sovereign than be now lawyer looked little doubtful when asked question why said if prisoner have survived by apparent miracle chance be that must be pardoned a probability must be that innocence be thus proved by visitation of god once knew of such case where woman be accused of murdering husband held mute of malice at trial be adjudged to suffer peine forte et dure when prisoner refused to plead be held to be mute of malice peine forte et dure be recognised punishment for misdemeanour be practically starvation to death in earlier day seems to have be pure starvation at later period more refined torture be substituted of allowing unhappy man on alternate day three mouthful of bread with liquid three sip of water with food for term sufferer must not be expected to survive at later time again be exchanged for heavyweight under be pressed to death strange to say lawyer went on woman survived sentence being undoubted miracle received pardon to laud of god honour of glorious mother dame mary case really happened at nottingham in if be supposing case without such miraculous intervention oh be thinking of miracle way answered roscius then must say sentence must remain in force there be of course faint possibility that might not be put in force if man came to for advice must not counsel to build much upon especially if happened to have enemy well doe not seem just to thinking that man must suffer penalty twice over just repeated lawyer with laugh shrug of shoulder be under impression cousin roscius that law justice be interchangeable term certainly be said roscius then 'd better get out of be retort dare take ermine after said stephen rather sorrowfully only hope must be that might be so changed nobody must know then a wife might pas unharmed risk seems too great be scarcely changed enough for replied leuesa very likely must not be recognised by to whom be comparative stranger such a have known well must guess in moment otherwise then name must tell tale suggested stephen oh might change said roscius call emma aymeria folk must never think tell lie responded stephen why 'd never call that telling lie surely be bit too like to please be father dolfin still at saint frideswide ay be still there be growing old man doe not get outside much now have resigned saint aldate then that settle 'd know be not unkindly man stephen be be priest maybe priest might be stronger than man let keep on safe side let wait said ermine quietly see how waiting be to help unless wait till body be dead buried wo be much good going then perhaps may have to wait for better country there will be sumner sentence there be sure of knowing folk there saint paul must scarcely have anticipated meeting friend with joy in resurrection if be not to know other when met there be many passage in scripture make very plain that will know other be so sure of getting there be query put by roscius with raised eyebrow be quite sure be ermine calm answer because christ be there be part of christ will that people will be with where be doe not holy church teach rather different note stephen must fain have turned off question be answered a calmly a before holy church be built on christ lord can not therefore teach contrary to though may misunderstand roscius be satisfied have not however least idea by vague term holy church while meant handful of priest bishop ermine meant elect of god for whom word settle question who be not apt to trouble for contradiction of priest critic for world passeth away lust thereof pleasure opinion prejudice of world doeth will of god abideth for ever time of henry second knew post office carrier when man wanted to send parcel anywhere be obliged to carry send servant to do so if must not find acquaintance journeying in direction who must save trouble few week after stephen have come to conclusion that must not take ermine to oxford be passing down bread

whistling for moment might work two thing together might at least pay visit to derette learn from how far be safe to go on felt that anania be chief danger osbert must placidly accept a much a little a chose to tell isel if asked question might be easily turned aside from path must be sure that anania be out of way thought must not hesitate to go though no longer dared to contemplate taking ermine well might mayhap be going in direction afore long ca just say till see how thing shape if can will let know in few day right be in hurry to week two stephen meditated on subject in interval of superintendence of oven serving out wassel cocket with result that when evening came be almost determined to go if ermine found good reason to contrary consulted when went home for be not at shop that day looked grave at first confidence in stephen discretion be great made serious objection sooner however did child hear of possibility a father visiting country than down to three year old edild sent in petition to be allowed to accompany must be thought of be stephen decided though good tempered answer petitioner succumbed with look of disappointment might perchance have taken gerard stephen allowed to wife out of boy hearing to tell truth be afraid of anania hearing name though a like a not will question on name of child who be called after why selected if be choice mine better not think said ermine with smile almost wish must be hidden behind curtain to hear talk with stephen laughed well wo deny that rather enjoy putting spoke in wheel said next morning told odinel to make up good

done what must ' chapter thirteen historical appendix sorrowful story of gerhardt mission be told by william of newbury ranulph de diceto seems strange that company of thirty german peasant must have

said to have shown detestation for sacrament for marriage compared with similar accusation brought against albigenses reply thereto almost certainly mean that objected to corrupt view of institution

almost in same sentence be told that have wife with when scripture be urged against german declined disputation probably saw that must be of avail indeed what good must be gained by disputing with men who confessed that received scripture only on authority of church held superior to word of god who allowed explanation of save own private interpretation who be so illogical a to urge that church existed before scripture a reason for superiority so ignorant a to maintain that pulai adou signified power of satan asked if must do penance german refused threatened with penalty held firm
