invention of wife of doge of venice about two hundred year previous for piece of refinement public rewarded lady by considering a proud a lucifer fork existed in form of spice fork fire fork one ever thought of eating with in england until be introduced from italy in reign of james first for time after that use of marked traveller luxurious effeminate man moreover there be knife spoon provided for helping one self from dish person have knife spoon for with helped at convenience people who be very delicate particular wiped knife on piece of bread before doing so licked spoon over when be practice of fastidious people proceeding of who be not such may be discreetly left to imagination second table be served in much more ordinary manner in instance knife be iron spoon pewter plate wooden trencher never changed drinking cup of horn in midst of table stood pewter salt cellar formed like castle very much larger than use now salt cellar acted a barometer not for weather for rank one of noble blood filling certain office sat above salt with respect to cooking father have peculiarity ate many thing that never touch such a porpoise heron used manner of green thing a vegetable liked bread hot from oven to give cold bread even for dinner be shabby proceeding meat much underdone for thought that overdone meat stirred up anger mixed most incongruous thing together loved very strong taste delighting in garlic verjuice never appear to have paid slightest regard to digestion be in most emphatic sense not teetotaller dining hall not table be decorated with flower singer often placed in gallery at one end be employed whole time gentleman usher acted a butler yeoman be always at hand to keep out strange dog snuff candle light to bed guest who be not always in condition to find way upstairs without help hour at time be nine ten o'clock for dinner except on fast day when be at noon three four for supper two meal day be thought sufficient for men who be not invalid sick

breakfast especially for old very delicate exceptionally temperate people took milk for breakfast though middle age present with example of vegetarian total abstainer yet of there be very few indeed be mainly to be found among religious order in watching illustrious person on dais one thing struck clarice a extremely odd must never be thought strange in nineteenth century be custom in day for husband wife to sit together at meal highest rank excepted to eat from same plate earl countess of cornwall be on opposite side of table with one of priest between clarice thought must have quarrelled softly demanded of heliet if be case indeed be heliet rather sorrowful answer at least not more than usual lady of cornwall will never sit beside baron a thou shalt shortly see will not even speak to not speak to exclaimed clarice never heard do so yet said heliet doe entreat very harshly there be few gentleman more kindly generous towards wife nay harsh treatment be on side what miserable life to live commented clarice fear find so said heliet dillegrout white soup be now brought in clarice being hungry attended more to supper than to mistress for time during next interval between course studied master be tall rather fine looking man with handsome face gentle pleasant expression there certainly be not in exterior cause for repulsion hair be light eye bluish grey seemed clarice thought so at first silent man who left conversation very much to others decidedly intelligent glance of grey eye occasional twinkle of fun in when amusing remark be made showed that be not in least devoid of brain clarice thought that priest who sat between earl countess be far more unprepossessing individual than master be franciscan friar in robe of order while friar who sat on other side of countess be dominican much more agreeable to look at at juncture earl of lancaster who bore strong family likeness to cousin earl of cornwall likeness extended to character le than person inquired of latter if news have be heard lately from france have have letter lately replied host turning to countess asked have lady now thought clarice must speak to much to surprise countess imagining apparently that franciscan friar be questioner answered note none holy father friar gravely turned head repeated word to earl though must have heard clarice became aware at once that own puzzled face be source of excessive amusement to vi vi elaine eye inquired reason oh know said elaine in loud whisper across table know what perplexes thee be like when first come be such fun to watch did not succeed in repressing convulsion behind handkerchief even with aid of diana elaine do be sensible hush maid said mistress underdone gently if lady see thee laugh will be sent away without more supper know said elaine shrugging shoulder be clarice who ought to be punished not can not help laughing when look so funny elaine having succeeded in recovering gravity without attracting notice of countess clarice devoured helping of salt beef along with much cogitation concerning mistress singular way still must not restrain supposition that latter must have supposed priest to speak to when heard earl say hear from geoffrey spenser note that stock of salt ling be beyond what be like to be wanted villein might have cade two thereof lady again turning to friar countess made answer will be seen to holy father while friar with equal composure a though be quite matter of course repeated to earl lady will see to lord doe always answer so demanded clarice of heliet in astonished whisper always replied heliet with sad smile surely said clarice amazement getting better of shyness must be very wanting in reverence from dame to baron clarice idea of wifely duty be of very primitive kind unbounded reverence unreasoning obedience diligent care for husband comfort pleasure be main item a for love in sense in be usually understood now be item simply might come into question be not necessary by mean parent at time kept out of matter a much a possible regarded a more of encumbrance than anything else be very sad tale clarice answered heliet in low tone love must cherish dearly if must let there be not love in when be young maid almost child set heart on being nun think have never forgiven baron for being innocent mean of preventing scarcely know of be more to be pitied oh surely exclaimed clarice nay be not so sure god help who be unloved far more god help who can not love think deserves more compassion of two may be answered clarice slowly thought be running so fast that word came with hesitation what shouldst thou say to one have outlived sorrowful love now thought happy chance that have turned out contrary thereto must depend upon how have outlived responded heliet gravely heard one say not many day gone remarked clarice not meaning to let heliet know from whom have heard that when be young loved squire of father did let from wedding with now be right thankful so be for be killed on field left never plack behind be far better off being now wed unto gentleman of wealth substance what shouldst thou say to if be one of kin to thee must a lief say nothing to be heliet rather dry rejoinder nay heed not must fain know then think squire may have loved so did never in good sooth said clarice told slept many night on wet pillow so have seen child have broken toy replied heliet smiling clarice saw pretty plainly that heliet thought state of thing be not love at how else can love be outlived said love can not sorrow may be folk say love sorrow be nigh same nay 't be sin sorrow that be nigh same selfishness be sin very much of what men do commonly call love be pure selfishness well never loved none yet remarked clarice god have mercy on thee answered heliet wherefore demanded clarice in surprise because said heliet softly that loveth not knoweth not god for god be charity ' art thou destined for cloister asked clarice only priest monk nun in eye have business to talk religiously might reasonably be expected to do so be destined to fulfil be god will for be be simple reply whether will be cloister have not yet learned clarice cogitated upon reply while ate stewed apple thou odd name said after pause what heliet asked bearer with smile be taken from name of holy prophet elye elijah of old time be mean other ah love not said heliet be very queer replied clarice with apologetic blush very odd underdone oh be not name answered heliet quickly with little laugh be quite a bad be pride clarice fancied have heard name before must not remember where why be bad said then reckon mistress underdone hath be twice wed hath said heliet answering last question first a people often do father be first husband why be pride evil surely thou knowest that oh know be one of seven deadly sin of course responded clarice quickly still be very necessary noble heliet smile expressed mixture of feeling clarice be not first person who have held one axiom theoretically have practically behaved according to lord saith that hate pride said lame girl softly how then can be necessary not to say noble oh clarice went further did not mean what said oh yes of course said clarice better drop said heliet quaintly father bevis be about to say grace dominican friar rose returned thanks for repast company broke up earl countess with guest leaving hall by upper door while household retired by lower preparation for sleep be almost a primitive a for meal exalted person such a earl countess slept in handsome bedstead of tent form hung with silk curtain spread

conceive two person might be drawn together by mutual taste for elevated innocent pursuit most wicked motif imaginable be recklessly suggested for attachment edward showed for chosen friend who be not of noble origin have handle to name till conferred be only through thick mist of ignorance prejudice that of day can see character of edward second read only in page of monk who hated lollard king in angry complaint of noble who be jealous that listened to bestowed gift on other men than do see faint glimpse of edward really be in letter book recently dug out of mass of state paper in page of de

cruelly snubbed for day after interference in behalf of graceless husband not in public for except in one instance of examination where sense of shame guilt have overcome for moment vivian company manner be faultless surface observer must have pronounced model husband poor clarice have learned by experience that restraint vivian put upon when inwardly vexed be sure to rebound on devoted head in form of after suffering in private to clarice reaction came soon severely on evening before rosie funeral heliet found seated by little bier in hall gazing dreamily on face of lost darling with dry eye strained expression sat down beside clarice took notice heliet scarcely knew how to deal with if something must be said must set tear flowing might save great suffering yet to say wrong thing might do more harm than good supper bell rang before have made up mind a rose clarice slipped hand into heliet arm to surprise of latter thanked for what said heliet for only thing one can do for for

again glided out of hall so softly that heliet did not hear go only looked up found alone knelt for few minute by bier then went quietly to own room next morning there be abundance of conjecture a to who must have paid tender graceful tribute earl be generally suspected at once said that be doing of everybody be asked denied father bevis be appealed to a being better acquainted with saint than rest of company to state whether thought probable that one of have be agent father bevis strong common sense declined to credit human hand with deed clarice be one of last to appear when sweet fair tribute to darling broke suddenly upon sight result be attained for have be more le hoping that touch of nature set floodgate open dropping on knee beside bier clarice poured forth rain of passionate

first agony to be content with seemed beyond human nature heliet laid hand on of friend dear must have have rosie suffer a have done for moment clarice mental eye ran forward over what must most likely according to human prevision have be course of rosie after life thought came to a with pang grew upon that future must have have easy lot in store for vivian barkeworth daughter must have disposed of without thought of own wish prayer tear from must have availed to turn from purpose be well with child thou art right said in pained voice be better for rosie a be for leave that with god

dost thou think be angel heliet have excuse in settling crutch for delaying reply for moment then said in low tone source of whose tenderness be well that clarice must not guess be not sure dear that be not if clarice suffering have be passive before began to be active now vivian made life torment to by jealousy on one hand positive cruelty on other yet manner in public be so carefully veiled in courtesy that not one of friend guessed how much really suffered a much time a must spent in oratory be only place where vivian left at peace under vague idea that must bring ill luck to interrupt one prayer unfortunately for clarice have caught glimpse of pier having conscientiousness in own composition must not imagine in of that pier must be at berkhamsted without at least making effort to open communication with clarice be idea vivian must have refused to entertain for moment for what other earthly purpose must be there vivian be man who have faith in human being in belief only possible mean to prevent clarice from running away with pier be to keep either in sight locked up when out of idea of trusting to principle must have struck a simply ridiculous sir pier however have completely disappeared a completely a though have never be seen after while vivian grew more confident not so particular about keeping key turned clarice knew why locked in why gave over doing so have have suspicion of reason indignation must not have be small public affair meanwhile maintained interest king marched army to scotland routed wallace troop in battle of falkirk success be somewhat

edward have never looked on action in other light than a piece of fun have father be concerned about sin committed against god exactly sin of boy who robs orchard might with le outward severity have produced far more wholesome impression on son what considered appears to have be merely dignity of prince be outraged by act of boy who bore title quiet grave exhortation might have done good imprisonment did none left on many mind impression that boy have be hardly used one striking feature in conduct of edward second be remarkable meekness submission with bore father angry outburst severe punishment often administered for mere youthful folly such a most father must think amply punished by strong lecture perhaps few stroke of cane edward first seems to have be one of men who entirely forget own childhood be never able in after life to enter into feeling of child majesty however have other matter to attend to beside provocation received from heir for in month of september following be married at canterbury to princess marguerite of france be case approaching that of rachel leah for be beautiful princess blanche for whom king have be in treaty marguerite be foisted on by process of crafty diplomacy not far removed from treachery however since marguerite though not so fair a sister proved better woman of two king have reason to be disappointed in end council of
