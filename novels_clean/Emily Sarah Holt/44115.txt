be made dost thou think marguerite to be served by thee to serve one else of course while damoiselle be young at home will serve monseigneur then when cavalier come who plea monseigneur good god will serve damoiselle afterwards be duty of good wife to serve lord of course noble villein must serve good god well thou hast settled easier than must do said margot dost thou never become tired of serving not now damoiselle what dost thou mean by ah there be time said marguerite thought blush burned on dear old face when be young silly maiden very very foolish damoiselle dost thou think maiden silly margot very few wise damoiselle foolish head be full of envious thought know that vain wish have be born noble lady instead of villein maiden thought scorn to serve must fain have be born to rule how very funny said never knew villein have notion of sort thought be quite content be noble damoiselle always quite content pardon why said then margot be noble noble may rightfully aspire villein ought to be satisfied with lot good god have marked out for with honour of serving noble house have damoiselle damoiselle have used deep strong word satisfy believe nothing will satisfy living heart of man woman except one thing what one thing be ignorant villein damoiselle know holy latin tongue a lady do now then father eudes will render word of blessed evangel into french in sermon did so that day when be satisfied what be that satisfied thee then margot be word father eudes said of good god when walked on middle earth among men 'come unto ' said 'all ye that labour be heavy laden will give rest ' understand marguerite how did word satisfy thee word did not damoiselle thing did just took blessed lord at word went to thanks be to holy name gave rest what dost thou mean margot will dear damoiselle not come try will want rest day have not better wait till be tired said laughingly ah yes never want rest till be tired not wait to come to merciful lord oh nay can not comprehend thee margot damoiselle be not likely to know how to come until want to do when doe want good god will hear damoiselle for heard servant didst thou entreat intercession of saint marguerite ah be ignorant old woman dear lord said unto thought perhaps meant so just went how couldst thou margot if please damoiselle did if have be angry suppose must not have heard how dost thou know did hear thee when damoiselle entreats monseigneur to give silver mark open purse give be possible for to doubt that have heard good god must have heard because gave rest understand margot what thou meanest by rest want to know about have thing given over puzzling thee be there light come upon seems to damoiselle if be not too bold in speaking poor thought go on said want to know then damoiselle seems to that there be two great light in may see thing in world first be fierce light like sun blind dazzle holy angel perchance can bear for stream from throne of god stand before throne can not mortal eye must be hidden in dread unapproachable light if mistake not be by light that damoiselle have hitherto tried to see thing wonder that eye be dazzled other light soothes enlightens be soft clear like moonlight stream from cross of calvary there good god paid down in red gold of own blood price of redemption must have be because thought worth while if paid price for poor villein woman like must have wanted damoiselle must not cast pearl into vienne for have paid thousand crown if cared enough about to give life for then must care enough to be concerned about welfare in lower world damoiselle must not refuse cup of water to to whom be willing to give precious gem herein lie rest what good god who thus love will for will for myself also marguerite might be something must break thine heart must blessed lord not know that think break heart be willing to be melt be heart harden like rock have to be broken thou wouldst not like something hurt thee not enjoy did damoiselle enjoy verdigris plaster apothecary put on when be ill three year ago yet did not think enemy friend ah good god have medicine chest hold smarting plaster bitter drug be better than to be ill damoiselle marguerite have idea thou wert such philosopher ah noble damoiselle be pleased to laugh at servant who doe not know what hard word mean there be nothing old marguerite know only how to come to blessed lord ask for rest gave rest knew how to do wonder if old marguerite be not truest philosopher of be evident that thing puzzle just because let alone leaf with god still be not knowing want to know oh wish must tell if be wicked to want to know wonder if truth be that there be thing can not know thing good god doe not tell not because wish to be ignorant because must not possibly make comprehend then why did not make wiser why doe let question perplex to can find answer think must be that doe not wish to find answer why will see what idea marguerite have about seems to get hold of wise notion in unintelligible way for of course be only villein can not have a much sense a noble there be that tiresome messire raymond in hall when went down be noble enough for mother mother be princess of carlovingian blood be sure have more sense than need way in say ah when tell anything just exasperates baron brother be shade better though will never wear laurel crown still doe not say ah descendant of charlemagne prize of intellect like younger brother in fact think like men of sort except guy of course monseigneur then other men be not like guillot amaury raoul rank with other men wonder if woman be very much better think be if be to look upon alix lady de montbeillard a sample oh dear wonder why hate people so must be because be hateful doe anybody think hateful how queer must be if did really do feel to night a if did not know whether be standing on foot on head can not realise one bit alix going to be married alix going away from castle to be only mistress there monseigneur called down into hall a stood picking dead leaf from rose bush for pot pourri there be one in hall well of course there be quantity of servitor retainer never count for anything mean there be nobody be anybody bade come up to drew close kissed on forehead stroked down hair what will cabbage say to what have to tell said be something pleasant monseigneur said now there thou posest answered yes in one light in in of two light thou wilt see yet know looked up into face waited dost thou like messire raymond de montbeillard monseigneur answered have then perchance thou wilt not like news messire raymond have something to do with thing well said be afraid rather saucily so long a doe not want to marry much care what doe monseigneur pinched ear kissed seemed extremely amused thee not just yet little cabbage not just yet suppose wanted to marry alix doe want to marry alix doe under good leave monseigneur well yes see good reason to contrary little cat be brave knight have fine castle be real carlovingian throughout france in middle age carlovingian blood be rated at extravagant value be donkey said real too have hush then replied monseigneur yet laughing patting cheek well well perhaps not overburdened with brain how sharp thou art child to be sure want of brain in direction good worthy man cabbage stalwart knight when be to be monseigneur asked in hurry to see fine dress demanded gracious lord laughed again nay think not till after christmas time enough then be in hurry to lose housekeeper canst thou keep house rabbit have have will there be anything for dinner have have have have be half frightened yet half delighted of course thought if alix go away umberge will come reign here nobody be likely to think old enough good enough under nobility good leave will see to said monseigneur answered by peal of laughter have have have showing talon be want to rule cabbage doe true woman on troth have have have if please monseigneur why must come short of dinner because see about gracious lord laughed more than ever reason at little rabbit reason at try thy hand by mean by mean so umberge doe not need to come have have have have certainly not for said rather piqued seriously little cat said face grew grave wouldst thou rather umberge did not come art thou not friend with oh a to friend so so la la said think must get along quite a well without middling wouldst

matter to must not have asked thee said trust will be for noble damoiselle welfare said must get to say more now margot tell something else said why doe good god not make thing clear to everybody what sayest thou have not told why damoiselle perhaps to teach damoiselle to trust there must be trust if always knew be not knowing better than trusting replied be responded marguerite doe monseigneur always take damoiselle into secret never require to trust god be great king of world king always have secret matter surely king of king must have state secret too seemed putting on new footing sat considered matter while marguerite took off dove cote unbound hair rich network confined hair often of gold precious stone still see why may not know everything said at last doe damoiselle remember what stood in midst of beautiful garden of god wherein adam eva be put to dwell tree of knowledge said true doe not help to why why might adam eva not eat will damoiselle pardon think doe help to why not to why of why be what always want to see why adam eva might not eat suppose be because good god forbade why marguerite why have be not good god see one bit said surely knowledge be good thing

why good god ever let satan be at said see how satan came to be satan to begin with blessed lord know about said marguerite when damoiselle be little child be sure did not understand why gave bitter medicine apothecary knew can damoiselle not leave question with good lord want answered margot cried impatiently if knew must understand when be dead must not so much mind waiting know thing like well

long while be dressing did not attend to order to have bread hot at last minute can not be where how jewel be set in linen sheet be mystery there be abundant evidence of fact ornamental centre piece be considered of consequence that bread at feast must be a new a possible gracious lord did not blame asked umberge together how happened that thing be wrong declare if umberge did not say elaine have ordering of monseigneur will please to ask be afraid lost temper for said yes monseigneur have ordering of for fair sister took care of thing if must have have three pair of hand be in six place at

turn out till come to live with said alix so be not so very glad after to lose little one be startled for never supposed that alix have guessed that did not know what to say why child did think have eye added know be glad did what generally do hesitated for moment then came out bluntly with truth well alix be glad be not now alix laughed be right said always tell plain truth elaine will find many time a go through life child that prettiest pasty be not always best flavoured plainest say worst to wear common quality of silk suppose be so never must have guessed must be wishing for alix to come

one thing for be thankful be that good lord have not given much of own way must have be very bad for perhaps for villein might said noble be different possibly even for noble said good lord might be best chooser seems to if left everything in way must never pray at let damoiselle pardon that have full trust in friend wisdom be scarcely reason why must not ask counsel friend can not know what advice need lord know about doe damoiselle never tell thought to monseigneur guy because know that be likely to think that oh be such pleasure to tell one thought to guy replied generally think a do when doe not talk thing over with usually end in thinking a doe then if be sad comfort if be rejoicing rejoices with margot be like talking to damoiselle said marguerite with peculiar smile have seen

put best thing into head thou knowest ' night before go to sleep last thing say in heart beir god know what be good what be evil for thou knowest give good thing to night keep evil one away suppose if be very wise clever must not make such poor ignorant prayer must know then what must be best to do yet think must be better off for then must see so much le of good lord must rather have more of good god le of quick wit ready tongue though title will certainly sound strange if not irreverent to modern ear be meant a most reverent epithet known to who used must be nice to feel a margot doe can not think where got must never do for who be noble to take pattern from poor villein suppose such thought be good for low ignorant people what must have done if have be born villein can not imagine what must feel like be very glad be not of course can not tell what must feel like because noble have thought feeling of quite different sort to common people suppose guy must say be one of queer notion always say more queer idea come into head than one else o guy guy when will see thee again two whole year not word from thee art thou languishing in paynim dungeon hast thou fallen in battle have beautiful lady come thy little lynette be forgotten have be asking father eudes to tell something about holy land for want to be able to picture to myself place where guy be of course father eudes can tell for know about thing have uncle who be holy palmer visited blessed sepulchre used to tell most beautiful legend say about holy land beside own father fought for sepulchre in second crusade dwelt in country for several year father eudes say be nearly hundred year since kingdom of jerusalem be founded for be in year of lord at time of first crusade first king be gallant count godefroy of boulogne who be unanimously chosen by christian warrior after holy city be taken must never call king only defender of holy sepulchre ala good king godefroy only reigned one year on death prince assembled in church of holy sepulchre also call temple to elect successor because there be great contention among resolved to decide choice by lot stood around tomb of lord holding long taper

robert courthose son of lord william norman who conquered england to horror of prince duke robert blew out taper refused to be king said that be not worthy to wear crown of gold in place where for sin

year lady ida sister who be very wise preux lady have son reigned after uncle for thirteen year yet at death left four daughter son father eudes think that showed displeasure of lord who have willed that kingdom of jerusalem must belong to lord king of england wickedly refused to receive brave noble chivalrous for of course be bounden duty of christian men to rescue holy land out of hand of paynim jew such horrible heretic who worship devil bow down to stock stone since land belonged to lord jesus christ who be king of by holy mary mother died seised of same for reason christian men who be right heir of said lord ought to recover inheritance in land not leave in hand of wicked heretic who have right to at since be not child right heir of jesus christ lord singular reasoning be borrowed from sir john mandeville well when king beaudouin ii be dead holy land fell to eldest of four daughter who be named lady melisende wedded count foulques of anjou from king since then have come so now seems settled in line of anjou suppose lord king of england therefore have right to more can not help feeling sorry duke robert blew out taper must not have done if have be mine think to

gave benediction though did try to keep a much to windward of a must put sprig of lavender in handkerchief before asked for be rather afraid father eudes must say be wicked of to put sprig of lavender

shell denoted pilgrim to shrine of st james of compostella cross key to rome bell to canterbury hence canterbury bell cross to holy sepulchre fleming wore green cross french red english white one proverbial red cross knight therefore strictly speaking must not be englishman wonder if angel like smell think disagreeable if do of course must account for yet one can not imagine angel with soiled

that be rose went away of course must be for welfare must go to guy get appointment in household of one of princess see life well know about getting married might not have so much of own way like dearly besides if be married must not be always with guy think wo on whole asked marguerite to night if must tell why holy people did not wash said thought did well said yonder holy palmer have not

heterodoxy asked laughing let damoiselle pardon servant did not monseigneur saint paul say that men must wash body with pure water be sure know said always thought holier be dirtier be one reason why always thought too must never be holy must want hand face clean at least did damoiselle think must never be holy yes did margot do wherefore let forgive poor servant oh holiness seems to mean sort of unpleasant thing said must not wash lie on comfortable bed wear anything nice dance sing have pleasure want to be holy really must not do with margot under damoiselle leave thing have mentioned seem to to be outside thing unless mistake for be ignorant creature holiness must be something inside soul be inside of to clean soul must have something will go inside to inside principle will be sure to put outside thing straight will not see what outside thing can do to inside except sometimes make cross then be who be wrong not dost thou suppose be wicked to be cross margot damoiselle father eudes once read list of good thing that true christian ought to have in heart there be nine of 'love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance ' think one can not have many of when one be cross peevish then thou dost not think sinful to delight in fine clothes jewel lie in soft bed have dainty for dinner for be outside have yes damoiselle be world substitute for happiness now what dost thou mean margot laughed have not good thing be not happy ah yes happy damoiselle be not happy why what wilt thou say next cried will damoiselle permit poor servant to ask question oh yes anything thou wilt then be damoiselle quite certain safely happily certain what will become of when will die o margot what ugly question hate to think of why suppose will go to heaven why must not all noble go there except who be very very wicked have hate to think of wherefore why everybody doe of course let damoiselle pardon not oh thou art old woman hast outlived thy youth pleasure wonder damoiselle will find a life go on that older grows more distasteful that thought becomes to be unless must learn to be happy may good god grant must not help laughing heartily for young noble maiden like to take lesson of forlorn old creature like margot in art of being happy did seem so very ridiculous ah damoiselle may laugh now said marguerite in quiet way have told sober truth oh dear said think have better sleep on margot art thou not very much pleased at thought of going to holy land ah yes damoiselle very much must dearly like to behold earth foot of blessed lord have trodden lake on walked hill from went up ah 'he will so come ' 'this same jesus looked at in astonishment worn old face sunken eye seemed alight with hidden rapture must not understand holy sepulchre said for be holiest of holy place a everybody know well must not so much care to see that answered marguerite to surprise 'he be not there be risen ' if dear friend of mine have gone on journey must not make pet of saddle on rode away must rather want not to see for must always remind that be gone marguerite exclaimed dost thou not know that neuvaine offered at holy sepulchre be of more efficacy than ten offered at other altar will damoiselle give leave to wait till see of course if good god choose to have so there be end of matter think must rather be sure for must like to pray in church of nativity to thank for coming a little babe into weary world in church of ascension to beg to hasten coming again ah church of ascension said there be pillar in church nearly close to wall man who can creep between wall pillar have full remission of sin be that in holy evangel asked marguerite must not tell fancy there may be mistake about added of course if be in holy evangel doe not look quite of piece with what father eudes read read one day out of writing of monseigneur saint john that blood of jesus christ blessed lord cleansed from sin time think said be from evangel of monseigneur saint matthew read that if man did ask good god for salvation must be given well asked gave must give anything more must be likely to do because crept between wall pillar why marguerite hast thou be listening to of wicked lyonnese that go preaching up down dost thou not know that king father hath strictly forbidden man to harbour one of rabble if please damoiselle know nothing at about why be merchant of lyon named pierre waldo lot more with go up down country preaching corrupting people from pure catholic faith hast thou listened to such preacher margot have damoiselle what know there be grey friar at

heresy said what be truth oh dear if one might know one own self ah pilatus asked that of good god when stood before judgment seat did not wait for answer wish have done answered then might have known suppose good lord must have told to submit to church so must not have be much better off because do know that be better off damoiselle said old marguerite for though good god did not answer pilatus maybe be not worthy did answer same question asked by monseigneur saint thomas did not damoiselle hear father eudes read that in french be only few week ago shook head can not imagine when how marguerite doe hear thing never do went on be one day when good lord have told messeigneurs apostle that be going to ascend to heaven said 'the way ye know monseigneur saint thomas ah be rather like damoiselle wanted to know replied that did not know way if have not be holy apostle must not have thought very civil to contradict seigneur let alone good lord good god be not angry saw suppose that monseigneur saint thomas did not mean anything wrong wanted to know like damoiselle of house of lusignan so said ' be way truth life man cometh unto father by ' see what mean said truth can not be

chapter vii little cloud out of sea coming event cast shadow before campbell be monday night be oh so tired three grand wedding be over very beautiful sight be very pleasant feast dance be done now if messire renaud feel doubt to night about body being have none about mine eschine made capital bride in sense in man must use word be looked very nice stood like statue believe have idea in head beyond that be going to be married that be very delightful thing that must look well behave becomingly be that sort of woman that men like be sort that men seem to think woman be amaury if ever did see creature more absurd than know who be fidgetted over eschine bridal dress precisely a if have be milliner at very last minute garland have to be altered because did not suit most charming of wedding be guy dear lady sybil be so beautiful behaved so perfectly a must judge of bride behaviour little soft moisture dimming dark eye little gentle tremulousness in sweet lip dress be simply enchanting soft white perhaps lady isabel made most splendid looking bride of three for dress be gorgeous while lady sybil style of beauty be by far more artistic poetical lady isabel be certainly more showy so far a must judge three bride regarded bridegroom with very different eye to eschine be accident of rite portion of ceremony must spoil show to leave out to lady isabel be new horse just mounted interesting to try pleasant triumph to subdue to lady sybil be sun centre of thing deserved attention just in proportion a concerned almost hope that eschine doe not love amaury for feel sure will be very unhappy if do a to messire homfroy de tour think lady isabel will find pleasant charger be thing spirited seems to to have little of mule about creature who must be given at time to taking bit in teeth absolutely refusing to go yard further now be over pageant feast dancing can not tell why be sad how be why be that after one have enjoyed thing very much one always doe feel sad think except to bride bridegroom wedding be very sorrowful thing suppose guy must say be one of queer notion look to so terribly like funeral there be bustle show then wake up miss one out of life be true one can come back still doe come back to be yours more think instance must be very very few in be so only where be to very near dear think marguerite saw looked tired sad there have be light heart to day said there have be heavy one light of to day may be heavy of to morrow sorrow of to night may turn to joy in morning do feel sorrowful margot know why damoiselle be weary great joy brings dull tired feeling after suppose be infirmity of earth angel feel so must like to be angel said must be so nice to fly said marguerite not for reason must like to have sin to see good god oh dear said be just what must not like in sense of never doing wrong might be very well must not want never to have amusement suppose thou meanest seeing good god must frighten dreadfully doe damoiselle remember time when little jacquot bertrade brother set fire to hay rick by playing with lighted straw oh yes very well why what have to do with doe recollect how shrieked struggled when robert pierre took carried into hall for monseigneur to judge for naughtiness oh yes margot really felt sorry for child be so terrified yet be half ludicrous monseigneur did not even have whipped yet if remember rightly damoiselle be standing by monseigneur side at very time did not look frightened in least will allow servant to ask why why must margot have done nothing wrong why be damoiselle more like jacquot than when come to think of seeing good god ah thou wouldst like to say because have done wrong suppose yes think there be reason a well what be that margot damoiselle be own child know love know be child of good god margot will damoiselle pardon be creature not child oh o margot said suddenly didst thou note that tall dark handsome knight who stood on count guy left hand count raymond of tripoli in mantle lined with black sable gold barred scarlet hose be man mean saw why if please damoiselle didst thou like damoiselle did not like marguerite be very fond of answering one question by did not must not tell why must then tell margot damoiselle man have mark upon brow good god angel can see few men see in be not easy to see many forehead look blank to eye sooner later one of two mark be certain to shine forth holy cross of lord badge of great enemy star fell from heaven what saw on man lofty brow be not cross of christ star of satan margot thy queer fancy said laughing now tell prithee on whose forehead in house thou seest cross lady judith answered without least hesitation think lady sybil let damoiselle pardon if can not name other with certainty have weak eye for such sight have hope of monseigneur count guy margot margot cried thou uncharitable old creature only three what not lady queen lady isabel holy patriarch oh fie let damoiselle pardon servant lady queen ah have right to say look blank to cross may be there may be blind patriarch lady isabel good god forgive if sin believe see star on on said laughing to hide curious sensation felt much akin to mortification yet what did old marguerite foolish fancy matter be surprised to see worn old eye suddenly fill with tear sweet damoiselle said good god bring out holy cross on brow love so well a yet if speak at must speak truth have not seen there must not make out why did not like count of tripoli be very handsome man even partial eye must admit handsomer than guy there be strange look in eye a if only saw lid of coffer beneath inside coffer there might be something dark dangerous guy say be splendid fellow guy always be given to making sudden friendship to imagining friend to be angel until discovered be men very much doubt angelic nature of count raymond like what queer fancy be of old marguerite that satan put mark on people yet can not help wishing have not said that about think be very respectful might have said something more civil thought marguerite always will speak just a think be like villein must never do for noble guy have now be regent of holy land for year people seem to fancy that be rather too stern such comical idea of guy of people think know how be guy be very impulsive in enterprise very impetuous in pursuing see that during king illness thing have gone wrong fallen into disorder of course will not do to let thing go on so people must be governed kept in place of course must why if there be order kept noble villein must be mixed up with other of more intelligent ambitious of villein might even begin to fancy on par with noble for there be sort of intelligence in of people though must be of quite different order from intellect of noble used to think villein never be ambitious have learned lately that of do entertain such feeling must be most dangerous idea to get into villein head though of course right proper enough for noble can not imagine why villein can not be contented with place did not providence make villein if have plenty of food clothing shelter fire good dance now then on village green extra holiday when seigneur daughter be married when son come of age what can possibly want more said so to marguerite ah be noble know answered quietly enough with fire in old eye realise that be men just a be god sent into world with just a much body soul a did have intellect heart conscience just like 'just like ' only fancy trust good god may not have to teach through pain ought to be satisfied said be perfectly content with place in world why be not contented be easier to be content with velvet than duffle said marguerite more calmly look better feel softer too if damoiselle be to try duffle for day perhaps must complain that felt harsh to very likely said villein must not have fine skin like mine finest skin doe not always cover finest feeling said marguerite in dry way what very silly idea of course people can not have such feeling a have must be quite absurd to think so do think however that what vexed most of thing be that amaury that silly little boy must take into head to lecture guy on way chose to govern a if must know anything about why be two whole year younger than guy told so feeling really vexed at impudence what must say be seven year younger than know that be woman woman have always more sense than men at least have more sense than amaury must be idiot if have not have made discovery to day have astonished lady judith have whole bible psalter too of own not written in latin in own tongue in be born be greek say that great part of bible holy evangel writing of messeigneurs holy apostle be originally written in greek always thought that holy scripture have be written in latin asked if latin be not language holy angel spoke lord when be upon earth answered that did not think knew what language holy angel spoke must doubt if be tongue spoken on earth that good god messeigneurs holy apostle have doubt at spoke greek sound very strange lady isabel have have violent quarrel with lord go about with set lip head erect a if be angry with one almost think eschine improves upon acquaintance not that find cleverer than expected think be good natured seems to have malice in if amaury storm a doe sometimes just let whirlwind blow over never give cross word must not do that suppose be why admire in eschine young nun came morning to visit lady judith one of own order must not quite understand conversation sister eudoxia for be name struck a being holiest religious person have ever seen spoke so beautifully thought about perfection one must attain to in life how one whole heart soul might be so permeated with god one might pas through life without committing deed of sin thinking evil thought not of course must ever attain to such perfection sounded very beautiful holy be quite surprised to see how constrained even cool lady judith be be only yesterday that assented warmly to old marguerite saying that one who served god must love kind of sin with sister eudoxia who spoke so much more charmingly on same subject sat almost silent when did speak seemed to be rather in dissent than assent puzzled when sister eudoxia be gone lady sybil said oh what happiness if one must attain to perfection of living absolutely without sin will answered lady judith will not be in world sister eudoxia say might be ah poor sister eudoxia said lady judith sadly have taken up with heresy nearly a old a christianity worse than than of messire renaud de montluc because have so much more truth in ay so much mixture of truth so much apparent loveliness that can be wonder if almost deceive very elect beware of being entangled in child heresy holy mother cried lady sybil with shocked look thought have never heard one ascribe more of glory of salvation to god than did for said that thing be done for by good lord that even perfection be wrought by for not by in said lady judith very point of heresy child eudoxia see distinction between righteousness done for be ground of justification before god holiness wrought in be conformity to image first be finished on rood eleven century ago second go on in heart of child of god here now be one of who without intending even knowing that do do yet sadly fail to realise work of holy ghost how much spoke of blessed spirit objected lady sybil daughter said lady judith with smile hast thou not yet found out difference between name thing there be many men who worship god most devoutly be god have made to man on earth be ready to love serve god with whole heart if may set up god after own pattern what that really mean be god a like a possible to who will look with perfect complacency on darling sin cherishes may then be allowed to condemn with utmost sternness evil passion to be not addicted that sound very shocking holy mother said lady sybil be liable to temptation replied lady judith be apt to slide into ere know wrought for little time in silence when lady sybil said what do call heresy holy mother into say that sister eudoxia have fallen if thou wilt look into vision of apostle blessed john called apocalypse answered lady judith thou wilt see what christ lord call 'this thou hast that thou rejectest teaching of nicolaitanes hate ' thought said lady sybil looking rather surprised that nicolaitanes who be heretic in early church held very horrible doctrine led extremely wicked life holy patriarch be speaking of not long ago ah child said lady judith men leap grow into great wickedness dost thou not see how doctrine work first be possible to live do sin secondly can live do sin thirdly do live not sin lastly when point be reached spiritual instinct doe not condemn being thus perfect can not be sin therefore may do what please if lie murder steal must be dreadful sin in be sin in because of perfection be following christ assuredly not doe sister eudoxia really imagine that oh responded lady judith have not reached that point comparatively few get so far on road a be whither road be leading then what be root of heresy believe lie at root of heresy rejecting god word that may keep own tradition stem may perhaps consist of two thing want of sufficient lowliness want of right knowledge of sin be not enough realised that man conscience like else in have be injured by fall conscience be looked on a heavenly judge still in original purity a thou mayest guess lead to depreciation of word of god exaltation of conscience over word also be not properly seen that while man life flesh will live with flesh renewed spirit must be in perpetual warfare to end know said lady sybil there paused 'we know repeated lady judith with smile ah child think know great deal be like child playing on seashore who fancy that know be in sea because have scooped up little sea water in hand there be height depth in god word in god purpose have never reached yet perhaps will never reach a heaven be high above earth so be way higher than way thought than thought be curious to know what marguerite must say always agrees so strangely with lady judith even when have not talked matter over at so said when went up to change dress margot dost thou commit sin damoiselle think so perfect then said with rather comical look must not help laughing well not quite when thou opposest will said dost thou know there be people who say that live without sin may be when to contradict holy evangel be mark of perfection said marguerite drily well what hast thou heard about in thy listening margot said laughing first thing heard perplexed said be of monseigneur saint john who said that be born of god doth not commit sin troubled sorely for time since knew did sin feared lest be therefore not born of god one day father eudes read again from very same writing that 'if man sin have advocate with father likewise if say have sin be liar so then thought well how be monseigneur holy apostle must not contradict still must not see how to reconcile though thought thought till brain felt nearly cracked at once father eudes read thanks be to good god something from monseigneur saint paul put right what be ah must not get by heart be too difficult very long be something like in christian man there be two heart of one be from god doe not sin at other be evil heart born in be always committing sin margot of thy two heart be thyself have can not answer such question good god will know art thou sure be not wicked people certainly monseigneur saint paul said `` bee through oh margot must not have meant if have not meant what said must think must have mentioned said marguerite in dry quaint style well holy apostle be different of course said look very odd to that anybody living now must fancy never doe wrong ah poor soul said good god know better if chapter viii a good a most people best way to see divine light be to put out own candle morning lady princess of antioch visited lady queen remained for day taking departure only just before gate be closed for preferred to camp out at night be quite young be niece of lady queen after be gone be talking about in bower from came to speak of late princess lord mother pray talk of said lady isabel made bye word by shameless behaviour only thoughtless remonstrated lady sybil gently never thought deserved what be said of oh never think anybody doe sneered sister must not have associated with woman must have known what be said of wonder that be brazen enough to show in public at think isabel believe did know know be not at clever be half witted not much better be answer oh yes know that must have known think did said lady sybil earnestly then ought to have known sharply replied lady isabel wonder did not shut up be pest to society o isabel deprecated sister be very good natured sybil never saw one like must have found good word for juda iscariot hardly said lady sybil just a gently a before perhaps might have helped finding evil one there be pearl gatherer dirt gatherer quietly remarked lady judith who have hitherto listened in silence latter have by far larger cargo handful of former outweighs in value what do mean holy mother inquired lady isabel turning quickly to rather too sharply thought to be altogether respectful only 'let that thinketh standeth take heed lest fall ' said lady judith with quiet smile said lady isabel with world of meaning in tone child be reply undertake to censure cleanness of neighbour robe must be very careful to avoid spot on purity of own dost thou not remember lord saying about mote beam well said lady isabel bringing scissors together with good deal of snap think that who associate with such people a princess constantia bring reflection on own character snow soot go well together soot defile snow responded lady judith doe not affect sunbeam understand said lady isabel bluntly who confide in own strength goodness isabel be like snow very fair until sullied liable to be sullied by least speck who take hold of god strength be christ lord be sunbeam heavenly emanation can not be sullied art thou snow sunbeam child oh dear can not deal with trope figure in style answered rising work be finished be going now fancied did not look very sorry for great event be happening lord king finding malady grows rather worse than better have resolved to abdicate in favour of nephew lady sybil baby son so to morrow beaudouin v be to be proclaimed throughout holy city on day of saint edmund king will be crowned in church of holy sepulchre say lord king be very wise man before became mesel will still give counsel when needed young king being three year old nov quite see what difference abdication will make guy must still remain regent for several year only change be that will govern for step son instead of brother in law feel little jealous that lady sybil must be passed by not son be next heir of crown why must be subject of own child who ought to be hers really feel vexed about so doe guy be sure though say nothing at least to a to lady sybil be so meek gentle that if beggar in street be put over head believe must kneel to do homage without cloud on sweet face however felt at liberty to say what thought to amaury though seldom do without being annoyed by answer certainly be now be woman said messire amaury what doe woman know about governing what doe baby know said oh will be man day answered amaury guy will govern in case replied trying not to be angry with be so silly think so supremely wise do believe more foolish people be wiser think have said saving presence damoiselle elaine be not so sure that guy know much about amaury thou art idiot cried quite unable to bear longer believe thou hast told that before returned with provoking coolness dashed away for knew might a well talk to damoiselle melisende pet weasel like count of tripoli more see of le like like fawning profession of friendship for guy guy doe not see through bit believe only mean to use guy a ladder by to climb a soon a be at top will kick ladder down behind did not say that amaury be idiot be not true here be sister eschine mother of

suppose must not put too much faith in 'them helena said 'they often say great deal be not true one must attend to holy mother answered why replied oh because must never do what must never do to despise opinion of society why gently persisted really found rather difficult to say why methinks helena have seen thee despise opinion of society when contradicted thy will be not more reasonable to despise when contradicts god will holy mother pray tell be that world said because nurse old marguerite say that monseigneur saint john bade beware of world flesh a well a devil be not quite sure what mean except that world be other people flesh be how can be inimical to own salvation child said lady judith gently when duty be brought to thy remembrance be there nothing within thee feel a if rose up said 'oh want to do ' never helena oh yes very often said be flesh said 'they be of christ flesh have crucified with passion lust oh dear exclaimed almost involuntarily very unpleasant be not said lady judith smiling ah dear child flesh take long in dying crucifixion be very slow process very painful process be not willing to 'endure hardness ' have better not enlist in army of jesus christ ah be what always thought said religious person can not be very happy of course must not be right for wait till next world yet old marguerite always seems happy quite understand child lady judith dropped broidering deep sweet grey eye looked earnestly into mine what dost thou know of happiness helena following christ be not hardship be luxury happiness rather mirth of world be often incompatible with be because one be so far above other that extinguishes a light of sun extinguishes lamp yet who must prefer lamp before sunlight tell helena hast thou wish to go to heaven certainly holy mother what

always with love be loved by for ever ever there will be manner of delight pleasure can not think of anything else be thy heaven said lady judith with smile in thought chief ingredient be tender compassion though must not see why ah child must be no heaven at to verily 'as man thinketh in heart so be ' pleasure ease earthly love be thy treasure helena 'for where thy treasure be there will thine heart be what be matter with heaven said feeling little aggrieved why child thou hast left out central figure be coronation if there be king wedding where there be bride why what be left must be equivalent to nothing ask thine old nurse see if thy heaven must satisfy ah have in heaven thee there be none upon earth that desire in comparison of thee ' old marguerite understands that dost thou maiden shook head felt too mortified to speak to have poor ignorant villein woman held up to a knowing more than knew being happier than really be humiliating yet must not resent from one so high a lady judith lady judith must have said more fancy melisende came in quietly dropped matter a generally doe if third person enters next morning a marguerite be dressing hair asked what notion of heaven be inside with blessed lord devil sin evil thing left outside said ah will be rest to be rid of evil will be glory to be with lord pleasure flying delightful thing margot said ah yes will be very nice

not of exactly same common sort of stuff that be yesterday afternoon lady sybil be alone in bower have baby in arm little creature be to be made christian on sunday asked what name be to have expected

discovered that be within prohibited degree why can not dispensation be given when such thing occur knew nothing of why must be parted be driven into loneliness obscurity well be done decree of holy church parted went back to people have never heard word about who saw depart from jerusalem said seemed like one whose very heart be broken never came back said pityingly be much wonder answered lady sybil in low voice rocking child gently in arm must have be much think for crowned anointed queen of jerusalem to steal into capital a damoiselle de courtenay must have be far more for wife mother to come suing to supplanter for sight of own child can not wonder that never never came back be silent for little while then said be lord king a grieved a can not understand if so why must not have obtained dispensation have be married over again lady sybil shook head saw tear drop on baby robe helena said hardly above whisper think be have opportunity of allying with caesar there be men to whom woman be woman one woman be just a good a very nearly so do men selling horse stop to consider whether will be a happy with new master a old care very often can not understand ay amaury be one of sort think if be alive that will never come asked hope might think will not ah how have hoped helena hast thou wondered how be that nothing short of absolute impossibility will suffer to depute to daily distribution of dole at postern gate to poor woman come for alms canst thou not guess that amongst face look for one for one might creep in there unrecognised to look on must never never go away with soreness at heart saying behe be not there ' loaf give to stranger say 'pray for soul of agnes of anjou then if day must creep in among rest must not know ah think must if be only by mother hunger in

why be people so hard on other be fellow sinner suppose ah helena said lady sybil with sorrowful smile hast thou not found dear that greater sinner man be very generally harder will be on other sinner especially when sin be of different type from own holier man be more hate sin yet more tenderly will deal with sinner for a sin mean going away from god so holiness must mean coming near god god be more merciful than men to who come to for mercy lady judith came in while last word be being spoken never can quite tell said what sin be why must thing be sin other thing not be sin go on helena said lady judith turning round with smile why must so many thing be wrong like so many thing be right like well holy mother be something like said laughing will please to tell why because child thou hast inherited sinful nature like sin a sin said then temptation have power over thee be so art thou never 'drawn away of thine own lust enticed ' well be not perfect said suppose nobody expects to be yet without absolute perfection helena thou canst never enter heaven o holy mother cried where art thou about to get said be sure know replied blankly thou shouldst know child responded gently think about

announced in afternoon holy patriarch baptized by guy name amaury be in ecstasy with boy ala in evening poor little thing fell into convulsion barely lived to see dawn of day amaury passed from climax of triumph to depth of despair growled snarled at body snapped at eschine in particular a though thought have let child die on purpose to vex that must be in a much distress a did not seem to occur to if anything must have provoked more than amaury unreasonableness must have be calm patience with eschine took there stalked about grumbling growling why did let child die wanted to know a if must have helped there be not one of have sense a if have alix boy manages to live know how to treat woman be idiot alix apparently not being woman poor eschine lay still few tear now then making way down white cheek meekly begging lord master pardon for what have not done when be gone said think to anticipate what saw on tip of tongue thou knowest elaine dear be not angry with men do set such store by son be only natural must be very much distressed will persist in making excuse for distressed well said doe not need to be so silly angry natural well yes think be natural to amaury to be idiot always did think so o lynette dear pleaded eschine be beginning to think have be rather unjust to eschine when said there be nothing in have taken long while to come out seems to come rather in form of doing bearing than of thinking saying amaury be most profound donkey mortal man can doubt at rate mortal woman be awfully startled morning when marguerite undrew curtain told that lord king beaudouin have be commanded to god seems now for time past have be more ill than one knew except lady queen stepmother what that wicked count of tripoli may have known of course can not say be sure have have hand in late king will crown be left to little king beaudouin v sweet sybil be disinherited what that really mean suppose be that count be jealous of guy influence over lady imago that can sway child better than mother there be to be various change in consequence of lord king death lady queen return to own family at byzantium do hope lady judith will not go with be very much afraid may guy talk about retiring to city of ascalon though be sure lady sybil will submit to will can see doe not want to leave boy though believe distrust that wicked tripoli a do asked marguerite if did not feel very angry

will happen ah be not seeing much what can happen to put thing right again margot have do know better than monseigneur saint jacob when son monseigneur saint joseph sent for little brother refused to send meal until came be so beautiful history so many time repeated in world poor old father thought thing be against did not know what good god be making ready for did not know good god will never be hurried be be in hurry poor child of time want thing to happen to day who have eternity to work in can afford to let thing take time damoiselle doe not know what old helweh said to yesterday who be helweh said be arab woman who serf in kitchen paynim o marguerite what can paynim say worth hearing be christian if to be baptized be to be christian a people always say then helweh be christian if to be christian be really to know follow lord christ seems to a if evangel always meant that then know be afraid helweh doe not understand much about oh if have be christened must be christian said well what did say said 'all thing come to who know how to wait be saracen proverb well believe ah let damoiselle pardon be true well said half laughing then suppose know how to wait think damoiselle doe answered marguerite quietly wilt thou teach have take good god to teach must not think wanted much teaching let damoiselle bear with servant good god have be teaching to for seventy year dare not make so bold a to say have learned yet why margot thou art a quiet calm patient a stone ah not here said laying hand upon bosom perhaps here here touching eye lip down there for what for whom art thou waiting margot asked rather amused have ought to be only whom be too often what be like little child waiting for father to come home thinking more of toy bonbon may bring than of then there be thing before can learn to wait must learn to trust to trust what margot believe trust in something if damoiselle plea great many trust in great many more trust in circumstance fate chance luck a call few trust in other human creature waking be often saddest of seems a if one thing found hardest to do be to trust good god have to drive away often from other trust before will learn to trust oh how must grieve heart when have done so much for yet will not trust wonder what mean feel a if must like to know must not tell how to begin lady queen be gone back to people be so glad lady judith be not gone with be sadly afraid must do melisende be gone messire renaud de montluc for whom lady queen trust to obtain high position at court of byzantine caesar be not at sorry that messire renaud be gone made feel uncomfortable whenever looked at can not well express feeling in word gave sensation a if nothing stood on thing thing be misty uncertain fancy people like sort of feeling detest like figure though amaury say be very unladylike taste because be so definite certain two two make four will make four do what please with twisting turning will persuade to be either three five now like far better than art more interesting in such a music painting embroidery of people say yes be very fair very good of course might be better like thing must not be better guy say be very short sighted argues want of ambition in quite see that if thing be best can possibly be why must want to be better oh one want aim say guy one must have mark to shoot at if be besieging castle knew beforehand must not possibly take must deprive of energy object there be nothing so devoid of interest a doing something lead to nothing be worth nothing when done well say then think if siege war be done away with must be no bad thing just think what misery cause outcry come upon then amaury informs that be incomparably astonished at be not war grandest of employment what on earth must noble do if there be war must have till earth like peasant read write like monk sew dress wound like woman guy say good naturedly oh one of elaine curious notion never think like other people think say of suffering come from war bereft widow fatherless child human pain sorrow doe woman weeping over husband corpse think war grand do suppose stuff say amaury ca get must say if eschine be to die never mind can get well must not much wonder if must once after rather keen contest of sort asked old marguerite if liked war saw eye kindle damoiselle said husband followed seigneur to war left ill at home in cot have power to choose a damoiselle must know night fell seigneur came home with banner flying along village street there be bonfire rejoicing for great victory husband did not come rose from sick bed wrapped in sheepskin went out to fatal field like candle in sunlight pain of heart put out pain of body what saw night damoiselle will not ask be not meet to rehearse in ear of young noble lady know how bore only that did bear going from one to in moonlight turning lantern on dead still face ever looking for face feared to find at last found pier one love of young life where fight have be most terrible dead lay thickest knew that have acquitted right well for face be to foe broken shaft of seigneur pennon be still grasped tightly in hand damoiselle there be funeral pageant table tomb herald cry for stranger hand buried where lay a might have buried seigneur horse if need be there be white weed seclusion for young widow who knelt by baby cradle too miserable for tear may be in hall where soul be alike before king of king voice from throne said to 'well done voice did verily say to 'fear not come unto will give thee rest ah damoiselle know now what old nurse think of war oh why must there be such thing how else must knight win spur indignantly demand amaury surely winning of amaury spur be not only thing of consequence in world doe good god take account of widow tear orphan wail if only knight win spur must not other way be contrived for spur must leave people alive when be finished now elaine be such simpleton say amaury so at last a nobody else except marguerite who be nobody seems to understand ask lady judith what think child say 'he maketh war to cease unto end of earth breaketh bow snappeth spear in sunder burneth chariot in fire father of age to come prince of peace be one of fairest title not till come helena till then earth will be red with blood of son moistened with tear of daughter let pray for coming holy mother be age off said be made answer have lord told thee so much helena ah may be know not see nothing else to keep may be that if earth must come to to day must come to to morrow holy mother know what mean by 'coming ' to dear helena said gently thou wilt not know till thou art ready to come understand said how be to get ready 'if man thirst let come unto drink ' 'if thou knewest gift of god thou have asked of must have given to thee water of life ' art thou not athirst dost thou not know gift of god dear maiden then ask to bestow on thee thirst knowledge really know whether be right wrong night after have finished credo pater holy angelical salutation ventured to say in own word fair father jesu christ give what lady judith marguerite talk about hope be not very wicked did so tremble properly know what thing be only that seems to make happy why must not be happy too suppose good god will know about a appears to be so condescending a to listen to marguerite who be villein surely will hear who be noble be so odd that amaury who be simpleton must be perpetually calling simpleton do think more foolish people be more fond be of exhorting others not to be silly be very funny world be queer place be indeed lynette say guy with mock gravity when make remark to queerest place have be in thirty year a guy be scarcely twenty seven may be supposed can not help laughing there be queer thing doe really seem a if villein at least villein have genuine feeling just like noble have always thought that be because marguerite have associated so much with noble that seemed little different just a might impart rose scent to handkerchief if shut in drawer with rose leaf know did not become mother nurse until after husband be dead so must have have feeling before while be better off than other villein be very incomprehensible suppose too when one come to think about be child of adam eva how did difference come to begin with be very difficult to tell how thing began be great deal easier to see how end who must suppose if men have never found out that great river danube roll into black sea almost like sea in volume came from melting of ice snow upon hill of switzerland have say marguerite when repeat thought to great god be so rich that can bring large thing out of small others can only bring small out of large that sound like spoiling thing said men be very apt to spoil what touch answered good lord never touch anything that doe not leave more beautiful have not blessed childhood manhood by becoming child man be not earth fairer since dwelt on little child dearer since took in arm blessed ah might have cared for felt with just a much if have never be man must not have be same thing to knew when love one very much damoiselle love what have touched if touch ourselves sends delicious thrill through good lord knew that when took on nature with suffering infirmity when touched where in sorrow weariness poverty hunger pain death can suffer nothing have not suffered first on have not laid hand blessed for chosen thanks be to name be like honey sweetening everything thing be bitter acid want most sweetening so good lord chose poverty pain ease rich be sweet of have heard father eudes read of one two feast where be blessed joy a well a sorrow perhaps lest must fancy that there be something holy in pain poverty in something wicked in being comfortable happy people do think so after have heard father eudes read great deal more of funeral than feast where blessed lord be seemed to go where people wanted comforting much oftener than where be comfortable knew that many more must sorrow than rejoice what strange eye marguerite have can look at nothing see good god strangest thing be that seems to make happy always make miserable to think of god when be bright joyous be like dropping black curtain over brightness why can not be like marguerite ought to be great deal happier than there be something wrong somewhere then of course there must be something holy in poverty voluntary poverty be why do monk nun take vow of poverty suppose there be nothing holy in simply being poor like villein if lord really be poor when be on earth must have be voluntary poverty said a much to margot damoiselle said man who follows lord must carry cross own cross not somebody else mean think cross good god lay on shoulder blessed christ did not cut own cross others be very fond of cutting cross for ourselves instead of leaving good god to lay on always cut of wrong wood like very light pretty with plenty of carving gilding when good lord make cross put carving on often hews out very rough heavy one at least doe so for strong make light sometimes for weak there be gilding only pure gold of own smile be not in cross in sunlight sends upon damoiselle will find when men sort out cross strong walk away with light one rough heavy fall to weak good lord know better than carry cross margot said only religious person marguerite shook head decidedly damoiselle learn of good lord must bear cross said so 'if man serve let follow again 'if man will come after let deny take up cross follow ' father eudes read damoiselle see 'any man must mean men well can not understand only feel more puzzled than ever be sure must not make happier to carry heavy cross yet lady judith marguerite be happy can see be religion good people seem to be full of contradiction how be one to understand chapter x preparing for struggle hath thousand friend hath not friend to spare hath one enemy will find where have thought thought about lady judith question concerning perfection a expected can not see way through at what be more see how to reconcile with what said of sister eudoxia so morning took liberty of asking what meant lady judith smiled replied wert thou puzzled helena yes holy mother said very much be glad of answered wanted to puzzle thee make thee think have be thinking great deal said can not think way out of labyrinth must take counsel of holy writ to find way out answered lady judith laid hand on greek bible be very handsome book bound in carved wood locked with golden clasp unlocked with little key hang from girdle said now listen helena in day when lord dwelt on middle earth there be certain men amongst jew called pharisee who be deemed exceedingly holy person so exact be in fulfilment of duty that did not reckon tithe paid unless taxed very pot herb in garden yet lord said to disciple righteousness surpass not that of pharisee ye will not enter into kingdom of heaven ' likely enough said surely christened man must easily be better than heathen jew said more helena 'be ye then perfect even a father in heaven be perfect ' perfect a good god be perfect exclaimed be standard responded be not to rest short of can not said holy mother when be talking of sister eudoxia did child let take two more passage from holy writ see if cast light upon 'the end of law be christ unto righteousness to believer 'and ye be in complete ' understand holy mother have heard thee speak helena of thy favourite legend of two good knight of greece what be that sir pythia agreed to do for sir damon to suffer death in stead if did not return home at appointed time

to spend hour in fretting over inconvenience did not last quarter dear eschine sound very grand said why dost thou not teach amaury to look at thing in charming way fret over mistake inconvenience far more than guy do eschine smile have more patience than amusement in for same reason elaine that teach yonder crane to sing like nightingale can guess parable must be mere waste of time labour guy did

pilgrimage meant have be at court of england on purpose to offer crown of jerusalem to king father seeing say distracted state of kingdom peril of paynim war fact that king henry be nearest heir of king foulques of anjou well upon word a if crown of jerusalem be theirs to offer seems to too body even guy say that be only one of queer unaccountable notion since king foulques of anjou have right to crown except a husband of queen melisende so long a heir remain in existence must be preferred to heir by wife amaury laugh at for saying say of course when count foulques married queen melisende became king right passed to be thenceforth simply consort child having a much right a hers doe not seem just fair to one only laugh say have such absurd fancy why what must be good of marrying heiress at say amaury if have to give up property when died before still see that be just wonder if sometimes queer idea of one century become common idea of next amaury seems to think notion exquisitely ridiculous nonsense elaine say be simple matter of family arrangement go fancy wisest woman in world thou hast silliest idea ever heard well amaury said more than fancy thee wisest man guy laughed

pleased to have back patriarch master of temple have not yet arrived guy think may tarry at acre with count raymond come on in train lord de clifford have come from england by way of jaffa with answer of king henry father seems that patriarch actually took with key of holy city blessed sepulchre be astonished that count raymond must have entrusted to more than travelled by way of rome through wicked misrepresentation obtained letter from holy father urging king henry to take on charge king henry be holding court at reading when came to patriarch say be moved to tear at account of miserable state of holy land well be not going to deny misery do say be count raymond fault that if matter have be left in guy hand must never have come to pas king henry however must not give answer at once bade wait till have convoked great council sat at clerkenwell on eighteenth of march in last year decision of parliament be that in interest of england offer ought to be refused well said guy a mere question of political wisdom be doubtless right for apart from pleasure of god must be ruin of england to have holy land clinging round neck like mill stone yet remember lord robert courthose never prospered after have refused crown of world impiously blew out taper have be lighted by miracle think what end be dost thou think lord asked lady sybil looking up that meant impiously have always thought word so beautiful that be not worthy to wear crown of gold in place where lord have worn for crown of thorn very beautiful lady said little drily if have not heard just before conference of death of brother king william red well when king henry gave answer what did patriarch ask that one of son might be substituted guy think specially indicated count of poitou guy say there be great possibility in young count amaury sneer at idea however king parliament alike declined to accept in name of of prince seeing none of be present patriarch have to content with promise of aid alone king henry took in train to normandy after celebrating holy easter at rouen have interview with french king at vaudreuil king promised help swearing on soul of other many noble french english took holy cross be hoped that king of france count of poitou may lead army hither in few month richard coeur de lion whose reputation be yet to be made usual oath of monarch in solemn form if can manage to conclude truce meanwhile come here to find slaughtered prisoner to paynim say guy great body move slowly king army be of description saladin have taken neapolis scout bring word that be ravaging burning land a march have turned towards holy city almost morning may be awoke from sleep with dreadful magic engine sounding in ear holy mary saint pray to good god for poor servant not word come from regent four several messenger guy have sent by a many different route in hope that at least one of may reach acre earnestly urging to send instruction even know condition of matter at acre king regent may be prisoner oh what be to be done guy say that may become of kingdom must not be lost if ten day more pas without news of regent will parley with saladin if possible conclude truce on own responsibility feel so afraid for guy believe if count raymond must find handle must destroy without mercy guy seems to perceive that responsibility be ready to assume involves serious peril nevertheless lady inheritance must not be lost say asked lady judith morning if be not dreadfully frightened of saladin say eats christian child sometimes maiden when child run short if felt alarm must scarcely be woman helena said took fear to lord a king david did 'what time be afraid ' say ' will trust in thee have answer last night oh said what be if please holy lifted head with light in grey eye be be thy comforter know whom thou art afraid of dying man of son of men who wither like grass thou forgettest god thy maker maker of heaven foundation layer of earth fearest ever day face of fury of thine oppressor now where be fury of thine oppressor ' did good god speak to in vision holy mother helena spake to a doe to thee in word thought must have be great deal more satisfactory if have be told in vision how do know holy mother ventured to say that word written in holy scripture ever so long ago have something to do with now god word be living child said be not like other book dead book word who be alive for evermore endureth for ever moreover there be special promise that holy spirit will bring god word to remembrance of servant a need when come from come living with power then think holy mother that paynim will be driven back say that child think that god who turned back sennacherib be alive yet angel who smote camp of assyrian can do again if lord command if not real mischief helena real harm can happen to who abideth under shadow of god might be killed holy mother might said so quietly that looked at in amazement holy mother exclaimed thou dost not understand lord word helena 'and will kill of hair from head of will not be lost indeed said bluntly can not make thee do so added gently god must do why doe not do have not asked over over again to make understand suppose something be in way something be fault how be to get rid of when even know what be ten day be over word come from regent guy have assumed a vice regent command of holy city of course be person to do a lady sybil husband scout report that saladin be marching through pas of gerizim guy have sent out trumpeter with suitable armed escort to sound parley invite paynim to meet with arrange for truce at lebonah until trumpeter return know whether effort will succeed lady sybil can see be excessively anxious very uneasy lest if guy go to parley with wicked paynim must use treachery towards be god will said saw tear in sweet eye battle toil triumph for men waiting weeping praying for woman perhaps in way humble bedeswomen do god will a much a warrior knight trumpeter returned last night with message from saladin almost worthy of christian knight seems very strange that paynim must be capable of courtesy most expressive word in middle age not restricted a now civility including honourable sentiment generous conduct saladin be willing to conclude truce will meet guy at lebonah to do so be to be for six month only guy say term be somewhat hard however be best thing can do a regent maintains obstinate silence something must be done so far a envoy must learn paynim army have not be near acre only crossed jordan thirty mile lower down appears clear therefore that regent might have answered if must guy amaury set out yesterday morning for lebonah to meet saladin be two three day journey from holy city allowing three day more for conference must be ten day at least ere can return wander about house can settle to nothing lady sybil sits at work believe weeps more than work eschine embroidery grows quietly have discovered that carry heart out of sight be talking morning hardly know how subject came up about selfishness lady isabel said with toss of head that be sure reasonable being must call selfish now must not agree with for have always thought very much so lady judith quietly asked in what thought selfishness consisted in being stingy miserly of course said well stingy of what responded lady judith think people make great mistake when restrict selfishness merely to being miserly with money must say that man be unselfish who will give willingly count precious mean very different thing to different people wonder what mean to five said lady judith looked round with smile almost think must tell said oh do said lady isabel well to answered lady judith mean submitting because one wish who have right to submission else a matter of christian love to do thing in way think inferior absurd not calculated to effect end proposed in other word ruling sin be self satisfaction exclaimed against conclusion maintained that be so then continued to sybil mean depriving of lord society for advantage for of one else lady sybil smiled blushed then ruling sin said interrogatively nay did not undertake to draw inference in case own said lady judith with answering smile except lady isabel begged that must do for seemed thought to assent rather reluctantly will not like said if drew inference for yourselves must be more likely to attend to lesson conveyed oh might do wrong said lady judith laughed be then so infallible that can not do wrong said well sybil dear if thou wouldst know think thy tendency say thy passion thy tendency be to idolatry oh cried lady sybil looking quite distressed now misunderstand not pursued lady judith love be not necessarily idolatry when love creature more than creator when for instance thou shalt care more to please thy lord than to please lord then only be idolatry therefore use word tendency trust be not more with thee well then with isabel lady isabel gave toss of head gesture to be very much addicted with isabel continued lady judith unselfishness must take form of resigning own ease pleasure to suit convenience of temptation therefore be to indolence self pleasing with helena pricked up ear what be going to hear with helena said smiling on must be think to fulfil duty though whom loved might misunderstand think silly for then what be besetting sin holy mother pride of intellect think answered very nearly same a own holy mother have left out dame eschine said lady isabel rather sharply have said lady judith well child must ask lord wherein eschine selfishness lie for can not tell dare not deny existence believe sinner have in form only in case can not detect eschine looked up with expression of utter amazement holy mother exclaimed seemed to a went on have one of mentioned lady judith smile be very expressive dear child said be not word 'blessed be poor in spirit for theirs be kingdom of heaven doe think eschine best of be dear never must have thought well said lady isabel with sort of snort toss be quite sure have not one of fault mentioned ah child responded lady judith take heed of pharisee spirit eschine what wouldst thou say be thy besetting sin really can not tell have so many answered eschine modestly sometimes think that may be perhaps want of meekness patience stared at in astonishment well thank saint be in want of patience said lady isabel if one knew have to try turned looked at if possible in astonishment still greater really how very very little people do know if there be patient creature in world be eschine if there be impatient one be lady isabel wonder whether know think must have set down a proud of intellect lusignans always have have brain except amaury have stepped out of rank like people to disagree with contradict to behave a if thought have sense be true enough suppose must be proud yet can not be wrong to know one have brain what be pride where doe knowledge end sin begin oh dear how be one ever to know if two two must only make four in thing be that one make mistake one self in adding up lady judith asked morning if be vexed with yesterday for what said of oh answered at once did not know be proud of intellect think knew be proud of rank thou art right there child said yet fear pride of intellect be more likely to harm thee just because thou art le conscious of holy mother said do think sister eschine best of human creature helena be poor judge of other if thou wouldst know so far a be able to judge think two holiest person in palace be eschine thine old margarita better than lady sybil cried undervalue sybil be good true believe doe earnestly desire to serve god seems to that most christ like spirit know be not sybil eschine must think about study eschine certainly made sad mistake when thought there be nothing in holiest person in house seems very strange to believe now that what took for absence of feeling be mixture of great humility profound control queerest thing be that think really love amaury how creature can love amaury be puzzle to for being with atom of brain can look up to how can love one whom can not respect besides evidently despises eschine believe doe woman scold snub from morning to night for everything doe doe not do such treatment a must wear love in hole if be possible for ever to feel for such animal a amaury if be eschine must be anxious to get a far away from a must must be delighted when relieved of company yet do think eschine really miss will be honestly glad when come back be very unaccountable anxiety be turned to rejoicing at once guy amaury returned last night having concluded six month truce with saladin eschine have pleasure be sure felt very great one when amaury entered chamber of placing in arm boy for whom have so fervently longed who be born three day before came back little hugues amaury say that must be name seems a fine child a heloise a likely to live amaury be about a pleased a be in nature to be always seems to have eye fixed on wormwood of life rather than honey thou hast shown sense at last said eschine received very doubtful commendation a if have be most delightful compliment then amaury turned round snapped at because must not help laughing at absurdity asked marguerite evening what thought be chief fault have good god know said be very difficult to tell of one fault be worst what dost thou think said well answered think that chief fault be with deference same a of damoiselle be pride only that be proud of different thing of what art thou proud margot asked laughingly rather struck to find that have hit on same failing in a lady judith have damoiselle may well ask can not tell what be have old villein woman ignorant foolish to provoke pride only know be there doe not fasten on one thing more than there be pride be very subtle sin if please damoiselle if have nothing in world to be proud of be ugliest woman in believe must be proud of laughed well wherein lie pride margot said wishful to see whether altogether agreed with lady judith can see into inmost heart of damoiselle be like shut up coffer human heart can only look on outside on outside see two thing damoiselle be noble be clever know be worse margot have be bad enough to make pride think that even king can never fancy so noble a good god yet good many of think quite a wise o margot who must think that doe damoiselle never think that must arrange matter better than good god be ordering what be to say in heart be wiser be very queer how lady judith marguerite always do think alike margot who wouldst thou say be holiest woman in house answer be unhesitating know can only guess if damoiselle wish to guess noble lady judith dame eschine how very odd when asked thee once before margot thou didst not mention eschine at let damoiselle pardon did not know enough of then be not one to know in minute be like open book quickly read others be like book in strange tongue of one know little have to be spelt out again be like locked book can not read at without key dame eschine if damoiselle plea be book in strange tongue book be very good quite worth trouble to learn where didst thou find such comparison margot thou canst not read have can see others do what kind of book be margot have damoiselle be wide wide open lady sybil asked feeling much amused usually open can turn key if will be rather surprised count guy quite a wide open a damoiselle then where dost thou find thy locked book margot be still more astonished at answer if damoiselle plea lady isabel o margot think be quite easy to read be mistaken said marguerite with quiet persistence if damoiselle have yet read one page of volume now must have called regent locked book said hardly if damoiselle plea there be loose leaf peep out well that romance be not pleasant one said pleasant have be long one can not see end of story before one come to at last letter have come from regent be quite different to what expected
