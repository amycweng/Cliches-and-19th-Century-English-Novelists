time must please to tell what be iberian dear said mr cameron smiling must gladly give fifty pound in gold if must tell sir cried in great surprise went on more a if be talking to to very learned man than to what be iberian ah for man who must tell be basque what be etruscan what be magyar above what be cagot miss caroline dear there be deep question in art science without knowing have lighted on one of deepest most interesting most learned man that breathes can only answer a do now though be far from being learned man know will nevertheless willingly tell what little do know rather if take interest in such matter that really know of iberii be that came from spain that have reached that country from east that be narrow headed people celt later briton be round headed that dwelt in rude house in interior of country first digging pit in ground building over kind of hut sometimes of turf sometimes of stone that wore very rude clothing be generally much le civilised than celt who lived mainly on coast that loved to dwell especially to worship on mountain top that followed certain eastern observance such a running leaping through fire to bel savour of phoenician assyrian origin that be more than likely that owe to stupendous monument yet standing stonehenge avebury white horse of berkshire white man of wilmington what sort of religion have if please sir said for wanted to get to know must about strange father of ours idolatry dear a might suppose answered mr cameron worshipped sun identified with serpent have sacred tree doubtless relic of eden must appear also to have have

in truth one doe for have only arrived at stage of knowing that know next to nothing be easy enough to know surely said angus not at angus be one of most difficult thing to ascertain in world man be so ready to give off hand opinion on subject a man who know absolutely nothing must not start hare while young lady question remains unanswered language dear be not made grow first language spoken in eden may have be given to man ready made by god rather imagine from expression of holy writ that what be granted to adam be inward power of forming tongue must be rational consistent with if so doubt be granted to eve that must understand perhaps that must posse similar power woman made language sir may be sure said angus be shocking chatterer unfortunately boy scripture be against whatsoever adam ' not eve called name of living creature be name thereof ' to proceed confusion of tongue at babel seems from what can gather to have called into being number of language quite separate from other yet having certain affinity structure differs of word be alike at least so nearly alike that resemblance can be traced take word for father ' in language cut down to root there be same root found in ab in hebrew abba in syriac pater in greek latin vater in low dutch pere in french padre in spanish italian father in english ay even child papa infant daddy come from one root cutting away of superfluity

english be one tribe be going to say when be so rude a to interrupt english scot young gentleman angus growled out beg pardon take said mr cameron pleasantly now for question on what good quality do plume well think on steadiness independence loyalty truthfulness firmness honesty love of fair play how far be justified in doing so perhaps other nation be better judge believe generally regard a proud surly race quality on there be occasion to plume much loyalty have got to glory in said angus have always tried replied mr cameron to run loyalty liberty together when two pull smoothly undoubtedly national chaise get along best unhappily when harnessed to same chariot one of steed be very apt to kick over trace will not venture on such delicate ground seeing that political colour

keep boy of course must not say that did not think angus be included in momentary trouble in flora eye a glanced at made feel that saw a indeed must have guessed from what have heard say to mr keith well lassie uncle drummond went on while fear deserve compliment pay yet have ever thought what two road be what end have in view yes uncle can see said heaven be at end of one be sure of other cary felt tear come into eye uncle like to think about do tell for be what want to know what be difference see how people get from one road to other did not say feel sure that uncle drummond did not need that felt be on wrong one lassie if have fallen into deep tank of water where wall be so high that be not possible must climb out by for what must hope that somebody must come help suppose true who be somebody can help in matter thought thought must not tell seems strange did not think what meant have be so used to think of lord jesus christ a person who have great deal to do with going to church prayer book nothing at to do with that really did not think what uncle meant to say there be one man child who can give help longed to help so much that came down from heaven to do know who mean now cary mean lord jesus christ said uncle say longed to help never knew always thought thought did not wish to help at that must have very hard work to persuade well something like said hesitatingly flora have left room moment before now put head in at door called angus uncle drummond be left alone dear lassie said a tenderly a if have be own child must never have wished to be helped if have not first wished to help remember cary help be not right word true word be save be not few yard out of path able to turn back at moment be lost dear cary will let lord find can hinder said yes dear be

anybody against will uncle drummond be silent for moment well cary perhaps at time doe be not usual way of working man have right to expect in own case though may be allowed to hope for in of wonder very much now a write down how ever came to say to uncle drummond never meant at when began suppose got led on from one thing to when came to think of be very grateful to flora for going away calling angus after uncle said recollecting suddenly how doe anybody know when lord have heard smiled if be lifted out of tank set on dry ground cary do think must have much doubt about must see that uncle take emblem then love people very dearly there be others whom like at can not see love hate have doubt whom love whom dislike said at least not when really love dislike very much there be people whom can not make up mind about like dislike exactly be generally people of whom have not seen much think said uncle drummond else be colourless men woman of whom say that have nothing in must not feel so towards person of decided character one whom knew well uncle think must may rest assured dear that unless be utter stranger will never feel so towards lord when come to know must either love hate can not help almost frightened to hear uncle drummond say that must be such dreadful thing to go wrong on road cary added suddenly very softly must find difficult to love man who be going to die voluntarily instead of see how must help uncle cried then how be asked in same tone that have difficulty in loving man who have died in stead thought minute uncle said doe not seem real other must in other word cary believe believe cried surely uncle believe in lord say creed sunday probably do dear do believe cried again do believe what said uncle drummond why believe that christ came down from heaven be crucified dead buried rose again ascended into heaven of course believe uncle bit of what have to do with dear took place good while ago did not thought again suppose said slowly that christ died to save sinner must be sinner somehow quite see how be to be put together uncle seems like chinese puzzle of have lost piece none of others will fit properly can not explain yet quite know why

signify nothing whether knew where be born if be able to speak latin must signify great deal to whether knew whether believed must carry safe over must take opportunity to drop into water run away must not of course must said whole thing must depend on whether trusted uncle drummond rose laid hand on head not a mr digby used to do a though be condescending to little child a if be blessing in god name then said in low soft solemn tone sound to so very high holy a if angel spoke to cary dear child whole thing depends soul eternity depend on whether trust lord jesus then went out of room left alone a if wanted to think well about before said anything more think something be coming to help uncle drummond be late for supper last night thing must see be very unusual when did come be particularly silent meditative at length when supper be over a turned chair round from table be sitting down again to work uncle drummond who generally go to study after supper sat down among young people said with look on face seemed to be partly grave partly diverted considering that be more travelled person than come to for information have of while in england seen heard anything of one mr george whitefield clergyman of church of england who be commonly reckoned methodist angus made grimace said plenty flora be doubtful thought have heard name said have heard name too uncle know much about only father seemed to think good joke that anybody must fancy wise man angus appears to be best informed of said uncle speak out boy tell know well be queer sort of fellow fancy said angus be one of methodist say folk have have split whitefield have broken with travel about preaching though a do say that reason why took to field preaching be because church must hold enormous congregation gathered to hear have be several time to american colony where say draw larger crowd than john wesley good deal of say ' observed uncle drummond with smile do say ' that bishop clergy be friendly to remarkable preacher not well must rather think not answered angus there be one bishop who have stuck to through thick thin bishop of gloucester who gave order to begin with rest of look askance at over shoulder believe be irregular know to preach in field wholly improper to save anybody soul out of church english folk take horror at anything irregular woman like because make cry so much angus cried flora together be what be told assure young lady returned angus be only repeating what have heard well that may shortly have opportunity of judging said uncle drummond for gentleman have come to

selkirk in afternoon at monk brae can go to monk brae to hear if will of course will not be able to accompany trust to find opportunity when preaches in field if there be one must like to hear great english preacher confess what say will go may be sure sir said angus before must answer trust lassie to gad about if have chance mind take pocket handkerchief have with say 't be dreadful way man gar greet 't be true english be more given way than scot folk say can not help must cry whether will must like to go think uncle said only suppose be real clergyman there go genuine englishwoman said angus if paul be to preach must not go to hear till knew what bishop have ordained yes cary answered uncle drummond smiling be real clergyman more real than think fear oh be different uncle said be sure father must not like to hear preacher who be not at least know did not seem to think mr whitefield right somehow perhaps did not know be proper person proper person sighed angus casting up eye dear said uncle drummond kindly be good lassie to think of father wish never mind angus be only making fun be foolish young fellow yet of course not having spoken with father can not tell so well a what wish be 't be quite possible may think for hear many do that gentleman be schismatic may disapprove of on account only if so can tell for certain 't be mistake a to anything else must judge for do what think right see objection to going father asked flora who have not spoken hitherto not at dear said uncle go by mean if like may never have opportunity 't be very natural must wish thank answered flora then if angus will take will go well know said angus be afraid of handkerchief be at wash must not like to be quite drowned in tear might wash away too must be national calamity jest on

father said angus in low voice will take flora what say cary yes must like to go said wondered directly whether have said right wrong do so want to hear something must help found that monk brae be on monksburn road nearly two mile further on be high road from selkirk to galashiels after leave monksburn pretty well frequented so that angus be deemed guard enough last night whole road be so full of people going to hear mr whitefield that be like walking in crowd way kirk be crammed to very door outside people stood looking in listening through door open window mr lundie minister of monk brae led worship a say here when sermon came looked with curiosity at great preacher who did such unusual thing whom people seemed to think so wrong to like mr whitefield be not anything particular to look at just young man in fair wig with round face rosy cheek have most musical voice know how to put to best advantage word be a distinct a can be voice ring out clear strong like well toned bell have not preached ten minute before forgot voice altogether must think of nothing what be preaching about never heard sermon in life uncle drummond be only one have heard even approach doe not lift up carry away a mr whitefield doe other preacher ever heard except two be always telling to do something come to church say prayer take sacrament particularly do duty now always seems to that there be two grand difficulty in way of doing one duty first be to find out what be one duty of course there be bible if may say with reverence bible have never seemed to have much to do with be about people who lived ever so long ago what did what have to do with cary courtenay what be doing then suppose do know what duty be certainly do in respect be not sure that can express properly feel a if wanted something to come make do be like watch with wheel spring there ready to go want somebody to come wind up know how be to be done mr whitefield made wish oh so much that unknown somebody must come do

licence to live in sin mr whitefield named very thing whereby saw have be brought a charge against showed plainly that did not tend to destroy good work only built up on safer surer foundation work saith not for that must be saved by work out of gratitude that have be saved by christ who command work to such a must follow quoted article of church note saying that desired men to see that be schismatic preaching own fancy that church whereof be minister held same doctrine wonder if mr bagnall know that if ever read article spoke much also of new birth conversion never heard other preacher except uncle mention at know mr digby thought fanatical notion only fit for enthusiast certainly there be text in bible that speak plainly of mr whitefield saith that truly believe in christ unless so believe a to have dwelling in to receive life nourishment from a branch doe from vine saint john say same thing how can be enthusiasm to say what bible say people seem so dreadfully frightened of what call enthusiasm note grandmamma used to say there be nothing more vulgar queer thing be that many of very people will let get a enthusiastic a ever like about game of card one horse coming in before in race about politics poaching thing of sort have to do with world be about thing of real consequence thing have to do with soul next world that must not get enthusiastic may one not have too little enthusiasm wonder a well a too much must not be reasonable to be enthusiastic about thing really signify cool about thing want to write down few sentence mr whitefield said may not forget know how

considerably better than know where to look in bible for husband text dear dear cried lady monksburn in soft voice what must good man be thinking of to bind such burden a upon life thought have converted believe said angus came undone must think remarked mr keith that acted a joshua did with gibeonites how be said angus wo hurt to look for be answer know whether angus looked for did a soon a got in saw that mr keith thought there have be too much hastiness perhaps little worldly mindedness in mr whitefield may be why preaches so earnestly against know so well where slippery place be when have be down ourselves when have be down once be generally very very careful to keep off slide for future mr whitefield said last night that be not true to say a do that man may be in christ to day go to devil to morrow then if anybody be converted how can a angus said come undone only see one explanation be rather terrible one namely that conversion be not real only looked like be afraid that must be truth what pity be that mr whitefield did not find out sooner well helen how did like great english preacher said to flora nurse atweel miss cary discourse be ill for prelatist be answer be a much admiration a must get from helen there be more talk about mr whitefield morning at breakfast can not tell what have come to angus going to hear mr whitefield preach at monk brae seems to have made

calumny against good man may not know do satan very work for angus made grimace behind hand fancy did not mean father to see then went on say ' mr whitefield be so fanatical extravagant in preaching against worldliness that count sinful to smell to rose to eat anything relishing did say so asked uncle did ' say for well sir answered angus with laugh heard mr whitefield have said that must give people leave to smell to rose pink also so long a must avoid appearance of sin quoth if can find diversion must be willing to be found at by lord in coming give free licence to go to welcome ' then

man by mean have courage to own conviction if be right one may so have confirmed if be wrong stand in better case to have put right did not think angus looked quite comfortable hesitated moment then suppose came out with what have meant to say think not sir that be wise to leave unsaid such thing a offend people make turn away from preaching must not be careful to avoid offence unnecessary offence saith uncle offence of cross be precisely that be warned not to avoid not with wisdom of word saith apostle lest cross of christ must be made of none effect ' in eye then be offence of cross ceased ' be sufficient to condemn preaching whereof spoke policy of keeping back truth be devil policy 't be jesuitical will ye speak wickedly for god talk deceitfully for ' will throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee ' never angus never lord seems to have kept thing back from disciple pleaded angus uneasily yes what be not ready for must not yet understand never that offended offended

happened in way must suppose entirely to liking can name one thought must not see anything except when did miracle when spent night in prayer to god give night of prayer said mr raymond think must yield miracle unquestionably must have given pleasure to relieve pain see how much pain to be often mixed in looking up to heaven sighed ' ere did one wept just before performing cried how long will

infirmity bare sickness knew when virtue have gone out of ' may mean only that divine knowledge be conscious of taking passage together be not possible that wonderful work be wrought at personal expense that human body suffered weakness faintness perhaps acute pain a natural consequence of doing will understand merely throw out hint scripture doe not speak decisively where god doe not decide

religious person be one must not have dared to say must like to be so be afraid to go further to reckon one must be to sign name a queen be not sufficiently sure of royal blood to do what have ever said to miss newton that must entertain such idea mr raymond glanced at with brotherly sort of smile wished from heart deserved for be whig be afraid did not then said religious people believe be often very odd thing in eye of irreligious people do count among latter class miss theresa oh make profession said have one life want to enjoy be exactly position said mr raymond smiling now what do

fancy be dear good sophy said kissing suppose if mr liversedge asked to shake hand with chimney sweep just come down chimney must be delighted to do well perhaps might said sophy laughing that cary must have done not for for master found that liked mr liversedge very much a one must wish to like brother in law be to be whole heart seems to be in lord work if perhaps be little sharp abrupt at time think be simply because see everything quickly distinctly speaks a see be afraid must have something of pope about find be not like at let alone for mere difference of opinion though will talk over with readily if see that wish let keen black eye perceive something think sin down come on in very manner of old prophet yet show that have made mistake that action be justified begs forgiveness in moment never saw man who seemed more fitted to deal with broken hearted sinner to be tenderness comfort just take pattern frae maister be whaur be said old elspie mind ye be unco gentle wi ' puir

thae day can not understand hatty a be now for while after affair with crosslands be just like drooping broken down flower pertness even brightness completely gone now be changed have become not pert again hard hard bitter nobody can do anything to suit say thing now then make jump thing mean a if believed nothing cared for nobody when hatty speaks in way often see aunt kezia looking at with strange light in eye seems to be half pain half hopefulness mr liversedge fancy be studying be not sure that know what to make of yesterday evening fanny ambrose came in sat while fanny be ever so much improved have brightened up lost much of languid limp fanciful way used to have instead of writing ode to star seems to take interest in poultry yard dairy aunt kezia say fanny wanted object in life suppose have now when have be there about hour mr liversedge came in doe not visit sophy often fancy be too busy tuesday evening be usually leisure time so far a can be said to have one generally spends here when can ambrose presently fell into discourse upon parish somehow got to talking of what clergyman duty be ambrose thought if baptised married buried people administered sacrament four time year preached month so went to see sick people when sent for have done must be required might quite reasonably spend rest of time in hunting fox latin greek according a liking led think christ spent life so asked mr liversedge in very quiet tone in say sharpest thing reminds so often of colonel keith ambrose looked a if did not know what to say before have found out mr liversedge went on because see left example must follow step mr liversedge thought be orthodox certainly must have thought so a long a quoted scripture said vicar know nobody doe thing said ambrose then be not high time somebody must mr liversedge will never get promotion if be way be going on in world world ' there be only one thought there be two ambrose fidgetted uneasily on chair tell what good sir be on way to preach church empty pew have soul to be saved believe ambrose chuckled over little joke what of soul of absent congregation asked mr liversedge oh will have to get saved elsewhere answered ambrose then if do get saved what reason will have to regret absence suppose mr catterall be that loss theirs why must keep said ambrose at what cost be vicar answer little more music rather le thunder said ambrose laughing give back anthem have idea how many have taken seat at saint because of do know discarded singer be there saint be heartily welcome to everybody have gone there replied mr liversedge if drive away by preaching error will answer to god for soul if men choose to go because find truth unpalatable have responsibility for lord have not given soul be plain if have given to sower of seed by mean let go to a fast a can mr liversedge do believe ambrose drew chair back inch do almost think must be calvinist be not catching assure mr catterall be that depends on what mean certainly go blindly over hedge ditch after opinion of john calvin be not sure that one doe believe that people be be elect non elect if be elect will be saved however live if be not must need be lost however good be excuse speaking so freely be very much obliged to for mr catterall believe anything of sort if be what mean by calvinism abhor a heartily a do why thought calvinist believed that answer most emphatically believe that men be elect that be elected unto sanctification ' man who have not sanctification show plainly unless repent amend that be not one of elect now know man who say rolling white of eye clasping palm together a if be always saying prayer like figure on old fellow tomb in chancel say be elected to salvation from eternity can not possibly be lost be biggest swearer drinker in parish what say to be to believe can manage ca that be exactly thing then must not now do believe mr liversedge have picked up word from fellow god elected men because foreknew that foreknew because have elected ambrose gave little wink at fanny sitting partly behind a if thought that have driven vicar completely into corner when angel gabriel be sent to tell mr catterall will be most happy to let know until then must excuse deciding question on be entirely ignorant ambrose looked rather blank well then mr liversedge a to free will do think that man can be saved if like not let christ answer not man can come to except father hath sent draw ' ah then man have responsibility ambrose gave wink at let christ answer again ye will not come unto that ye might have life ' if have come see might have have how do reconcile two said ambrose knitting brow when lord command to reconcile will show how expect to do either in world to what extent knowledge on such subject may be enlarged in heaven can not venture to say surely must reconcile pardon must act on can act on principle can not reconcile certainly if can put full trust in proposer child doe day will be long while in dark mr catterall if must know why candle burn before light better be content to have light work by there be more sort of light than one said aunt kezia be best light by see clearest be vicar answer what have got to see asked ambrose sin saviour be reply till have looked well at mr catterall be sure that have laid sin upon sacrifice be a well not to look much at anything else think ambrose found that be in corner time just kind of corner that did not care to get in at rate said more sophy wedding took place evening be quietest ever saw let mr liversedge say how everything must be seemed to like a plain simple a possible bridesmaid favour dancing throwing stocking fuss of sort asked if have objection to cake none at said so long a want to eat pray let have sugary cupid on top rubbish of sort so cake be quite plain took care must be particularly good hatty made wreath of spring flower to put round house feel so quiet empty now when be over sophy gone of course be not really gone because vicarage be only across couple of field ten minute will take there at time be not one of longer always feel sad do feel somehow very sorrowful to night more think than have reason can not tell why sometimes sort of tired sad feeling come over one when there seems to be cause for feel a if have not something wanted yet if anybody asked what wanted be not sure must tell rather be afraid must tell want to say so there be something gone out of life wanted more of since came home have have none of next to none little book be not going to tell what be only there be reason for feeling sad must keep to myself never let anybody know suppose other woman have have to do same thing many time of perhaps grow hard cold say bitter thing people dislike avoid not knowing that if lifted up curtain of heart must see grave there in hope be buried long ago well god know best will do best for how can wish for anything more nd when went up to bed last night to surprise hatty came to put arm round there be only two left now cary said know have be very bitter unloving of late mean to try do better dear will love a much a can help have be very unhappy be afraid so be very sorry for answered kissing must not ask anything hatty can ask what like replied think cary that christ be knocking at door did not want to open must not be happy while knew be keeping outside at last be last night in sermon spoke to a be through closed door must not bear longer have to rise open let in before with kept everybody out now feel a if with wanted to take everybody in dear hatty seems so changed so happy be so thankful prospect look very dark ought not to do so for let in before hatty did suppose day will be clearer will have nobody will be satisfied with th thought knew great deal of what be going to happen did not cary courtenay such wise girl be how little did know evening esther langridge came in stayed to supper said ephraim have gone to parsonage on business have promised to call for on way home came rather later than esther expected have only seen twice since returned from london except just meeting at church so forth seemed to be always busy said have have to see mr liversedge have be detained later than thought sat talked to of for while thought mind seemed somewhere else guessed where thought found right whet after time when father have come in ambrose with be talking over fire ephraim left coming across to corner asked first thing if have heard anything from anna have not have line from heard anything of looked disappointed when said so be silent for minute then said cary what do think have be making up mind to do know ephraim said did not see how must have to do with anna for believed have made up mind on subject long ago must be very much surprised if told that mean to take holy order ephraim be very very much surprised how must anna like yes thought must be said be new idea to have to get father consent smooth away two three difficulty before thought well to mention to one vicar will give title be to be ordained cary next trinity sunday why be almost here cried yes be almost here replied with far away look in eye have seen now then then anna have be satisfied for of course be one of difficulty have to be smoothed away will hope to see more of friend now went on with smile know have seemed rather hermit of late while matter have be trembling in balance hope old friend will not be further off because be curate must not like that think need fear said trying to speak lightly how far heart went down future master of fell farm be fixture at brocklebank future parson of parish might be carried hundred mile away from few month might see more just then father set foot on one of great log blazed crackled sending shower of sparkle up chimney ruddy glow over room fire be dying out sparkle be gone already perhaps be a well that just at moment rather startling diversion occurred by entrance of sam with letter gave to flora here ill tidings sir said sam to father miss flora letter be brought by ane horseman be ridden fast far puir beastie ' o'er foam himsel just worn out brings news o ' gran battle betwixt prince yon loon ca ' cumberland ma certie cumberland be mickle beholden to 'em prince army just smashed to bit himsel ' puir fugitive in highland ill luck tak ' though be just becoming to christian man there be time a chiel disna stop to measure word cut off even wi ' scissors be at place ca ' culloden last week gane say there be na mair chance for prince now than for last year christmas to come again father of course be extreme troubled by news went forth into hall to speak with horseman whom sam have served with good supper ambrose followed so did aunt kezia for said men knew nought about airing bed be a like a not bessy must take blanket from wrong chest if be not after hatty be not in room flora have carried off letter be from uncle drummond so ephraim be left alone for somewhat to surprise made motion to follow rest cary said in low tone a took next chair have have news also be bad news in moment knew that tone said so looked up fearfully felt before heard terrible word be coming duncan keith rest with god oh be wonder if let work drop hid face in hand wept a if heart be breaking not for colonel keith must never see evil more for anna for flora for stricken friend at monksburn for uncle drummond who loved like son yes let confess for cary courtenay who have just then so much to mourn over must not mourn for except with outside pretence of something else did care so much for cary what meant intense pain in ephraim voice did fancy what did matter to if did tried to wipe away tear speak did care so little said a well a must utter think of anna parent ephraim led to death nay not so answered must not look at in light cary did duty be never well to measure duty by consequence yes of course think of parent sister poor soul will be hard for to bear yet almost think must change with rather than with angus when come to know cary somebody must write to miss keith ought to be either miss drummond felt puzzled must not break best to if be settled betwixt looked a if be be not proper person to write have not written to said why answered scarce like to intrude on have not seen much of know besides think woman must know far better how to break such news men be apt to touch wound roughly even when wish to act a gently a possible cary be unwilling to place such burden on think must be one of must speak of anna thus if felt bewildered unless said thoughtfully looking out of window where moon be riding like queen through somewhat troubled sky unless think for a girl can judge better than raymond must be best breaker perhaps know that raymond be not at home lady inverness writ news to said have not spoken either to mr raymond miss keith plainly shrank from doing perhaps must help to bear best how must be best said mr raymond might why cary be possible know that raymond miss keith be troth plight troth plight mr raymond anna started up in astonishment here be turning upside down of notion so be news to said ephraim evidently surprised why thought have known long ago of course must have puzzled see now never heard word about said feeling a though must be dreaming must awake by by always thought always thought what thought cared for anna forced lip to say thought cared for miss keith ephraim tone be stronger negative than word must have be yes cared for a friend a woman in trouble woman of fine character if fancied wished to make wife be never more mistaken cary fixed on somebody else for that long while ago before ever saw miss keith may tell name then be right at first be fanny said yes a well a must cary never loved never will love one can not tell little book what said exactly what happened after that only know that moaning wind outside chanted triumphal march dying ember on hearthstone sprang up into brilliant illumination did not care straw for battle ever be fought envied anna keith anybody else well hatty did not think be going to be old maid of family said aunt kezia did not once be be answer in low tone not sad one perhaps be best one for aunt at rate father will always have one girl to care for did not see flora till next morning knew that uncle drummond letter must be that in answered news of angus escape did not wonder if unnerved let read afterwards laird lady monksburn have plainly given up son for ever when heard what have done knowing what knew felt be best so have to tell flora news to see light die suddenly out of dear brown velvet eye will ever come back again wondered watching by light of own new born happiness whether duncan keith be a little to a have supposed knew somewhat later that have misunderstood that have misinterpreted one wish seemed to be to get back home father said must take a far a border if uncle drummond must come for to place chosen when parting came a took last kiss told prayed god bless that day might be a happy a be there be moment flash in brown eye take that wish back cary said quietly happy a be woman whom duncan keith loved can never be until meet again at gate of pearl may be long while dear will be just so long a lord hath need of answered hope for sake will be a long a father need then oh will be blithe day when call come to go home fell farm september th five

spoke to said lass be only in cradle yesterday soon came round be a quiet wedding a sophy be sure liked better other people might think be to live at fell farm during year of ephraim curacy then father think can easily get living through interest of friend where will be of course can not guess flora have writ thrice since returned home say uncle drummond be very thankful to have back again can see lady monksburn be greatly changed laird have so failed that scarce seems same man of said nothing one sentence waiting dear cary always waiting from angus hear word mr raymond anna be to be married when year of mourning be out can not imagine how will get along whig clergyman tory presbyterian however be affair be rather thankful 't be not mine aunt dorothea have writ one letter very kind to be writ on news of marriage very stiff toward aunt kezia see can not forgive easily think grandmamma ever will grandmamma sent large chest from london full of handsome present fine set of

blue quilted satin two calico gown from india beautiful worked scarf from same country six pair pearl coloured silk stocking new fan painted with flower most charmingly done splendid piece of white gold brocade superb set of turquoise pearl jewellery can not think when how be to wear seem so unfit for wife of country curate oh wait till be bishop say ephraim laughingly then can make dean lady

northerner have deeper more yearning love for hill dale than have down there be about midway between brocklebank abbotscliff be just where must have chosen to be if must have have choice be not often that god give man desire of heart perhaps to woman give even le often how thankful ought to be aunt kezia be so good a to come with to help to settle down must not have got thing straight in twice time if have not be here sophy spent day with father while aunt kezia be here just went back to vicarage for night father be very much delighted with sophy child call bouncing boy credit to family

to think made mistake do mean about chinese screen aunt said gold lacquer must have gone very well with damask chinese screen saith aunt with hearty laugh why be girl thinking about child mean about prince aunt kezia cried never mean to say did wrong in fighting for king wrong child for meant to do right gather from scripture that lord take deal more account of what man mean than of what doe thank god be so for if man mean to come to christ doe come matter how ay if man mean to reject christ doe that too however fair orthodox may look in eye of world therefore a to matter be in doubt can not be plainly judged by scripture christian men may do lawfully differ about if man honestly meant to do god will so far a knew believe will be judged a if have not cared to do what intend to say be that be plain to now that lord hath repealed decree whereby gave england to house of stuart there be right against cary doeth a will with kingdom of world maybe be not so plain to if so try to see through eye follow own conscience until lord teach if father have be truer men have passed bill of exclusion in trouble of must never have come of ate sour grape set teeth on edge ay own too poor soul be bishop lord halifax did bishop paid wyte a sam say must have be bitter pill to seven in tower to think that might have be prevented by lawful constitutional mean that order mean have just pulled
