bold brassy like for to be talking ' thatn to like of a knowed so much more than somehow never seemed to come natural till last night then come at once out of what miss lucy said about parson sermon celia remained silent for minute mention of dr braithwaite sermon have opened up vein of thought wondered if anywhere there be men who preached sermon of different kind from such a even old cicely might understand from must derive benefit be there preacher who instead of enlarging on angelical doctor be satisfied to keep to jesus christ crucified wild desire sprang up in heart to go to london hear great men who preached before queen did not mention to cicely celia full well that must appear to not only preposterous absolutely perilous harry be only member of family who have ever visited metropolis by virtue of majesty commission squire considered hot bed of evil physical moral political have walked down strand must honestly have suspected man met to be jesuit in disguise at least jacobite thought scarcely better believed that air of capital be close pestilential that honesty morality be banished from border that men in with exception of duke of marlborough whig minister be arrant rogue woman excluding queen duchess of marlborough be heartless unprincipled there be ground for belief sometimes excepted wrong person fact feeling floated through celia mind felt that to bring wish to light must probably hinder accomplishment sat silent thoughtful cicely asked at length rather abruptly do not find part of bible very hard to understand vast sight dear said cicely vast sight sure there be deal be main hard to poor old ignorant body such a then what do do cicely when come to piece that can not understand leave alone dear there be somewhat about middle of book ca say word right never have 'em pat about road being made so straight smooth like that very fool ca shape to lose way well think book bit like for be fool mr celia wo go to deny surely god will show want be meant for think so what ca understand think be for like of leave to be meant for now about jew on way to promised land forty year spent in wilderness can not see what have to do with eh mr celia dear go to say that urged old cicely earnestly be hard hearted stiff necked folk be hard hearteder stiff neckeder be not very gloomy cicely to be always thinking of death judgment such horrid thing said celia with little shudder never think about dear be old cicely short answer why cicely thought religious people be always thinking about know nought about religious people a call said cicely never came across one know be never think not while about death judgment such like see have got to die just now when have will be hard pull dare say there be dying grace there be living grace give dying grace at least so think till come to dying so leave that alone know when be to die will be sure to see to have grace to die with a to judgment dear have more to do with than other sight le seems to for have got to die if understand book right trust in have judgment for to stand if have taken sin away what be to be judged for see mr celia eh 't be not need think over judgment poor soul have to stand who will not take christ have nought of own celia sat silently gazing out of window on fair sward tree of ashcliffe park have not found answer when lucy burst in with previous ceremony with exclamation what be doing here celia did hear bell for sermon oh wish be over perhaps lucy be not only person who wished sunday evening sermon at ashcliffe be rather fearful institution to more mature sedate person than first one of squire son harry when be at home charley if not read psalm lesson for day be necessary that must be read very loud be disagreeable when contained number of hebrew name charley at least have idea how to pronounce be consequently reduced to make hit at passed muster in very flagrant case a fortunately for father be little wiser than ordeal over sermon be read by squire commonly lasted about hour half be never very entertaining being most frequently discourse on moral virtue in tone heathenish in style dreary beyond measure after sermon whole family repeated lord prayer other prayer squire being layman must have thought semi sacrilege to read then remaining in place charley lucy be called up to repeat catechism answering alternately standing in a stiff position a possible when be over have to repeat text of dr braithwaite sermon that one who remembered best be rewarded with silver groat be last act of drama young lady gentleman being then pounced upon by cicely ordered off to bed after saying good night round squire finished day with bowl of punch game of card backgammon in never occurred to to see incongruity with previous occupation later came supper after lady retired leaving squire to finish punch alone whole household be in bed by ten at latest sermon evening be discourse upon covetousness vice to none of hearer be addicted after listening to learned prologue concerning common derivation of misery miser with number of quotation instance to show be thought began to wander roamed off once more to conversation with old cicely gazette sir said harry coming into room in boot spur one morning about three month after sunday in question great tumult in london regarding one dr sacheverell who hath preached jacobite sermon much inflamed populace 't be said queen will not consent to being deprived likewise hang jacobite cried squire likewise pursued son 't be said pretender will take journey to rome to speak with pope hang pretender twice over pope three time thundered father hardly necessary sir though might find agreeable observed harry in courtly way moreover 't be thought be gathering army wherewith mean to come against coast if evil must chance to majesty let come growled squire will send packing in time anything else see nothing of import replied harry handing newspaper to who be dr sacheverell harry asked celia from window where sat with work there be little regarding be answer be of derbyshire family be sometime tutor at oxford 't be on th of november gunpowder plot day last that preached before corporation of london saith one of newspaper brought news letter a well a gazette speaking upon 'perils among false brother chose for discourse denounced bishop lord treasurer spake of lord who aided in revolution a men have done unpardonable sin where be that in gazette asked squire turning little sheet of paper about looking down column to catch name of obnoxious preacher not in gazette what said last sir answered harry 't be in sermon whereof brought copy thinking that might wish to see bookseller of whom have told that prodigious number have be sold methinks said thirty thousand thirty thousand sermon exclaimed lucy under breath leather prunella observed squire from behind gazette maybe so sir responded harry very civilly yet sermon sold by thousand one must think must be worth reading hold tongue lad men buy what be worth reading by cart load growled squire 't be only trash be disposed of in way very likely sir responded harry a before yet give leave to ask how many prayer book have be printed in england since reign of queen elizabeth squire only grunted being deep in gazette harry turned attention elsewhere must like to have heard dr sacheverell said celia timidly nonsense celia answered isabella from embroidery frame want to hear man preach treason be not thinking of treason sighed celia celia why do want to hear dr sacheverell asked charley a sat on step of dais elevated window above rest of chamber celia hesitated colored went on with work without answering charley be alone in room if wanted to hear what have to say about what call treason need to be afraid of telling said charley know whether will not take up with treason o charley exclaimed celia talk in way think how angry father must be if heard o celestina exclaimed charley in turn be pet

thing tidy going to church being scolded be tired of everything said charley suddenly lumping together remainder of heterogeneous catalogue charley said celia slowly wonderingly be be half determined to go off have more of father may say what like about treason hang pretender a often a plea say 't be grand thing to think of king son whom have kicked out living on charity in foreign land trying with such wonderful patience to recover throne of father must like to be with bivouac be that what harry call bivouac in forest march on day after day always seeing something new then at last have battle must be glorious for to fight with harry one of kill other think must did say anything about fighting with harry resumed charley little sulkily must not like a to anything else just tell celia

liberty eat up heresy great grandson may see scarcely will on doe depend gilbert asked stevens who seemed at once curious to draw out companion idea reluctant to present own on man who hold helm when

political passion father cuthbert then will be triumph of catholic church if only knew how to use interval to be patient never to be in hurry to instil gently unperceivedly into men mind idea that be equal have equal right be equally right to work very slowly very surely need one thing more be man at helm let choose man must be plausible able to talk well to talk in circle come to conclusion to
