few deserved so well a robert copley bishop of lincoln whom according to fashion of day people called grosteste great head for surname be then only just beginning to grow very few people have mean very few have received from father have therefore to bear name given to sometimes man be named from father be robert john son john wil son sometimes be from trade be robert smith john carter sometimes be from place where lived be robert at mill john by brook sometimes be from something about a concerned person way be robert red nose john white hood william turn again be way in surname have grown

known down to present day have said that be peculiar man be much more peculiar at time when lived than must have be if have lived now saint peter told bishop that be not to be lord over god heritage to be ensamples to flock when bishop grosteste lived most bishop be very great lord very poor example bishop clergyman too be fond of going about in gay clothes of colour playing at game even drinking at ale house many of be positively not respectable men bishop grosteste chaplain be dressed in plain black be of few who walk not according to course of world to like be of moment ought be of great importance what other people must say what other people might be going to do be matter of consequence whatever such men be scarce in follow leader world if be so fortunate a to be related to one of take care make much of for may go long way before see with most people like come up at top what will people say come next often pretty near what doe god tell to do be long way off sometimes so far off that never come to at bishop grosteste lived in one of darkest day of christianity thick dense ignorance of kind overwhelmed mass of people book be worth weight in gold there be so few of still worse very few must read when know that there be law by man who have be sentenced to death must claim pardon if be able to read one verse of psalm give idea how very little people can have known what precious thing learning be held to be even clergy be not much wiser than rest be generally best educated of most of must just get through service not so much by reading a by knowing what have to say often made very queer blunder between word be nearly alike few here there be really learned men bishop grosteste be one of have learned that europe must furnish knew so much that poor ignorant people about fancied must have obtained knowledge by magic far better than bishop grosteste be taught of god soul be like plant grew up towards light jesus christ be sun in day of full brilliant gospel light can hardly imagine state of affair then perhaps one fact will help to do a well a many in house there be image set up before prayer be said sometimes be crucifix sometimes image of virgin mary sometimes of other saint for saint male female be great crowd crucifix virgin mary be generally preferred why because poor worshipper fancied that crucifix have more power than image of saint that virgin be able to look after own candle torch in later time candle be always burning in front of image of course if image must keep alight be much le trouble to worshipper have no common sense in day well really look sometimes a if have not when men once turn aside from god word be impossible to say to what folly wickedness will not go entrance of thy word giveth light yea giveth understanding unto simple very few bishop then living must have taken notice of humble foster sister who lived in tiny house worked for living daughter being widow child dependent on be hard work then a now for such people to get along be often really harder for than for very poor guest being now come agnes dished up four hour if can be called dishing up when there be dish lifted great pan off hook where

be dead banished man pope have declared saint king henry made humble offering at shrine be amusing to find that with respect to offering at least majesty instruction be to buy samite of lowest price must be found be of use pursued avice sorrowfully angel have received mandate great feast be held at easter there be twenty beef fifty mutton fifteen hundred pullet six hundred shilling worth of bread beside many other thing ere one month be over feast became fast when saint philip day dawned darling lay in bed with fair eye turned up to heaven hand folded in prayer who may know what said to god yet more what told to have never be taught to pray must not be avice only notion of prayer be repeating form of word keeping time by string of bead will always think that in way beyond comprehension darling must speak to god on evening of invention of cross be may rd spoke to in heaven did lady queen sorrow very much aunt suppose though great lady like must not care a much a poor people wouldst thou child ah mother be mother let be cottager queen sorrowed so sorely that for week afterwards lay ill skill of physician must avail nothing lord king too fell sick of tertian fever held many day

seeing infirmity christ lord did work of salvation for that sings now before father face poor avice must get further who know god be word know that there be one mediator between god man that have offered full perfect sufficient sacrifice for sin of whole world before bertha must reply answer came unexpectedly from dark corner god must be hard to propitiate said young jewess in old time after sacrifice be offered man be cleansed from sin have not to cleanse by own pain be heathen said avice feeling condescension to argue with jew religion be better than yours how be hester rejoinder because have be redeemed by lord who died to save from hell doe not sound like then why have little child to go there did not go there went to purgatory went to pain if understood rightly why did messiah not finish work keep from going to pain altogether can not answer such wicked question said avice church teach that god love purifies servant in purgatory a soon a soul be clean go to heaven god doe better for than be hester quiet answer know what church ' be suppose god love be not for gentile relapsed into silence avice sat span thought of be terribly ignorant avice did honestly desire to know god will such truth a be in hester word troubled a thought other word came to heard year ago from pulpit of lincoln cathedral from long silent lip of holy bishop grosteste whom so deeply revered by leaning on christ bishop have said true christian rise into true life peace joy life in life see light in light be invigorated with warmth grows in strength leaning on beloved soul ascends upwards then for who loved christ leaned on must be with in purgatory then must be pain at avice shrank from alternative that perhaps there be purgatory at be hard to break free from trammel in have be held life bertha did not follow course of aunt thought wondered why said after long silence methinks god be enough for people wherever be hester also have be thinking to a much purpose be written

take in aunt hope have not done wrong hope not indeed replied avice who be not quite easy in own mind wonder why must be so wrong to pity jew be kind to look so different from other command of lord different most truly such cause for wonder be likely to be frequent enough so long a men allowed tradition of men to run alongside of infallible word of god have power to read for real word of lord
