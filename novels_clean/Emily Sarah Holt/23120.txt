regularly to prayer meeting be held sometimes at blue bell sometimes at ursula felstede at thorpe also sometimes at john love on heath often read bible to gave little sermon seemed a kind pleasant a possible when queen mary have be about year on throne must be plainly seen way thing be going be that must try to bring back popish religion brother have cast off sir thomas began to come le often found too far to john love to thorpe whenever meeting be at blue bell be only few hundred yard from vicarage well certainly be odd that sir thomas be always poorly on night still nobody liked to think

like like dutiful little girl be be resolved not to make friend of one whom father disliked for knew that might have good reason must not understand cissy have be taught to be civil to everybody

have ye not come to give thanks to god in own house eight sunday past ye have be regular aforetime since ye be back from bishop court surely be not true do hope trust be not true that ye be slipping

king edward have done away with so that to go to church be not to worship god to worship idol so terrible be persecution mary have allowed to be set up that penalty for refusing to do be to be burnt to death for what called heresy be terrible position for young girl in rose allen stood that night man not only held life in hand also of mother step father if chose to inform against end of might be death by fire for one moment rose be silent during cried silently most earnestly to god for wisdom courage wisdom to keep from saying what might bring into needle danger courage to stand true firm to god truth might be so bold a to pray father said at last to ask at mother cause of such absence from mass wot be young maid under direction of mine elder sir thomas tye smiled to thought rose very cautious prudent girl who did not want to bring into trouble so be daughter said in same gentle way doubtless be by direction of thine elder then wert absent aforetime ere ye be have up to bishop

turned ran up street a fast a dared in comparative darkness street be very rough in day lantern must not light far old mistress silverside lived in tenant lane be further off than mill elizabeth ran across from north hill to boucher street up that towards gate beyond mill stood on bank of colne mr ewring miller be man who kept early hour a elizabeth ran up to gate saw that light be already out in window of mill gate be closed elizabeth rapped sharply on window shutter be opened being dark inside must not see by whom prithee let through gate have message of import for master ewring at mill gate shut said gruff voice of gatekeeper ca let through while morning darnell will let through pleaded elizabeth be servant to master clere clothier of balcon lane be sent with message of grave import to mill tell master clere if want corn ground must send by daylight wooden shutter be flung to elizabeth stood for instant a if dazed ca get to said to herself there be chance way must go to tenant lane turned away from gate went round by wall to top of tenant lane pray god be in time to warn somebody be in danger who be at preaching to night mistress wade most of for be in house will go to king head ere go home thus thinking elizabeth reached mr silverside rapped at door once twice thrice four time not sound came from inside be at last sorrowfully compelled to conclude that nobody be at home down lane went came out into high street at bottom then can only warn mistress wade dare be bound will let others know a soon a morning break do trust will be time enough picked way across high street have just reached opposite side when arm be caught a if in iron vice felt held fast by greater strength than own hussy what goest thou about said stern voice of master nicholas clere chapter fourteen stopped on way nicholas clere be man of one idea at once people of sort do great deal of good when get hold of right idea great deal of harm when wrong idea get hold of once let notion get into head of nicholas reasoning persuasion must drive out made allowance permitted excuse if thing looked wrong then wrong must be be of use to talk to about that must have found elizabeth who have be ordered to come home at eight o'clock running in opposite direction at half past eight be in eye enormity admitted of explanation that have be in mischief be then on way to be only two alternative possible to mind of master circumstance be especially awkward for elizabeth since must not give explanation of proceeding must clear in eye of employer nicholas clere like many other people of prejudiced mind fixed opinion have mind totally unfixed in one matter of religion religion be found to worldly advantage to be during king edward reign be polite fashionable to be protestant now under queen mary only way to make man fortune be to be roman catholic though nicholas did not say even to that be better to have plenty of money than to go to heaven when died yet lived exactly a if thought so during last few year therefore nicholas have gradually be growing more more of papist especially during last few week first left off attending protestant meeting at king head then dropped family prayer papist whether be genuine article only imitation always dislike family prayer say that church be proper place to pray in though lord bidding be when thou prayest enter into thy closet when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father be in secret third step nicholas took be to go to mass command household to follow have elizabeth hitherto quite respectfully declined to do be ready to obey order of earthly master did not interfere with higher duty to god almighty holy word not fancy tradition of men forbade to bow down to graven image to give glory to person thing elizabeth knew that must not attend mass without doing that piece of consecrated bread must be held up must be required to worship a god be not god must neither see hear speak be not even a like god a man be to worship bit of bread because christ likened body to bread must be a silly a to worship stone because bible say that rock be christ be evident that be speaking figuratively just a spoke when said be door of sheep be morning star who in sens must suppose that christ meant to say that be wooden door be important that must have true idea about because there be just now plenty of foolish people who will try to persuade to believe that poor powerless piece of bread be god be insulting lord god almighty to say such thing look at th psalm from fifth verse to eight will see how god describes idol forbids to be worshipped then look at th th verse of th chapter of saint matthew will see that lord jesus distinctly say that be not to believe anybody who tell that be come before see when really doe come nobody will want telling will see for ourselves so find from own word in way that bread wine in sacrament be just bread wine nothing more eat drink in remembrance of just a might keep value mother photograph in remembrance of be sure never must be so silly a to think that photograph be own real self be reason why elizabeth foulkes must not go to mass sunday morning mr clere ordered to go elizabeth quietly respectfully firmly told that must not do so elizabeth have god word to uphold god forbade to worship idol be not simply that did not like that somebody else have told not to do nothing can excuse if break law of country unless law of country have broken god law elizabeth must have done very wrong to disobey mistress except when mistress told to disobey god what god said must be rule not what thought generally speaking mr clere called ugly name then let do a liked up to time master have not interfered with be constantly expecting that must be not afraid of answering for herself be terribly afraid for poor friend to tell that be on way to warn of danger beg to escape must be very mean of preventing escape for what be likely to do be to go at once tell priest in order to win favour for hussy what goest thou about came sternly from nicholas clere a held fast master cry mercy be on way home be turned out of by one prayed to take word of grave import to friend elizabeth thought might safely say so much a believe thee not answered nicholas young maid be idle gadabout if be not looked to sharply thou art better than rest whither wert thou going have told may master pray ask further secret be not mine theirs sent must have received message in day nothing be more usual than for secret message to be sent from one person to be not safe then a be now for people to speak openly freedom always go hand in hand with protestantism if england must ever again become roman catholic country many people be trying hard to make englishman will be no longer free nicholas clere hesitated moment elizabeth defence be not at unlikely to be true have made up mind that be in fault probability must not be allowed to interfere with rubbish said what man having eye in head must trust silly maid with matter of import woman can never keep secret much le young jade like to thee tell more lie prithee began to walk towards balcon lane still firmly holding elizabeth by arm master beseech let go on way pleaded earnestly will tarry up night if be pleasure to make up for one half hour now truly a be honest maid have told truth be about nothing ill tush jade hold thy tongue thou goest with if not peaceably then by force will of grace master let leave message with other to take instead of may have leave to speak one moment with mistress wade of king head must find trusty messenger to go forward tell thy message if be truly of weight then will be sent answered nicholas still coldly le angrily than before must tell message must not go straight to priest hope of escape be thus cut off like nehemiah elizabeth cried for wisdom master cry mercy yet again may not tell message yet thou wouldst fain tell mistress wade thou wicked hussy thou canst be after good what message be thou canst tell mistress wade mayest not tell crede thee not word have forward thy mistress will deal with thee chapter fifteen silence under difficulty elizabeth foulkes be almost in despair master held arm tight be strong man to break away from be simply impossible to persuade to release seemed about a unlikely still cried master let go in tone might have melted softer heart than of nicholas clere step out be said a compelled elizabeth to keep pace with till reached balcon lane mr clere be busy in kitchen stopped short a entered with gridiron in hand have cleaned be about to hang up well be proper time of night to come home mistress marched in too with thy master holding of thee a if constable have thee in custody be pious maid can talk nought bible say prayer once day oftener other folk always do think that sort better than hypocrite what hath be about nicholas what saith pack o lie said nicholas harshly whined out tale of message of dread import that somebody must not be named hath sent on found hasting with speed across high street contrary way from what must have be 'd best give strap wife deserves will ere long nicholas sat down in chimney corner leaving mistress clere to deal with offender elizabeth well knew that strap be figure of speech that mistress clere when angry have light hand girl be beaten cruelly in day grown woman too when mother mistress chose to punish for real supposed offence elizabeth foulkes thought very little of pain might suffer very much of needed warning have not be given then suddenly word flashed across thy will be done on earth a be in heaven then warning be better let alone if be god will rose with calmer face followed mistress clere to next room to receive penalty there said that lady when arm began to ache with beating elizabeth that will do for bit hope perhaps thou'lt not be so headstrong next time vow look a sweet a if 'd given box of sugar plum be feared thou 'd have done with bit more be proper tired now speak truth who sent

like most idle folk amy clere be gifted with full share of curiosity people who do world work who go about doing good be not usually people who want to tell how much miss smith gave for new bonnet whom mr robinson have yesterday to dinner be great deal too busy generally too happy to give least trouble about bonnet to feel slightest interest in dinner party idle people poor pitiable thing who know what to do with be often very ready to discus anything of sort considerately put in way to have something to talk about be surprise delight to sooner have mr clere shut door than amy dropped edifying occupation came up to elizabeth who have sat wearily down on side of bed why be what ail mother what hast thou be doing thou mayest tell will not make mischief 'd love dearly to hear about if

mischief from sheer love of gossip moment met with one who must listen to mistress amy be right weary pray leave be hold thy tongue if thou wilt want nought with thee not replied amy with equal crossness untruth since a must have expressed be dying to know what elizabeth must have done to make mother so angry amy be angry now get thee abed mistress glum face will pay thee out day see if
